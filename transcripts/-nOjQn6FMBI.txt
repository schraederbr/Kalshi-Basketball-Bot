so theyre gonna need a big game for Miles Kelly and we know Miles Kelly is capable of that hes their leading scoring he does it in bunches for those guys been a little streaky at times need to get him going early to get all important home win here for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets we are ready to go Matt Potters got the ball in hand Federico Federico wins the tap against Rodney Howard and away we go Mr Childress lets have a good game here start of the triple header youre on acc Network Pitt you see the record bottom left of your screen 42 in conference off those backtoback losses they had an 11 Point halftime lead on Duke and they battled in that one point loss last weekend against Clemson three doesnt go for Greg Elliott the Marquette transfer and here comes Georgia Tech they get Jalen Moore back the sophomore at six foot seven 14 in white didnt play on Tuesday in that overtime loss to Notre Dame with a thigh contusion but hes back in there for Josh pastner and here he is going to work on Blake Henson drops it back out for Kelly whos matched up with Burton Kelly off the bounce forced into a tough shot hell run down his own Miss and a fresh 20 line drop triple goes for more and welcome back Jalen Moore well check out the pit starting lineup as usual it is a group of men lets be kind saying their experiences Georgia Tech comes out in there start out the first possession of the one three one now theyre falling back in the traditional 23 Zone which is really tough to deal with theres Nelly Cummings Jacks it out to Elliott shot clock winding down Elliott slashing left it short rebound cleared by Georgia Tech and Debo Coleman Coleman pulls up hes trying to get back on track from three he and Miles Kelly were cold in Southwest guys are streaky right now theyre not in the best grooves but again hes got to shoot stay confident eventually theyll go in just taking make good shots Hanson hes been an explosive score as well the fifth year senior 167 a game hes been to I wont even call him to rob in Tibet man hes just been equally as effective theres only a tenth of the point between he and Burton so both of those guys are just scoring at a high level so youre going one a one B with it yeah Im gonna go one e1b I wont even call him Robin hes been that good all year long well get your all ACC first team choices later around here during the game off the turnover from Kelly Henson ahead of the pack and he gets plucked by Jalen Moore and a turtle Ball but great play I hope both of them guys are okay just great chase down block there timed it more goes up oh ball hit the ground pretty hard I hope hes okay cool guys are up running around a little Grimace from Jalen Moore who again did play Tuesday Josh passenger said he was cleared but at that contusion that Josh told us this morning Jalen suffered in the second half of the Florida State game in Tallahassee last Saturday this time of year theres always Nicks and bruises and flu viruses and coals and everything before the route Club this time of year so guys are all here just toughening up no doubt heres Coleman on the drive down the lane met by Federico and Pitt runs again catch Barton at Cummings with him marching through the contact draws the foul and jamarius Burton will go to the lot well theres Josh pastner boy he was still lamenting that close and lost in overtime and uh you mentioned sickness theres Devon Smith he did go through shoot around today Javon Franklin and Kim theyve both been sick the last couple of days but again they did go through shoot around we do expect to see them today I think theyll get on the floor at some point we dont know when but I really think theyre going to miss Jayvon Franklin because his ability in that mid post hes an excellent pastor and he shoots that midrange shot probably a little bit better about how we give them a bigger body more physicality but as far as initiating the offensive classes I think theyll need to get Jameson Franklin back out there tonight that small ball guy for Josh pastner theyre just so small when hes on the floor they dont have a lot of Rim protection so when Franklin Rodney Howards out there he gives him just a little bit more size and red protection and youre going to need that against this Dynamic guards that Pittsburgh had they got four guards were coming back to it all the time including Burton whos an excellent free throw shooter and he makes both averaging 165 and four assists a game for the fifth year senior hes just been incredible just under 21 a game in ACC Play Just its nearly nine points more in ACC football than a year ago Nikes abandon pressuring up on Debo Coleman at half court in Georgia Tech starts the offense Midway through the shot clock but Nike Savannah hes not a guy you want to play with the ball in front of him you got to put him when you hit just beat him and go Debo is not accustomed to guys crushing me used to using the size but like its man hes such so athletic so strong so physically gifted excellent threepoint shooter but hes a really good football Defender thousand Nelly Cummings Kelly off the screen from Howard Moore thought about the high low with Howard and now Lance Terry The Gardener Webb transfer shut off by Cummings probing for space Federico got a piece of that and then Howard ripped it away Kelly has to hoist back iron battle on the boards and we get a foul on the rebounding action where his pit panther team is vulnerable its on a glass I mean theyre plus four in a season but in ACC play theyre minus four so be interesting to see the first three that Georgia Tech received was off an offensive rebound so they know they can crash the glass and hurt this pit panther team theyre going to need with that smaller lineup to make sure these guards come back in there and help Federico Federico rebound fun to say that it is a plus 23 rebounding margin for Duke in that win against Pitt on Wednesday an eightpoint victory for the Blue Devils at Cameron quick trigger at the people Coleman was in late last night getting up extra shots and then playing off hes catching it in Rhythm taking shots true or false you know that because you left your backpack I did and he let me back in the building so thats the great thing I walked up on his car waving my hands like can somebody you know anybody and he was deep but I was like oh thank God its Stevo he let me back in the building so Im cheering for Debo tonight to shoot the ball well because he left me back in the building to get my backpack so Blake Henson shooting it well also hes got two threes Pit by two just over four minutes in Federicos done a really good job before some Franklin to catch that ball he wants to catch a lower than he does to get a turnover here Burton the takeaway and roll off the rim and then a foul committed by Pitt after Burton miss the Buddy Applause contest here early Debo Banks down his three and hits it comes back and says anything you can do I can do better got a good ball game here in Midtown running a food pantry can be absolutely I mean we all know John hughleys a heck of a player but hes also a heck of a young man weve had a chance to cover many games and talk to him quite a bit a year ago as hes kind of burst on the scene so lets hope he gets all the support and help that he needs Pat said that hugely will seek a redshirt here and Jeff Capel said were here to support John as he continues to learn to manage challenges in his personal life and added he should be applauded first for seeking out that help to continue to grow as a young man he should be and hopefully just encourages other young men and women to come out and seek help themselves when they feel they need it got another possession here another you know the second second option again a second chance to get to keep attacking the offensive glass here this pit team is really small have made a couple of Threes so far they do have Davon Smith into the game Off the Bench the junior who was so good in that game against Notre Dame with his first career DoubleDouble Terry spinner end of the lane bounces for Smith who connects great side for Georgia Tech early if they can start knocking down shots theyre not a great shooting team outside and Kelly Kellys their best threepoint shooter everyone else is streaky so they can come out tonight and knock down shots again this team is a lot better in the ACC than their Quantified record Josh pastner said to his per game its got to be Coleman and Terry making threes Scotts a good sign that they only have one from those two guys so far now the other guys are knocking down shots they like their chances against anybody because they know theyre going to compete on the defensive end off the Blake Henson miss here is Smith snaking and turning it over trying to kick to the corner for Miles Kelly yeah yeah I dont even know if Franklin could have been in the corner at 6 10 and caught that one that came in with some heat on it glad that hes feeling better though yeah High fastball upstairs yeah theres a chin Checker right there yep some heat on that one so fifth down one just about six minutes in enjoy the Tech Yellow Jackets do a great job at changing defenses and they switch things up keep you off balance from man to one three one to two three Zone Henson short offensive rebound Federico Henson didnt get Howard to bite misses that one and Blake Henson hes already throwing up six shots Coleman drives left hand had it roll off against Federico this is so long difficult to make shots over top of Federico a lot of contact there from Kelly draped around Burton and it belongs to Georgia Tech its a very physical team and Joe detects going to answer the call for spec team to have to dig into bench tonight go maybe a little deeper than theyre accustomed to both teams played with a level of physicality and honestly both teams need this game dancing out its on Nate Santos come in yeah Georgia Tech theyve got that one ECC win thats against Miami here a week and a half ago they felt like they gave one away Josh passley told us today we blew it against Notre Dame you cant lose games you can be beaten but you cant lose games and they feel as though theyve lost that game and thats a tough feeling tough Hill to swallow sip that pass now Smith cant hit his second Santos clears it Applause so when you beat a good team like Miami you just feel like you know you how good you can be Burton with a good take against Howard hes just so physical getting to the end of the lane really difficult to keep him out the paint Kelly gives it up for Debo Coleman Coleman gets to the mid post Coleman threw some contact gets the roll its great finish with the left hand there by Debo see that late game work is paying off man hes coming in ready knocking down threes shooting finishing with the left today at shooter out he was getting up a lot of shots he was trying to chat with him I said man yeah he was down in he was a little chattier yesterday today was game day and you know you want to see him play well when youre the guy was putting that kind of extra work you want to see him rewarded and so far Debo knocks it down big time three for Nike Savannah to start his scoring boy he has changed games on both ends of the floor thats what Jason Capel told us pregame well hes healthy now it takes a little time hes had an ACL surgery this last season hurt his knee early and you know you get over a year year and a half away from it you just feel that one more that much more comfortable when we see Nike doing as well Santos away from the ball sends us to a timeout as Nike sabandi drills one from Deep for Pitt on the road against Georgia Tech Music theres always a fresh deal on the subway app like this one this thing with his Georgia Tech backward its just been consistency thats what youre looking for out of the group both Smith and Kyle Sturdivant are into the game third of them Keys it into Kelly Sturtevant had 18 points and he did all of that scoring after halftime for the jackets and their bid against the Fighting Irish shot clocks at 10 Jalen Moore with it at the elbow on a handoff for Smith backs up on Diaz Graham and knocks down another jump shot great step back move there just patience getting to his spot stayed in rhythm Santos sabandi and Guillermo Diaz Graham three Subs in right now for Pitt Off the Bench along with Elliot Burton Georgia Tech disguise in the defenses early they were in zone now theyre switching with mantoman and theyre switching everything and just throwing the pit off he just has a rebound for Diaz Graham Elliott spinning on Sturdivant for a tough two just keep coming at you in waves its not Elliott its Cummings if its not Cummings this you know somebody its always one of these Dynamic guards its just nonstop with these guys you love their backboard oh just I love the depth of it we have so many quality guys reverse not there for Kelly tipped around it does stay with Georgia Tech just a great move there drives and Spins off away from contact no one at The Rim I expect him to do that more theres no shot blockers on the Georgia Tech Team attack the rim get it on the glass the issue theyre having on this sentence theyre not finishing possession rebounding so you get punished with the penetration of smaller guards but you can hurt them rebounding on this end of the floor here Smith too strong yeah Jayvon Franklin at six foot seven hes into the game by the way for the first time coming out of that media timeout hes their tallest guy with Howard on the bench he loves contact so hes physically putting his body on guys and hes so physically strong and gifted hes drawing contact you put your hands down you just gotta wall up and just dont reach get you caught reaching in there and hell make a living at the free throw line if you do that told you he is a great free throw shooter guy who we know had 31 in that win over Carolina and now for two separate opposing head coaches Hubert Davis and Brad Brownell jamarius Burton has left both of them saying we couldnt guard him but we had no one on our team who could stay in front of jamarius Martin hes too physical for your average guard and if you put you have to put size on not everybody has a six eight six nine guy hes just you know anyone to tell you when youre guarding against guys that have size and physicality with the skill set that he has its just a difficult task and confidence in the system with Jeff cable puts him in and allows him the freedom in his offense hes a handful hes going to be counted on even more because Nelly Cummings has been on the bench with his two fouls here in this first half as pit leads by four Midway through the first half but the good thing about this group again as we said theyre not dependent upon one guy Debo knocks down his second threepointer in the corner Music four made threes for the jackets great penetration great fine Tebow doing a great job getting this corner getting his feet set Elliott too strong off the back iron and a long rebound to Terry start of it step back from pal Sturtevant theyre sturdivin witting his bag on that one coming out early here getting the hometown crowd in the game hey now hey you got to get your seatbelt on get ready for that one and thats how he was down the stretch we told you once he got into that game yeah he has that in his game and again Applause they can use quality scoring from the bench and hes definitely capable of doing that shot clock below 10 Josh pastners fired up barking at his defense so Bandy goes off the bounce to the red strong take on Franklin great job what happens is you know hes a great threepoint shoot and he just freezes him at a threepoint line just gets downhill they shoot the ball so well outside of Notre Dame they shoot the ball so well so youre hugging up in your man nobody there to protect them at The Rim Guillermo Diaz Graham hey just dancing here step back clearing space get into a spot he knows thats nice he knows hes gonna have his friends talking about that one he didnt get into the game until there were three seconds left in the first half against Notre Dame he had been quiet the previous couple of games before that he took a shot to the head and then 11 in the second half and seven points in overtime Terry cant hit Franklin battles for it but its secured by Nelly Cummings into the game with two fouls lets see what Pitt does on the half court execution right now I think theyre shooting the ball really quickly again yeah I mean theyre just taking quick shots and theyre not setting defensive transition into set great chase down block there Applause how about it tracking back on Franklin and then Elliott draws a foul on the drive its going to get that thing get it out of here great clean block see some great defense some athletic chase down blocks down by both teams Santos is one of those guys coming in if he wants to make an impact its not necessarily in the offensive and its on a defensive end and hes showing you there Jeff Gable liked some of the minutes that he got from the sophomore Nate Santos out of Geneva Illinois at Duke on Wednesday he had a couple of nice drives and got some opportunities for the Panthers Elliot to the left hey every Thursday night womens basketball takes over here on the ACC Network next week its Diamond Johnson and number 11 NC State hosting Miami at six Eastern and the Ravelry matchup number 162 off to a great start to the season these first few months against number 22 North Carolina theyre on acc Network and the ESPN app Elliott has been lights out as a freethrow shooter this season puts Pitt up by three as they extend some pressure I think Jeff has realized that Georgia Techs kind of disrupted their Rhythm and changing their defenses and he wants to do a little bit of same and this team has struggled to shoot so they banked some threes early here lets see if that keeps going pretty good look for Sturdivant Cummings pushes and now Savannah draws a foul off the Baseline on Debo Coleman so thats Colemans second yeah thats the thing they just keep coming at you in a way they can they can knock down threes you got to get up and close out then they start putting pressure on you off the dribble in their spacing and it just creates trouble you mentioned the challenge in going up against Georgia Tech jackets fans have heard this throughout the seven year tenure of Josh passner but its shapeshifting defense and its tough to ID what theyre gonna do so Andy was wide open yeah that was a defensive mistake there A lot of times what happens is as a player youre thinking you got to identify because they figure in one three one we attacked that different then theyre running two three Zone we attacked that difference then then which set and how and who do we want to attack in that and when theyre constantly changing at every possession it just makes it difficult sturdivin another good look and then Smith came up just short on a follow bid springing off the deck thats the Mike Monaco hops coming in yes please spread that word if only he is bouncy Davon Smith Cummings off the steps cant head over Howard and look at Smith soar again to bring down a rebound to Howard hes showing you his athletic ability start of it boy hes had three good looks in a row tipped out by Howard Coleman loads and hits thats the second three off the tip Franklin Howard is just really being active he didnt possess the ball but he tipped it out Another Second Chance point that ends up being the three for Georgia Tech and I know theyve knocked down twice so far in this game theyre gonna need to punish this pit team if theyre vulnerable in any way theyre vulnerable on the backboard so far Georgia Techs been hurting him and getting their hands on loose ball winning the 5050 ball Elliott straight on no at Georgia Tech plus five rebounding they have six offensive rebounds already and now Howard scores from the Block and the pit lead is down to one great job running the floor get deep position going to his Lefty hook they dont run a lot of plays for power but again they reward the big man for running the floor only played 13 minutes and scored just two points Tuesday in South Bend Indiana Applause well short from deep and you mentioned maybe some quick triggers from pitt offensively Savannah misses that one this start to set up with some jump shots now just a great step up three by Debo in one of many for the young man having him extra work pays off got a great game here in Midtown fellas Gatorade fit oh Ive only here thats a great sign for those guys moving forward and again I think this team is a lot better than their one in five records in conference play now Coleman over six from three Tuesday his last six games coming into today six for 28 from three now remember he did hit 41 last year to do Kelly no Federico the rebound hes had shared some responsibility as well hes running a little bit more point guard for this team initiated offense for him and I think thats taken away from his ability to shoot and play off the ball some this year top 50 recruiting the country stick with Burton kicks it to sebandi sabandi gives it up Elliott now Burton matched up with Sturdivant demarius its just so physical you gotta front him as a guard when everything breaks down with his team theyre gonna put a guard on you got to get a bigger body on him if you put a regular guard size guard thats not six four six five and even at that size they just got to be physically being able to match his physicality third of it out for Kelly and he hits that is a sixth three for Georgia Tech Grace off and Joe to take as Miles Kelly gets going I mean he is a 40 threepoint shoot and you dont want to make a mistake Burton reached that time left him open great job moving by Miles Kelly finding an open spot knocking down the three first points for their top scorer who had missed his first five shots Federico couldnt handle the sabandi pass and its piterno a great job you see Bert JB Burton misses there on the swiping Kelly makes him pay the Georgia Tech team that for the season 33 percent now from three theyve only made double digit threes in a game one time this year theyre streaking today is one of those games this is why bro wins are so hard to come by you know this this group is feeding off this crowd Smith was shut off Kelly helps him out I think Smith got away with a traveler there I think he slid his pivot for a little bit Kelly has it go off his foot into the arms of sabandi who pushes Nikes sabandi in the open floor gets the roll Nike Savannahs got a chance at three just a turn over here on the defensive end turns defense in the offense when youre not making shots thats what you need to do create turnovers and score off those turnovers just coming down gets to a strong hand takes the contact and finish great job on both ends of the floor there by Nike Savannah and he was the guy in that Carolina win Jeff Campbell said that to really flipped the game for them and he was really good against Virginia as well and then Wednesday against Duke so Bandy had 11 as well hes already at his season average coming off the bench I mean hes giving these guys you know almost double digit points coming off the bench hes just under that and hes already got that now in the first half with four minutes to go so thats what I said they come at you and wave they got so many guys they dont need all four when all four is playing well look out just there you know they just need a couple of guys to play you got to hurt this team on the offensive glass Music Smith turns the corner and lays it in seven for Davon Smith I talked about it I think its this is a difficult team to guard when youre chasing a mantoman with all their stuff Pastor just does a great job of running sets and drawing up plays to get his team a bucket you got to come give help on this Henson missed it rebound Smith but he gave up a little prematurely they could have held in a little bit longer saw Henson coming down and just still a great look Sturdivant back out to the corner for Tristan Maxwell who gets involved with a seventh jackets three its raining threes here in Atlanta now Trista can shoot it no if he shoots it as well as his dad Vernon Maxwell but he shoots him pretty good thats a pretty high bar yeah thats thats the high standard Im gonna lean on dad give it to dad for right now but Tristan definitely can shoot it Savannah its feeling it third three has him up to 14 Applause the Nets are on fire here right now both teams are shooting the ball from Deep will turn into who gets a stop right now Howard gives it off to Davon Smith off the crossover so Bandy stuck right with him and nearly forced the turnover Sturtevant gives it up Burton recovers Smith cant hit off balance and its last Touch by Elliott they say off Howard and it belongs to Pitt on the other side with the Panthers up one on the road here in Atlanta theyre two games clear of everyone in this conference so and then if you duke you cant fall that far behind yourself so its just a lot of great basketball left to be played as Georgia Tech falls back now theyre in their 131 giving wrecking coach Cape was mantoman played it he just drew up in the timeout gotta be ready for that against the shots faster Burton drives to the cup for two jamarius Burtons up to 10 he and subandy have combined for 24 and traveling called on Jalen Moore so a costly Georgia Tech turnover Burtons getting to his spots and scoring a little bit of too easy to clip right now and just driving the ball getting hes so physical I think hes telling the Reps hey tell him Jamie lucky there like hey man you missed one hes starting to feel it a little bit and watch the ball in his hands a little bit more hes got 10 points two assists all without a turnover hit for 18 minutes they have turned it over one time yeah they dont have to force anything they can put the balls in the hands of their best of their offensive guys and attack their weakest Defender simandi missed it and close and now Smith speeds ahead of the pack pulls up into contact great defense by Burton Howard kept it alive and sturdivin knocks it down thats the third time tonight this afternoon that Franklin has just I mean that how was just got his hands on the ball and just kicked it out to a teammate I mean hes done it they got 12 Second Chance points here in his first half and hes just been all about his impact on this game has been amazing Elliot with a baseline cut missed it Federico follows for two Applause Frederico can do to get himself in this game too with all this penetration from those guards Franklin comes over to help Rodney Howard misses and the rebound to Elliott inside the final minute of this first half with Pitt leading by two coming up we will get you to the studio Kelsey Riggs has a full house for the start of a long day with a halftime report Burton swirls one out Smith his seventh rebound of the half nobody stops the ball Coleman hoist cant hit another Smith another offensive rebound thats eight for the jackets not a ball watching their own pit I dont know if guys are getting fatigued you see JB standing there with his hands on his knees Burton here at the top played a lot of minutes with Cummings in foul trouble Sturdivant off the bounce got a switch from Federico sturdivins Off the Mark Federico the rebound pent leading by two can get the last shot Henson off the bounce with a scoop to the cup great job finished there knowing it timing clock and situation there then went straight up the floor scored and then straight into the locker room Pitts got the fourpoint lead on Georgia Tech we go to the studio with Luke Joel and booze heres Kelsey Riggs got the crew got to go up and right now both teams are shooting the ball at a high level theyre not turning it over weve got a wellplayed game here so far and feels like Joe detects in control but Pitt has the lead see how the things shake out here in a second pit tied for third in the ACC four and two trying to get back on track after those close losses against Clemson and Duke Georgia Tech looking for its second ECC win off the heartbreaker Tuesday off the tech turnover attends it barreling to the cup and boy he is fiery as ever he came out shooting in the quick early shooting it quick and often early and coach cake will set him down on the bench a little bit so he comes out make his play on defensive end had a bucket going in to have him he did and one out of halftime for a guy with about as good a personality as youre gonna find in this conference Blake Henson Amazing Story Coleman hit three of them in the first half comes up empty there and the other ones are coming in the first half he got shots at the flow of the offense that one you can tell a little bit predetermined that he was going to shoot it when he caught it in a groove right now but sometimes when youre in a group just let it come to you theyre going to find you the ball will find you and that time I thought Debo kind of forced that shot shot an air ball but you got to keep shooting and a quick hook for Rodney Howard from Josh passner after Howard had the turnover on the first possession for Georgia Tech out at halftime I was surprised to see him pull him so early because I think Rodney Howard has just done a great job of keeping keeping his hands on balls and hes playing with a level of physicality but Im sure he wont be there too long to pass to Franklin back out Terry swirls it out rebound hits it Bullet Pass theyre a great skip pass weve learned anything this year Watching Miles Kelly you have to be ready when he is firing a onearmed pass Burton could muscle his way up for two and it belongs to Georgia Tech Evos a physical guy and people just bounced off of him I mean Burton is just so strong and powerful she said this in the first half you would put a lot of signs on him would you put like Franklin I put my biggest wing on him and Debos the right guy to guard he has the size of physicality I think thats needed everyone else I just think he can play bully ball against Elliots up oh Kelly driving into Federico and draws a foul that upsets the pick coaching staff I can see why Jeffs a little bit upset with that I thought Kelly was driving in no mans land and Federico Federico did a great job just coming over a little contact there can liberate with us hanging out in the background well we dont need to live here we can just listen to the right now yeah Jeff we hear everything Jeff yellow Val is on the floor it is on the floor Jeff got his wish on that one Colemans got to get it in he does to Jalen Moore you like this vantage point near Georgia Tech your second time here this year blanks get the hangout on the visiting bench you know it well oh good tip on the follow from Jayvon Franklin another offensive rebound there again pick guards got to keep the ball in front because when Federico Federico comes over to help the big men of Georgia Tech gets a free run at The Rim but somebodys got to put a body on the box Mount Federico spinning into Coleman draws a foul and Evo Coleman now is tagged with three fouls Rico comes over no box out there just goes right over top of it and hes he has sides but hes not a physical guy so hes got a box out briefly I activity by Frank theres a quick jump plays a lot bigger than his six seven size but he plays like hes six nine six ten Pastor said if he was that big I dont know if I would have been able to get him here oh Federico Federico at the line it got us thinking of course whos on the allname team and Federico Federico of course is on it who else you got I think the best name in the conference is leaky black I mean you voted for quick post I thought you know we could have maybe changed the name or two put in there but Im all right you know well go with that I think the Armani Mighty might have been a good one I think I like that name you stumped for leaky black I did so no statute of limitations on that its so good as ever leaky black has the best name in the conference kick to the corner and more two strong rebound Elliott pitch content on allow it they want to see Joe to take make those shots again I dont think they trust it go to Tech consistently make those shots like he did in the first half first points for Nelly Cummings who only played Seven Minutes in the first half with his two fouls and now the leads at seven for pick now this is the thing with Joe to take it relies on so much on their execution because they dont have a guy they can just give the ball to to say hey theyre in the middle of a run go get me a bucket it needs to be Miles Kelly oh he hasnt had a touch instead Moore forced into a tough one and now Pitt in total control with the momentum out of halftime Cummings hadnt played must have just so many different ways hes just pitching the taxi hes telling the team move the ball let the match up Let the ball dictates who attacks Cummings hoists and hits five in a row for Nellie Cummins time out Georgia Tech the lead is 10 for the Panthers on the road Music now they have so many different ways to beat you and guy like Cummings can get going and Jeff Campbell was saying it on that possession just just move the basketball yeah just move it and let the ball dictate the matchup they got so many guys that can make plays the ball doesnt need to stick so the defense cant load up the thing I wonder when I look at Pitt is how in the world did they start one in three and then one 10 of their next 11 yeah I mean better late to figure it out theyre just doing a great job look at it theyre just moving their feet keeping the ball in front communicating switching they of course Davon Smith into a very difficult floater and now Burton at the controls dangerous moment right now in the game for uh for Georgia Tech here the lead at 10 as large as it has been Burton short Howard his sixth rebounds birds have set with himself because he had Frank Howard a bit coward on him and just decided to settle for a jump shot they could have drove it Coleman misfires from long range hes already hoisted eight threepoint attempts here three of eight from long range I dont know why I want to call Franklin Howard yeah what are we doing I I dont know Frank Howard thats your thing yeah Rodney Howard Ill show you my notes yeah I can copy well let me look over this its it Optimist and its cleared by Sturtevant Terry slicing and bouncing got it back somehow and hits and secures it and they say he was out of bounds on the Baseline so it does stay with Georgia Tech on the other side we will study our names and numbers when we come back Applause Music what you gonna get when you show up at a josh pastner its so good he never disappoints uh by the way one of his New Years resolutions in 2023 has not slammed the scores table in frustration that will frustrate him yeah today yeah his team has not come out and answered the bill so far in his second half it wasnt for that tip in by Javon Franklin in the early in the half you got to weather this storm here and try to get back in this game dont let it get away from him post entry to Henson and a good block by Rodney Howard helping I think Rodney house had a heck of a game his activity on the defensive end has just been great getting his hands on balls theres another one another rebound for Howard had a stop yeah I I think hes been outstanding so far in this game 47 rebounds for the six foot eleven big from Ypsilanti Michigan sabandi on a strong take he has been excellent 16 for Nike savandy Nike has been a bucket here Kelly drills what hes the guy hes the guy we talked about he can get going he can fill it up in a hurry didnt get a lot of shot attempts early on didnt see the basket early credit to pit defense but again he gets going to take will definitely get right back in this game just the second bucket for Miles Kelly on an average of better than 14 a game Cummings cant respond Burton the offensive rebound sabandi and a rebound to Davon Smith Applause good pass good play and good on selfish basketball and good shot Maxwell faced up on Henson and now Kelly driving on Cummings Federico went straight up defensively and forces the turnover great job hes allowed to go vertical Kelly initiated the contact well call there just great defense yeah Pitts been settling a little bit when the jump shots here last basket was attacking the rim lets see if they get back to attacking the rim here Tristan Maxwell is talking with Blake Henson as they are parking back and forth and one another something wrong with a little trash talking well Burton didnt settle there the lead back in nine for Pitt not at all I dont know if Tristan Maxwell wants to talk trash to hit him I mean hints and hes in my rule on talking trash is you never talk trash to a guy that gets to shoot the ball more than you do Great rule its just the way it is Maxwell took a wild shot Sturdivant kicks for Maxwell talk Maxwell Tokyo talk tricer let him know so you can back there he let them know let him know yeah Hensons not giving it back either Maxwell is still looking at him hey you letting him know get that from his daddy and now chirping at the bench too is Greg Elliott he learned that one from the best its a great driving kick and its great when you can talk trash first and then back it up youre letting the pitmans know and Josh passner didnt like it Josh passer just yanked him after hitting a three hey its a better man than me I love it Hanson comes up short Smith another rebound hes got 10 of them at six foot one Smith off the bounce hangs it hits hes so difficult to handle when he comes at you with a full head of steam his size speed is athleticism getting in there and plays a lot bigger than he is Applause touring for rebounds at one end and a chance at a threepoint play when we come back to Atlanta urgent fansman Davon Smith has played very well and its a guy who was really sick yesterday and didnt practice at all yesterday for Georgia Tech yeah you hadnt done much the last two days Applause just comes out tonight hes just playing so within himself and activity levels off the charts as he nine points and ten rebounds as well on his way to having a doubledouble tonight this afternoon and send hands it off for Nellie Cummings now so Bandy whos been the top scorer for Pitt with 16 Smith trying to stick with him back out Cummings Gotta Get It Up and cummings did not its a shot clock violation forced by Georgia Tech great defense there about Georgia Tech forcing the shot clock violation I thought Hanson had enough time to catch a shoot once he put it down he was just he was up against it wheres your level of confidence for Georgia Tech going to someone for a bucket who are you trying to get the ball to well thats the question that you have with them right now you know Debo shot the ball well but the problem is that its the way that they have to score theres not many guys on that roster I think Smith is maybe Davon Smith might be the best guy to just get the ball to and let him make about play off the bounce thats not the other guys strength its Kelly here ran it right up into Federico who earns possession for him yeah I think thats not Mouser when they need to play the breakdown I think it needs to be Davon Davon needs to be that guy you know at that point youre Randy just pass it out Federico has done a great job just holding his grounds stand vertical Music hes got three blocks he had just come back in for that possession defensively replacing Guillermo Diaz Graham Burton through the contact hes got a chance to step a threepoint play what he did on that drop so great turns the corner but he cuts off the angle to avoid watching here leans inside initiates the contact who Rodney Howard takes the angle away from him so he cant block the shot thats what you want to do to a shot blocker and bird says hey you want to talk I talk with the best of him and he can definitely back it up so what a leader this guy has been for Pitt not just this year but last year as well he has been Jeff just Raves about him Jeff cable Raves about him in the leadership that hes shown in his teeth and with so much is going on about him I mean this team started the year there wasnt a lot this team was picked 14th in the ACC to start the year and there wasnt a lot of expectation and theres no doubt in my mind this team will finish in the top half of the league and its not the top four or five teams very early but right now Joe linardi does have them and rightly so oh deserving says the tournament team good pass from Maxwell underneath to Howard so Josh bassner goes back to Tristan Maxwell trusting him and Maxwells still gonna talk his talk it glance over at the pit bench as we take a quick timeout were back in the 30 to Atlanta Music he wasnt nobody he was going to talk crazy to you you talked to Vernon Maxwell you better been prepared as Joe detect comes out there and then one three one changing defenses again fivepoint margin pent leads Midway through the second half Cummings boy he is so balanced on his midrange jump shots shooting midrange Jumpers in Midtown hes doing it well I mean he looks so comfortable hes getting to his spots hes balanced looks like his his goal is going in every time he leaves his hand seven since halftime in these 10 minutes for Nelly Cummings the Colgate transfer start of it fighting for space on Barton nearly turned it over Howard bails him out Sturdivant from the free throw line cant hit get in trouble when they dont get that ball in the high pose the pinch post and start running their actions theres really only one guy I think its just David Davon Smith is the guy that they can just do something off the bounce I dont know if the other guys are The Playmakers doing it the way Davon Smith is Miles Kellys on the bench right now after he has struggled to find his footing here throughout this game shot clock is winding down its Cummings again Applause courthouse on the Mitch Max theres nothing he could do you can hear the pit bench yelling tell him to swing the ball reverse take advantage of that for the switching that Joe detectors doing and easy drive and finish there at The Rim Maxwell got it to go and the foul tell them talk to him try to talk to him will his team back in this game Mike is going to look at him hes driving hey sometimes its better to be lucky than good looking just throw it up off the glass and one just tell him I called it I tell him I practice that shot I mean come on hey hey I practice that its two in the book its a field goal in the bucket in the book thats the way thats what you tell them Applause Junior cant stamp it plan in only his 19th career game hes got there all sorts of different issues in his three years but hes an excellent shooter you know and I think hes shown that and I think thats one of the reasons why Josh pastners putting them in the game right now he knows his team is shooting the ball well but thats not what they do and theyre going to need him to come in and make shots and make them that much better Burton straight on late shot clock again gets by Smith Goes at Howard and rolled off pitch putting a lot of pressure on the rim and theyve done theyve outscored Georgia Tech in the paint thats what opens up their threepoint shot is attacking the rim Smith trying to create Savannah runs down the rebound Applause Music Federico sets the screen for Cummings hes just trying to set that ball screen and just get the ball moving let the ball move get body booming ball movement whenever you get to go to those guys man good things usually happen but not that time offensive foul forced by Lance Terry Jeff cable and pet on the road they lead by seven against Georgia Tech its boats to go hit on the road you heard the crew at halftime in the studio talking about just how hard it is to win on the road in the ACC its not a cliche youve lived it before no its not everyone in that studio knows how difficult it is only thing Im gonna say about the studio is I gotta tuck the booze man see if hes gotten in better shape I mean he walks up he walked up them stairs man and and into a camera and he was out of breath man so I got to get on him about that I got to check on him see if he got any New Years resolutions right now up to the crows now oh yeah he had to come up top man we interviewed him at halftime and he was gassed I thought he was had to check on him a little bit just picking on your boobs oh hes got a fire back hes got a microphone too Im sure hell come back seven chord margin seven and a half to go second half and this is the dangerous part for Joe to take like theres not one guy that just if youre lost so much on execution like that handoff he wanted to be at the elbow Maxwell really tough shot Smith bats it out and Georgia Tech with fresh 20 Terry on Henson no following his own Miss squirts out toward Burton who got bumped by Coleman Elliott kicks for sebamby dropped it down for Henson who draws a foul on Davon Smith who disagrees Joe to take that position got an active position on the last time got another possession didnt get back didnt match up and they bought Smith had to commit the fouled air they just never matched up defensively Applause great drive by Nike some Andy in finding him excellent creating it puts Hanson at the line 166 a game for the native of Deltona Florida who remember wasnt playing last year stepped away from the team at Iowa State before the season started Blake said he played a lot of pickup at LA Fitness in Florida and to get the competition level up hed be running his mouth to get a little fire in that gym yeah he is coach Cape was found a gym in him I mean hes a tenth of a point from leading his team in strong we talk about JB Burton but theres only a tenth of a point difference between me and Blake Henson Music where does Georgia Tech go to create offense its in the hands of Davon Smith with the shot clock winding down Savannah Smith they forced a turnover Elliott goes diving and weve got a held ball with the arrow pointing to pit great job by Elliott getting on the floor there sitting in gaps great job diving on the floor there Debo gets down dirty with him and ties him up hes used to doing that coming from a market smart no defensive mentality the way they get after it on the defensive end as well so thats nothing new to him here with the ball ahead by eight more than six left second half on the road at Georgia Tech start of our triple header here on acc Network sabandi lost it Federico found it had it pop out on him rebound Terry passionate didnt tell cable not to slap the board against us I know he talked about it but whats going on at the Georgia Tech end of things yeah its absolutely Cape was a little bit upset Coleman couldnt finish that basket there had a great look now Smith with a good look at the charge attack I mean hes a capable guy doing it off the bounce they got it they rely on half court execution and when plays break down hes the one guy I think they can give the ball to to make him a play and at that time he stepped up and knocked down to three a drought without a made bucket for Pitt swelling Henson short Kelly the rebound and Georgia Tech can trim it to one possession Howard is that a good game for the jackets backs it out for Coleman and returns it Applause Coleman kicks Music Smith no rebounds to Mandy Jeff cable does not take a timeout now he does yeah he does they would just remind their staff yeah and they reminded him and it was a big time to take his take a time out there under five to go the lead is five per pit on the road Music introducing the little John then seven oclock Eastern in central New York Notre Dame at Syracuse and this to start it all has been a good one in Atlanta now weve had a good game today hasnt been sloppy both teams have competed played hard ly good basketball game Nike sebandi nearly got the roll deadened off the back iron and then a foul on the rebounding action by Federico Federico its great fox out there about miles Kelly not shooting the ball great but again those are the little things you can do to help your team a lot of time left to put your imprint on this hell get a chance to make a play here down the stretch get his team back in this game good hands by Burton they were looking for the dribble handoff with Kelly Smith trying to navigate the pick and roll instead gives it off for Coleman Coleman drives on Hinson a lot of contact and an offensive foul on Devo Coleman and now hes cool great job by hence is just getting through the dribble handoff get back in front of the ball just moving his feet feels the bump there great job contact Jamie lucky on the call Coleman stays in keep an eye on that 406 Mark he picks up his fourth Ellie Cummings comes back in and replaces Greg Elliott for a pit team searching for some offense well you need uh Nebo to stay out the evening with profile pit you want to put the ball in this guys hands Burton had a great spin nested in close rebound cleared by Howard you can live with that good move just didnt finish it now if you enjoy the tech where do you go here now you want to catch the ball you want to put the ball in Highway 10 here he catches in the good spot Federicos done a great job of Kim coming to the threepoint line making it making it difficult catch did that again there on Smith who turned the corner Federico stood him up savandy pushes on the drive the finish and the foul Applause some banding in this bag with the layup package there okay tell you how difficult a finishing that is man he comes in with the hero step and his best Kyrie Irving impersonation putting Pitt up seven Music higher than this I mean theyre moving the ball theyre attacking mismatches and hes a confident guy with his ability to defend hes gonna be on the floor and hes going to find Opportunities and hes just taking advantage of it its confident he should be again we go back to what assistant coach Jason Capel told this pregame that he has changed games for Pitt yes not just defensively and rebounding him with the energy there but on that side of the floor with his scoring as well well if you think about it what would this team be tonight without him I mean Joe detect has not played poorly hes just been really good like that on the defensive end powered hook no Applause were at the guts of the game right now for Georgia Tech you got to get out of your Zone yeah theyre coming out theyre playing a little bit mantoman and this is where it gets dangerous with pit because they get to pitch pick their match up who they want to attack and who they want to put in a ball screen action with this guard play Applause go back to Cummings shot clock at five Sturdivant is on Cummings off the ball screen Nelly Cummings down the lane off the glass great job there we talked about it all night long with his midrange just got to his spots Kelly no rebound is a foul on Federico Federico battling there with Rodney Howard I think I was playing well tonight again hes been inside hes had a physical presence and we talked about it a bunch tonight and theres a foul here thats just rewarding his efforts going to the glass made in efforts got his hands on a lot of balls you know deflection about those Shooters and grabbing offensive rebounds had scored a lot of points tonight but hes rebounded the ball hes got 10 rebounds and four offensive rebounds and hes got his hands and deflections on more dials in his form ahead of the one and one misses on the first only 56 for his career and how about this Georgia Tech for the game at the freethrow line oh for three yeah its always tough when you missed the front end of them one and one as well it just becomes into possession as you at least when youre not a great freethrow shooter you want to make one its always tough and I think as a guard I try to you want them to get to the free throw line its a great shot great move great boys hes their closer and hes like we said before hes playing like an allacc guy and were seeing nothing different from that tonight boy they have had closing shots from sabandi from Cummings and now from jamarius Burton and the lead is it does it inside the final 90 seconds of this second half Kelly backs it out for Smith off Applause Music Applause pressure here it does have two timeouts they break the pressure into the hands of Burton and Lance Terry commits the foul along the sideline that is the seventh on Georgia Tech so the one and one coming for an excellent freethrow shooter in jamarius park yeah its not the position you want to be in again trying to press them with four guards on the floor they all handle the ball they all initiate offense and thats difficult to do for anyone in that point in the game they get to put their best free throw the ball the best free throw shoot his hands and try to not game it nobody yet but just try to close the game and make free throws its its his election a free throw shooting shooting any 80 80 percentile you just think about the last possession down there you missed the front end of a oneonone and then they come down and theyre making their free throws its just one of those little detailed things that coach cable was talking about that they needed to start showing up if they wanted to get back to winning ACC games and getting their third Road win theres not a lot of teams in the ACC if any with three ACC Road wins Burton makes both lead at 11 with 109 left here in the second half and trying to get another ACC Road win and trying to get to five and two in League Play yeah go to Texas quick theyre not built to play that way but now theyre running out of time and you got to make quick decisions and get it back quick you dont have time to keep running offense Terry smooth shot 52 seconds left down to nine be trying to get a five second count here yeah theyre gonna pull it back out and put it in their ball handles and treat those guys 44 seconds left so lets spin it forward with pet they go to Louisville on Wednesday here on acc Network Louisville fell again today at the hands of North Carolina at the Yum Center and then pit back home next Saturday also on acc Network against Florida State theyre a good team I mean I think theyve shown it I mean you just thought when you looked at how they started a year going one and three you just thought like okay this isnt going to work well but I think again the identity ship at that time you probably probably be thinking hey were going to have John Hughley and how much was he going to play a big part of what they were doing and I think they found their identity and theyre going to be a tough out I mean these guys can score they got multiple Playmakers and not all of them play great tonight but enough to possibly come out of here with a win Coleman hits from long range back down to nine with 36 seconds to go here in regulation its Colemans first Basket in the second half after he had been cooking yeah early on at 11 early in the first half and thats his first basket here in the second half in long two for Debo Coleman again check out the standings big one coming up less than 10 minutes away from Duke at Clemson its a big one what should we expect in that game between the Blue Devils and the Tigers who you see 60 still perfect Hunter Tysons been awesome Hunter Tysons playing like player to your candidate right now PJ Hall we know whats good the front line is so good so so experienced an asset or unit but the difference in this team this year is Chase Hunter is a guy that when the shot clock breaks down they can give him the ball and he can go make a bucket and I dont know if theyve had the combination of all those things together so this is not a fluke I know theres some are going to say hey its the scheduling we talked to Jeff Capel about it yesterday at practice and he said its the best team hes faced that they face so far and you know this is a team that played Virginia and Carolina Anderson State and Duke and he said that he believes Clemson is the best team and I think theyre for real I think they got all the parts you know Brad burnells teams are going to defend theyre tough theyre all those things theyre well coached and theyre going to be a tough out I mean if they win this game today theyre theyre cleared two of everyone else for sure and uh I I think its gonna be tough to catch them I mean theres a lot of basketball left to play by no stretching imagination am I saying theyre done I think Virginias going to have something to say about some other teams but they have the ability to score and now they got a guard that they can put the balls in his hands and I think it makes him a serious contender in this league man he is from Atlanta and Chase Hunter is excellent as well and you said Hunter Tyson I mean hes playing as good as anybody in this league and if you had to vote today maybe he would be accomplished I think he could I think if you would have vote right now today I mean we can talk about all that hes definitely all AC right now again I know its a ton of play but hes been surprised and its been a play of the Year guy I mean you know he and Armando Baker who I was shocked to see play today when he got injured only played one minute last game and then he comes back today and he plays and Hanson gets the rebound after he missed on the front end with 30 seconds left turn on the glass tonight its good for them to kind of sneak in and get dipping off this rebound himself Armando bacon by the way doing Armando bacon things oh its just its a double double I dont even need to know the stats I know he had a doubledouble he did of course he did 16 rebounds of course I dont even count until he gets the 10 like for me its like he got six because I know hes gonna fall for the trip and get 10 rebounds Clockwork and just counting hes a double double just book it a few walks out there now Applause Carolina Victorious today like we said at Louisville leaders 11 for Pitt inside the final 30 seconds again we will get you top of the hour to Little John Coliseum Howard on the hook no hints in the rebound secures it for Pitt and the Panthers they bounce back and they get another ACC Road win they take down Georgia Tech here in Atlanta does a great job pick coming in just doing what theyve been doing all year coach cape has told us there was no Panic this team was cool calm collected they were going to get back to details of doing the little things and just finishing possessions and we saw some at the night they know theyre going to give up some official rebounds theyre not the biggest team in the league they made plays when they counted and the guard played the depth of this guard play is as good as any team in the ACC four more hours of Hoops still to come dude Clemson coming up in five minutes
