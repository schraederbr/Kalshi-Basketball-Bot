shoot around right before they broke he said hey look I dont really care about your production Emmanuel I care about your effort because we need that effort to really trickle down to the rest of our team so both of those guys will come off the bench again today Emanuel okorafor The 69 Freshman playing his third game with the Cardinals and Baba Miller will be playing in his seventh game after sitting out a 16game suspension mandated by the NCAA to start the year missed one game because of tonsillitis but he should have a big impact for the Seminoles who are five and seven in League Play and as you mentioned favored by five in this game on the road and on their first possession a beautiful set to find Jalen Worley for the layout Applause and Mr everything for Louisville L Ellis the 63 senior point guard but hes got to do more than just direct the ship hes got to score hes got to pass and hes got to take care of the basketball yeah I was at 34 35 minutes per night hes expected to do everything for this team but also defensively got caught falling asleep there on the first possession of the ball game on the ball Im just missed Jake trainer throws it down a legacy his father Jason Osborne played a couple of years here at uofl okay McDonalds AllAmerican at the local male High School now look if youre Withers that is something that green does exceptionally well a 40 plus Point percent threepoint shooter on the floor and when you play threepoint Shooters run them off the line always keep your hands up make sure youre trying to deter their Vision you cant let him see the basket cleaning no defense at The Rim as Sydney Curry goes right to it you were talking about trainer before had a big DoubleDouble in their last game but you need a guy like that to be energetic and when hes able to get on the boards I think thats a really big thing for their team Kayla Mills fouled by James and yes Jay the Cardinals are coming off of rare win just through third of the Season Wednesday the beat Georgia Tech 6858 L Ellison company presented Kenny Payne with a game ball afterward because it represented his first ACC victory at his alma mater Im going to say this to people at home it may ruffle some feathers for Louisville fans we just need to stop the conversation about Kenny Payne not being here after one year Im going to set the tone for the broadcast Doug and say that this world that we live in in which you feel like you need results yesterday considering what this program has been through not to throw anybody under the bus but there are a lot of people a lot of kids on this team that Im not sure they felt like there was a real connection before Kenny Payne took over so right now hes trying to do the right thing with his team trying to reestablish the culture and frankly this team is trying to buy in but they need to play with a sense of urgency and Kenny Payne has it it just needs to trickle down to the rest of their team so guys like Ellis are guys that are trying to bring it we understand its not the standard of Excellence that represents Louisville basketball but it takes more than a year to rebuild Rome and thats what you need to we need some patience for a guy like Kenny Payne whos going to bring the right kids in here eventually to get this program back at the top Matthew Cleveland to Worley nice looking three on two break for the Seminoles yeah I agree with you just want to say it Doug I mean it bothers me in todays culture a little bit there is still a lingering iarp Cloud the last five years now you dont have to worry about any sanctions coming but the reality is thats a long time to have that cloud over the program youre bringing a new head coach even though he knows the lay of the land hes one of the great Cardinals as a player and a long time accomplished assistant coach its going to take some time well watch some practice today Doug and you know look Im just gonna we always keep it a buck here when you and I talk to Doug first off when youre going to any practice okay any team thats an elite team theyre guys that are already there in dead sweats okay like they are working out there getting ready you know they saw a couple of guys there today and then after practice whos getting into work after practice I know thats who Kenny Payne is that is who he is thats who his staff is thats who Danny Manning is thats who Nolan Smith is thats who Gaines is who played here at Louisville all these guys take on that kind of weight so its about finding out who on this current team wants to put in the work and effort and consistently maintain that kind of mindset to be the best version they could be and hes finding that out this year and each of those staff members you mentioned Jay oh by the way were all first round draft picks back in their day they know what it takes and trying to impart that onto this group and this mornings was the third Louisville practice Ive attended in person this year and the first two were clearly uninspiring they are making progress this morning was better than it was a month ago and two months ago so it does feel like there is progress being made and by the way that wasnt a shoot around that was a full hour and a half practice thats true thats true getting back to the basics teaching them about back Cuts Flex Cuts some of the basics of the game that this team is still trying to build on our IQ thats what he does Darren Green with another triple he started to emerge for Florida State as one of the leaders taking Baba Miller under his win you know when you think about Florida State basketball you think about depth and you think about the ability to apply pressure well its different for Coach Hamilton and this team is that they dont really have the debt to throw as many bodies at you as they would like and also when you think about style in which they play where youre having six or seven guys are playing 30 minutes plus per night makes it hard to maintain that style of play and that energy and effort off the steal Darren Green now with eight points and the timeout comes from Louisville the turnovers have been a problem for Louisville all year long and you know the preseason polls are always poo poo by the head coaches and heres another example why the ACC has not worked out how most people thought it would be look at a team like Pittsburgh I mean literally they got old so quick with the transfer portal and theyre at the top of the ACC Clemson obviously there with Rob Barnell hes done one heck of a job UVA think Uvas the UVA dropped their game to Virginia Tech they did right before it just did but still older teams are whats ruling called basketball right now the thing about this Louisville team 340th in NCAA as relates to age thats a big thing Hal Ellis the fourth leading scorer in the ACC at 17 per game is yet to score Jalen Withers muscles his way into the paint but thats the second consecutive turnover for Louisville Matt Cleveland Cashes in at the other end Florida state is so active their hands multiple people drawn to the ball of some Louisville penetration and they are getting out and getting going and we talked about that before the game Doug their ability to get points in transition really makes it easier for them scoring the ball sometimes when they get a little bit stagnant in their half court offense Withers shooting confidence is off the charts right now coming off a 19point game against Georgia Tech Wednesday where he was four of six from The Arc Kenny Payne said that shows you what hes capable of but he was more interested in the fact that Jalen also had a seasonhigh 13 rebounds they need that type of energy enthusiasm and effort from everybody on the roster look the reality for Louisville is they have to take care of the basketball we saw that in their last game which is one of the main reasons they got to win 10 turnovers in the first half as opposed to five turnovers in the second and that kind of ball security is what you need is knocks down another one Patience by him offensively he is at about 45 on the year and going up you see the numbers last eight games coming into this one for the 69 Redshirt Junior out of Charlotte green spin steps back Withers sticks with him Withers has that size in that length where green gets by and he can block it at The Rim cam corn has been very good lately for Florida State those are his first two points 610 freshmen from Allen Texas averaging about eight points per game Music spins a round corn missed the shot rebound comes to Chandler Jackson a freshman Wing up Ahead Green thats his first Miss three of the afternoon he leads all scores with eight Applause tough shot James misses the transition three why is that a tough shot well just because he had multiple possessions where the game was moving really fast you would like to see who will try to get something in the half court sometimes you like the pace of the game right you dont want it to be as frenetic he wanted to be a little bit more employees with what you have on the floor with your team in the rotation Cameron Murphy Corin gets that middle name because its his moms maiden name takes it a nine point ball game FSU on top yeah Gotta Move Gotta Move Ellis offensive yep got that hand or forearm or elbow up around the face or neck area of Chandler Jackson cant extend that right arm into the face there offensively you got to keep it tucked inside and he got Jackson with a really good one right to the face I see Ellis turning this corner right here and yeah thats the right hand just extending slopping Jackson right in the face thats a blatant offensive foul you know a lot of times for Florida State the size and length of their Defenders when youre being guarded by guys who are six seven six eight on the perimeter they can play off smaller guards like Ellis and contests his shot late and it makes it a lot more challenging for a guard as dynamic as him because also theres not a lot of room to drive and for him he has to be patient with an offense I know theres a lot of pressure on him obviously with being their teams leading scorer but he has to find little quicker buckets in transition utilize headphakes more yeah thats a blatant offensive foul right there thats tough and you know we had a nice talk last night and again today with Florida State assistant coach RJ barsh he had the Scout for this game and he said for L Ellis he rejects ball screens and drives less so on The Scouting Report they knew where he was going weve seen him drive left repeatedly early on and its just a matter of what the officials on this particular play come up with you know whats interesting Doug coming back and calling several college basketball yeah thank you thank you brother but doing a lot more NBA you see how NBA games discount reports are so detailoriented about the strengths and weaknesses of players and you see defensively teams that literally execute that always sending you or noticing like what your pattern is and for a guy like Ellis right now I I think thats one of the good things youre seeing maturity wise for Florida State recognizing that hey like hero his Tendencies when he does when he drives left he has a tendency to try to go all the way to the rim as opposed to pull up and really stuck in the room understanding that and thats how teams get better right your ability to retain that information and then execute that on the defensive end which I know fans youll hear that but its a lot more challenging to actually execute because so many players are more offensively mindset these days our officials Lee Cassell Tommy Morrissey Jeff Pawn King came up with that it was just a common foul and weve got our two highlight players into the ball game now at the same time Baba Miller the 611 freshman for Florida State and Emmanuel okorafor The 69 Freshman for Louisville s number 34 in white Miller is number 11 in Black and now the 611 freshman trying to keep LLS out of the lane everybodys in those gaps when Ellis has the ball theres nowhere for him to drive tough shot in I was about to say this is why his shooting percentage is not what it probably should be because he has to take so many of those shots up against the shot clock but that time he puts it in and as that goes in Kenny Payne is yelling at everybody this is where you need to be more engaging defensively where is the communication who is talking on the floor foul away from the ball I wouldnt be surprised if its on a manual okorafor indeed it is but those are fouls that the coaching staff can put up with they love his energy and enthusiasm the Cardinals hanging around foreign Music Applause Music what a womens basketball triple header we have for you tomorrow afternoon on ESPN2 and the app Deja Kelly and number 11 North Carolina square off against Haley van lip and Louisville in our first game at noon Eastern then Angel recent undefeated number three LSU taking on a Texas A M team and we capped the afternoon with a Big Ten matchup between Taylor mikesell and number 10 Ohio State and Diamond Miller and number eight Maryland that is tomorrow afternoon right here on ESPN two the womens basketball program here at Louisville as you saw lots of banners up inside the KFC Young Center and you get a chance to check them out tomorrow by the way pulling up here not being here for seven years lets see Florida State knockout three this place Im like is this the Dallas Maverick Stadium I mean this place its incredible the facilities here alone are just off the charts from The Practice Facility to the Yum Center it is absolutely big time here fourth turnover all live ball turnovers and immediately the Knowles and Jalen Worley add to their total its an 11 point game okay so execution out of a timeout leads to a Florida state three and a turnover in a transition bucket for Florida State four turnover six points off those four turnovers so far and Worley picks up his first personal foul for the Seminoles it comes with everybody being tight with the basketball Louisville just a little bit laxed foreign with their defensive effort as it relates to communication on that last play with the house three and then also the dribble with Ellis its good to see nahim McLeod back out there for Florida State the seven foot four inch sophomore who hasnt played the last couple of games being under the weather he is back to feeling good I think the official phrase from the Florida State basketball program was that it was the winter crud going around everybody has a little something sounds like all my kids at home right now good to see big nahim out there also off the bench in the Florida state Tom house who had the threepoint bucket a moment ago second foul on Darren Greene Id like to play right here by Wizards you got a smaller player on you you got the size you got the frame badio body you know so many times bigger players when they see smaller guards on them on the perimeter want to settle for a perimeter shot no keep that elbow in dip that shoulder use that extra body weight and body your way to the bucket whenever I would see a green on me if I were Withers Im putting him in the basket well Withers is six nine green is six five Jalens father Curtis Withers started Charlotte in the early 2000 1750 points I know from your perspective thats not a lot its a lot of points but dont do that to me dont do that to me its a lot of points but you know what doug when he was able to get that ball into the drive it wasnt off a standstill or stagnant offense that ball had moved around you got the defense to rotate multiple times this way guys couldnt be in gaps when Withers was able to take advantage of the height Music Cleveland back into the game with a basketball along with Worley and house on the perimeter a lot of size and length inside for the Seminoles as weve become accustomed to with McLeod at 74 and Miller here at 6 11 great ball movement to find Cleveland for the dunks Applause Kamari lands swing it swing it first shot Withers has missed again he has been on fire lately theres so many times guys just want to put the ball on the ground oh look for the rotation pass way too strong for Miller theres McLeod to clean it up this is the largest lead of the afternoon at 13 thank you its got to work to get open these are the things that we saw in the shoot around where God you just have to work guys have to be active and actually make themselves available for the past and youre seeing here theyre in the zone just miscommunication they raise the back half of the zone and he sneaks in Cleveland from the weak side on the Baseline wide open those are the types of miscommunicational breakdowns that have Kenny Payne it makes you lose your mind Applause Roosevelt wheeler into the game for Louisville should also say that Brandon Huntley Hatfield is getting closer still out with injury but they say that its probably sooner than later that hell be back on the floor for the Cardinals Applause good job by Ella spy and over switching getting Withers back on Cleveland Cleveland Lobster McLeod comes down with it and he was fouled by wheeler Applause all right so I want you to look at this right now look at the difference I wish we could zoom out every Florida State player came and got in a huddle every player in a white jersey was fragmented to me just seeing I hear from the booth that is a team that is not together that is a team that lacks the ability to communicate to each other what the next possession is because everybody has their heads down about that last play where no dont get stuck in the mud focus on whats about to come so we can get ourselves out of the funk and get to the next possession Applause house no long rebound Withers Applause swing it Applause under nine minutes to go in the half Ellis penetrates with a paint touch finds Mike James for the three Cleveland tracks down the rebound Cleveland crosses over Ellis goes into the lane just couldnt finish but you keep seeing things that make you scratch your head jack oh because if Im Ellis right there why am I taking a stab for a steal Im just gonna allow them to go down Applause The Freshman out of Hillcrest prep and Arizona has his first three he had a good game against Georgia Tech last time out he was a top 40 recruit coming out of high school from Indianapolis Indiana heres Bob Miller thought about it from the corner Applause under eight to go McLeod just taller than everybody lays it in what great patience and what a good pass by Worley right there Louisville did a really good job of when he rolled they bumped him from the weak side and they recovered got back to the man but unfortunately due to his size of frame he just throw the ball over the top Ellis threw alive wheeler wasnt looking for it Louisville keeps the ball back to Ellis for three Applause Here Comes Worley cut off by James back out to house Applause Withers with another rebound Florida state has won six straight in this series trying to make it seven in a row here on the road this afternoon wed love to see Louisville run the set I mean the last five or six possessions in the game I understand theyre doing things off triple Drive opportunities but it feels like their offense doesnt really have a lot of rhythm blocking foul Applause and thatll take us to break Applause 3319 Seminoles over the cards Music Arbys new five dollar Loaded Chicken do you think at four and eight theyre gonna do what they did last year and get into the NCAA tournament I think this 83 is a game right now they can get that up the rest of the way to 103s a game the way that offense moves I do think theyre in 1315 wins last year to get the tournament and they replicated lets get back to the turtleneck Dawn and dungeon thank you sir with Jay Williams Im Doug Sherman 3319 and yeah when Virginia Tech got Hunter Couture back they go right back to being as dangerous as anybody in the ACC spread the ball knocked on the three play aggressive defense and Ill be honest when I watch UVA play UVA is a really good team theyre together and theyre they minimize mistakes but Virginia Tech is extremely talented and you theres no team in college basketball that is extremely dominant Houstons a really good basketball team too but theyre beatable as well yeah feels wide open to me this year and it is when we get to the ACC tournament I mean who are you going to make the odds on favorite Ill look at you for that information Applause Louisville playing from behind on its own floor again today looking for its second straight win thats going to be a goal pass no chance of going yeah but McLeod knocked it away anyhow McLeod with that sucks him with that length I mean theres no need to even block that that ball is going to be extremely short hey look you take them as you get him for Louisville but still to me like the execution once again after a timeout just wasnt there for Louisville Music well Leonard Hamilton told us a few weeks ago hes got to get more playing time for Tom house that is coming again today 67 freshman from Dayton Ohio good shooter heres Cleveland good defense by trainer I think he got a piece as Corin was on the end line trying to save it great Deep by trainer just stay down used that long wingspan he once again due to his sides over Cleveland he can contest shots late which means he can wait for Cleveland to leave his feet and then use that length and jump later and still contest or blocked the shot Percy Millers come off the Louisville bench to play the point while Ellis gets a rare rest Ill give it give him a ball fake trainer give him a ball fake at the post and give him a skip pass guys got to see the floor Applause like I just said before give Florida State to compact their defense contract and kick it out for a three Mills tough shot off the window known James tied up and its a held ball thanks to the defense by Jackson youre going to see Miller get into these guys here this is kind of patience Im talking about gets in gets the man off his feet and able to kick it out for a wide open three I love the patience by Miller to get into those gaps to be strong with the basketball and kick it out to a wide open threepoint shooter split pizza night on it Music Sherman J Williams make them say how do you know that reference how do you know that why not his dad is huge Master P come on Master P used to hoop back in the day now too okay Ive seen it he did Percy uh NBA preseason with the Hornets back in 8990 I mean I still would have given him 30 but I mean hes okay he was all right he would have gotten six or eight thats all right not known as a defensive player drunk he was a shooter heres his son five minutes to go in the half give it back to Percy the son of Percy here come the Knowles cast a little ahead of Jackson and he cant say lets see what I like about the shot from Louisville you know the first seven or eight minutes of the ball game they were getting penetration but there wasnt relocation after the penetration right there was a lot of stagnation people just standing around offensively but when you are able to get into those gaps give me a back cut move without the ball move to open spots you know and keep your hands ready to shoot because youre going to get wide open looks against Florida State they do contract their defense off penetration Florida State just committed its first turnover of the ball game over 15 minutes in by wheeler on the post knocked out of bounds by Caleb Mills Louisville will keep it with 12 to shoot really just has to hold this guy off on that seal get a ball pick by the guard throw it over the top itll be easy one at The Rim Allison Withers back in for Kenny Payne he talks to Miller and trainer who head out and a stoppage before the inbound do you know any good Master P songs I just sang one for you you did but do you know the name of it to me thats what it is youre so quickwitted I like it that was well played on your part I dont know about that I like my music though yeah I was surprised today jumping in the car with you had a little Drake on you had a little little Uzi I was like what the hell is going on here Doug youre surprising me couldnt change the station you couldnt figure it out couldnt figure it out no thats what I listened to Withers lost his footing Seminoles again on the Run Cleveland to the rim pretty much Applause your kidney pain in the staff those careless turnovers with the ball just drive you crazy unforced turnovers down unforced turnovers will always lead to the detriment of a team and that is the story of the 202223 Louisville Cardinals averaging about 16 turnovers per game hard to win ball games when you turn it over that frequently cam foreign off the jab step puts it in he has prolike moves I mean thats the second time hes caught the ball turn and face seeing if the defense is actually coming at him from the weak side and looked at the defenders hands her hands are down hes going to shoot a midi Applause surprises Leonard Hamilton has a 610 freshman with Pro potential right I mean thats been his Mo for the better part of his two decades in Tallahassee and look at him hes calling for the ball Applause Music Worley back to Mills just really bad Rotation by Louisville he had two players on one player Applause and that takes us to our next media timeout Seminoles up 11 Music spin green and cuff coming up on the halftime report here we got two Top Ten teams both went down Virginia Virginia Tech will break down the Hokies forthcoming schedule and also KU Iowa state that was a tough one for them great highlight though coach what do you see here well Florida States doing a great job of getting the ball in the paint theyre sharing the ball but Jay will said this a little bit ago and this is the problem with Louisville they make a mistake or things arent going right they get their head down so fast its such a long game theyre down 11 theres a whole half coming long game long season but theyre building for the future at this point I like what Jays talking about right its its about much further Beyond this year if anything just stop listening to the nonsensical narrative if we just dont acknowledge nonsense maybe theyll just move on nonsensical narrative fellas Music I mean I I couldnt agree with you guys more and I look I Im always on social media Doug I hear what people are saying to me right now on Twitter Im not trying to come here and literally fly into Louisville and give people lectures I like the passion by the Louisville fan base I just know how difficult it is to actually reestablish a culture it doesnt happen overnight now there are certain things that you need Google to do they need to pay the sense of urgency and there does need to be a sense of togetherness with this squad Applause some guys may not be here next year you know not everybodys buying in if theyre not buying in and Kenny Payne has to find out who wants to buy and if they want to buy and theyll be here next year if you dont theyll be in the first thing out of here now thats just keeping it honest with you about the business of the sport absolutely I mean it goes without saying even under the best of circumstances you can count on people going but I wouldnt be surprised if theres a complete roster overall building comes to life as Lance hits the pullup hes got double figures lets see that to a sixpoint game this is what Louisville fans want they just want to see that you can they are playing with the energy and the passing they want to celebrate you all they ask for is effort got to get a hand up one of the great fan bases in the country theyve been averaging about 11 12 000 which is down considerably but still a pretty good number for a team thats three and 19 this is why I would love to see Louisville run a set James missed from the corner you know you just have multiple possessions four or five in a row where the game is just going at this pace would love just to see them get a high efficient shot off the set Applause and these are the kind of defensive breakdowns I was talking about as it relates to Louisville just watch Withers on this play here I mean hes on the ball he leaves his man why are you leaving your man thats Elliss man it forces him into defensive rotation Florida State knocks down to three and thats your fourth year captain doing that thats the other thing that I think scratches your head as much as anything Doug love defense as much as you love offense love pricking down your opponent mentally in the defensive end just as much as you want to score 30 thats when your team goes to the next level as a mindset swing well this is a season high and ACC play for points in the first half for Florida State they scored 39 at Notre Dame Applause it was all Seminole so Louisville will keep with eight on the shot clock Im going to keep saying this it makes it really difficult for Ellis at his sides to find penetration when youve got trees down there you got you got trees you got guys six eight six nine Ellis only being six one six two gotta find a different way to finish up the rim or Kenny Payne has to put them in a vehicle that allows Ellis in an isolated situation to get his shot off Applause final 40 seconds of the half Seminoles up by eight they get Corin on the switch he doesnt take advantage instead kicks to the corner Withers got caught sleeping standing straight up on the weak side this is what you need from a guy whos a veteran on this team but to the Baseline in a stance being alert about man you ball seeing the ball at the top of the key knowing that youre guarding the shooter and the corner those are the daggers that absolutely destroy your confidence as a Louisville basketball player and instead Mills buries the three James with an air ball at the other end how about the elevation final two seconds Worley tied up by Lands Applause 20 minutes in the books Florida State 45 Louisville 36 at the break look of course police played theyre only down by nine theyre still in a small game and those are the plays if youre Kenny Payne youre saying what are we doing guys we had to play with the sense of urgency Doug thats all they talked about today at practice they said hey look our energy has to be everywhere we have to have a sense of urgency and we need to pay for each other and for a guy like Withers thats a guy that Im Im singling out in the locker room I am addressing it head on by saying I need you to be better and I need you to give us energy on the defensive end with the land warley has been great against the Cardinals this year in addition to that bucket eight assists no turnovers so far in the two games by the way catches Ellis standing up those are the kind of plays Im talking about coming out of halftime heres what were going to run our first offensive set heres how were going to take advantage of it Louisville wants to play gaps they want to get up and pass Lanes if they do if you feel them over playing lets head in with the back door cut lob at The Rim second foul on L Ellis by the way you can do that when youre not putting pressure on the ball as well right great balance for Florida State as we begin the second half four guys now with eight points two with six and that stays that way Applause Worley Corin Mills and green all with eight points as the Seminoles have led throughout led by as many as 14 in the first half Florida State defensively switches everything thats why youve got this match up Ellis trying to drive on foreign and the health Defender comes over Cleveland not called for the foul its Corrin who gets the personal okay here another example another example Florida State kids in the group huddle Louisville is scattered fractured yep nobodys talking to anybody everybody is playing individually thats the difference right there between a team of individuals and the collective Union so is that your Captains Alice Withers and Curry or is that head coach Kenny Payne at least the responsibility is that well its somebody on the floor I would say its typically its the point guard responsibility to bring everybody in but I think thats kind of this team lacks a little bit of that leadership that floor journal to put everybody in their place Im sitting next to a Florida General right now amazing right next to me he would have put everybody in the Huddle yeah the Louisville Legend gonna join us in just a few minutes Peyton Siva back to watch his alma mater be interesting to hear his thoughts about uh the state of affairs with his beloved program another turnover two on one Cleveland on the business end of the alley oops I mean there are a lot of things not everyone have to call out I mean to see three white jerseys jog back after a turnover is disappointing extremely disappointing Music weve seen this for years for Leonard Hamilton getting a lot of points in the paint again today for the Seminoles 32 points in the paint for Florida State able to get points and transition off of turnovers the lack of communication by Louisville has allowed to absolutely dominate the paint now we said at the beginning of the Show Doug that Leonard Hamilton has a team where hes not able to get into the depth of their bench they dont have the same depth that Florida State teams have typically had in the past in the past so you have guys playing a lot more minutes but today they are by far the aggressor and they are coming out and really deciding the standard for what you see defensively on both ends another unforced error This Time by Mike James who dribbled it off his foot yeah Leonard Hamiltons team all five starters with eight points or more Mills green Cleveland and warley all have eight Corin leads all scorers with 10 the depth has been compromised with a couple of key injuries Cameron Fletcher was injured at UVA hes the Kentucky transfer and then just as big Jalen Gainey twotime Defensive Player of the Year in the ivy league at Brown coming here as a grad transfer to play for the Seminoles preseason injury out for the year that changed the dynamic in terms of defensively for Florida State this year yeah he was a very versatile piece that could have guard positions you know one through four essentially in thats a Swiss army knife that just destroys you offensively and defensively not having a guy like that available Applause and theyre the big two on top Papa Miller not because of injury did miss one game with tonsillitis but the big thing was that he missed half the season based on a suspension for travel benefits which he received and green and Jackson have both missed limited time Currys pass taken away by Cleveland streaking to the bucket all right now this is how things are going to change next year you ready for a duck next year if I saw Worley coming down if I were a liberal player thats going to be a hard foul yeah theres going to be a rule in my team if Im KP next year no layups you will end up on your back before you end up scoring the ball off a free layup in transition it does not need to happen and thats where you want to see Louisville take the next step somebody take a heart foul somebody draw a line in the sand somebody yell at somebody and thats why I think this team lacks but they need to find who those players are going to be next year on this roster because thats what the fans deserve thats what Kenny Payne and the staff deserves and that is what they are saddled with every single day every hour of every day trying to make those determinations and work with the group they have here Kamari lands gets the roll the guy Im not worried about their offensive production obviously fans are going to be worried about the turnover margin I understand that Im not worried about Im worried about the effort that we get on the defensive end and not giving up anything easily and Diving on the floor for loose balls being the aggressor I dont even care if you need to trash talk Doug like if were down 15 Im trash talking you you have to be built differently you have to find a way to engage your mind back in the game Miller Curry trainer lands and Ellis the five on the floor for Louisville theyve been playing from behind all afternoon hand up get up in them get up in them especially when youre guarding green an excellent threepoint shooter Corner looks for Mills around and out first to speed for Ellis but he got cut off by Mills lands inside Sydney Curry blames it off the glass for two I want to get only down to 11 points I mean right there a striking difference distance a lot of game a lot of basketball left to be played here green step back two off the back line pouring on the offensive glass spins shoots over Curry no no two offensive rebounds in a row time out here at the KFC Yum Center when we come back a Louisville Legend joins us courtside foreign Music Center in Louisville Kentucky joined Now by a young man who knows what its like to be in this building when its rocking bait and seal so Siva great to have you with us first update for Jay and I what youve been up to and what brings you back to Louisville today uh first thank you guys for having me man its a pleasure being on here just got back recently from Australia was over there playing in the NBL which was a fun league and now just back here living in Louisville uh coming down here to the Yum Center enjoying watching these guys play and you know just seeing my Louisville alma mater I got tight man they had highlights of you a couple minutes ago you caught a threes I forgot how bad yeah but talk to me a little bit about you know hey one of the things I loved about you as a player you set the tone right the tone was always set for you at the guard position you guys had an identity what do you think the identity is of this team right now what do you see on the floor when youre watching them play well like you said it starts with the the guard play and as a point guard you have to be extension of the coaching you know I talked to L A lot hes a wonderful kid I love him to death and he got he has to continue to lead this team be more vocal out there in the court and theyre still trying to find their identity and I think thats why they struggled this year and thats why theyre struggling right now so hopefully they can find that identity soon and uh kind of pick it up now you played in two final fours you won it all in 2013 even though theres not a banner up there we know you won the tournament whats it like for the alumni watching what this program is currently going through Peyton man it was tough it was a tough you know couple years to see where they were at and with the NCAA Cloud holding over their heads but its good to see you know Kenny out there former alumni on the on the sidelines and hopefully you know turning this program around you know the fans in the city deserve it theres nothing like them I love them to death and thats why Im back here in Louisville myself and as alumni I want to do everything I can to help these guys out and I try to get down there as much as possible to just speak some words of wisdom to the NLP and I got yelled at by the people on social media about here we go with another analyst giving us a lecture on being patient with Kenny Payne I guess Ive just known Kenny Payne for a while I know his Network I know how tied in this guy is to the leader of the elite players I know people on the staff what do you say to the fan base that says Im tired of being patient weve been patient for seven years its tough man its tough for the fans and you get it uh the fans they love basketball theyre passionate they want to see some results but I see it every day I go down to practices I go down to individuals and these kids are working hard man and its its just about translating that to the game and right now they just got to figure that out Kenny and the staff theyre amazing staff and they have these guys working every day its just about getting these guys to buy into it and getting these guys to translate it into the game oh my goodness wait Doug its all coming together right now wait wait a second we got a national champion a guys been the two final fours a guy that was the heartbeat of this team a guy that lives here in this city a guy that goes down to individuals are we sure Peyton we dont want you on the staff here are we are we sure I mean hey man Im not throwing it out there for you now I dont need to put pressure on you but I dont know who else better represents Louisville basketball to Payton sieber hey man Im just here to help these guys out man I do a pro bono right now so well see one day in the future maybe but Im just here to help him out man just out the I Love Louisville I love the these kids man and they deserve everything so like I said Im just here to help him out whatever way I can very very professional answer yeah very professional this guys gonna be a politician but lets go back more than a decade what Drew you to this program from the Great Northwest man Im from Seattle Washington and you know I grew up watching you know basketball group watching udub and love them to death and then once I got older I started paying attention to take a bigger picture I had a former guy from Seattle that played out here Terence Williams got a chance to watch him in the tournament fell in love with their style they got up and down T will was a beast too oh man then got a chance once I watched him watch Edgar Sosa when he was here and I was like man I love that school I got a chance to visit the fans were amazing thats why Im living here now they just showed love man and you go to where youre loved and this was a place that you know showed the most and I felt like it was going to be home for me so I want to come out here prove my worth and at that time you guys know the Big East was one of the top conferences in the nation they had about 10 teams every year in the NCAA tournament so that thats what drew me even more and theres no doubt that it was going to be an overhaul with this team I mean its just its inevitable right we always keep it a buck here when we talk from a guard possession that you know its gonna be a Personnel change I I do want to ask you what your opinion is on Mike James right a younger player tall long athletic still has room for improvement from an IQ perspective but has the talent of a high level ACC guard to me 100 I think Mike is one of those kids that kind of came on Late and a lot of people didnt realize he was hurt his whole freshman year so that that took some time then he was hurt all preseason and I tell you what I told you I lived here he was one of the only guys Ive seen in the gym there was a couple others but I saw the work ethic every day and seeing him just put the work in you know translating into the game I was very happy for him man to see him healthy and see that translate it was an amazing and I think hes going to have a bright future for him thats what we were talking about earlier about you know when you see the shoot arounds not seeing guys in the gym before shoot around Arts you know in the lather I mean we would have saw that with your team even after practice is over you guys still stayed in the gym its just you know look if your facilities living facilities are next to the gym that is the alltime dream for a Hooper thats all I want to do 100 man I tell them all the time like you guys can wake up and roll across the street you guys are right in the gym you know but thats just the culture now and they got to establish a better culture and I think theyre doing that with Kenny whos teaching these guys they got live in the gym man and I mean theyre learning it now if you live in the gym man the results will come and they see it right now and that is the brand new Denny Krum dormitory youre talking about that opened up this past fall season womens basketball teams and the volleyball team are among regular students who live there and its literally right across yeah its an amazing Place uh you know I was I thought minority Hall was beautiful and you walk in there its hey kids these days man you know every different every decade you go oh man back in my day we didnt have this you know I had it good these guys have it great so welcome to your 30s yeah I was gonna say I mean you guys didnt have nio about none right um and I think one of the things thats interesting is you know you guys were coached hard and I thats what I like about Kenny Payne even in practice say they were coached hard and its hard to be coached hard when you got the transfer portal like the way it is and nio where everybody wants to be coddled nobody wants to be told the blunt truth yeah and thats what I love about Kenny man he doesnt control anything hes going to tell these guys how it is what it is going to be like who cares about your nil who cares about this or that youre going to come here and work and Kenny works these guys so its good to see that and like you said nowadays kids they can give up or transfer and they want to do whatever they want but its good to see uh you know Kenny still has that old school approach that was the third foul on a manual akoraphor Im guessing youre still in close contact with Coach patino and with Russ yeah I talked to him a lot close Ps doing good man hes dealing with some injuries Iona love him to death um oh man what a Glock Russ is doing well too doesnt he have like his own like uh brandy or some kind of Scots Scots brand something like that I dont know that was a nice block right there no Russ does have a great bourbon man yeah is he okay and I I dont I dont know anything about the bourbon I dont drink but you know Russ has one this is Louisville Kentucky where theyre known for that so good for him nice lead by Kamari I mean hes a talented freshman too man if he can get that shot going man he can really help these guys out a lot have you had the opportunity to see akoraphor much yeah man this kid hes just hes one of those kids that just is very appreciative of what he have he came over here from the African program and he works hard man he has a great energy about him thats a tough three right there but he has a great energy about him a great you know Aura and he just wants to be here man hes one of those kids thats just appreciative of the little things and thats what these guys need man they need to see that and he just hes just enjoying this so far see pain I would disagree with you I dont think that was a tough three its not a tough three when youre contesting the shot with your hands down by your waist right like I think theres something else for Louisville on that shot like when youre close now you got to have your hands up you gotta have active hands see Im a little fan so I was saying thats a tough dude Im not an analyst man Im biased yeah yeah but no I mean youre 100 correct man you have to challenge a shot and as Coach P used to say in college the percentage of a challenge shot in in college is way lower than a percentage of challenge shot in the NBA I mean you got to put a hand up you gotta at least make them see something uh their hands are down theyre high there we go like you said Mike hell of a player man he works hard and hes going to be a special player down the road see by the way that play right there Doug thats what they talked about during their practice today they said if they trap the inbound pass slip in make yourself available thats great recognition right there by Mike James right sometimes when youre a younger player you get lost in the chaos of the game you dont think through the game and as you see him continue to kind of evolve through the thinking process of the game he has a chance to be special for sure even a great path by Emmanuel man lets just take on the double team and have the selfawareness to throw that pass a lot of guys nowadays their basketball IQ isnt really there you know hes hes learning hes been here for what two weeks now hes really showing a Bryce Buffalo he hasnt we talked about it off the top Payton that they are asking an 18 year old who wasnt even the country a month ago right there man he brings energy and thats what Global News man they need a that breath of fresh air that they havent had in a while and hes hes doing really well out there eight minutes into the second half Peyton Siva the Louisville Legend scored over 1200 points during his four years for Coach Patino kick kick Ellis fouled and again thank you so much for joining us Pete great to see you um pretty damn good Music to you it may just be an elevator here goes nothing but for a young Florida state with the 11th point lead Over Louisville my partner Jay Williams did a pretty good career at Duke I would say yeah I think first North Carolina I was seven and two not that I remember every single detail of every game but I pretty much do wait a second your math doesnt add up how could you be seven and two of our Graphics seven and one okay all right seven and one 177 total points 42 assists 24 steals your number one memory from a game against Carolina is probably the year we want it uh we lost Carlos Boozer uh to Maryland and we had to go play in North Carolina senior night and I was our last game of the regular season to get a share of the regular season ACC title and uh we just came in there and we actually implemented the Golden State Warriors style to play a basketball before the Golden State Warriors we went small Shane Battier was our five just like similar to Draymond Green and we just shot so many threes myself Mike Dunleavy Chris Duhon um you know and Shane Battier it was in Nate James it was a lot of fun and I think thats how we actually found a rhythm to win the whole thing and again were looking forward to the rematch tonight 6 30 on ESPN the renewal of the greatest rivalry in college basketball oh yeah oh wow I need to see a replay or that I mean that is what athleticism right there but I like that go meet him at The Rim Applause oh thats clean that is clean I think God is clean hes going vertical Cleveland is initiating the contact that looked like all ball to me Applause third personal foul on Mike James but once again Doug what was the mindset right there by your young player no nothing easy youre not getting a layup in transition were gonna meet you at the rim or were going to give you a hard foul I thought Peyton saved his Insight was fantastic on so many things but he talked about the fact that Mike James you know he missed an entire season rehabbing from a torn Achilles tendon then in the off season over the summer in the fall he had multiple hamstring injuries and so not until really weve gotten into ACC player were starting to see the bolts Larry was a couple of years ago I mean look at Kevin Durant the way hes responded off an Achilles injury and you know its been one of the best Achilles comes back of all time but he still also had multiple injuries because you end up compensating with your body he has followed Kevin Durant hes followed learned from Dominique Wilkins who was somebody who decades ago came back from that injury and he said Edmund sunders is another guy currently in the NBA who came back from that and he says that those rehabs gave him Mike James a blueprint for how to do it himself Cleveland the black shot hes got green in the corner cant find him did bring it back out to house inside Corinth creates corn is a pro hes going to be a pro his footwork is impeccable and also right there he initiated the contact and didnt rush a quick shot thats what you love from his style of the play and hes every bit 610 225 just to French though Ellis oh I love that I love the hustle that would have given Kamari lands a new career high hes at 15 which he scored first time against the hilltoppers of Western Kentucky Ellis dancing with the ball here I mean he is so Dynamic with the basketball it has an array of shots at the rim and when hes able to get going offensively hes one of the most prolific scorers there is in the ACC conference and he draws so much attention with the ball because of that Dynamic ability to get to the rack guys just need to be ready with their hands to knock down open shots when he gets in the paint three important that was okorafors fourth foul so again his minutes on the floor being Limited with the foul difficulties our college basketball lineup rolls on all afternoon over on ESPN at 4 Eastern number one Purdue takes on Indiana then your alma mater Duke taking on North Carolina inside Cameron Indoor Stadium I know who youre rooting for who do you think who do you like in that game between theres really no other team too like that really is this a trick question seeing what youd say no its personal so what youd say I guess its personal its okay its allowed to be personal you know I think North Carolina is one heck of a team I think theyve had some challenges um I think its been a difficult year for Caleb love and obviously big cop battling some injuries but if youre a Duke this is a game you got to get at home Applause and good job by Miller just be in the nuisance being there all right everything to talk about if youre down double digits just pressing up and put putting Florida State in position to make mistakes just saying Hersey break them off something yeah just being there right there and forcing offensive value you cant push off like that if youre Cleveland and on Cleveland justice first foul of the day that was streaking in Miller did great Ball Trainer to find the wide open Jalen Withers Applause that by the way was Louisvilles first points of the day off of a turnover and at the other end Taylor Mills puts in the three ball from the corner if I can turn and face and see the rim Im gonna have a shot at the basket you have to get a hand up every time Louisville Kentucky offensive players knees is that ever happened one hand up and one hand down being active Jalen Withers can shoot theres no question about that 14 points to lead the Cardinals hanging around can they get a stop or two green tough shot no they get that stop now can they cash in at the other end Applause Mouse in the house mouse in the house there you go Punisher good job Curry kicks to the corner its a good shotgun Miller though misfired Applause Mills with a quick first step with the left hand no Sydney Curry Corrals the rebound now lets move his head up attacks and one blocking foul and he will shoot two I got right right before the under eight timeout I like to push there by Ellison both teams are gassed right now I havent had a timeout in a while multiple possessions but find a way to get to the freethrow line create contact that was the third foul on Darren Green sending Ellis a 78 foul shooter to the line the King LeBron continues his quest to pass Kareem to become the NBAs alltime leading scorer later when the Lakers take on the Pelicans six Eastern three Pacific right here on ESPN2 and ESPN plus hes just 63 points from the record and heres our NBA Saturday Primetime matchup on ABC in the ESPN app should be a good one Luke in the maps in San Francisco to take on Steph and the Warriors coverage with NBA Countdown begins at 8 Eastern five Pacific want to know when the Browns going to break it uh when he catches Kareem at home against the Milwaukee Bucks a team that Kareem has played for with the sky hook mark it down and that would allow Kareem to be there in person Kareem will be in La if the game is happening there he wont be able to be on the road timeout here in Louisville and what if I want a new car State Farms here thats here at four oclock Eastern time Deontay Johnson wooden Ward watchless top 20 guy taking on Texas KState and Texas next top 10 matchup Dougie back to you Music foreign guys thanks so much back here in Louisville where coach Leonard Hamiltons team trying to move to six and seven in ACC plays got five different players all the starters in double figures but a missed front end by nahim McLeod and the Cardinals Jay just keep hanging around Miller and Ellis in the backcourt together this is Ellis over the excellent shot blocker and McLeod picks up the personal I love that I love the spacing by Ellis to get into the gap stop the clock make two free throws come back down on the defensive end get another stop hit a lot of gaps right they use their size their height they got in a ton of offensive rebounds in this ball game you know and the one thing that Louisville has to have to keep them off their offensive glass and that is where Florida state has been able to make their Mark not shooting a high clip at first but getting that second chance points is whats killing me well Jay this is the closest the game has been since the start of the second half when it was 4536 Ellis with a couple of free throws he leads all Cardinals with 16 points we talked about teams finding identity right like right now I see Louisville way more connected than I have the entire game Worley green Cleveland Mills and McLeod out there for the Seminoles green Cardinals get another stop Louisville got a little bit lucky on that one Wiggles got hit with a backspin they worked on that back screen today in practice and green got an open three just missed it great play Ellen Ellen offensive rebound and Louisville will keep it as the shot was blocked out of bounds heres what I love about the Way Louisville is playing and they worked on us today in practice as well driving the Baseline the opposite side drifting towards the corner look heres a drive Baseline pass with the left hand and rotating the ball quickly the defense cant get out there knocking down the three like I said before Louisville just playing way more connected basketball of penetration and sharing the rock trainer Applause its a sixpoint ball game look at the body language of Louisville theyre engaged Good Help from the weak side timeout Florida State Louisville on a 90 run forces coach hand to use a to Applause ol with former Duke AllAmerican Jay Williams Im Doug Sherman Louisville creeping back to within six Applause Music lets watch the second half for Louisville just I mean a lot of fan trades actually taking care of the basketball not allowed those careless turnovers that you saw in the first half really good job getting into those gaps being strong and finishing and look you know Florida state has had a tendency sometimes to take their foot off the gas Im sitting in the Florida game weve seen other games where they allow teams to come back and now its not getting stops in a defensive end four to shoot Worleys got to put it up shot clock violation and many of the fans here at the KFC Yum Center remain on their feet for their Cardinals Applause thats the matchup you have a mismatch on Curry down low theres a small on Curry now you give them the matchup they wanted four in the shot clock Miller penetrates loses his footing no call and theres the shot clock violation thats where sometimes you just wish they had a floor General that could pull the ball out and see that Curry had a small on him instead of having Curry come out for a ball screen so they can switch the small back on Ellis you allow him to post up thats where weve gotten all the mismatches Worley snaps the Louisville run we talked so much today in practice about the bigs being up on those screens communicating to the guards where the screen is coming from Curry did not communicate trainer no Miller tracks Down The Long rebound and The Possession continues with just over five minutes remaining Ellis into the lane tough shot I love college basketball lets go Music scoring back to Cleveland long three off the front iron Cardinals down six trying to press it up floor Ellis end to end his shot hit the bottom of the backboard and went out of bounds back to FSU Applause theyre going to see Florida say here come off the ball screen and find a way to get to the rim and thats where Curry just has to communicate where that ball screen is coming from to the guard who is applying pressure The Bigs are the backbone of the defense Doug they have to be the most vocal people on the court thats all Kenny Payne talked about today in practice we will go as our bigs communicate defensively Applause now Worley will look to initiate takes the ball screen and its an illegal screen against Camp foreign just doing a way better job being up on the screen and thats what you want pressing up getting over at the top yeah Im really sure if that was an illegal scream didnt really see a lot of movement there nonetheless it is his second personal just over four minutes to go thank you Applause Music so once again now he got a small on him he got a small one give him the ball he got a mismatch on Curry instead Alice spins into Lane and draws the foul which will take us to break hey look if Florida State wants to switch all that action thats fine whoever the smallest Garden Curry give him the ball down low on the Block kiss sometimes Music at Dominos we appreciate those who get off the couch front runner for National Player of the Year at the Rival Indiana well thats the lowest well see the ball being dribbled by him all day right there fans should really watch this guy is ahead of the defense when he gives the ball up watch the position he gets to get offensive rebounds and to repost just under seven minutes that tips off over on ESPN we got a tight finish here lets get to Louisville thank you Dallin Louisville right back in this basketball game after trailing by double figures for most of this second half but they have been different in the last few minutes Jay well theyve been playing with this sense of urgency Ive seen more communication in the second half than I have from Louisville you know for the last couple of games and taking care of the ball is critical and now these are the best moments of a college basketball game the game is somewhat tight the teams ability to execute the details down the stretch typically win the game everybody for Louisville right now seeing menu ball good job getting over the screen communicating back out long three green no defensive board for Cleveland what did we talk about Doug he said offensive rebound will be keyed down the stretch got to keep Florida State off the glass the Louisvilles got a defend for another 20 seconds Music this time they secure the rebound thats what you want up your Louisville you want them to settle for a contested three Applause trainer calling for the ball hes got it give it to him Sydney Curry mussels as well through the defender for two more its a twopoint ball game timeout Seminoles Kenny Payne today in practice talked about Curry wanting the basketball who is stopping that man child on the Block nobody Doug if he cracks into them first whenever he sees a Florida State Defender standing up he cracked into him got post position and finished strong and thats what they worked on and thats the same Sydney Curry we saw late last season and now Jay hes got his weight back under control and is much more able to do that but a lot of times Doug for big so have that size of frames they await they wait for the defensive player to create contact for them and we always talk about this in the league and we talk about this whenever you play basketball no you dont wait for them to create you initiate the contact you be the aggressor you carve out space who is stopping Curry from creating space down on the Block I dont care what tiles you can put a seven footer on them you can put somebody he has to frame to carve out space you want him to do that consistently because this will change ultimately how Louisville plays basketball well the Cardinals are on a 152 run on the flip side one of the Seminoles need to do and who do they need to look to at this point Jake they need to stop settling for contested threepoint shots need to find a way to get the ball to the rim get to the free throw line seems like the last several possessions the offenses became stagnant and theyve set up for contested threes a 15point lead has been trimmed to two by a Louisville team looking for its second consecutive win and while that wouldnt normally be noteworthy in this season it would be a huge achievement for the Cardinals tuck let me ask you who do you think is Florida States best player at the moment probably Matthew Cleveland so Ive been watching Florida state for a while Matthew Cleveland has all the skills to be the best the one thing I wonder about him sometimes is it seems like he can disappear in games I would like to see him be aggressive and take the game over when it matters the most here he is with the basketball in his hands tough shot and Louisville can Tire Take the Lead the lob to the ram say trainer from Ellis on the huge alleyoop Worley cut off gets it back out for the corner for Mills 10 to shoot curry with the rejection but the follow Slam by Corin puts FSU back in front Applause here comes the ball screen by curry in the switch defensively they switch Ellis around Corin goaltended and Florida State once again ball pressure hand down what a great pass by Ellis over the top and trainer to slam it down I mean this game has me standing on my feet though you know what basketball is you and everybody else in the building Jay Worley Cleveland lays it in Great set for the Knowles great pass there by Worley trainer just got caught standing up lost his man Alice hands to James out there with trainer Withers and Curran shot clock down to 10 great job by Florida State pressure in the ball time out Louisville Louisville is not able to get into their operating zone right operating offensively you want to get towards the threepoint line Florida States defense had them pushed all the way out between half court in the threepoint line so they have to work for that space guys have to work to become available on the offensive end when Florida state is playing those passing lanes and it appeared when Kenny Payne called that timeout he was staring at the man who was holding the ball Mike James about killing a dribble perhaps a younger player you dont pick up your triple in that situation right if anything we call it an escape dribble which means if youre pressuring me you know Im gonna reverse pivot use a hard back snap just to create some space to let my team calm down but this is where we go into Doug the floor general of this team you know you want the ball in Elliss hands but you want also somebody that can say everybody just relax take a second heres the set that were in lets execute it Kenny Payne has to be that player now that extension of that player on the floor for them thats why youre going to timeout Withers has been hot again today consecutive games four of six from distance trainer with the big alleyoop slammed a moment ago Currys out there with James and Ellis look for a pin down from Curry Ken ellisabal I get Curry and Ellis in the high ball screen instead they go to trainer hand it back to James trying to work on Worley four to shoot three Ellis is in a bad spot the contested deep three is Off the Mark and it takes the air out of the building Louisvilles got to give the foul with only two seconds difference between game and shot clock so James comes up and commits the personal on Worley who is a 65 foul shooter Matthew Cleveland has his 10th DoubleDouble of the Year 15 points 10 rebounds and for the 17th consecutive game he has reached double figures in scoring Music and that was the fourth foul on Mike James as Jalen Worley the sophomore from Mount Airy Pennsylvania out of Westtown School makes the front end and 65 free throw shooter by Whirley really good job by him knocking down the first if he knocks on a second I think youre going to see Florida State apply some full court pressure getting a little bit well use some of the clock Yep theyre going to press up Worley gets them both and with a timeout lets send it back to Dallin thanks Doug underway on the app you get the top 10 match up Texas on the road to Kansas State a battle Atop The Big 12 Marquis Noel Noel chiante Johnson Marcus Carr a bunch of studs there that game will start here on ESPN2 when our game concludes back to you guys for the finish and the bill Music thank you sir 256 remaining in regulations so now what is the strategy down to possession we got to get something quick you get a quick tune you do not need to take a threepoint shot 256 seconds is a long time in a basketball game Louisville just used their last time out though on this play so you get it quick too and then you try to get a quick steal if you dont get a quick steal you get a quick bow you extend the number of possessions in the ball game by putting Florida State on the free throw line win or lose this ball game what have you seen from Louisville coming back in the last nine minutes from 15 down Im saying the team that is collectively playing for themselves you know and that was our biggest question coming into this game is that when you get embarrassed over and over and over again there has to be a certain point to get draw a line in the sand and hes like were not playing for anybody else but our own Pride I think what weve seen in the second half is the Louisville team that is communicating they are playing with a sense of urgency and they are defending and when they do those things that is the extension of Kenny Payne on the floor and by the way that is what Louisville fans want to see they want to see that consistent effort from the second half Louisville team L Ellis with a big second half scoring the basketball now with 22 points total to lead all scorers Kamari lands has matched his career high with 15 Jalen Withers has 14 and itll be JJ trainer to inbound shot clock is off lets see if they go for the quick two with Ellis off the hesitation leaves his feet Curry now press up not removable you press up and try to create a quick turnover trap trap trap foul given by Ellis Im okay with the foul but see I when he catches the ball like that that is the worst place to catch the ball with 15 seconds left somebody needs to be counting in her head 1514 because you can use the sideline and the Baseline as extra Defenders I would have trapped there for a couple of seconds seeing if you can get a quick turnover rather than just go to a quick five so Ellis picks up his third person will foul trainer to me was a little slow coming for the Trap do you think he should have waited for him to get there to trap the ball with time being so precious yeah I mean I I still think its working you catch the ball in those spots Darren Green a 90 percent foul shooter for the Seminoles thats why I try to trap for a couple of seconds because Im seeing their teams best freethrow shooter to the line 70 is executed getting it into his hands hes one out of two and its a threepoint game Music Ellis thats tough tough shot doesnt go Curry kept it alive three seconds possession two seconds for the tie and the Seminoles escape with an 8178 victory just seemed like Ellis Im curious if he actually knew that they were down three there in that particular situation um I would like to see him try to take a step back three more so than try to finish through all the trees he hasnt really been that highly efficient
