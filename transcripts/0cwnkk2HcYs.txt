of perhaps Clemsons worst stretch of the season in which they lost three consecutive games by double figures but of late Clemson has lost a couple of onepoint games a double overtime game and hoping to get right in Chapel Hill tonight theyre underway and Clemson will have it first starting lineups very similar to what youve seen in the past the exception Clemson coach Brad brell is starting Jack Clark number five you see him in the corner for the fourth time tonight and a turnaround shot from Chase Hunter the first two of the night right away youre seeing Clemson Target Elliot CAD similar to what Georgia Tech did in their game in practice today Carolina was running a play they wanted to get Bon a touch on the first possession but Tigers able to take it away shefin is now guarding bot but no problem Harrison Ingram who also had a sensational game on Saturday night against Duke EV to score at two here is the starting five for brown Els Tigers Chase Hunter and Jack Clark Joseph Gerard the former Syracuse player along with shefflin who might be the most improved player in the ACC and PJ Hall as Jay mentioned there is shefin with his first shot of the night and he puts it in yeah sheing you talked about in his last game against North Carolina had 16 Points 11 rebounds really able to take advantage of that with his sides down low you know a lot of people always talk about the game before the game Rees that was a Georgia Tech game weve seen the game after the game look at Kansas prime example going against Kansas State in octagon a doom you know the tendency for teams to take their foot off the gas I dont Im not sure thats going to happen to Carolina theyre a team that has more of a veteran presence but still you wonder about their focus and their concentration Joseph Gerard knocks down his first shot Gerard in his career at Syracuse and had struggles against North Carolina its 11 to 43 the four coming tonight bacock misses his first shot Gerards coming the other way Clemson up 62 saw the starting lineup for the heels Jay will you might see a lot of them tonight Seth Trimble wont play for North Carolina tonight got banged up in practice yesterday nothing that happened in the Duke game he is not available tonight as Gerard is now two for two with a three and cson has jumped on top by a Music touchdown chefin with another rebound off the Davis Miss now you see we talked about the Duke hangover such an emotional match up but the record has been quite good and already Clemsons hit a couple of Threes which is one more than they hit in the first match against Carolina when they went 1 for 18 from the floor and theyre up by double figures Joseph dra doing a really good job of pushing the tempo not the fastest player or most explosive but very good at getting to his spots on the floor finding PJ Hall logging in transition Clemson has it missed and theyre also getting every rebound boy shefin gets deep position on Ingram those two guys very similar in terms of productivity across the board and thats the first Miss of the night for the Tigers Here Comes RJ Davis the leading scorer in the ACC sheflin with another rebound Clinton doing a very good job of getting back in transition defense one of the things North Carolina is superb at is off eight shots pushing the ball down one of the fastest Paces in the country Clinton doing a great job of communicating this far already has one three and now hes got another PJ Hall who only had 10 points and hbert Davis is not going to wait on the media timeout as Clemson who has won exactly one time in its entire history theyre 1 and 160 in the dean Dome and theyre a 152 clarify the note I had a moment ago theyre not 1 and 60 in the D in Chapel Hill theyve had their troubles here but not so far tonight North Carolina typically plays in drop coverage on PR and you have two guys that are able to knock down shots in PJ Hall and shefin as well and Joe Gerard his ability to get into those little gaps his game is never rushed offensively I think youre going to have to see Ellie kdo or RJ Davis get up Underneath Him and force him to be uncomfortable a significantly better start than the Tigers had at home a month ago now down 13 PJ Halls absolutely battling Bott down low for position on the Block Clemson showing a little Zone here saw this some practice this morning theres bot who rolls it in Clemson is not going to bring a double team thats going to be opportunity for bov to eat all down low on the Block Chase Hunter finds some space and he knocks down another one from the short Corners hes got four RJ Davis lets Applause fly RJ at 17 against duia tonight almost travel only five to 14 from the four Hunter turns down the ball screen balls already hit a couple three corners got bot to go up and PJ left it on the rim saves it so theyll get the fresh 20 great Hands by PJ Hall to grab that offensive board Halls already hit two and was going for three theres an offensive rebound from sheflin kick out to Jack Clark thats no good and Harrison Ingram pulls it away heres RJ Davis we and the critical keys for Clemson to win this game is take care of the basketball North Carolina has 17 points off of 11 turnovers by keeping their last game and they allowed them to get a rhythm offensively they C draws the foul on Hall first meeting last month all fouled out thats his first tonight what a start for Clemson or you want to give it to the big guys sabatt The Bigs amond Bott and PJ Hall two of the top bigs in the AC going head tohe basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance bundle home and auto and sa visit progressivecom well that celebration on Franklin Street apparently has not died down much because North Carolina started out in a little bit of a fog in fact earlier today hbert Davis said that he got into his team at practice yesterday I asked him if it was because one one of those coach things that you plan to do after a big win or did they need it he said they needed it cot goes to the free throw line and rattles at home and cing in a big hole right out of the gate but its a difficult thing Jay will so much as as you know better than anyone poured into that rivalry game on Saturday night I mean thousands of kids on Franklin Street I mean at Duke we would have Barn fires or so emotionally invested in that game the most difficult aspect of it Rd is walking around campus the next couple of days and everybody telling you how great you are its almost like you won a championship and you have to recognize theres still nine regular season games left in the ACC and Clemson has been in a ton of battles they never came out on the right side of a lot of them but theyve been in the fight good find from Gerard but RJ godfery you just checked into the game cant get it Pax and woic whos seen his minutes cut in recent games is in for Hubert Davis as we mentioned earlier Seth trembl not available tonight and Bott goes right at Godfrey and he gets the n one this is what North Carolina needs to do more of the first possession against Duke they ran a back screen they put Armando Bott on the Block he went to work and they fed him consistently throughout the course of the game at times North Carolina gets very guard heavy now RJ Davis one of the guest best guards in the nation but at times they forget about Armando Bott down low on the block him being a priority as much as RJ Davis being a is key to success for the T hes got seven of North Carolinas nine points theyve gotten him started but part of that J Will isnt it also Armando being a little more assertive and demanding the basketball we call the Georgia Tech game and I got to give a shout out to Huber Davis last couple years hes seen Huber who has a very lowkey demeanor he pulled Armando bot against George attack and laid into him very much felt like I was watching Roy Williams so the evolution of hbert Davis as a coach is continuing to be seen Carolina in transition boy did we see a lot of this on Saturday night cormack Ryan misses the layup and shein has his fifth rebound Applause already Jack Clark thats no good heres Ryan North Carolina will look to run Clon able to get back a tough shot there by Clemson you dont want toay play at the same Pace as North Carolina more of a controlled set slow down the tempo of the game force them to execute defensively each and every possession Line open for three he struggled a little bit relative to his capabilities great find from J Davis had a chance for another threepoint play for bacot RJ Davis turns this corner great change of speed sees the play before it even comes cafrey there comes up try to block the shot from the weak side Bott does a great job of giving a target with his hands two hands ready to catch the ball RJ acquires and attracts so much attention hell get those feeds all evening long as you mentioned earlier prior to the Duke game previous three Bott AAG a little over six points per game and 6 and a half rebounds yeah hes in double figures look how it comes into the lane here and just drops it off but you saw botts hands ready I cant tell you guys how many times you see bigs in the NBA and in Kos their hands are down theyre not actively ready but Bop gave him a Target johy Wiggins good stretch forth and shoot the balls into the lineup for Clemson hes number 21 the Tigers desperately need a Applause basket hes Hunter great car pressure by RJ d way Hall taking Bon inside uses the left hand and now PJ Hall will have a chance for a threepoint play you talk about matching the physicality of Bott down low Hall doesnt mind battling down low pounding back and forth but also going to the perimeter finishing through the contact with the left hand one of the best players not only in ACC but in the country and PJ allall second only to RJ davidon scoring in the ACC Bott has 10 and if PJ can make this free throw hell have nine he is an 82 free throw shooter on the season its obvious though for North Carolina pound the ball down low when Hall is in the game try to get him in foul trouble and vice versally if youre PJ Hall take the ball down low on the Block keep running pick and roll make Armando Bott work defensively which hopefully tires his legs out on offensive end B has nine Clemson stems to tide for the moment the lead is eight look at those numbers in nearly going both guys have shown up they get it inside on that zone and Bott kicks it back out rattles out on Cor M Bryan and jayen Washington just ended the game for North Carolina and Wiggins tied up Carolina shooting around 35 Point 7 from the threepoint line and carach Ryan was able to knock down a couple of versus Duke but hes one of the critical keys to this team potentially winning a championship keeping the defense honest with his outside threepoint shooting bad defense Applause there Johnson wiggin will called for that last foul and hes out of the game the ball went off for PJ Hall out of bounds itll stay with the Tar Heels ma moic the transfer from Brown will inbounded getting little extended playing time in the first half with the absence of Seth tremble tonight knocked out of bounds by Hunter still six on the shot clock well North Carolina taking care of the basketball as well had double digit turnovers in both the Florida State game and the Georgia Tech game at the half but versus Duke 17 assists five turnovers they take care of the ball theyre a dangerous team in transition RJ thought he got hit on that one but it went behind the end you had a look at Brad branell still daing the quarter zip Hubert Davis meanwhile is up his game and is back in the sport Co this season were glad to see that soon well get the suit and if we can get everybody out of sneakers the grownup FES my job here will be complete you cant help yourself can you I cant Here Comes cor M Bryan Bott has hul deep and thatll be an easy one Armond Bott has North Carolinas last 10 points he is carrying them and keeping them in the game DJ Hall complain to the referee you dont meet him early he gets too deep on the Block Hall bucket his third triple on the night and hes got a dozen I mean what a blast between Titans down low you must be feeling pretty good about spotlighting that matchup right off the top of the the match up that was the right one and he lived up to billing so far in the first nine minutes heres RJ Davis Ryan trying to find the range what a rebound how about Jack Clark the NC State transfer coming in and skying for that rebound Hunter pull up kick to the corner to Josh Beetle whos in and beetle is buffed as he goes along the Baseline and Pat Adams calls the foul beet was going so who wore it best got the window page you got the Plaid all in a little bit of baby blue Huberts going with a full button down tonight rather than the polo thats an upgrade wheres the tie the god the 18 and4 record in number one seed according to Joe andard but in the four losses its been a common theme and one that at least is starting out that way tonight Jay will yeah and thats what Clemson is doing right now on Pace obviously for 80 points in tonights matchup opponents field goal percentage theyre shooting 52 from the field theyre shooting 50 from the threepoint line and theres no rebounding margin for North Carolina theyre actually losing the rebounding battle minus one I think the tempo of this game has to pick up for the tar Hills and they have to find a way to get r J Davis going didnt really become a PR I mean off night against Duke 17 points first class problems in a win but at the same time he is a temple creator with the way he can hunt his shot in transition last month when these two teams played no one scored a fast break point and we havent had one yet tonight Clemson up against the shot clock dodre had to put it up quickly he doesnt Pon roic will push it up the floor once again great job by clinson four jerseys getting back to the paint and protecting the rim has missed his first five the accs leading score roic the Lefty hey knocks down a three just a second made field goal for North Carolina by anyone not named Armando Bott Gerard DJ Hall might have gotten a little shove in the back Carolina gets away with it roic taking advantage of his minutes hes on the drive and loses it and hell be fouled by Gerard roic is bringing the energy that North Carolina needed at the beginning of this game just sticking his nose in there amongst The Bigs him and RJ Davis to grab that rebound those are the 5050 balls that you must get and wck is bringing that tenacity hitting a three getting a defensive rebound then pushing the ball transition and getting a foul 15 foul on Clemson the last one called against Gerard Kad will inbound the ball cheffin has returned hes guarding Ingram Ingram turns it over Le a lot of times we talk about The Hangover effect being on the players its also on the crowd as well you know you came off a game like that where the energy is hitting decimal levels Ks basketball scenes havent really heard before its important for the players to get the crowd in the game also coming up next well take you to Foster Pavilion and wo pop Isaac and number 23 Texas Tech against a sensational freshman jacobe Walter and number 13 Bor who willll see against Kansas Allen field house on Saturday and Joe Gerard knocks down another one hes got an Eden Clemson its up 26177 very different game than climpson shooting one of 18 from the threepoint line what they did last time these two teams met would hit one couldnt get that one here com the Applause tigers that bar strong and he got hit by Jaylen Withers hes checked into the game transfer from l i I beg your pardon that foul was called I thought Withers got him but it was Jaylen Washington foul one you know everybody wants to be a fast Speedy point guard if you notice Joseph Gerard every time hes taking the ball down the court in transition he not blow by speed hes moving at his own speed but his head is always up and hes really good at changing angles and forcing the defense to communicate hes the one that allowed Clark to actually come down on the right side for that drive at The Rim to get the foul basketball IQ is off the Char Bart makes both free throws he had the final shot of the game against Virginia on Saturday and just missed at what would have been the game winning bucket in the onepoint loss the tiger seven to the suddenly redot Cavaliers man they put it on Miami Last Harrison ing rattles out Clark has done a good job on the board Wards Gerard constantly moving shot fake and a sweet touch and Joseph Gerard has 10 roic beats everybody down and shein blocks him I believe they call him for a foul Im just trying to tell you its that old man at the park that just knows how to play utilizes ball fakes you know uses his eyes uses hesitation moves changes angles understands how to play this game just that ball fake I mean look at that January 6 one of 10 for Five Points so far in this game 10 points four of six from the field think he knows how to play or what he is a a crafty guy you know hes got an emotional game coming up this weekend too when Clemson goes to Syracuse where he spent his career up until this year misses the first well have womens basketball match up for the night between a couple of ACC Powers Thursday night 600 Eastern Time number 12 Notre Dame against 15 Frank Lille thats 600 eastern time Thursday Prime Time womens basketball this league has a number of teams that will make noise in the Womens Championship come March ACC with the most ranked teams in the country and womens college basketball is going to set up for a great ACC tournament and Mar mens Gerard curling looking for a little help there was a mismatch down low they clear it out Bott trying to stay in front of Gerard fph steps back good job by arm Applause bacocky it to him nice pass from K but now Hall gets bot well under the basket Ingram Cuts nicely but couldnt quite handled the pass shot clocked inside 15 heres kdo Bott gives him another chance Armondo goes back up lot of contact there and Wiggins who theyve been imploring to rebound harder gets it and going to the bucket is Dylan Hunter Chas his little brother and call a foul Clemson is come in with an attitude bucket is counting and Dylan Hunter making his presence fell Music thoughts Martin against Duke in 1970 Charles Scott was one heck of a basketball player speaking of root saying went to D DWI Clinton in the Brock same school as Tomy archal and as you said re Its a Sky Airman and what he went through obviously in the history of this country and also Rd you know I dont believe black history should be one month it should be every month we dont have white history its how do we celebrate culture all the time in our country thats what were so great at doing constant appreciation our J Davis and couldnt agree more Jan will should be a unifying thing that we celebrate all of the contributions that have been and RJ Davis knocking down his first bucket of the night the one thing you you dont want is just because Armando Bott is being aggressive and youre making it a priority to throw the ball into the block dont want RJ Davis to diminish his aggressiveness he still needs to be a guy in consideration for ACC Player of the Year and National player of the year hes that talented thats the first turnover of the night for Clemson and through aggression RJ almost gave it back to him by getting a hand on it Kad davidon Ryan just one of 13 from the floor in fact Elliot Kad hes a terrific passer ball handler and leader still finding his way on the perimeter hes looking for his first threepoint basket this Cal year but also those two combined have one assist so Clemsons been doing a great job taking them out of transition and also having active hands not opening up those passing GS to get easy points in transition GAC still cant find the range the match up they switch you got that match up down low EJ Hall DJ Davis had no chance 14 for the tiger big man and the lead is 13 one of the things you didnt see duu when North Carolina switched on Philip hsky he just spent his time roaming on the perimeter instead of going down low and musing up like PJ hard call a gold bucket will count forau thats his first by thats right here like thats the match up just taking him down low on the Block and just going hard at The Music Rim well PJ has really showed up tonight in this first half and gotten Clemson off to a centilating start 11point lead tigers have the ball Dylan Hunter DJ Hall Rises up thats a tough shot he tries to follow his own C comes out for the Tar Heels good pass to Bott whos going in and all almost a chance for yet another threepoint play for arando but hell go back to the free throw line where hes already made four tonight talk about posting up down low Amando Bott recognizing some of the mismatches and going right at it being aggressive on the Block and vice versa this is the skill set of PJ Hall he can do it on the outside and in the inside it talk about a guy that can be utilized in pick and pop can space the defense can really take his game to the next level Applause Music one of the things Reese that has been so impressive about Armando is his conditioning is better this year than what has been in years prior obviously versus Duke there was a long stretch in the first half where there wasnt a TV timeout called and he was wind it but I felt like he would have been forced to come out of the game before now hes a guy that can sustain playing through multiple minutes on the court at a pretty high Pace both defensively and offensively in no drop off also a much improved free throw shooter as Carolina crowd which was fought the traffic outside and made their way inside the Dean Smith Center trying to Rally the defensive troops Pat Applause Adams calls the Applause foul I think it was a timeout called was there a foul Music or ellot kadoo I believe was called for the foul theyre discussing some things there 510 left in the first half over North Carolina ellot Kau just absolutely got hosed here guys I mean this is the offensive foul on Hunter first off thats a push off and as Hunter comes off he got CAU for that foul there was barely any contact on that always catch the second guy J not when the second guy doesnt doing anything Rd and now theres a little frustration coming in I mean typically you get those calls when youre at home to work in your advantage not to your disadvantage second foul on Cormac Ryan thats not a foul there either ni let him play officiating crew CL Armstrong Doug surm and Pat Adams perhaps responding to that push and not wanting things to get away now theyve all of a sudden really tightened it up they just called a foul on RJ Davis thats his first now the only thing I would say about that play in particular RJ Davis had his hands all he was pressing up in him his hands all over him but still this is the level of physicality that we had in the Duke Carolina game they were allowed to play this way so if the refs arent allowing you to play this way I get it the fans are booing the veteran team you have to adjust to the way the refs are calling the game and Veteran teams both of these are just that these are two of the older teams from college basketball as Gerard will go to the free throw line Zaden High number one crushman from San Antonio is checked in from North Carolina weve had three fouls called in the last nine seconds the officials wanting to make sure they get control of the festivities here maybe hes getting a getting a little physical my thing is if youre going to make those calls do that at the beginning beginning of the game so at least I know how to play Dont Change Up the way that you call the game were 5 minutes left to go in the first half Gerard has a dozen Hall has 14 and Clemson has a double digit lead on the road in Chapel Applause Hill shot cl to five Hunter all over RJ Davis and Gerard comes away with the rebound and Gerard has his pocket pick nicely as high makes a good defensive play O thought about it now Carolina will swing it wide open in the corn high five for the rebound and Wiggins comes out with another one even Wiggins dad has been encouraging him to be a better rebounder 610 and a half we know he can shoot get on the glass he has had a couple of big ones in the early going tonight as Chase Hunter drains to three and the lead is Applause 14 clinson is taking it right to North Carolina they aggressive offensively the gang rebounding defensively keeping Carolina off the glass for Second Chance opportunities and theyre completely taking North Carolina out of transition zero transition points for the tar Hills this point didnt have any in Clemson in the first meeting either RJ misses again do tried to come out with the rebound he didnt lose ball as Gerard every loose ball seemed to be going the Tigers way Bron almost stumbled able to get rid of it to Gerard before traveling heres Joe Gerard no good RJ Davis and hes going to be fouled RJ Godfrey well they say defense wins champion ionships and defense will find a way to deem the winner of this game tonight Chase Hunter doing a great job contesting there on RJ Davis and then vice versa RJ giving it right back Seth does this to me every single time you know its its the game before the game then its the game after the game and look I Ill give it to Seth I mean he hes absolutely right we got a chance to call the Georgia Tech game North Carolina tiptoed into that game they werent the aggressor they lost they played against Duke they were the aggressor they won and so far in this game they tip to into this game and Clemson has been able to come in and be that aggressive team off the bat and hence while they have a double digit lead but another factor to this Jay will is I know you look at Clemsons record and you see how North Carolina played on Saturday night this is a tiger team that started the season 11 and one AR off the side of the glass with wins over Alabama South Carolina and TC in their recent games a threepoint loss at home thats a tough shot by Harrison Ingram the Georgia attack and double overtime controversial call at Duke that cost him a onepoint loss and then they had a shot to win the game by this man Jack Clark against Virginia didnt go in then does go in now as Clemson has its biggest lead so this is this is a team that is in all likelihood for you make the NCAA tournament goard has him as an eight seed right now and they really started well they just put a little bit of a tough patch but a talented veteran team that has shown up to play tonight somebody from North Carolina to hit a three sooner or later hting high with the tip all coming in off the bench freshman got the steel now tip in the one thing you cant control of your North Carolina is your defensive intensity and the way you attack the glass you prioritize throwing the ball down low just cuz youre missing shots get offensive rebound that is just a shame that shot didnt go in because that was in pass from Clark find PJ Hall as RJ Davis has it roll off and see who the foul is going to be on on PJ Hall PJ Hall thats his second PJ fouled out of the first meeting I dont think he liked that one much you know sometimes when you play so fast you lose a little bit of the psyche of the advantage of keep attacking PJ Hall PJ Hall is the second leading scorer in the ACC he obviously has physical frame to bang against Armando bot prioritizing throwing the ball down low and getting him in foul trouble creates a major advantage for the targos sheflin has missed an extended period theyve been able to keep him on the bench with two fouls and now for the last 98 seconds PJ Hall goes to the bench and high Mo the free throw but mentioned early one well you know really Clemson and North Carolina have split the last two meetings in Chapel Hill those previous 59 were a big problem for the Tigers 0 for 59 Brad said Brad coach was saying sometimes he walks around there was an older gentleman saying will you ever beat North Carolina will happened before I transition he said guys before they win in 2020 that older folks would say look before I move on to the next life I really want to see it wow got a chance to see another one that was a strong move from chony Wiggins a sophomore from Grayson Georgia 15point lead as we head toward the one minute Mark to play here in the first half Clon just putting in a ton of ball stains keeping him on the perimeter leaving that inside pocket to go to work see RJ Davis making a tough three that is six for RJ inside a minute to go and North Carolina cuts it to 12 the too crowd urges their team to finish the half strong if Clemson can keep its Poise thats the guy to do it Joseph Gerard Wiggins can make that rattles out on him North Carolina gets a shot Applause quickly might have a two for one opportunity Davis through his legs finds an opening room and he knocks down the three now the tigers can hold for the last Applause shot KES Hunter thats no good haon roic will get a long one off and thats how well go to the half North Carolina finishes with a bit of a FY but its still the largest perer this game to an heres the play I love most a Miss shot but look he continues to execute The Scouting Report stays up on wiic and doesnt allow North Carolina to get in transition those small details have been everything that Clemson has been better at than North Carolina thus in this game second half underway Clemson only got 8 minutes in change from Ian chefin he did have five rebounds in that he went 16 and 11 in the first meeting between these two and still were able to control the half excellent defense by Jack Clark on could Joseph Gerard was outstanding in the first half he had a dozen Elliot could was minus 16 in the first half 9 minutes minus 16 with zero assist PJ hall right over the top of Harrison Ingram and it rolled out on him bov is terrific in the first half lets see if the tars can get him started here in the second second Davis finds him dont you very much assist typically when Carolina gets out in transition OT CAU is really good at kicking the ball ahead but I think theyre going to need more of RJ Davis probing the court with the ball especially the more they get into the half Applause court PA at 14 in the first half he goes right to work uses the hook shot for the second time here in the second half PJ cant quite get it to drop Davis T up thats one fly its no good he said he got hit looked like solid defense to me thats a really tough shot in transition when its two on four I pace of the game Applause though PJ Hall has played well and shot it well from outside hes got got 17 points and that is his fourth triple of the game and the lead is back to T PJ is a pro man hes going to be on the next level he continues to shoot the ball like that at that consistency of a clip take the ball inside and out and just does a great job banging on the glass see Armando Bott just by being active got PJ Hall his third foul on the blockout but RJ is so good want talk about probing right probing forcing that defense to come from the weak side Gerard cant get down that de those are the type of plays youre going to have to see from RJ Davis to kind of get them going especially if theyre forced to execute in the half court that foul Jay will was called on Hall its his third and Brad Brownell taking him out sending RJ Godfrey back into the game can for from to get forth but they also have to be cognizant of how quickly they can get him back on the floor Che double team that LE Ingram Music Ingram has eight lunson trying to withstand this early second half push how about Hunter just working on kdo but kdo forced the air ball Ingram wow Bott and hes fouled by Clark Clemson wasnt doubling Armando Bott in the first half the double comes over and Harrison Ingram just sat right there shefin turned his back to him and thats easy money I mean youre youre talking about a pass being delivered to the best Swiss army knife in college basketball Seth Greenberg my counterpart in studio has always called him a Draymond Green I think hes more of a Ron ESS and Im talking about lets predate The Meta World piece lets talk about Queensbridge Ron ESS bring it back to the city now can defend one through five had a spot up shot can knock down shots from the outside hes a better shooter in Ingram but I just love the mentality of the way he plays Ron Ron came at you 247 365 he did not care who you were he had his own swag and that is who Harrison Ingram is on his team he has been vitally important and hes taken so much of the rebounding load off of Bott whos made all eight of his free throws tonight he has 18 and the crowd at the Smith Center is alive trying to shake off that slow start a long mountain to climb Clemson jumped out 152 and is Led through out love the pressure that RJ Davis is putting on Jal right now force him to speed up just feel the tempo of this game changing shot clock to five Godfrey is it knocked Away by bacock the good hands Godfrey gets it back shot P still up against it Hunter has to force one its no good I dont think he got that off they run him playing now everybodys flying a lot of contact and thatll separate him on the floor see what Pat Adams Applause has the foul was called on Jack CLK who picked up a couple of fouls moment ago shot clock right see if he gets it off yeah just barely got got of it barely got it off but still look at the Active hands look at the way RJ Davis picked up the r the full length of the Court thats not the same team we saw in the first half Carolina down Applause five they working on CL and goes by and now it missed it and Godfrey and bacon are fighting for the rebound heres the whistle inside and the foul will be called on Armando Bott thats his second half dozen college basketball games highlight to schedu Saturday college game day in Kansas thats a featured matchup J Ox coming off that overtime loss at K State last night hosting Baylor the Big 12 Sonic Blockbuster you can always watch it on the app you happen to be out and about K per was absolutely balling last night for Kansas State how about some of those shots especially that one spinning ball shein goes over INR I dont think you realized where the basketball was and I shefin will have a chance for a threepoint play and Clemson needed that to sort of settle things down yeah at least just like Harrison Ingram got lost on the ball fake here couldnt really find it didnt know if the shot was going up or if it was passed and shefflin the recipient with the big time man Music one I think this guy might be the most improved player in the ACC averaging almost a double double hes the only player in the ACC had these numbers with two or more assists and in addition to the 16 and 11 he had in the game against North Carolina in the first meeting he also had five blocks and four steals I mean he has the baby face he is a Jackie Moon hair I mean it is incredible I tell for a guy who shoots 56 from the threepoint line they need him to start shooting the ball more only 19 threepoint attempts on the year but his chop ability can open things up for PJ Hall as well you Davis is saying today hes the quintessential guy that you look at Gerard as one rattle out shefin was fighting for it you look at shefin you think well I can bust him up and hes said nope no you cant not him I mean he is consistently when Clemson tracks his PPS dat the guy who works the hardest jumps the highest goes the longest but the guy who scores the most for North Carolina this year has been RJ Davis hes got nine all on three Applause balls Gody thought about it now hell get it into chevin chevin is just ripped away by Ingram extra pass to Ryan gets shefin in the air corack midside the ark and hes finally got his first field goal a timeout here as the tar Hills have closed to within Applause three how about a couple of Stanford transfers getting it done for the heels Ingram with great hands push the ball transition great extra swing pass here by RJ and what a bucket by Ryan to close it out PJs got three fouls and Brad Brownell leaving him on the bench since he went to the bench with that third foul its been a 103 North Carolina run about 17 points hes hit 4 3 pointers tonight shot clocks inside 10 cheffin over the top of cor M Ryan R only around 63 and a half 64 sheflin a guy whos 68 RJ Davis has another one hes got a dozen and Clemson did such a good job of that in the first half transition defense and transition defense even applies to after a ma shot North Carolina one of the best in the country one of the fastest Paces at pushing the tempo after a May bucket RJ Godfrey got the offensive rebound and fed cheffin hell go to the free throw line for a couple thats a third foul on Armando Bott Bott and PJ Hall each with three fouls twopoint game in Chapel Applause thrill its been so long since Ive seen you you guys should come up getting transition threes or those lagging people being able to drive to the rim and that last three ball just left RJ Davis 4 point short of time Michael Jordan for 15th on North Carolinas alltime scoring list I mean think about not that ar your name is next to your name is about the pass Michael Jordan the greatest player to ever live whoever Dawn the Earth RJ Davis is going to pass him this evening about our buddy Joel Barry sitting they going on this graphic sorry JB you Joels my guy just if youre talking about MJ youre talking about the goat thats nine points now for Chef ly missed about 12 minutes of the first half with a couple of fouls and now theyre leaving PJ Hall on the bench with three Washington into the game three rattles out here comes Joseph Gerard we talk about PJ Hall being on the bench are do you and I were arguing going to break about when we decide to bring him back I said the under eight you think sooner I think sooner I mean now look if you can get a basket here and continue to hold the lead but Carolina went on a run as soon as he went to the bench in the second half sha went for three Washington with a good box out on Wiggins marel with the ball down four headed toward the 13minute Mark Davis pops open Hunter trying to force him under the basket and RJ Davis now just two behind Michael Jordan hes got 14 two behind Jordan two behind Clemson Chase Hunter just fell sleep there defensively nice little back Cup by RJ I love when little guys get down low on the Block and post up how about when L guys knock down threes Joseph Gerard has 15 tonight thats what a veteran does answer the charge always moving at his own Applause speed how about Davis splitting and Jack Clark just Clos lined RJ in there I dont know have to review that thats three on Jack Park who got his fourth start of the Season Music tonight oh no the chest this how he fell back his Music rfl but did you see the split it was it was it was nice you try to tell your big stay attached to the guy setting the screen so he cant split D Hunter is checked in Chase Hunter is brothers gone to the bench graad Brown L try to get him a rest until the Under 12 meeting time out great CAU from Paxon roic whos delivered Some solid minutes tonight hes got six and again Carolina back to within three roics giving him a lot of energy what a hard basket now look from the outside thats no good there the Under 12 and PJ Hall is standing but not headed to the scorer table Applause yet l g Clark Washington was open for a minute couldnt get it to it botts also on the side RJ Davis no good another rebound for Applause sheff its all about execution right now for Clemson Clark Fades away couldnt get it to go and Dylan Hunter tracks down the loose ball shot clock resets to 20 for the Tigers as brown L directs Applause traffic gard and corack Ryan they went at it back in their Syracuse and not Dame days heres Clark for three thats no good sheins fighting for for it and Gerard gets it a step in three no after two bounces on the rim and here comes RJ Applause Davis great job by sheon keeping that one alive sheon got an open look but still you want to try to utilize the clock and run a set loic was driving and hes fouled on his way to the basket Under 12 media timeout second foul called on Gerard two points short of Jordan and perhaps more pressing at the moment three points short of Clemson with 1046 to Music play dick byal and the entire V foundation for cancer research have had remarkable work that dick has done we certainly wish him the best its Super C sensation and Sensational Mond Bott who has been all of those things when hes been on the floor has returned with three fouls and so too is PJ hall both playing with three both have been outstanding tonight see you forecast now do so got PJ Hall got a ro makes one of two Carolina showing some back court pressure Paul didnt like wanted Wiggins to throw the ball back to Hunter on the other side it work of disgust for the youngster you see the conf contr that North Carolinas had since PJ picked up his third foul early in the second half well thats why PJ gave Wiggins the look we just came out of a timeout lets run the play that our coach has called the atto after a timeout okay so lets run the set which had Hall going into the bucket to get a foul foul is on RJ Davis just his second Clemsons biggest lead tonight J Will was 16 North Carolina has never LED last TI 22 thats 18 for BJ Hall North Carolina has been able to get a lot of things in transition and secondhand transition and whats going to be critical for Clemson if they can continue to slow down the pace of the game is their ability to execute in the half court that will require PJ Hall to stay out of foul trouble because he is the focal point of their offense Sho better than 80 from the line makes him both he has 19 the lead is four Clinton going zone now theyve shown a good bit of this tonight typically Brad Brown L has been a manand man guy but the Zone has been effective tonight against the heels Jo Gerards not on the floor right now but certainly he knows how to execute the Zone stays in Syracuse by way those are those are winning plays for cson defensively I know RJ Davis can score but getting him to have a high dosage of shots off the dribble from outside the AR those are tough shots got back H from shein in the pass from PJ Hall sheins into double figures with 11 Bott goes right to work on shein and Hall comes in to clean it away oh Seely got a handle that he got a hand on that he got a he got a block seeing one in the ball down low thats who PJ Hall is and what a great basket cut there by shefin and then even on the defensive end shefin got a block on that but with bot his foul was on woic so Clemson has been able to turn back every North Carolina charge they havent wilted a single time they pushed the lead back out to six inside 10 minutes to go Tigers trying to win for just the second time ever in Chapel Hill Pauls been hot from three not this time chevin bot fighting for it Ingram pulls it away here come the Tar Heels Davis by shefin the pull up wont go and shefflin gets the rebound thats eight boards now for the Energizer for this tiger team hunter from just inside the AR thats no good Hall gets the offensive board and keeps it free and Dylan Hunter has it now Wiggins for three and he rattles it in the lead is back to nine and and Harrison Ingram is down you got on the play the officials sending out the North Carolina training staff to have a look at it now Harrison I think it was just Charlie I certainly hope so hes hes been so important in all facets for the heels look like their legs just collided he and PJ Hall as they were fighting for that ball theyre still looking after Ingram willll check on his status good to see that theyre going to help him up it appears right now cson up 6354 Foster Pavilion pop Isaacs Texas Tech top 25 team taking on Baylor ranked 13th in the nation but what a week for Baylor theyve got this one tonight they go to Kansas on Saturday college game day will be there and those guys in the Big 12 will have a lot to live up to have as much fun as weve had here tonight Clemson has gone on a 7 nothing spurk since North Carolina which hasnt LED tonight closed within two smart by Brad Barnell that put Wiggins at the top of the Zone since hes 6869 using that wingspan contest shots on RJ RJ Davis over PJ Hall what a tough shot hes got 16 I dont know if you could play any better defense than what PJ Hall just did in RJ dibs and that bucket ties him with Michael Jordan for 15th on the alltime scoring list PJ Hall Fires for three we have Jaylen Withers is checked in with Harrison Ingram being attended to it looked as if they were working on both legs as if perhaps he was cramping in both legs the car Hill stand out and now Withers the veteran and transfer from the Louisville in the game too long Davis and it leaves him with Bott hes not likely to shoot it from there but he will from Applause there Armandos got 20 to heels back to within five Here Comes The Applause Crow Chase Hunter rolls off and guess who this guy just never stopped working Ian sheflin with an offensive rebound fresh shot clock Gerard knocks down a three Joseph Gerard has 18 what a pass bot and a foul on sheerin and a chance for another threepoint play for Armando bad who took one right in the kisser I mean what an exchange of plays Joseph Gerard with a dagger of a three I mean what a great offensive rebound by sheflin sets the screen here just a minute where Kack Ryan has his hands down is enough for Gerard to see that I mean just the Savvy veteran presence of Gerard in the court and then Bott with a strong and one opportunity after being slapped across the face Bott had 25 against Duke Saturday night now shooting for his 23rd and he got it all right this one you see North Carolina press up really try to speed up the tempo of this game lets go over the top to gerardi talk about letting it Fly just because you can go doesnt mean that you should Applause go look at the performances from Bott and PJ Hall we highlighted those two guys right off the top of the telecast and they have more than to deliver shot clock at five heres Chase Hunter rolls off oh with the put back you heard the fan correctly behind me telling Armando bot to block out they you got to put a body on a guy like PJ Hall you cant out jump him RJ Davis draws the foul I really want to show you guys this play PJ Hall is so active on the boards youre going to see the sh go watch Bott hes not boxing anybody out hes standing there watching the fly the ball you have to put a body on a guy like PJ Hall to keep him off the offensive Applause glass especially a guy who probably a little bit longer more explosive and with that free throw RJ Davis just passed Michael Jordan on North Carolinas all time SC hes got 17 tonight its an incredible feat but Ill tell you right now from KN and RJ doesnt mean anything unless they win this game Davis one out of two still a Sixpoint lead for Clemson his week lined inside 6 and A2 to go in Chapel Hill all fumbled it didnt get a real clean look at it Elliot Kad on the run one on two Koo all the way and a chance for a threepoint play you talk about the seiling the peak for where Elliot kadoo could be as a player look how explosive he is cradling protecting the ball hes only played six minutes in this second half and this has been a season of highs and lows but when hes on the floor his defensive intensity and his explosiveness off the dribble getting to the rack are his strong strengths he classified to come in and hes fit in beautifully with RJ Davis of course no set tremble tonight so more has been on kdo and on Paxton wji whos come off the bench threepoint Applause game jayen Washington applying pressure to shley hand off to Hunter shot clocks to five shefin going to work on Washington and Ian Chef had a chance for a threepoint play and look at his showing the flex jacked anyway I mean you talk look at the finish with the left hand if youre worried about not being as athletic as your opponent look at the left hand with the English off the glass he talk about Jackie Moon swager what come on this dude is a terrific athlete was a high school quarterback said he missed the games but not the practices and he liked being inside to play basketball cant finish the threepoint play but a big bucket there keeps the Clemson lead at five nice slit pass now corack Ryan has a look every North Carolina fan is waiting for cormack Ryan to knock down three at a high C Cormac is 0 for six from behind the arc tonight Hunter shakes free now slips it to hall Hall will shoot the short jumper rattles out Davis on the push botts got it inside and its an offensive foul and Armondo bot and thats four it would not have been an offensive foul if he did not extend that arm if he just kept his shoulder down not extend the arm it would have been a no call but that extension right there thats an all day he what a play by PJ Hall to put his body on the line and get that offensive foul Hall himself has had some foul trouble tonight playing with three but a standout defensive play there heres Gerard whos made a ton of big baskets tonight backing down K now hall for three DJ left that one well short Kad on the push RJ Davis working on Chase Hunter oh with the block they got the ti no jayon Washington has it Gerard ties him up thats a foul and theyre going to call him for a foul well is called on Joseph Gerard thats his third what fight by North Carolina to stay on the offensive blast and remember Jaylen Washington hes played well sticking in there as har Harrison Ingram who just returned to the bench as it been instance apparently based on the way they were working on him dealing with some cramps now Washington is going to be shooting a one and one its a 62 free throw shooter makes the first North Carolina women highlighting ACC Network womens basketball double header Notre

refs have to make the call a late late foul on Tobacco Road brings back some bad memories wow for Clon and for the first time since it was 22 were tied now without Bott in the game look for a high dosage of PJ Hall on the Block well they had the youngster James aono into the game for the first time tonight and he through the foul itll be a little out of body experience it kind of cleanses the soul a little bit you know you had a rough game the other day against Kansas didnt rebound the ball like you wanted to gave up too many open shots you cleanse the soul you get tossed you give your son chance to kind of finish out the game Lifes good in Houston double teas hes ejected but the Cougars up big metime pop Isaacs in Texas Tech trying to snap a two game skin po po is so good at the end of

remember you know Clemson has had a lot of tough losses a onepoint loss to Duke a a onepoint loss to UVA a threepoint loss in double overtime to Georgia Tech the biggest thing they have to do is believe they can win a close game and execute down the stretch Hall offensive rebound and PJ Hall a chance for a threepoint Applause Play heres what you love about PJ Hall so many times we see big men do this they get offensive rebounds and they bring the ball down look how he he kind of keeps the ball high to a degree and Powers through a grown man basketball boy he is played his backside off

shot clock still at 12 will reset Face Hunter to hall Hall lets it Fly front rim no good and Kido Has It taros On the Run cut off by Hunter is Davis now back out to kdo Ingram who hit a three to tie at moments ago Bop playing with four the J Davis and get it to go last Touch by North Music Carolina it is worth mentioning it has been a city of Horrors for Clemson historically one and 60 in North Carolinas house the only Victory coming in 2020 under Brad Brownell now the tigers with just over two minutes to play in a twopoint lead Gerard for three Joseph Gerard now as Applause 21 boy Clemson has shown some real toughness answering charge after charge now trying to hold on Ingram left this game for several minutes the parent cramps almost threw it away and then Jaylen Washington does throw it in the back court and itll be a turnover and Clemson will have the ball sixth turnover of the night for Hubert Daviss team well look here RJ he tries he takes the shortcut dont take the shortcut its okay if you lose just follow him and chase him over under that screen just chase you know when players try to take a shortcut jod is so good at recognizing that he bounces back and thats how he hits a Applause three easy to get caught up on that big muscle M and now the foul going to be called on Paxton wji thats his second foul and that is double bonus time for Clemson the 10th team foul against North Carolina and thats what teams are going to try to do when codo is on the court theyre going to play off of codo and when you can take North Carolina out of transition Rd their ability to win a championship will ultimately be determined with how they can execute in the half court Jack Clark now five of six from the free throw line this season Jack had to deal with some injuries is just now getting back into the flow Eran player transferred in from NC State gives them depth gives him size down low to bang against the brids from North Carolina and also has a great feel around the basket hes hit all four of his free throw tonight four five coming in and Clemson a thre possession lead up by seven there with thear heel turn for big bucket here RJ Davis has it and a foul outside on Chase Hunter thats three on him the last thing you want to do right now if your Clemson is a Tic Tac fou and stop the clock allow North Carolina and a 90 plus free throw shooter to go to the line and knock down to got to make the clock your friend not your enemy RJ surprisingly is having some struggles at the free throw line tonight this free throws cost North Carolina the Georgia Tech game that you and I saw last week Davis gets it back to a six with 90 seconds to play fivepoint lead Carolina with pressure in the back court and theres PJ Hall open theyll get it across easily to park and hell take his time and a Chase Hunter run it all right shock theres some North Carolina fans right now that are leaving the stadium and the game is not over its nowhere close to being open you saw that traic coming in here Jo Gerard tough shot shefin fighting for the rebound theres a whistle inside and sheins hard work is going to be rewarded as he is fouled and thats Harrison Ingram its called for the foul his second just Che just just working he is is working two shots two two and hes the aggressive this dude has another double double his second in two games this season against North Carolina but missed free throw there Clemson has missed some big ones of late could have stretched out the this lead now eight of 12 in the second half lead is six chefin has 12 points here in the second half RJ Davis turns the corner get pass Hunter and a lost his balance as Hunter was trying to avoid the foul and Clemson has it inside a minute to go up by Applause six Hunter holding again almost trapped ch finds hall Hall back to chefin and is knocked Away by Cormac Ryan shot clocks at 13 still be Clemson basketball and shefflin is just everywhere on the court hes making himself available one of two players in the country averaging nine points in n and a half rebounds and two assists per game only one in the ACC hes been outstanding in the second half big reason that Clemsons been able to fight off thus far every Tar Heel push North Car shot clock inside five Clemsons got to let one fly wuk has the rebound for North Carolina corac Bryan trying to get past jard pmat gets it up quickly it rolls out man its he had a tough night bot fighting for it a whistle Applause underneath Clarence Armstrongs going to call the foul on PJ Hall thats number four on the tiger star Back Against The Wall have lost several games in a row by a combined Five Points over the last three games and Clemson has came in here has executed and fought North Carolina every possession free throw is no good 23 for Armondo and North Carolinas going to need some Tar Heel magic down the stretch or Clemson is going to be so euphoric even Tyler from Spartanburg is going to celebrate the second win in Chapel Hill all time if they can hang on for 236 seconds a fivepoint lead for Brad Brown Els team he mentioned this earlier this is a really good team Jay wil hit a little bit of a snake bitten stretch probably didnt play their best basketball about a month ago a threegame losing streak all by double figures in Middle one was against North Carolina but of late tough loss to d a tough loss to Virginia one against Georgia Tech at home you cant let get away in double overtime but this is a team that scheduled aggressively their Nets in the top 40 and now this could be a resounding win for their resume for the rest of the way I heard PJ Hall talk after the UVA game in which they lost and his biggest thing that they kept hitting Omar is we had to keep chopping wood and when you hear that thats a sign of a veteran that stands were going to take were going to take our lumps in the ACC you know its one of the best conferences there is in the nation and were playing against good teams not in that out but you have to take ownership of that Rd theyre in all these games how they execute down the stretch ultimately determine whether they won or lost those games they lost but today you felt like youre watching a different Clemson team you and I talk about pregame when youre in those games as Clemson do you believe that youre going to win or do you believe that something inevitably will go wrong again and this is the Clon team that has been EX shoting and have been fighting defensively and they put themselves in the position to win up five with 236 seconds left to go you know there are certain things that Sports casters bring up that no one really thinks about the 1 and 60 Mark in Chapel Hill is something that Clemson fans think about its something that their coaches and players have heard about and when the heels made that charge tonight or made numerous charges here in the second half could have done exactly what youre talking about and say okay how are we going to let this one get away and they dont have it salted away yet still 236 to go North Carolina putting on the heat former High School quarterback shein has charged with getting it in bounds that was almost a turnover we dont want to run us not it out of B you dont want to run to the corners of the Court you want to catch the ball somewhat in in between both lanes oh that that that that that looks like thats going to be North Carolina ball theyre going to go have a look at at it pat Adams over at the monitor now Im part beg your Parton Pat Adams headed to the monitor to join Clarence Armstrong theyre going to look see if they have enough video evidence to overturn that lets have another look here is his hand is the last on the ball right there he it hits it I think thats Clemson basketball it doesnt look conclusive theyre still looking at the videos we check in with the studio and REE we want to let you know that Texas Tech Baylor is underway right now over on ESPN news both teams start theight just a half game back of Houston at top the Big 12 Texas Tech Baylor coming up after we finish up in Chapel Music Hill Kevin thank Music you youre right comes the ball they looked at the video and Adams Clarence Armstrong agreeing that yeah but see look at his right hand I mean its not but his right hand the his right hand right there on the right side from the other angle though it looked as if there wasnt contact with the ball once he dislodged Music it now Clemson will try to be a little less adventurous getting it in this time Chef went ahead to Hall theyre going to have to foul tough pass but instead Hall with an Aaron pass thats a poor mistake for a veteran to make now RJ Davis trying to find a little bit of room not much time left inside 5 Seconds now and boy Clemson flirted with disaster with a really inexcusable turnover and I believe theyre going to get out of here and be able to tell about it yeah PJ Hall is smiling right now he just looked at me looked at me and said uh probably shouldnt have pass that one yeah you just hold on to the rock big man you go to the free throw line and now North Carolina faithful after that euphoric Victory against Duke on Saturday night leaving in a much different move its 46 seconds away from the second loss ever to the Clemson Tigers in Chapel Hill you know re one of my best friends is a do Taro fan BR Bon you were talking about this before how does North Carolina handle success and Im sure thats what Hubert ising about over the last couple of days yes the admiration the Adoration is great we beat through but now we have to theres nine more games left in the regular season of ACC our goal is to win a championship how do we bring that intensity every game Hubert was worried about this really in the days after wanted them to recover on Sunday kind of got after his Squad yesterday they were sharp and shoot around today but man did they come out flat or to give credit where credit has been most deservedly earned Clemson came out with his hair on fire and set the tone well Clemson came out and they punched North Carolina in the mouth you saw that by their 152 leads to start the game and Ian shein has been everywhere in this game he just does all the little things and I know that sounds like a coaching cliche to people at home but I cant tell you how imperative it is to win games on the road hes made himself a Target hard basket cuts hes always been cool C and Collective on the Block found different ways to finish not over the top but up underneath people and him and PJ Hall have been the absolute bright spots for Clemson basketball tonight another double double against the Tar Heels almost identical numbers and a lot of those rebounds were crucial ones and now Clemson has won his last two and three games here at Cho Hill how about that wow RJ Davis one in to make it 80 to 76 and now the tigers are two and 60 all time in Chapel Hill
