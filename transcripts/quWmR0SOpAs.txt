scoring team in the league at nearly 88 per game Did not nearly as much thunder especially with all of the injuries which well talk about during the game And the Panthers control the opening tip off This is Demarco Ryan the transfer grad student from Oregon State Their leading scoreer is at least its playing today is Cameron Corinth He wears number two The thing is Tom Pit has seven guys between seven and 12 points a game They dont really have a goto guy but they have guys anybodys capable of a big afternoon And they are without for a second straight game Their leading scoreer Brandon Cummings a 63 sophomore still bothered by a sore ankle That bothered him early in the year when he missed three games and now has reared its head again Wide open look and off the mark cheering Yeah I would think theyre going to play uh Yugato oneonone inside Now hes hes bigger and hes a very good passer inside but they want to cover the perimeter Its a blackout game here at the Pit today They gave away some sweet looking hockey jerseys to everybody who made it And theres a three by Demarco Miner Hes a guy I mean 23 points a season high I mean lets face it everybody for Pit has got to step up and have a career game You tried twice He was looking for a foul under there and didnt get it This is an undersized pit team Theyre big guys Really set back by injuries this year So have to rebound as a unit Theyve got some bruisers though Theyve got some guys thatll get after you with all theyve got You know a lot of people say Hey look you know guys play hard Theyre supposed to play hard But this pit as you look at the starting lineups for today this group has played hard despite the 9 and4 record Yeah And Caleppa is exemplifies that We touched on that on the open Not a shot blocking team but uh theyve got some guys you know very very strongly built I think Coach Arduzi might need a few of these guys come next fall That was an up and down call a travel officially So the turnover by they had 17 of those in their loss against Virginia They also did not shoot it well from the free throw line Coach Cable uh look at the end of the day you go back to the injury to Papa Keante Hes only played in eight games They havent had Deshawn Jackson the entire year They thought he was going to be a huge part of their team and now theyre playing without their leading score as still scoreless in this one Yatollahu will go to the line with a follow Yeah hes a guy that youre almost going to have to give up your body and keep him away from the rim You see the huge size difference inside This is the second possession in a row hes been a factor on the offensive glass and hes just playing right over the top of that front line And you know theres media guide height and then regular height cheering You can hes a legit 71 No doubt about it Made of this 10 bull turkey and pure on the free throw attempt Hes only a sophomore Bright future ahead of him From last year Indiana was able to keep the core of that team together which in this day and age doesnt happen a whole lot and they had a big time recruiting class as well among the tops in the nation Well see a couple of those freshman as the game rolls on Tombs and Germaine ONeal Jr and theres another turnover for the Panthers Stepped out of bounds ran out of uh his sense of the court but you know in talking to Andy Infield hes really locked down or tried to the state of Texas really concentrating on his recruiting efforts uh in state And both of those young men I mentioned Tims and ONeal both played in Texas High School along with Mitchell Holmes red shirt freshman from down the road in Fort Worth Oh that that was a nice pass Pierre laid it off Im not sure you could ever saw that coming No but you know what When youre a big guy like that and you see a guy your player driving youve got to have your hands ready and its and then once the balls up in the rim then you worry about the offensive rebound Hes Mike Chaminsky Im Tom Brenamman Great to have you with us Rob Reichley our producer Our director is Scott Snider And our entire crew for game two of our triple header here on CW of ACC Basketball Nice feed miner down to Corinth Corin is a guy He was really solid in the nonconference schedule Has slipped a little bit in ACC play He needs to step up The long range is not there early on for the Mustangs Thatll be a reachin foul thatll go against BJ Edwards Well Jeff Cable told us yesterday Tom that their pit is at their best when theyre moving the ball and moving bodies And that just you know its a simple game and players make it hard but thats just twoman basketball Everybody goes on the guard Help Lake getting there inside and he gets an easy dunk Oh boy they missed an open cutter Witherspoon there cutting junior with a miss Offensive board Corin and he draws a foul on Yugatou applause Well and heres the thing that we talked about offensive rebounding Pit is one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the ACC Now with a low shooting percentage you might expect that but they do have a nose for the ball there Been a poor poor pit free throw shooting team And that continues the first try today The seminals and Fighting Irish from South Bend Indiana The final game of our triple header NC State won the opener over Virginia Tech NC State really starting to come together Well and that was a massive win against this SMU team on their court the last time out So Will Wade they played theyve won seven road games already So the theyve played extraordinarily well and the schedules coming back to them Its interesting you mentioned the number seven and road in the ACC this year Home teams are only seven games over 500 in the ACC Thats lowest its been in two decades and still cant find a shot from downtown And thats our first time out Well Pit needed a good start Pits off to a good start Just short of 93 You know what time when when he first came in in the coaching like he was down at Leonard Hamiltons staff in Florida State He was a kind of a shooting guru That was his thing Now all he wants to do is talk about defense when youre head coach youre a priority shift And uh he tells us that they would shift their defenses this year of this game And SMU is the back and forth between zone and man Loopy Miller able to sneak his hand in there and take it away Thats Germaine ONeal one of the very talented freshman on this SMU team Well they had a back door cut and cheering missed Cory Washington there BJ Edwards has been Mr Everything Another freshman big fella Tombs Nice righthanded hook Yeah hes a guy another guy a freshman who you know at this time of the year maybe get a little worn down but uh Andy Enfield told us before the game that uh he was going to play nine guys today He wanted to expand the roster a little bit 65 SMU just two of nine from the field 0 for four from threepoint range And heres Miner from way downtown Heres Poopy Miller trying to get going and hell go to the free throw line Man he is some kind of exciting player as Miller Saw him have that incredible game in the win over North Carolina to start our ACC season regular season here on the CW And you can see and you made mention of the fact to me Tom and he had the flu uh not that long ago missed the Duke game lost a ton of weight and still trying to get back into into form And you made the point because obviously you played forever in the NBA after the star studded collegiate career how tough it is to put on weight during the season Oh yeah I mean you you know the the rigors of the season practice schedule and you know I bet you hes probably up six 6000 8000 calories a day Well he is so thin from where he was even just three weeks ago Had to miss one game because of that And SMW did as good a job as on Caleb Wilson I think defensively in that win against North Carolina as Ive seen any team do And of course your alma mater squaring off The Tarheelss and Blue Devils getting together for the first time later on tonight in Chapel Hill Washington at the other end And ONeal with a rebound Are they playing Theyre Yeah youre getting notices on your phone while Im laughter trying to talk to you for Gods sakes Illadvised shot there by Evans Yeah my my friends who went to Carolina all want they wanted they wanted whats the spread And Im like this is Duke Carolina There is no spread Yeah And I tell you what Dunning when he gets off to a great start it really for for bodess well for them First team all sunb belt performer a year ago is Barry Dunning Jr at South Alabama And thats a blocking foul as Jaden Tounes took it to the basket Hell head for the free throw line Tombs a big man Yeah I mean you come with him behind Yigato Thats a pretty good one two Little bounce pass there Good catch going away You know on the offensive end hes been okay Its been on the defensive end especially showing out on high ball screens that Andy Enfield says he gets lost sometimes but thatll come Tombs with three He averages seven 610 230 lb freshman out of Amarillo Texas finished up high school at Dynamic Prep Academy where he was a teammate of Germaine ONeal there Hit them both You recognize the name senior Germaine ONeal long time NBA player played 18 years Thats a stellar career Fourtime Allstar He saw his dad when we were down in Dallas earlier this season and his son will run down a rebound here That time Dunning a little bit of a forced shot Theyve had a few of those Oh my HOW ABOUT THE REJECTION Kieran Mullen And then Mullen HOW ABOUT THAT cheering WELL got down the other end in hes a guy whos capable Hes a very good threepoint shooter Yeah you made a comment before the game You felt Indraitis and Dunning Jr needed to have big games Heres the look I mean this was a great a great slip but a better recovery And this how about this little step back three and hes coming off an 11point game He played well against UVA so maybe playing with a little more confidence The transfer from Iowa State Spent one year there 0 for seven now from threepoint land as Walters checks in the game for the first time Shot clock down to three Going to have to let it fly And the rebound off the fingertips of Giron Pierre Jr See I I think that uh interesting is he he he made a an opportunity slip by there He had Boopy Miller on him A big size advantage Could have had that jump shot in the lane Oh how about that inbounds play Wow I mean you cant decide it any better than that Mullen after setting a screen and Keequley when he was at DC won the Buckus Award the Lombardi Award the Lot and the Gerski award as a junior before heading off to the National Football League By the way is the second youngest player ever to be inducted into the Hall of Fame And uh you know what kudos to him too He stepped away from it arguably right in his prime or close to his prime just for health reasons that he wanted to uh he wanted to retain good health for the rest of his life SMU has still not made a threepoint basket in this game Theyll take that too from Loopy Miller His first field goal Well thats they need to readjust their sights and get into the paint area and build out the threepoint shot Not there for them but theyve got the size Theres no shot blocking out there for Pit SM is three of 14 from the field and 0 for seven behind the arc left hand up but a foul called before the follow against Tombs I mean so here you are with 1107 to go on till halftime And look Pip 9 and 14 2 and eight in the league but a nice start for the Panthers Next Saturday NASCAR returns a brand new season new partner when the OReilly Auto Part Series races into historic Daytona International Speedway 33 weeks Raw racing begins Saturday from Daytona 400 pm Eastern only on the CWCW got rave reviews on its coverage last year and looking forward to getting rolling My friend Adam Alexander doing a great job in the booth Great job And uh and giving them a big lift so far off the bench I toldu back in there and drops it home with the lefty A good feed there That pick and roll with their center has been there for SMU and they should run a steady diet of that for the next five or eight minutes Thatll be a bump out on the perimeter Heres the look screen the bump off It forces uh Mullen to get caught in between and thats just an easy layin Welldesigned play Really no help from you can see the weak side was completely cleared out See checks back into the game as Mullen leaves for the Panthers And Recitis was wide open a corner down there Long three and nothing but the bottom of the net for Wilson Witherspoon with 6 seconds left on the shot clock A huge bailout So the Panthers without their leading scoreer already with 19 through the first 10 minutes of this opening halfoo took it back out to Miller Is this the first three Yes sir Well you know they took a chance It was a late double team that time SMU hadnt hit a three Not bad to dig in on the center but uh that was a great look by Boopy Miller Itll be Walters with the body St Walters came in from Michigan Heres a look You see the double team seven come right down Little late recovery outside Just able to get the laces right and then put it up That is the fifth team foul against the Mustangs Oh boy You knew that was trouble soon as it left the hand of Demarco Ryan Edwards has still not scored in this game And theres a take away and a foul That was BJ Davis Ray and already his second foul since coming in the game He prevented a dunk race but really active at the top cheering of that defense And tell you what I mean Davis Ray is he does not get a lot of time during the course of the year So he can use his five fouls as much as he you know as often as he wants Wasnt going to give up that play And against a team that doesnt shoot the free throw well take away a highlight play like that maybe not a bad idea Keep the crowd out of it Three of four from the free throw line so far in this one but its 18 just 66 on the year Now Witherspoon 65 on the year Yeah theyre top looking at the the top three scorers for Pit shooting the 50s from the free throw line And I dont I cant remember when Ive seen that the last time And it turns out to be a beneficial foul What happened there Did they call the foul on Yugato Oh he traveled I think got blocked by somebody one of the players here and couldnt tell So right back to Pit and Miner the trigger man He threw it away just a moment ago Defended by the taller Walters Minor tough shot OH MY DUNNING JR with a followup slam He has five Nobody got a body out of him that time We talked about pitting their offensive rebounding You got to find bodies BJ Edwards averages 14 points per game and is not scored This is Pierre Hes bumped by Dunny Thatll be the 14 foul against the Panthers Heres the look I mean if youre SMU thats the shot you want to force but youve got to clean it up And nobody on him You can see look at this I mean hes just sliding right in there Nobody touches him Six point fivepoint lead for Pit SMU has hit its last three after a terrible start Close miss there You could again head fake and kisses it home Hes off to a good start He has six Make it seven now Yeah I mean you know if if hes going to miss and be right in there you know hes going to play over the top of everybody that Pit has out on the floor cheering threepoint game Its a nice look but quick hands once again by Poopy Miller to slap it away and Pierre coast to coast will lay it in Wow Quick take I tell you what Boopy Miller got switched off on C Appa and that looked like a mismatch but he took the ball and the dunk away from him for it working on Yugato will fade away Tough shot and a rebound comes away to SMU and the Mustangs on the run Three on three and Edwards alive and Sigato with another basket and a timeout for Jeff Cable Yugato has nine He averages 10 in large parts of America Of course you walked up uh the hill in very beautiful hilly pit Pittsburgh Pennsylvania yesterday Dude thats not a hill It was a 45°ree incline A hill is a little hill That was I had to take a breather halfway up I thought I was climbing Everest You made it though Yeah Rob our our producer Rob Reichley said its just a short walk from here The end of the day my watch said I had 12000 steps applause Thats why I gave you a lip this morning Came back home afterwards laughter Enfield wonder wheres the foul there and that is his 17th team foul but it was a twoshot foul anyway for Dunning Jr Now hes a good free throw shooter 75 And a nice throw there applause Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Well it was critical that he get off to a good start today and he has um and we talked about it that that affects his play and players some players are like that You know they need to get off to that quick start He got them both And then beautiful free throw form And then you know for him it it just elevates everything else It elevates the defensive end of the floor as well Miller fade away Yigu and was fouled before the tip He was shoved from behind That will be the fifth team foul against the Panthers Corin leaves and Mullen back in that big block early in the game Yeah Tombs going for the dunk Yep Pull up jumper Nice touch right there by Pierre Jr I mean they have some scores on this SMU team Now you know they have four they have five guys who average in double figures and uh you know that end of the floor has never been a problem for this team Although their numbers of scoring are are down in league play but uh heres our rugby player from the corner See he wasnt just any rugby player According to many he was among the top players in all of Australia where of course rugby is extraordinarily popular their great rivalry through the years with New Zealand and he could have played professionally rugby There you see the picture right there Thats a mans game I tell you I was I was talking yesterday if theres a loose ball with five or six guys and he doesnt come out with the ball theres something wrong right Can you find guys in college now that theyre getting paid That would be a fine Thats a nice fade away by Witherspoon Seven guys have scored for Pit so far and thats been their mo but its been its been a collective effort Pierre for three and it is good for Giron Pierre Hit their last two of their last three after missing their first six So wake up call coming a little bit later in the game The air has seven to good enough for second in scoring behind Yigu And theres an SMU take away Boy you talk about coming up with the ball Boopy Miller Oh my Big fella came to play today Now well hes looking around and he doesnt see any faces that hes looking into So he knows that hes got a free run inside Thats the way you feel walking through life isnt it Yeah most of the time there has 11 Little out of control there Crowd wanted a foul Instead its a kick by Mullen SMU basketball Heres See the hands ready right there and not an easy pass but uh you know hes just feel you catch he catches it inside the block charge line I mean its over in this game The average is 11 He has 11 and only a sophomore Twoyear starter for the Mustangs Still not a single point for BJ Edwards He has been among the very best players in the Atlantic Coast Conference this year Thats him with the basketball Hes been the ACC player of the week three times this year The only two players in the league that can say that are him and Boozer at Duke But only his second field goal attempt in the game so he hasnt been pushing it you know hasnt been hunting his shot but uh seeing really nice defense on him that last time Oh February the 22nd the PBA is rolling on to the CW 10 weeks of exciting action All starts with one of the sports biggest events The PBA on the CW premieres with a players championship Sunday February 22nd music 4 Eastern 1 Pacific right here on the CW Ice cold bowling a thousand years ago Today guys we taped it at 600 in the morning if you can believe this in the dead of winter in Cincinnati We taped it at 6 am and they would open up the lanes for fans to come in It was the longest running TV show in the history of Cincinnati Locally produced When they opened the lane at 600 am They also opened the bar Thats why it was full Well and uh I was going to ask if they had pinsitter setters back then It was so long ago Really funny Theres Miller knocking it down Thats good Isnt anything you wont call Thats right Thats right Pretty nifty work there by Ryan Dunning Tough shot And here comes SMU The Mustangs leading by one Oh boy Little miscommunication there Pierre threw it away trying to get it to Cory Washington SMU has hit seven of its last eight CW courtside Saturday presented by Alson from the field music since has made 10 of its last 12 So all the way up to 48 after that woeful start Well and uh you know building inside out too 18 to eight advantage points in the paint so far and most of that has been the big man inside Quick catch and shoot right there and off the mark but an offensive rebound Another one for Pit Wide open three Witherspoon too strong Got his own rebound Heres Miner Hes going to let it fly from three And those are two really good looks And theres our rugby guy Think hes ever done that to somebody before Yeah Somehow I think that thats thats probably occurred in his past Well I mean look Pit had four chances right there and just couldnt knock one down And not just four chances four really good looks So now SMU for the first time of the game going with the twin giants in Tombs and Yugatulu in the game Well when you want when you have a size advantage why not have more of a size advantage Heres Edwards looking for his first basket And thats a three And you mentioned I mean hes you know hes a big time scorer but he has really not been hunting his offense in the game so far Credit to him Hey only had 11 against NC State He did add nine rebounds but he has just had some phenomenal games this year stretches of games this year Good bounce pass and then a reachin foul after Caleppa missed the layup He was looking at Yugato coming over to block instead of finishing the play right here You might be able to see it Hes going up Hes looking to see where the guy is And that should have been an easy two So now SMU starting to get things moving a bit Leading by four Were down to 210 left until halftime Germaine ONeal Jr the fresh tough shot there Not going to go cheering Yeah a bit of a force Boy I mean to tell you when Cale Leo when he makes contact with other bodies out there the other bodies are the ones that are moving Jeff you all right down there Man when that guy runs into you you know it Now like to remind you coming up the halftime show presented by Subaru love Its what makes Subaru Subaru Highlights from Virginia Tech NC State Game one of our double triple header and then a preview of the third game Florida State Notre Dame from South Pen All coming up on the Subaru halftime It has missed its last seven Has not scored in over 2 and 12 minutes Reach in foul sepa And you know thats they theyve tried about three different bodies on Yigatu and its just I mean everybody is is undersized until you gave that NC State score You know that Kadir Copeland is playing at a very high level recently You know he had 16 assists against SMU in that win down there He had a double double today 21 and 10 assists cheering Yiku missing three not there Here you tried to bat it out but into the hands of Indrasitis cheering This is actually I mean this this scoring pace is right where P would like it Way out Witherspoon not there And the rebound comes away to Edwards You know the thing its interesting with the threes that theyve taken the rebounds havent been real long The guys on the perimeter havent had a shot at them Weve all been kind of in around the in the lane area Shot clock down to seven Pierre Jr finding Bloopy Miller will draw a foul And that will be the 18 foul So Miller will head to the line You know talking about NC State getting the onepoint win as you look at this foul the onepoint win over SMU in Dallas But you know those two teams are basically trending in the same zip code as far as the net rankings are concerned The Atlantic Coast Conference so much better than its been the last year or two top to bottom looking at what eight teams in the top 37 in the most recent net rankings with number 34 being SMU and two front ends and one of ones missed by uh missed by SMU But yeah to your point so many opportunities this year in the league to get those quality wins you know having those good like the SEC had last year Yep when the league has just been its great to see again because college basketball is better when the ACC is good and Dunnings been mighty good as you predicted he might today coach Jaminsky yeah it was that he hit his first shot and then that has made a big difference at the buzzer and its too long but hey as you said if youre Jeff Cable right now you feel pretty good college and this is a true on campus site too How they built it on the side of this mountain I have no idea Some you had to climb yesterday Yeah we all have mountains to climb Yeah Boy knew it was some more than others Some steeper than laughter Yes thats for sure Heres Dunning right out of the gate He had nine in the first half And so SMU with the basketball leading by two Just underway Opening minute of this laughter second half Atlantic Coast Conference basketball SMU thinking about a trip to the NCAA They were thinking that last year but didnt have enough quality wins Wound up in the NIT and bang just like that It is Cory Washington who did not score in the opening half and he averages 11 a game Yeah really That was on only take taking two shots again Well you know Ill hit that point again there You got you got some pretty big time scorers who havent been really forcing their offense Good ball fake there but good recovery defense Heres Dunning Hes 0 for two to begin the second half Had a couple good looks at it too Yeah they needed him to get off to another quick start Lob to Yigolu He has 13 in a game his first bucket of the second half Yeah he just basically has to make a clean catch inside and then hes going to convert But five nothing start for SMU and the lead at seven Largest of the game for the Mustangs cheering Shot clock at one Not a good possession there for the Panthers EDWARDS OH YOU BET It goes down to Pierre Jr and a timeout immediately by Jeff Three One of one from the threepoint line and Jeff Cable needed to stop the run if possible with the timeout So seven zip to begin this second half And thats a 174 run overall going back to the final four minutes of the first 20 minutes And every shot that Pit has taken in this half has been a three They need to get something attacking the rim Witherspoon Thats a tough shot Fade away defended well by Edwards Second one in a row where the shot clock has really been on their back Washington went up got fouled by I think they got Miner Yep Cory Washington to the strike And thats a foul that its a bailout foul because that was going to be a tough conversion for Washington and then you just give him a break and put him at the free throw line Washington averages 11 points five rebounds a game came over from Witchah State Second team all AAC performer a season ago Hes good player cheering Fastest growing cable news network in all of television News Nation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find it go to newsowcom Well and you know Andy Enfield he he was able to keep his core together You know Booby Miller Edwards and Yugato all came back and then he put some nice pieces around him Its tough to keep your core group in this day and age in the same place Yeah the two big gets in the portal were Pierre and Washington And jumper by Witherspoon is too strong And another rebound for Edwards pushing ahead to Washington and hell go to the free throw line He hits a deck hard but hes all right Good sportsmanship there by the Panthers A pair of them in fact Gunning and minor And you can see its the misses by Pit that have been starting the fast break Its almost like those shots have surprised the teammates a little bit Jeff Kipil saying yesterday that uh you know hes got guys who when things start going wrong try to take the game on their shoulders and thats just not when theyre at their best and they dont have that goto guy Washington hit one of two a moment ago Hes an 82 free throw shooter Keep coming down Lane violation I believe against Pit Thats Thats tough Yeah And that was uh Selea He kind of almost stumbled a little bit Went into the lane area before Washington released it Wow Two of four from the line Washington and he is rock solid normally in a strike Been looking for its first points of this second half It was a twopoint game at halftime and now that lead is 11 for the Mustangs Shot clock at four Im not sure they know it WHAT A PASS AND HOW ABOUT THAT OH THEYRE saying he didnt get it off Theyre going to have to Theyre going to look at it and see that was so close I mean it was a great play at the end of the clock Witherspoon with a feed into the hands of Corin Did he get it off I thought he did Yeah I think he did too Its like I said in real time it looked very close previous play is under review to look for a potential shot clock violation Okay there the catch and finish But this is the third possession in a row where the shot clock has been winding down on Pit Theyve had trouble getting a look All right so Bloopy Millard and the Mustangs with a ninepoint lead Thats the first basket of this second half First points of the second half by the Panthers Only two field goals in the last nearly 10 minutes And Yugatulu will go Theyre saying no We had not gone up yet Thats a third on Seppa Floopy going out there trying to tell his teammates exactly what play it is theyre running and where everybody should be Well you know what Subtle but really smart when youre out there The ref couldnt throw him the ball So he stepped inbounds let everybody get lined up and then took the ball from the referee And Washington who did not score in the first 20 minutes has eight points here in the first four minutes of the second half Miner to the rack Nice play Lays it in Yeah I mean for his size Yugato is not a great rim protector but uh looks like Luke Miller getting some of his speed back from his bout with the flu He is now gone What 30 consecutive games in double figures Ali there to Corin His second bucket of the half 30 straight games in double figures for Lucy Miller I mean when you think the effect that his transfer is Yigatola with a left hand his transfer what its meant to SMU and what its done to Wake Forest Yeah absolutely Uh and it also shows the importance of the point guard position in college basketball right now If you can start from there if you got that position locked down youre in decent shape It was last year when Miller transferred from Wake Forest where he spent one season and joined SMU for his final two years Rejection by Washington and the shot clock sits at 14 What a game its been for Yigolu that never really got out of the pain area but the ref you know they were looking at everything on the floor You can get away with that 3se second probably had about a 6second camp out Got 15 points and hell go to the bench as Tombs checks in And theres a takeaway Miller up top Oh goodness And the dunk by Pierre Jr That was going to be a you know in that case you almost want to take the the dead ball turnover and not even try to throw it in because that was just the first pass of the fast break But Millers just been so active defensively Almost got another steal there Instead hell pick up a foul Theres the look I mean again its you know Andy Miller Andy Enfield talking to us beforehand about you know we could score the ball thats not an issue and know you know as a coach I dont want to first complain about that but they show off the defensive end of the floor theyre going to be formidable Yeah I think its fair to say that you know they had the toughest schedule of any team in the Atlantic Coast Conference over the first half of the ACC schedule thatll belong to pit So I mean theyve played all the big wigs already right And you know the back half of their schedule is certainly favorable but he made a point He said Look I think we can beat anybody in our league on a given night He said I also think were capable of losing anybody in our league Dunning with a three Good to see him still shooting He missed his first few offerings in this half using a big body spin move How slick was that Pitch interior players are going to be uh theyre going to be feeling it after playing these games Those two big bodies just has such a great future ahead of him Only a freshman And Dunning again just keeps letting it fly Why not 13point lead SMU with the basketball in the corner Rare miss of this half for Washington They have to be careful They dont want to get caught up in a track meet but then again they also dont want to have the shot clock on their back Nice tap out Another long rebound Dunning lays it off and that shot was tipped as it left the fingertip of Corin Goofy He had it blocked by the taller defender Witherspoon And so because theyre look at those out of control shots theyre not getting calls inside Tell you that guy you leave him alone Forget about it He can fill it up at seven at halftime and he has seven more here in the second half Touchdown Had a 28point game three games ago and then 23 against State and the lead at 5741 in favor of SMU Shot clock at two Dunning had to just force it up there Never caught the rim and this thing right on the verge of getting ugly Miller to the basket He draws a foul on Corin and after the timeout Goofy Miller will head to the line to shoot a pair SMU rolling here in the second half Mustang more than one of those games Yep And then and you talk about the triple doubles really doing everything and and this is a guy whos 63 Yeah You know not a not a really dominating music physical presence but uh overall presence on the floor Fabulous He does have six assists to go along with three rebounds in this one cheering Miller for the first of two Watch as contestants spell their way to glory or disaster All new episode of Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson Thursday 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW Miller had a boat Well as as bad as it was for SMU to start this game they are now nine of 11 82 from the floor three of four from three Uncharacteristically missing those two free throws And for Pit its been the opposite Four of 17 one of eight from three And they havent been to the line Swinging in the corner Miner tried another three And Pierre looking to push ahead on the fast break Hes going to go to the rack himself Boy he is some kind of player you know And and this is the thing We talked about the five guys averaging double figures and where Pit didnt have that guy SMUs got about five guys who can step up and have big games if somebodys having an off Yeah youre not kidding I mean you look at their team this year theyve had four players in games this year score 10 or more points 20 times Theyve had five score 10 or more in seven games Theyve had six players score 10 or more in three games just a lot of offensive fire There are a lot of there are some teams in the league that can really score the ball I mean its the state being right up there as well Virginia fans are seeing a lot more offense with Ryan ODM in there No kidding Averaging in the 80s Yeah Rare ever getting there for almost 15 20 years But a national championship Yeah thats exactly right Well he knows what its like to play in one of those games Jeff Cable played for Duke Heres Walters Hes a guy Hes had some hes had some injury issues this year but uh they were they were hoping for a little bit more offense from him coming from Michigan Yeah in fact he hit two threepointers in a game against NC State the other night as theyre starting to get him back into shape after missing a lot of time this year Heres Witherspoon for three and they finally get one to go down Second three of the second half the other from Dunning 10 minutes to go and its 6144 SMU Tombs catches it down low Brought it down low and had it taken away Thats good ball movement there by Pips and then cant finish Yeah CPA did everything and hes missed a few layups inside this afternoon Youre right Thats the best ball movement theyve had Well that is a great dribble penetration there Stutter step by Edwards to get the layin Yeah I mean you know you when youre doing your scouting report for SMU who do you lock in on Andy Anfield you know knew they went right to Yugato early in this game Go go go Hor has six here in the second half Hes come alive Walters again And again hes short and then lost out of bounds in a belonged SMU Twos bounced it right off the leg of Andraitis You know a lot of talk here in Pittsburgh There has been the last couple of weeks about the future of Jeff Cable Hes in his eighth year now Couple of games over 500 Hes been to one NCAA tournament in his first seven years Another year he really got jobbed by the selection committee I think you and I both agree on that two years ago But you know it it is so interesting and you and I and Rob Reichley and Scott Snder were talking about this last night at dinner for a long period of time and you had asked a question about coach cable yesterday You know with with NIL and some teams are spending a lot more than other teams There are a lot of teams spending a lot more than Pit and you know how do you judge a coach and what kind of job hes doing now You posed that question yesterday Yeah And its very difficult And I dont know that coach you know coaches are saying we hope that the administration understands how difficult it is to start from scratch almost every single year And you know theres no more building of a program like there was 20 years ago And thats just thats that time has passed So how how do you how do you judge a team You know is it by all right how much heres how much money youre getting If were getting this much money were expecting results you know has it come has it come down to that type of equation And even though coach Cable was not the one who said it we have learned from other sources here in Pittsburgh that this Panther team as far as you know NIL money in that kind of thing as Hisitis bangs it down from threepoint land and theyre among the near the bottom in the Atlanta Conference Well in most part in college you think you could see a pretty direct correlation between money spent and results on the on the floor And the guy theyve paid the most to this year hasnt been able to play because he got ruled out because of medical Thats right Heart condition Yeah Yeah Deshawn Jackson through no fault of the coaching staffs Then you had a great player leave in the portal They had five lead overall from a year ago They have a big time recruiting class coming in here next year and theyve got some talented freshman on this team So you know if they stay with Coach Cables theres a takeaway and hes not going to miss this easy when Sepha throws it down Thatll prompt a timeout 6551 SMU CW courtside Saturday presented by All State neighborhood briefly SMU I think Andy Anfield said little early for our home run trot right now Yeah little early Little early for sure Long way to go in this one 745 but boy what a second half start for his team 12 of 17 from the field 71 and it just got a little better on the layin by Miller Well he got his guy on his back and then Yugatola screened off his man That was just really good vision by Boopy Miller 15 now in the game for Miller SMU with three players in double figures Miller Pierre leads away with 16 Jigatu has 15 And thats an off game for them Only three Well I mean they got a couple other guys that might get there Cory Washingtons knocking on the door with eight although he is not in the game right now Thats Davis Ray the freshman Saw some playing time in the although Washington is in a game I beg your pardon And thats a foul on Pit 15 foul on the Panthers SMU only one foul here in the second half Pierre Jr off the screen buries a threepoint really nicely run underneath out of bounds play A year ago he was a Conference USA player of the year at Jacksonville State Average 22 per game Well and you know the but the risk you take as a coach you get players from a league like that you know can they step up and play in the ACC And hes answered that question for sure But they its not always a guarantee at a mid major conference if you can make that step up to the you know Big 10 or SEC No doubt about it I mean look no further than what we just saw in the football season coming up James Madison Kurt Signetti to Indiana brings a bunch of guys from JMU You know can you play in the Big 10 Well they answer that and then some Yeah Jeez is uh just teamwork and chemistry still matter in sports Yes For sure That is one of the more incredible stories over the last two years Well you you had one of the the great lines before the game today Theres a jump hook by and Ill let you delivered I had made the comment I said Man how good is Nebraska in basketball this year And then you followed with Yeah Nebraska wins their conference and Indiana in basketball and Indiana wins the national championship in football The world is off its axis laughter Thats a truth And how about that getting in the scoring column BJ Davis Ray the freshman from St Louis I mean if somebody would have said to you two years ago Nebraska is going to be a basketball school and Indiana is going to be a football school youd have taken whatever odds they give you Yep No no doubt about it First one is good by Miner Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands You know SMU has been really good in both football and basketball since joining the ACC Played in the ACC champion football championship last year Yep It was it was quite a day because I remember that was in the game in December where they they played Virginia in their very first ACC basketball game and that night was the football championship in Charlotte Thats right You and I were there Yeah And a lot of administration officials went to the basketball game and then flew to Charlotte and saw that guy do his thing while they were still while playing Virginia Theres a foot race on for the leading scoreer now between Miller and Pierre Jr They keep going back and forth Pierre at 19 Miller now with 18 And Tombs thats a nice rebound right there Did not come over the back Well and you know since the perimeter game has opened up the centers havent gotten as many looks for SMU 7658 Were down under five minutes to go in Pittsburgh Dont forget part of our triple header today here on CW Sports We have Florida State and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Those two teams are trying to get into the ACC tournament So look is that a game of you know top 20 teams No But its very important if youre trying to get into the ACC tournament And you know you got a first year head coach down in Florida State Youve got Shrewsbury who you know look its been a tough year for him and the Irish Theres no two ways about that How about the turnaround though You talk about last year the first time that happened and NC State doesnt make the ACC tournament Thats right And now where they are this year No kidding With Will What do you think about them Youve seen them quite a bit Yeah I again theyre another team that can really score the ball Um you know defensively is you know theyre going to score in the 80s Can they get better defensively You know I think so Tell you whos playing you know I I mentioned Copelan but Van Allen Luben is really having a nice season for them Well he finished strong with Carolina last year Its you know this is third school in a chance where hes been able to be a main part of what theyre doing offensively and hes hes really stepped up It started at Vandy if I remember right Vandy to Carolina now No was it Notre Dame Oh Im sorry Thats right Notre Dame So three ACC schools in three years Who am I thinking of in the league started in Vandy and then transferred two more times since then Im drawing a blank right now Some another big man in the in the league At any rate were at 7858 with 414 left Miller able to come away with a rebound They P has gotten a a bunch of quality looks They got some good looks from three and some layups that theyve missed And then you get that guy with a shortest guy on the floor goes into the paint and scores a layup Man he is something to watch We saw him that North Carolina game had 27 points and 12 assists There you see 15 times scoring 80 or more And that ties him with Virginia Duke for the most in the league in Carolina I think he heard your comment about whos vying for a leading scoreer in the game He wants to finish that argument Well that guy right there is trying to get it right back Pierres trying to get it back Hes one behind him Le in the first half has two baskets So but credit him I mean when when the outside game wasnt there he stepped up inside and they had a bunch of points in the paint in that first half They kept him afloat in the game Offense came alive in the second half cheering and you could lose continues to sit down over there you know Coach Enfield said you asked him a question before the game We had a chance to visit with him for quite a while Really liked spending time around him He good guy smart guy good coach Yep And uh but you know he said Look you asked about your team wearing down He has a a handful of guys that play a ton of minutes and a lot of other teams do too and youre getting into you know February now and you asked him are you going to start changing things a little bit winding down and he talked about you know if we were able to get a win thats a strong move underneath right there by Corinth But if his team got a win here today and its moving in that direction leading by 22 with under three to go that he was going to give him tomorrow off said we dont play again till Tuesday He said I rarely ever give him Sundays off but I am this time Well and moving the game up gives him a couple hours And people may look at that and go Wait its a couple hours Well at this time of the year a couple hours is a lot And uh you know I the season is so long I mean these guys start playing in earnest in the first week of November and its 4 months before you even get to March and thinking about your league tournament and the NCAA tournament So I mean rest is at a premium especially when youre playing a sevenman rotation Yeah Weve seen very little of ONeal in this game That guys got a nice game too Yeah And uh offensively I think hes okay He was on the defensive end of the floor especially if he gets out on the perimeter But um you know he hes going to be I think an important piece behind Yigatola as this season goes along Jims in a double figures So thats four Mustangs in double figures And they have Washington a basket away from making it five And here comes Pierre Jr going to give it up And see that its better when Boopy is the passer and hes the finisher I think its a movie just said What are you doing CW womens double dip tomorrow number six Louisville taking on Syracuse And then in game two the Mustangs of SMU to take on number 17 Duke Duke undefeated in ACC play at 120 Had a big win on Louisville against Thursday night Tomorrow at 12 Eastern 9 Pacific Well I saw that Louisville team in person a couple weeks ago and they had to move some games around because of the weather Man thats a big time win for Duke cuz that Louisville team is good Wouldnt be surprised to see clearing of the bench a little bit here now for SMU also number 13 Well you know and we didnt say it per se but this was really a must win I thought for SMU coming in Not not so much that you know one it gets him to 500 in the league which is big but you know th this loss would have really not shown well on the resume foul underneath Holmes checks in for the first time Mitchell Holmes a red shirt freshman out of Fort Worth Texas And you know we talked about how the front half of the schedule really flooded for competition Yeah And but back lo you know the back back five games youve got some opportunity This is again were not were not dumping on any other team but you look at SMU look at those teams and say all right you know Im its a W You know you talk about years to to draw where you play a team twice This year they twice play Louisville and who they dont play You know some teams dont play Thats right Like Virginia and Clemson dont play That could be a big deal come the end of the year in terms of seedings for the ACC tournament cuz both of them obviously are ranked and they will be in the ACC tournament Walters spin move Nice move by Walters His first bucket Well you look at two that you know to me its a crime NC State and Carolina only play one time I know You know and and Wake plays Carolina and Duke one time each Both of them at their building Yeah really feel for whats going on down there at Wake You know Coach Forbes and they had a couple of three 20 win seasons None of the three did Wake Forest get in the NCAA tournament Things are not trending certainly in that direction this year for his team And you know and they lost some key one guy were looking at right here in front of us Poopy Miller But you know they in those years Tom they didnt play a strong schedule in the nonconference and the big games that they had they had some close ones that they lost and thats thats the separation part this year that most of the teams in the conference did great against very good nonconference Absolutely Its been the best in fact nonconference season for the Atlanta Coast Conference in the last nine years I mean the league is so much better See with a layin and were down to the final 25 seconds SMU will go to 16 and seven As Mike mentioned will even its mark in the ACC at five up and five down But theyre going to end up with a pretty decent conference record when all is said and done if they take care of the teams that we just showed you that theyre supposed to be Doesnt mean they will be but theyre supposed to be So they crank up the offense in this one Much better defense
