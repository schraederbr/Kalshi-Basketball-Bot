and we have just learned that Jaden Zachary is not the starting lineup for the Eagles he is out with a ankle ailments dont expect him to miss that much time but will be an interesting development for BC to see how they can adjust with Jason Matson now in their back court as you look at Zachary on the Eagles bench first time hes missed his start in his 45game bc career we are off and running great to have you with us tomorrow Langford with his brother Makai Ashton Lankford he has the ball TJ bicker staff Applause Music Eagles in their throwback jerseys as you look at their starting lineup the tie out to Lakers milking the shot clock Mason Batson the Cincinnati transfer fade away for two and theyre gonna need some offense for them to be successful well theyre going to need offense from somebody somebodys gonna have to step up here but that first possession John I think is how they want to play all night theyre going to play deep into the shot clock they want to lower the possessions of this in this game because theres no way their offense can compete with Virginia techs DigiTech is so disciplined as theres a deep three by Padula out the zilly with the rebound and hes been a revelation for them a huge part of their 111 start transferred from Wright State trying to back in the hook shot as it rolls home and brazily as Mike young calls him a throwback what does he mean by that well hes he can do a lot of different things hes an unbelievable combination of skill and physicality he can play the Finesse game but as he shows you there he can post you up he can go to that jump hook the versatility of Virginia Techs two bigs Matson bazilly is is really the differentiator for this team deep three by Makai Ashton Langford is off the line yeah good point Christian they only tore the ball over nine times thats the least amount in the nation its amazing how well they are coached and how disciplined they are Music Applause screened by Justin butts but Doula Works off of it he is Nifty off the bounce hes having a heck of a year hes to me right now hes the player of the year in the ACC now Isaiah Wong is making a real strong push but the year that Sean Padula is having hes Fearless Applause also 48 assists and 18 turnovers and theres a turnover for the Eagles as Master Langford stepped out of bounds and I said it in the open like Mike young is doing things with Sean medulla and allowing Sean Padula to do things that he has never allowed point guards to do hes posting them up Mike was saying before the game he said look Seans going to take a couple shots theyre going to make you uh scratch your head but you kind of have to live with that stuff because he does other things just off of instinct that uh that makes this team go hes cranked up his scoring plus 11 from last year a steal by Matson Hunter Couture throws the ball away a rare Miss Cube Madison had three threepointers and the Eagles lost to Villanova this month and that goes out of bounds off of TJ Bickerstaff Earl Grant trying to build the culture talks a lot about gritty and not pretty thats his Mantra at BC they like to muck the game up and Mike young knows full four about that did Zachary two and a half minutes off the bench after the ankle ailment Music good news for the Eagles to get him in the lineup for zilly the misfire Here Comes Ashton Langford Music his most effective Chris when they dont attempt 153 pointers the record is 31 when they take less than 15 heres a three by CJ Pena in an air ball loose ball for TJ Bickerstaff awkward move but an effective shot and theres a reason why they dont take that many threes they cant shoot them um but they want to play inside out its been a struggle I mean you know their offensive numbers are not good uh they are near the bottom nationally not not even just in this league uh and theres a reason I mean theyve had a lot of injuries guys in and out of the lineup theyre only 28 from threepoint range steal by Hunter Couture the tour hold on athletic at the ACC tournament last year in the open floor but a travel called against the Hokies the one thing though is they have played BC has played Virginia Tech well particularly in this building last year it was James carnick who had his way inside but they were able to get Virginia Tech into some foul trouble and like you said they are physical I mean thats kind of who theyve had to be because it is a hard time scoring theyre going to play low possession a physical game did you use the word muck did you say they Marcus said they mocked it up it could be a hockey term as well Grinders familiar with that from your army absolutely you could use the term muck in a lot of different contexts yes you could we might have to experiment with that but were at our

like what would PopTarts do here yeah that feels right crazy good sure Music thank you foreign Music Music spot there his was big but you know the differentiator again is their ability to shoot it all five of the goal five of those guys they put out there can shoot the three you know they shoot they pass and they defend and they really know how to play its a really smart basketball team that doesnt hurt itself that last line we showed you trailing for just 45 minutes and 16 seconds on the season the reason why the ranked 21st and 20th in the coaches Bowl the three by Couture rebound spared by damara Lankford Devar Langford is going to be a key player for BC in the next month they need him to increase his scoring output as Roger Ayers calls a foul and hes been just too inconsistent for the coaching staffs like yeah he needs to play better I mean its a fact of the matter like like at some point you just got to look in the mirror and say I need to be better than I bet hes an elite athlete with you know a pro body and he just hasnt played up to I think the expectation and an injury issue along with a lot of guys on this game including Quinton post who was cleared to practice did practice today maybe back to 10 days great feed to bazilly that was special wasnt it Music Jazz Kelly in the ball game for the Eagles is a freshman guard he had 10 points in Nebraska in a loss the ACC Big Ten challenge Kelly the fade away over the top tips it to Padula and plus two and a half on the rebounding Edge all season Justin mutts candidate for ACC Player of the Year punched Away by Jaden Zachary you know these bigs will pick and pop but off this screening action they can also roll and how about that feed the tag guy comes over late Jayden Zachary and just a nice find and thats where you know Petula is going to find you he he will find you just gotta have a pair of ready hands Mike jug said hes crazy I said crazy in a good way he said yes hes hes crazy because hes a basketball gym rat he eats drinks and sleeps it and they love his intensity Zachary tries to back in with the fade away and he connects and Zachary leading the eagles with 113 points per addict Applause putting him on the Block there and a steal taking it away from MJ Collins the dump off to Pena nicely done by Zachary and pain in transition well they told us they didnt start him because of his ankle I have to tell you Ive seen a lot of bad ankles Jaden Zachary looks pretty healthy Music on that batting he does medulla knives through the lane get blocked on kid as many kid the Clemson transfer uh heres this post up giving Sean Patel a little taste of his own medicine hes got about an inch and a half on him and then a nice read here good anticipation if BC can get some of this stuff again Virginia Tech doesnt turn it over a lot but get some of that stuff in the open floor to help your offense Justin matz outstanding on the Baseline so much body control he had 27 against North Carolina and their victories averaging 13 points eight rebounds shooting 62 percent Music Pena launches Dania scored nearly 1600 points NAIA and division two went to two different schools before coming to Chestnut Hill Music Applause and another steal here come the Eagles to Langford transition and he converts and she grabs the twopoint lead Applause oh God its for turnovers Chris for the Hokies thats a team thats third best nationally and not turning it over so out of character and heres another one Zachary with some numbers Kelly eyes the three Couture that was dicey as he lands hard and the thing with the turnovers as it breathes life into an offense that needs life and thats just you know just a silly turn over there kind of a youre driving into traffic and its good for a guy like Makai Ashton Langford to see the ball go in you know another guy who its been a slow start to the year spinning and second on the team gives you an idea about BCs offense has been slow to develop Music Applause its transfer Music kid is opposed for mutts hell convert that all night Applause one kid and Elijah Pote at the body for 10 points and six rebounds for Mike young he says thats an underrated aspect of why were 111 those two guys both of them transfers Applause and they give them a different look at that big you know they get a little more physical not as skilled as basilian mutts how about Kelly and Tamar Langford grabs the loose ball Music Applause Eagles over five from three Pena they could over six at MJ Collins a long glider Applause butts feasting on the Baseline man six straight points for Justin months what a touch Applause foreign Music dont know where its coming from he sees the court so well Applause drain the clock with Zachary the offer continues from distance Applause Eagles shooting 38 percent Applause butts go to the hot hand heres Padula you like what PC is doing defensively Collins gets cut off by Kelly good possession by The Eagles G theres an air ball very good athletic bodies and they are physical doing a nice job staying in front of the basketball Music Kelly again quick its not a good shot and he passed up a wide open one on the last possession in the half court and that one was you know more contested and it was early thats a freshman still developing forced into some minutes with Donald hand out for the year with a torn ACL another highly touted freshman but mutts Baseline man delivers its tough on that block because hes a really good passer and a willing passer and so you you know youre not going to double him down there and he just hes got really good footwork and a nice soft touch the riding a six to nothing run he has eight points Justified Stones hes as tough a match up as there is in this league hes also a podcast host its called

medulla gets doubled swarming defense by BC coming up next well take to the Tallahassee for the Seminoles hosting Notre Dame Its the final game before the holiday break for these two teams Miss sadan ACC Network Music Applause youve watched almost 12 minutes of this one what are your impressions I think BCs defense has kept them in this as well as Virginia Techs turnovers you know and obviously the two are connected had to work on that end Music Applause both teams called from three a combined over 14 back in by Devin McLaughlin hes provided it of offense for real Grants Squad but not that time of The Bump by Zachary on Padula High entry pass to poti open three from Maddox and he nailed it and thats thats why theyre tough because all five of those guys out there can shoot it and actually Maddox has been the worst of the five you know only shoot 27 on the season from three but its in there this is 11th threepointer of the Season hes 40 for the field Mason Madsen got a pretty good luck Eagles keep it alive on the board Applause Madison doubled this time Roger Ayers calls a foul on Darius bias you know Darius Maddox has progressively gotten better a guy who played 35

like youre Earl Grant youre playing about seven guys so to have that that obviously that size but you know another quality player in your lineup they need it Applause and its difficult you made a good observation during our break played good defense but that doesnt necessarily turn into beneficial offense they dont get rewarded on the other end I mean that can weigh on you it just can weigh on you mentally Music Applause check a nine to nothing run Music and uh by Couture Maddox hounded by Ashton Langford Almost Got Away and we have a little gift for you starting at 7 AM Eastern Christian

outside of the family here thats good its a good political move on your part never hurt anybody eight point lead by the Hokies the largest of the game tomorrow length of the double team on him and McLaughlin follows up with an N1 situation maybe what the doctor ordered for BC and a nice interior pass a good good strong role there and and get you know its one of those sequence of events that uh youre like all right we got a bucket out of that but again theyve done a nice job moving the basketball getting that movement they just havent been rewarded with a finish at the end of it Music some anxious moments for that man Earl Grant they had a six minute and 40 second scoring drought just all block the 18 minutes off the bench seven points and five rebounds Doula the Up and Under hey Pops these relentless cant convert they missed three bunnies and McLaughlin pulls it down Applause there you saw Padula on the block though Applause you love that dont you I love it tomorrow Langford hes industrious off the offensive glass Second Chance points was the last time you saw a point guard on the Block Applause Mark Jackson 25 second back down they kind of found it organically you know it was something that Padula liked to do and they were they were creating stuff off of it and so Mike young has really gone to it as Maddox buries a midrange there charismatics hero in the ACC tournament last year with his buzzer beater against Clemson in overtime Ashton Lankford its the three thats the first three of the night for BC and 11 attempts Applause Earl Grant told me he thought it would be a 65 possession game Mike young said he thought it would be fewer than that Music both teams similar Styles medulla and a foul Langford brothers that BC back into this game he sees done a nice job and the offensive glass kept some possessions alive and then Makai Ashton Langford here knocking down that first three ball of the game and a guy again is not shot at well like most of this team only four of 25 for three coming into this one Applause Music and the zilly back in the ball game for the Hokies a lot of Link kid and BC gets freshman Prince Elite Bay has been injury play but he excelled in his first game against Cornell won the game with a buzzer beater for the Eagles on November 7th fourstar recruit appearing in his seventh game points three and a half boards Langford Applause doubled by Kid and Couture Alibi thought about it three kid the crash 100 Ayers calls Eagles TJ Bickerstaff for a foul Applause comes flying out of nowhere I dont know I mean I you know he kind of stuck his hand in there he may have gotten him with his lower body it looked worse than it than it did in the replay what a turnover by Virginia Tech very uncharacteristic for Mike Young preaching patience on the offensive end but theyve turned it over six times they average only nine a nation best figure they leave BC by four with the awardwinning Geico mobile app our customers joined the call hey Bill

get in the Christmas tree tried to sell the holiday special at the ACC Networks putting on on Christmas morning at 7 AM yes I am Jayden Zachary to Picker staff as this has been a Grinder from the tip pokies have lost three straight to the Eagles a league Bay nice move and the floater is beautiful and he showed shot big bursts in a nice little float game in the lane its been a physical game John its these officials allow both these teams to be physical on the basketball been able to bang cutters oh basilia that was great off the bounce getting by tomorrow Langford quiet but Grandpa zilly an impactful performer on out of the portal over 50 schools were in on him Virginia Tech lucky enough to get him Applause to skip the pass to League Bay Applause to Langford dribbling in the trouble there with a foul on the Hokies its a shot from Prince of leg Bay The Freshman off a pogo stick grants because Grandpa zilli when a league base shows him the shot fake hes gonna be a talented player you know again I think the adjustment to the college game and you know on a team where offense has been hard to come by its been a slow start for a lick Bay but hes gonna be a good player Applause there he is again off the double but he threw it away Applause seventh turnover by PC doula to mutz Applause whats spices Its just tough its so good off the dribble Music the reason why he shoots over 60 percent rarely takes a bad shot but hes getting a match up with fives you know teams have to as as Langford knocks one down there you know teams have to make a decision John when youre playing bazillion months Who you gonna put on each guy and mutz has gotten that match up against the five and so hes been able to show that versatility its one of the reasons that shooting percentage is so high Music reverse Land by Darius Maddox thats Virginia Tech basketball find the cutter Applause you do it so well Applause four for their last four for the field the Eagles are four for their last five and a foul on Hunter Couture look at this pass you just cant stand and watch and thats where Darius Maddox I was saying earlier if if youre ready and youre active Petula will find you there is Maddox a guy they dont run a lot of stuff for him but hes hungry to score and if youre hungry to score youre gonna find a ball cut into the baskets a good way to do that Music shop do the 12game oh yeah a league Bay fighting for the 5050 ball and its going towards Boston car Virginia Tech rather ACC pm with Mark Packer Trey Boston and Taylor Tenenbaum theyll talk football but theyll also have the latest from around the conference weekdays at four Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app I will say though on Petula you know theyve theyve put a number of different guys on him Jayden Zacharys done a nice job been physical with him Makai Ashton Langford on him now so they put length and size on Padula Music Applause shot clock in the winning seconds what a foul against BC they continue to defend well second foul on TJ Bickerstaff only about two seconds end up on the shot clock That official had a good angle saw that arm of vicker staff from behind using an idea the BC feisty defense Virginia Tech 30 points sees a low for them in the first half that was against College of Charleston their only loss of the season right before Thanksgiving the Eagles impressive on that end its just a matter of finding their shooting range Music Applause silly equaling the largest lead of the first half of eight points and we will take a 30second timeout right back at you and Justin Hill after this Music welcome to the neighborhood did you know that Geico could help with your own insurance cookies oh this is my moms secret recipe a little nutmeg in there its a secret is it cinnamon its my moms secret recipe Geico everyone is ready for Monday Night Football thats what I freaking talk about the Chargers square off against the volts Music time out by Virginia Tech holding an eightpoint lead halftime report coming up both coaches live interviews well have our highlights and stats and more Chief thoughts for patrol absolutely very deep folks expect nothing less you think Mike young is pleased I think he is you know its its but he knew coming in what this game was going to be like at BC as we said at the top has given Virginia Tech problems oh its been a grind Fest here in this first half Applause Lankford the runner Applause Runner meets a good look you know again its its a good look its you know you leave a lot of time here though Music absolutely too much time for Virginia Tech a league Bay both teams four from three combined two for 21 a league Bay Isaac and he buys it at the buzzer a good ending for the Eagles to cut the deficit to five he gave a good laugh by BC Prince of League Bay gave them a good lift saw the floater a couple minutes ago and a good way to end the half little physicality that Mike young was talking about its why he wants much to facilitate a little bit more I thought BC did a nice job against those two guards medulla and Couture making them have to work Prince Alibi hit a huge three to end the first half not this time punched away though by Makai Ashton Lankford and Jaden Zachary does not start the second half he didnt start the first time in his bc career 45 games two and a half minutes on the bench with a ankle injury it looked no worse from the wearer deep free by Matson rebound by TJ Bickerstaff and offensive rebounding a point that Mike Mike young made to us in that interview thats now nine offensive rebounds for BC a league Bay a balanced picker staff cleans it up thats 10 offensive rebounds for BC J bicker stop Four Points hes averaging seven and thats a number thats why I want a pass to Padula EC only had two offensive rebounds Chris in their win against Stone Hill on Wednesday night just two foreign nice play design out of Halftime by Virginia Tech nice little slice cut there from Sean Padula good pass for months bicker staff calling for an offensive foul by Brian OConnell part of this official official crew with Roger Ayers and Matt Potter you know Justin Muntz is second on Virginia Techs team and assists yeah the pass on the other end and then uh well I got him out of order here theres the charge for months and then heres the pass and you designed that on the chalkboard at halftime nice Cut there by Petula and Justin butts a willing passer out of the post Music thats a Couture first match of quiet in the first half you can go off though at any moment as you saw in the ACC tournament last year when he was the attorney MVP mutts and Roger Ayers says thats a foul you know the other thing two BCs done a good job with is you know they found themselves having to switch onto these bigs and so youve got a guard in Makai Ashton Langford there on mutts and just stays in front takes that one right in the chest your Earl Grant offensively you heard from him but whats your message about offense well its probably what its been all year I mean theyve moved the ball nicely I think shot selection nice when you can Bank them in I think shot selection has been good and you know the turnovers the points off of turnovers at least early in that first half brings some life into that offense I asked him earlier today about their shooting was he said its not so much about shooting in general its just about the quality of shots but the looks that theyre getting not the best Ty Ashton Langford driving the lane and he picks up a foul Hunter Couture so he goes end to end with a vengeance Music you know we talked about BC shooting struggles been a real struggle for Virginia Tech long rebound Makai Ashton Langford whos played really well tonight its been one of his better games hes played so far this year against a very good Virginia Tech backcourt Applause Music Applause to Safe point Music good news for BC is this is the type of game they wanted Music it really is they felt like they were going to get it because this is a you mentioned it earlier its kind of a quirky game for a lot of teams to sell 21st December 20th you have a 10day break you know whats in front of you players are going home after this one mentally its different isnt it it is yeah tour down the lane thank you mazzilli the industrious class and a foul Applause its on princely Bay his first and its been a struggle for Hunter Couture and they got to figure out a way to get him going you think a layup could maybe do that but once again that front quarter Virginia Tech coming up on the spot and you make the point about you know Earl Grant and his approach to this game Priority One was taking Virginia Tech off the threepoint line they could not allow Virginia Tech to come in here and make perimeter shots and they have done a really nice job of that Applause lead for the Hokies at the foul line pretty good at 73 percent Music Applause Ashton Langford knifing through the pretty land Eagles grab the lead first lead 56 for the first time and a turnover against Virginia Tech weve talked about how physical BCs been defensively these are physical drivers I mean he gets a nice angle here then uses that hes long you know hes about six threes hes got good length nice little artistic finish off the glass there Music deal by Justin Muntz slopping pass by Langford and theyll lay in by butts the cerebral mutts Mike young calls him the best defender hes ever coached did you see why I do he does it all hes really a terrific basketball player listen to Devin McLaughlin leads ACC bench players with seven points and five rebounds coming off the pine a Casta link for his heating up he has 13 he leads all scores again a physical drive Im surprised there wasnt a call I mean there had to be something there either a block or charge Jordan Petula how about that pass Applause and Matt Potter calls a foul on Hunter Couture but Makai has to leg for taking over a nice

year a guy who has battled a foot injury hes winning his matchup tonight against Sean fatula hes five of eight from the floor 13 points and its been his physicality I thought it started with his defense you know on the ball getting after medulla and so far in this second half Johnny hes really driven it and taken it right after doula oh youre right clearly his best game thus far as the Eagles have made five of seven shots to start the second half Music Langford ties brother to step back you like that idea step back used to make those routinely I also missed a lot of them too Im gonna dig into your army tape doesnt exist Music butts somehow works out of a trip a trip team and he hits not much you can do with that he is he is really tough so comfortable Savvy Devin McLaughlin to the Baseline Zachary first appearance of the second half Music Mara Langford cut off five months with four to shoot hes gonna have to hoist it he does Zachary runs it down for tomorrow Langford and out

you know look you get these games right before break you come on the road not a great crowd in here its mostly Virginia Tech frankly lets be honest Virginia Tech you assume theyre gonna beat its been a tough year for Boston College and Virginia Tech was dead in the water I mean they theyve been flustered the physicality has bothered them they couldnt get anything going and then Justin matsuchon Padula stood up in the last two minutes and they got a twopoint lead here and a lot of basketball to play I expect this this open ball screen Wing ball screen Jane Zachary or Makai Ashton Langford

Langford out of Worcester Mass Spin and good hes been quiet but thats a big time shot when those guards have gotten two feet into pain they have really done work Applause Blow by by Padula and another

physical game right no question about it both sides Applause Music Applause tomorrow Langford headmans a pass good catch by the former High School tight end McLaughlin Applause as were under a minute remaining an OT Ashton Lankford from the elbow rebound McLaughlin trying to tip that out you can go up there with two hands and grab it possession is King Applause theres five to shoot tomorrow Langford cut off the league Bay theres the Deep three Ashton Langford superb medulla nicely through the defense celebrated a bit too much perhaps Mike young time out well keep it here as little Aston Langford has a seasonhigh 21 points 17 offensive rebounds and Mike young mentioned this at the half they had seven offensive rebounds at the half and look at Grandpa zilli hes just trying to tip it out you gotta grab it man we need possession of the basketball you afford a team another possession and look it leads to a bit of a prayer for Makai Ashton Langford but you got to get possession there 17 offensive rebounds for BC and it just you know speaks to their effort and how physical they have been in and around the paint and I was preached in the last couple days of practice because they only had two offensive rebounds against Stonehill in a 6356 win now a threepoint Advantage timeout theres Ashton langfords line its been fantastic and take us to both huddles where are you going here on both sides well you have to foul if youre Virginia Tech but you know its one of those where and Virginia Techs not a pressing team its not necessarily what they do but its one of those where you youre okay getting the ball in bounds maybe you try to throw a trap on there you induce a steal and then and then you do have to lay a foul on NBC is not a good freethrow shooting team although Jayden Zachary and Makai Ash Langford are by far their best freethrow shooters for those who tune in expecting to see Notre Dame and Florida State that game will start on acc and extra I wont get right to it after our game but first things first this will be one of the signature wins in the short tenure of Earl Grant if the Eagles can hang on when he first ranked Hokies inbounding The Langford Brothers Demar gets it back from Makai and a foul and thats the guy you want to foul shop do is fourth Chris Eagles at the foul line dicey all year 67 percent on Demar Langford Juniors 58 percent so you got if youre Virginia Tech you didnt get a steal but you got what you wanted you got sub 60 free throw shooter at the line fourpoint BC lead money shot by tomorrow Langford theyre six of eight from the line Applause thankford Brothers combining for 28th of their 67 points how about the Hokies played in their last three meetings against BC all losses and two huge Shots by tomorrow Langford fivepoint BC lead wants to inbound and a nice pick up here just forcing them to take time the Doula trapped punch Maddox rebound chips on the Baseline Maddox gets it back he throws the ball away he got flustered and the Eagles can smell it with 109 remaining 15 turnover by Virginia Tech the most theyve had all year really good decision Zone press there and forced Virginia Tech to really stand up and take a lot of time off to the point where they needed a three at the end of that possession and threw another one away turnovers Boston College offensive rebounds have killed Virginia Tech Applause tomorrow Langford chased down by Matson Brian OConnell calls a foul hes got Darius Maddox so the Eagles will go to the line with 87 seconds left in overtime and the small crowd boisterous as you mentioned many of the Virginia Tech fans but be a stunner was a gritty win you know I I have a lot of respect for the way Boston College approached this game you know its a team that has struggled offensively all year but they manufactured stuff for themselves here tonight just saw there havent been a ranked opponent since January 2020 and the scoop by bazilly now its a threepoint game 18 remaining timeout pokies Music Applause even even that was an adventure I was gonna say it almost got away from mutts slipped off his fingertips Music I think its going to be that type of year this year the ACC though Chris crazy results yeah theres no theres no team you know like last year it was kind of Duke for most of the year and then Carolina had its run at the you know last month of the season Im with you John I I think its its just going to be that kind of a year as far as beat Duke last night you saw Pitt hang on to beat Syracuse Miami beating Virginia Miami beating Virginia by two that was a gritty win for Jim laronegas Squad Applause Music Lamar Langford to inbound finding Jayden Zachary as he secures it Packer is foul Eagles can begin the celebration less than a second away from their first win against the ranked opponent in almost three years when Harold Brad came here as Mantra pretty not pretty and put an exclamation point on this game with that one theres no doubt about that this game has been gritty and it was not pretty but fun it was it was a lot of fun to have you next to me its John Kempton will check in first for him hes been into replay Memphis transfer replaces shop Padula Music Applause although the eagles with a fourpoint lead dont forget Notre Dame and Florida State coming up Thats All She Wrote BC a stunner in Chestnut Hill Earl Grant signature win for him and the Eagles have won by five your final take Chris bottola its a big win they earned us you know they really did and
