see to deal with Armando bot set for the tip and underway controlled by zakai Zigler back in the starting lineup off a season in which he was lost to an ACL surgery he has been off with his shot early trying to get his confidence back with that leg as San dieago vesy in his fifth year joins him in the back courtner es be from the foul line no good in the rebound to North Carolina and that is RJ Davis wholl bring the ball up along with the freshman and the Freshman is today story for them Elliot Kau he wears number two our starting lineups brought to you by Dove men plus care Harrison Ingram gives Hubert Davis an aspect he hasnt had for several years bounce to bop this is Ingram his first shot good from free a r it to your point hes the most veral offensive player that Hubert Davis has has plays that hard match four position knocks down three can make plays off the bounds can ISO back you in and Bully ball you terrific transfer fine for Hubert Davis and hes an emotional tone Setter for the team as best into the paint to Josiah Jordan James another guy that came back as theyre under five on the shot clock vesy has to get rid of it Ziggler look to the clock fires thats off and it goes out of bounds itll be North Carolina basketball I like the teeth of Hubert teams early defensively and there is Hubert Davis in his third year 12th season on the staff hes used a handful of different starting lineups three of them in the Bahamas but they are healthy tonight corm Lian who was out with some ankle issues is available and well see action tonight for Carolina Tennessee so physical on the defensive end we watched hour and hour film with Tennessee last night the term tough and physical was said 30 or 40 times out of Rick Barnes in an 1hour film session not happy at all or pleased with how his guys played against Kanas he felt they were soft I expect Tennessee to play with an anger and a chip on their shoulder for the next two hours two and one at the Maui invitation they lost to number two Purdue and number one Kansas so here they are on the road dealing with a North Carolina team thats a top 20 bad pass inbounds right into the hands of esav and he stole it and heres d connect he takes it to the rack no good but he is fouled and D connect who has been an outstanding offensive Force for Rick Barnes team early will go to the free throw line to shoot two the graduate student who transferred from the University of Northern Colorado rabby anything soft and lack ofical against Tennessee will not work in this building tonight for North Carolina that was just that habit pass that Tennessee had bodies on bodies when the ball was handed out of bounds chewed up the play and ignite the Run game for Dalton connect for his free throw crawls over the iron this is the guy that led the Big Sky in scoring last year and over 20 a game 2223 and this year 17 and a half hes a terrific threepoint shooter and as Rick Barn preaches his team is built as you said on tough physical defense they want to see connect rise up a little bit on that side of the basketball already two free throw attempts for Tennessee only eight allog together against Kansas just their inability to punch the paint could do crosscourt Ingram again for three thats the bot hes two and two and hes got six early points you cannot leave Harrison Ingram hes too viable on that weak side they find him for those weak side bombs you got to stay hugged up the 55 in white they do and Bot will be a terrific match up down low V be the hard drive and its connect he fires some three and thats halfway down and out Davis hell fire a quick three no good battle for the boards Bott may do fighting for it and exactly what youd expect early in this game from these two teams where physicality is absolutely an emphasis well Armando Bott is one of the top rebounders in all of college basketball and his ability to run down loose balls rebound out of his area and Tennessee Ive been watching the first couple of minutes they are touching up Mondo Baker caught on every possession making him feel them defensively setting the rules in terms of the physical play that were going to bring to you tonight Hubert Davis from Carolina take pride in their ability to get to the free throw line as they drive from kadoo he kicks Ingram again no that short do with an offensive rebound Bott a little jump hook and that will go in I think thats where hes at his bu hes not it back to the basket power move drops set dunan hes very good man with a both paw six 7 ft around the rim Carolina up 82 thanks to two Ingram threes in that Bott baby hook James got SI and a pritty pullup as he goes right over RJ Davis he won the battle for the elbow to Josiah Jordan James thats a huge part of offense Withers takes it he took it right into orange arms and it was denied now connect instead of pulling up hard to the basket D connects influence on this game being felt its a twopoint Carolina lead Elliot Kau is the back defender in that transition defense he is not yet doged tough in those transition defensive stop plays Ingram behind a bankot screen thats off to the left so after hitting his first two hes missed his last two conect picked his pocket to Ingram and here he comes and hell flush it with his left hand talk about two impact players that have come to these programs Ingram for Carolina and connect for Tennessee and Mai connect got caught dribbling a little too often had the ball picked as they get it down low to Adu who lays it in what a pass by vesy man to lead ad RJ Davis right back at you they want to play quick they dont want to deal with Tennessees halfcourt defense if they if they can avoid it they hit three three so far you will get screen in every possession when you play Tennessee Ziggler pulls up high arcing jump shot thats a big sign for Tennessee his shots been off a little bit early yeah pretty simple offense though but that action has been good for Tennessee over the years against North Carolina a little side step up screen to get those 12 13t jump shots amazing how quickly Zigglers recovered from that tourn ACL and how hard he worked to get back until Barnes he was ready to go in Applause July Davis again thats too strong and connect with the box and theyre going to get Withers jayen Withers the Louisville Transfer but a foul trying to get that offensive rebound good quick start 1310 Carolina leading Tennessee ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires handed part by the Sonic foot long4 PB chili cheese Coney for a limited time only at Sonic couple of substitutions coming in as we take a time out the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research of course it was around that time where Rick Barnes was recruiting Hubert Hubert Davis to George Mason so theyve known each other for so long it was right after Hubert lost his mom the Barnes and Ru Davis are very close and here is a double dribble called against D connect at the point that that that was the first scholarship offer that Rick Barnes made as a head coach go to Hubert Davis and it kind of told you the vision that he had in how to build a team he wanted high quality character guys that were coachable wanted to be hard coach he saw that in Hubert Davis although he didnt get him gave his vision of how Rick B was going to be going forward for the next 30 plus years cormack Ryan into the game he fires and Off the Bench just too strong Ingram out hustle connect for that offensive rebound D connect wanted no part at the Collision for that ball B using his strike thats thats on D kect that was a 5050 ball that he gave a 20 effort on and I expect D connect to be the first guy checking out with the next dead ball thats the kind of play that Rick Barnes has very little tolerance for Jordan gainy ball handling now for Tennessee he is a terrific outside shooter so he and Zigler now in the back court and AD do will fire from about 15 17 ft away and knock it down I think its important for ad to take those open jump shots tonight Bott wants to stay in drop coverage for the most part he wants to protect that Rim ad has the ability to stretch it what a luxury that Hubert Davis has we have Kau The Freshman the preseason ACC freshman of the Year handling the ball takes great care of Ingram working on gain hes got the switch he wanted now they kick it they move it around and its Ryan again that time he finds the but for back Ryan the not C the last three years impacts the game here right off the bench just big time offense by North Carolina cuz Harrison Ingram playing ISO bully ball and he kind of double with a stunt and that ball got revers two passes to a wide open core macarine the most natural shooter that Carolina has connect again dribbling a near nearly lost it ji mshack into the game for Tennessee wearing 15 five in the shot clock as they start the offense way out top Zigler high and they have a run out they dont see bot down there with Zigler on him kadell finds him now deep in the paint and hes going to get fouled by ad boy and he catch that deep in the paint that is that North Carolina Run game 100 RPMs I go back to this movement of the ball you double team Harrison Ingram and its a simple Swing Swing to corm Ryan in that far corner but its all starts with a playmaking ability of Harrison Ingram Ravi think about what Ingram is doing for this team knocking down 50 of his threes hes their number two in assist hes their number two rebounder and he leads them in steals touching the game in every area is King five and one hes got eight points early on and Amando Bott knocks down his first free throw hes having a very good year early at the strike making about 85 5 86 of his free throws hes been a 65 free throw shooter well I talked to him in Atlantis about it and he said all Ive done is just kind of slowed myself down Im not rushing at the free throw line one simple SP smooth motion thats a major jump I mean he was leav four five points a game on the charity stripe last year no longer the case Ingram and vott will get a break here for North Caroline into the game Jaylen Washington 13 and Zaden hind number one ad do will also get a break as were at the 1247 Mark well get the Under 12 timeout so theyll get the extra breather there 2012 North Carolina leading Tennessee Carolina has made four of nine from three its interesting Tennessee trying to set the tone early of how physical the games going to be theyre screening right now at ravian to of slipping screens you want to set the rules of the game man set hard screens dont slip out of them they got a good action off of it just an air pass and the turnover is by Tennessee early yeah they had gain on the Baseline wide open he wasnt looking for it and the pass from Josiah Jordan James sails out of bounds the number one defensive efficiency team in the country is Tennessee from the outside that is Jaylen Washington made a couple of Threes already R theyre not reacting to the ball on the flight youve got to be there and take away the air space the numbers drop dramatically if youre within 3 feet of the shooter on the catch and they increase dramatically if youre greater than four feet four turnovers early for Tennessee and they are down 2312 High screen set Kick Ryan three no good loose ball another 5050 ball in the hands of Carolina Ryan fires again hell end up shooting three free throws Josiah Jordan James fouled him right in front of the Tennessee bench what a start for Carolina theyre on an 80 run as we take a Time out when we come back Jimmy part of the ACC SEC challenge his all time ACC team one I was at Arkansas and know Rick Mar told us today one things that he always admired about Dean Smith was Deans ability to get a shot off in special situations and we played Michaels team in 1983 they were ranked number one undefeated we made a basket about 4 seconds too where they called timeout I remember coach Sutton saying hey they will get a good look and sure enough they threw it to half court called timeout the very next pass got Steve Hill a pretty good look from the corner Dean Smith still one of the alltime best ever in those special situations and what what is one of the things we watch them work on today during shooting round that that exact same that exact same thing Hubert had a play with 5 Seconds too 4 seconds 3 seconds and two ran makes all three of his free throws this is the largest deficit as you take a look at the great legendary coach eoy Williams of course the court named after him lead at 2612 this is the largest deficit Tennessee has faced all year they were down 11 to Kansas and on the other side Carolina had double digit leads in five of their six games and in their loss to vill NOA they led by nine at one point where is Tennessees offense going to come from theyre down 26 to 12 here are under 12 to go gains going to try he pulls up thats contested and that is off look at the tough twos that Tennessee has been forced to take in this game their inability to get the ball at The Rim very concerning Davis gets the switch he now has Josiah Jordan James on him M Ryan Twisted both ankles we werent sure he was going to play he obviously is and making an impact they got M Shack off the floor up and in by jayen Washington hes got five Tennesse playing really small right now mshack had to play that defensive by position tenness is going to have to find their groover its a knockout punch early for North Carolina see backed up on the ropes connect corner sets the screen for gainy and now Mesa he goes with 10 hard drive soft touch no good and we may get it on the floor there was a clear out of Josiah Jordan James he was in the air it looked like he was push from behind and it will be a foul against Carolina well this is one of Rick barness best offens teams that hes had that they have struggled shooting the ball from distance 17 out of 63 in their last two games at Maui and Im very impressed with with North Carolinas ability to hold up in a physical game they held up against Villanova I think hbert Davis has his guys beli in that they will not be out tough this year cuz they were multiple times last year and finally connect connects he needed that a threepointer from the corner off the inbounds the last Carolina foul was against Seth Trimble who is arguably their best Defender he wears seven Ryan the hard take resty flips it up and it didnt go but he will go to the free throw line where he is deadly well D connect can take and make guarded shots hes all of 66 theres not a lot of space there Trimble the best defense the player that Hubert Davis has is checking but kect can rise and fire and find the rim about any time he want hes been careless with the ball so far in this atmosphere and defensively the loose ball still by bothers does it not bother you well you saw that in the tournament youve seen it here and I assume in the Big Sky having not seen him play as often as we do now he he probably was relied on to create his own shot to dribble a lot he made 77 threepoint field goals last year hes a 38 three shooter and this year Jimmy he has scored into tonight 35 more points than anybody else on Tennessee and he made himself into a player cuz dton connect had no offers out high school he had to go to Joo and then to Northern Colorado but absolutely has worked himself into a guy that will be on an NBA roster next year now the defense and the topness theyre still growth in front of him but you cannot deny the offensive skill of three and orang Lions made all five of his free throws they are up by 15 Dany driving against Trimble well see how good he is defensively connect dribbling again to James Lane open and he drove right by his man for the flush Washington got beaten again Josiah Jordan James wins the elbow you drive the ball or cut through the elbow or the nail offensively you win games Ingram back in Washington low against connect he got a picked by Applause vescovi James drives again and he will lay it up and in right by Jaylen Washington Hebert Davis is going to have to get Washington out of the game cuz he is no Factor right now on the defensive end just blow by open up the hips and Triple J takes advantage of it 15point lead cut down to 11 Davis long three oh boy he banked it in that was unintentional but its three more points for North Carolina and they may get a foul underneath after on Zigler seean Trimble got tied up and they will call that foul on Zigler look at RJ Davis going to his left thats what you want to force him to do make him deck it and go to his left and theres the hard contact Ziggler and Trimble whats the what argument do you have you have no argument Carolina with 33 points Barnes talked to the officials and theyre going to take a look Music at the monitor Hubert Davis is asking what it is in fact that we are taking a look at you saw that lowering of the shoulder it was Josiah Jordan James who went over to the officials and was pleading something but a red hot start here for Carolina Tennessee hasnt allowed more than 35 in the half this season and we got 926 to go whats the contact again between Ziggler and Trimble and just a shoulder by Ziggler knocks Trimble down its a common foul on five in Orange I agree with the call think about Tennessees defense right now they lead the country Ravi in defense defensive efficiency only allowing 87 points per possession I mean 87 points per 100 possession okay Houston 879 Mississippi State 89 those are the only three teams in the country holding opponents below 90 for every 100 possession in Rick barness Squad defensively they find their teeth in this game they have the ability to get hot on defense crawl their way back in wide left wide open backs can backed in throws it up and in and he is having his way with anybody hes in double figures with 10 and its 3519 theyre shooting 60 from the floor where was the fight by dton kect though on the one bounce back down James is left open he pulls up and hes keeping them in it Josiah Jordan James they are finding Tennessee those elbow jump shots and its its not the highest percentage shot but theyre taking what North Carolina is giving them defensively kog get James on him Trimble Baseline right up in front of connect off the window thats an assist though by Armond bacot to seal his guy off and just carve out space for the rim attack really well done by bacot good hands Trimble and a whistle and a foul on vesy boy a couple of good defensive plays by Carolina Ingram and now Trimble clean picks of Tennessee dribblers yeah North Carina has been really good now with their hands defensively without fouling just Tennessee a lack of respect for the quick hand defense of North Carolina theres that seal off by bacon on mhack just opens it up and tremble a kid that doesnt shoot balls out of the corner he makes plays out of the corner a frustrating Santi vesy tells double z to scoot over Pon loic hes into the game for Carolina D coach here he has the ball in his hands guarded by connect ad do back in the game as well good give go up off the window Trimble takes that pass from B I told you hes a guy that makes plays out of the corner he doesnt shoot out of the corner and the hard fast violent cut by zth Trimble The Cut Is Right Through the midsection of the lane Ravi he doesnt shortcut it gives himself a little bit of distance for the pass watch the cut this is a violent cut by Trimble once he gives it up right through the middle of the lane to Perfection here 12 points against Arkansas well see the Razer backs and Duke one of our ACC SEC challenge next maack in the paint he threw one up and missed it kadoo good pass bot camped underneath hes got a chance for a threepoint play and the heels are having their way you have to go back to Kindle Marshall to find a point guard for North Carolina that brings that ball with ziping gas and finds people as well as Elliot Kad Armondo vott runs and establishes his big rear end right in front of that rim and it is over the speed of two The Power of five Tar Heels our donkey stomping Tennessee I was in Atlantas with Armond Bott and he said you got to get one when he come to town it was delivered last night to Perfection its a big time burger at the Town Hall burger and beer and then I was the first one ever the first ever to sample kads Chicken and Waffles its new on the menu and I was the first one served served it up last night a big time place what tremendous people in there you know we asked for a diet soda and for some reason they they they didnt have it they couldnt produce could find one 10 minutes later Ava delivered a bottle of diet soda she had sent somebody or herself went out to get it so to Ava to the owner ship town hall to K Mondo to you unbelievable effort last night myON well I mean Tennessee might be thinking about postgame food as well but they were in the timeout saying listen its still a game Jonas auu interrupted Rick bar said its Pride at this point like either you want it or you dont theyve double up our points we got to take it one possession at a time you can see Martin hes trying different combinations he got gainy back in the game they have a freshman who they believe is going to be a big time player the 611 241 pounder out of Scar brro main he wears 13 thats JP Estrella he has the ball now he just did a phenomal job of sealing off on that last play and getting a lay up another turnover careless by Tennessee Ingram pushed out and he throws it up and he crashes into the photographers there well see who that foul is going to be called against as we remind everybody its the women who take Center Stage the SEC AC challenge starts with number one South Carolina theyre going to be right here in Chapel Hill the Tar Hill women are rated 24th thats s eastern time and then Virginia Tech and number seven LSU Angel Reese back with LSU after missing four games both games on ESPN and the ESPN app thats one of the biggest story lines in the womens game Angel Reese has missed the last four games with no explanation the most outstanding player at the final four success has a way to test you well see how Angel ree in that LSU program moves forward is certainly a rocky start to the season for Kim M and her Squad but phenomenal Talent is Angel Reese Trimble goes out gaining into the game number two for Tennessee and with that layup that puts him over the 1000 point mark in his career and he of course was to St USC Upstate and Carolina goes full court pressure here 4423 Carolina shooting about 67 for sent from the floor its been a different story for North Carolina as that three ball was M by Tennessee I should say as that three went begging and then aella knocked it out of bounds and hes going to get called for a foul grav Cameron cars coming out he just checks in and shoots a first side of the floor one pass contested threepoint shot Rick Barnes pretty much having the same conversation with him right now I mean this is a learning experience but we came here to win if youre Rick Barnes and you cannot allow a guy to just stay in the game cuz you want him to get experience too many kids think they have a right to play thats right and Bott impr free throw shooting knocks down another one arond Bott double figures with 10 hes made all four of his free throws he and Ingram have 22 of the 45 points and its been an awfully impressive performance by North Carolina here in the first half Abby hanging out with Bott in Atlantis I I know this from spending time with that young man he cares greatly about North Carolina basketball he wants to do special stuff this year but his respect for this program is as good as theyve ever had as a player Z Jordan James to 10 turnovers have been a story seven of them for Tennessee only three for North Carolina s minutes to go in the first half bounce past to Bott that time better defense and it was Estella he just ran into Applause CH try to back down kadoo gets some help and its Ingram who had it connect to the rack and Lace it up and in well very fortunate though because again you start scraping down on that ball and Tennessee Not Strong with it at all getting the ball Ravi outside of their shoulders and outside their hips man defensive hands come in just eat it up well knowing what the DNA of Tennessee is North Carolina is playing Tennessees ball game arent they they they are out toughing right K tried an alleo there to Bott and a hand got up and its deflected out of bounds by James but everything that Rick Barnes preaches to his team thats exactly what Hubert Davis does with his team his team is doing it well his team last year broke AP part on him Hubert Davis did and theyll be the first one to tell you they had a lot of stuff to flush down the toilet and get behind them but they are connected theyre together its a talented group again the transfer of Harrison Ingram and corack L has made a huge difference in this Carolina team Davis tough shot fading away thats off the iron and it is Tennessee Applause basketball a lot of basic is what Tennessee calls it motion offense out of Tennessee early again one pass a guarded three thats not how you get back in the game spell found him again they good they are winning the pipe part of the flooor is North Carolina and Rick Barnes now has to go with another big Armando Bott Pau speed power Tar Heels rolling 3 well the Run game is hot right now and Bott just takes off on a Sprint and once they get the ball to kadoo he has already thought one pass ahead kadoo is the type of kid he knew where he was going with the ball before he ever got it and thats that pipe part of the four that Im talking about that Rick Martin talked to his guys about today if we dont win the pipe were not going to win the game Bott is certainly along with kadoo controlling that part of the floor got to see loss to Purdue number two number one Kansas and very much in danger here the 544 to go down 4827 a pass there and coming over the top is cormack Ryan hell pick up the foul I dont know what the record is for points allowed under Rick Barnes and a half half theres a real good chance is going to be set right in his career possibly Kate Phillips is 12 hes got that mask over his nose hes into the game now hes a freshman on of Jacksonville Applause Alabama James pulls up for a three thats off to the right way off and Phillips picks up an offensive rebound and now he loses it cadel oneonone with mshack uses his body misses right and the follow up and they are winning every loose ball right now theyre the faster team theyre the tougher team but theyre also the faster team to all those 5050 balls connect with a cut throws that in with his left hand do connect is starting to pile up points let me see this about corack Ryan hes from New York City and he brings a toughness and a Swagger and Moxy to this North Carolina team that they have sorely missed High arcing three to Long gainy may have got away with a push in the back on bot Conex got 11 Phillips in the paint Ingram got his hand on it no foul but itll be Tennessee basketball yeah they get a couple of guys you know RJ Davis is a White Plains New York guy Ryan you said out of New York kosza West Orange New Jersey kit they have a little East Coast flavor here he will go to the bench they got a half aund with 454 against one of the better defensive teams in the country and hes three no good deflected out and theyre going to get a foul on Phillips underneath ni foul called against Tennessee and as we head the other way we will remind everyone what a college football lineup for you this weekend Friday night 800 Eastern Time Washington tries to stay unbeaten they face Oregon for the Pack 12 title tremendous game Saturday at noon Texas Oklahoma State Big 12 Crown 800 Florida State unbeaten Louisville ACC Championship ship and then reent company at noon Eastern the exclusive reveal of the college football playoff semifinals right here on ESPN they caught knocks down another one they are 13 of 13 from the free throw line and we talked about it earlier Hubert Davis team has made 121 free throws into the game their opponents had shot 101 they made 20 more free throws than their opponents had shocked this season and they are now 14 of 14 in this game well they are clicking offensively as well as Ive seen them all year I just did their three games in Atlanta so they they played well down there but again theyre doing this against what is ranked as the number one defense in the country coming in blowing out Tennessee in every facet mhack tries to drive and he is able to put it up an in I just dont think I I know I dont I know you cannot jump shoot your way back into the game if youre Tennessee youve got a hard drive to get yourself to the free throw line and lock in defensively bad pass connect Picks It Off takes it and flushes it Ingram thought there were maybe an extra step or two D connect now with 13 this is the eighth half that Dalton connect has been in double figures out of the 13 halves of basketball Tennessee has played this year connect got a hand up and that may have affected that shot from Trimble Phillips pushes that was deflected by Ingram he tried to deny it but its out of bounds off Carolina look at North Carolina taking care of the basketball only four turnovers Tennessee all already with eight and RJ Davis and kdo combined for seven turnovers total in Atlantis and 170 plus minutes the the value of taking care of the ball connect underneath theyre going to call it on the floor Withers came over connect really didnt have an opportunity to come down with the basketball its 5233 under four in the first half all Carolina the spns inclusive presentation of college basketball presented by Continental Tire is brought to you by the United States Marine Corps so far it has been Carolina winning the physical battle and they are up by 20 one DC sweatshirt and treated like royalty in that restaurant was speaking a royalty Bott is putting on a show Tennessee by the way is shooting 60 and theyre losing by 19 connect will go to the free throw line and see you H and its going to be on Bott when slow to get up North Carolina made that run to the title game Armando Bott was dominant for a three or four we stretch sprained his ankle in that semifinal game it bothered him really all of last last year this is a guy that has the capability of leading North Carolina back to another final four appearance this year the pieces around him are in place Ravi yeah this is Hubert Davis one of his better threepoint shooting teams that hes had 37 coming in last year was their worst threepoint shooting team but make no mistake five in white has not started off like Zack Edy or Hunter Dickinson but you look at all the Kim pal ratings for National player of the year right now hes in the top 10 and has not even touched what hes capable of being his rebounding numbers are what jump off page at you and yet tonight hes doing it by scoring 15 points and making seven of seven from the free throw line kadoo tough catch by Ryan oh a good play by Cormac Ryan on a 5050 ball from kadoo he drives then the floater no good they caught battles but mhack has it good job of making K finish over size there loose ball picked up Phillips dribbled off his foot out of bounds another turnover for Tennessee and think about how clean North Carolina has been with the ball coming into tonights game R ravy North Carolina had faced 408 possessions versus Man defense they only turn it over six times a game in the true halfcourt offense thats as good and as clean as you can be with a ball in a fastpace system Kell finds his man Davis and have numbers he takes it to the oh thats pretty he plays with a chip now Im telling you there was no all ACC accolades toss towards him this year I think it kind of Burns in his gut a little bit and this kid is Razor tough right now lasered in on the rim from the three and the rim hes got Applause eight Tennessee offense stagnant relative to what were seeing from Carolina of gainy pulls up and he hits it over Ingram it still to me is a simple game the quality of my shot versus the quality of your shot North Carina obviously winning that math equation Davis with a blow by reverse hes got the last four and hes now the fourth member of Carolina in double figures in the first half theres not one guy for Tennessee that has any pride in guarding the basketball right now not one its been a long time since Ive said that about Tennessee defensively but they have lost their identity in the last six or seven Bas JY left open for a three thats surrounding Out Phillips had to go off his head but he controls it the 56 points the most Barnes has given up since 21 he gave up 55 to Georgia in a first half in 21 this is the most since then now watch RJ Davis he was huge in Atlanta is 23 against Villanova 30 against Arkansas and he is really Rising as a sixfooter from that threepoint line but his explosiveness and his toughness and his grip to seek that Rim hunt the rim and finish over size very impressive wears number four because his birthday is 1021 so if you take the one the zero the two and one it adds up to four 1 0 is 1 plus 2 is three plus 1 is four thats why he wears a number Applause four Elliot kdo is the Difference Maker for Carolina allows Davis some freedom off the ball jiah Jordan James Pops in his 11th point of the first half trying to imagine what Rick Barnes will tell his team in the half I I can tell you for an hour last night we sat in the film with him and for an hour that guy right there used the word tough and physical no no less than 3540 times and the message was sent but it was not received B out of ball left R they triple teamed him Ingram so easy Ingram has now made his fourth 3point third of the half when you can shoot a pass uncontested a bad pass that bounces up to you at knee level that tells you the lack of urgency that Tennessee has right now covering up shooting and His Hands deflected that ball away they tried to get a back cut from connect J theyre going to have more than 60 points against Tennessee in the first half assuming they score two more Dan tough shot good box out that time MAA was pushed out of bounds by Davis they keep pushing it Ingram again no good you got gainy another wide openen three in and out theyve had a few of those in the first half a a minute to go 5939 Carolina they caught James battling Applause underneath Davis Withers takes Phillips and thats a bad pass he got trapped on the Baseline oh boy connect nearly threw it to the official this is not a game where you miss a shot look at the bench or look at the officials asking for a call The Adult connect as good as he is this a big moment of growth for to make plays for others and knock down shots stretch the defense he plays that hard match four position but North Carolina they they are playing with a hot ball this half Tennessee has chased more than theyve defended on their own defensive end one thing that I love about Harrison Ingram and cormack Ryan guys that have transferred in they have ownership in this North Carolina Jersey this year theyre not renting it right and Hubert Davis had a good conversation with me in Atlanta about the fact that these guys have come in and they have absorbed everything about North Carolina basketball theyre not here to rent that Jersey great pride and ownership from Harris Ingram and a great first half he played all 40 in a game against Arkansas two double doubles and three games in the Bahamas theyll try for a Last Applause Shot Hands deflected they have a second he fires and no good and we are going to have a foul or not I think cor MC Ryan is going to to go to the freee throw line to shoot free throws the official blew the whistle the question was did he get the shot Music off and when does the officials arm go up on the call there I dont know if they called mesak for the initial reach on the floor before floor before we cant see when Ron grs arm goes up there just now Creeps in on the left side but when was that call made point1 I think hes going let few free throw thats yeah Cormac Ryan goes to the strike where the team is 14 for 14 and hes five for five you wake up thinking you were going to see a team Carolina put 60 in the first half up against Tennessee or any team this season do that well Im shocked because I know how good Tennessee is defensively Im Im not surprised cuz North Carolina has Firepower to match anyone out there that was a big boy body blow game that they held up with Villanova in overtime in Atlantis and theyve got all the pieces and a lot of Mojo no respect by North Carolina for Tennessee defense in this first half just flit them from the opening tip 61 points in every which step for Hubert Davis so we are set for our second half of our Sonic Blockbuster and its been a bust for Tennessee four different guys Ryan Davis Bott Ingram combined for 52 of the 61 Carolina points get our thoughts from myON who talked with Coach Barnes or was talked to by coach Barnes in just a second as zagler has the ball Tennessee tries to crawl back a do tough shot but he gets it he was certainly frustrated not surprisingly but I said you know what was the message at halftime he said he told his team that was the worst 20 minutes of basketball thats been played at Tennessee since Ive been here he said were going to find out in the second half what were made of but he said there were defensive breakdowns lack of effort but he said its the worst it has been since his time in Tennessee boy did Bott just move Adu from one side of the paint to the other and an easy bucket and I I agree with Rick barness assessment of his team you go back and watch this first year and this is a program that has really established himself nationally as a standard of physicality and defense toughness body blows none of it in the first half in the second half Adu just accepts the move of Bott esy Adu was planted down low and that time Bott got behind him thats a foul on a chance for a threepoint play well the the ball has moved faster on that possession for Tennessee than it did the entire first half and North Carolina played with a hot ball in the offensive in their first half and AD do does a good job of just slipping out of it showing his numbers to the passer that all starts with that Boomerang fast pass up top gives ad do an angle Carolina attempted 10 more free throws than Tennessee in the first half ad do makes his first and only free throw of the game Tennessee seven of seven from the line and Carolina is 16 of 16 how good is Elliot Kau and RJ Davis for the ball again one combined turnover between two point guards on the floor so good so clean and efficient he go six assist no turnovers Bott and its all going arando botts way this is the bounce back game they assumed they were going to get after what happened to him during the tournament good position that time a and a foul by Bott he reached in they working on Armando Bott down low ad do twice now Jimmys got behind him well this is where Bott I think has to continue to grow and hes never been a pound you back to the basket guy drop step dunk you and his Defender but he is good with those finesse shots from four five six feet really turning either shoulder I talked about how tremendously he cares about that North Carolina jerseyan program but hes going to sit out with three fouls and I know its a 21point game but but things can change for Tennessee because of their capability on the defensive end and they lock up right now with Bott on the bench and cut into this lead so Washington comes back into the game Jaylen Washington the sophomore out of Gary Indiana at 610 had a hard time defending the Tennessee bigs per square foot theres more banners in this Arena than any arena in college basketball thats a we walked in today and started looking around at all the banners the final four National Championship banners the retired jerseys the jerseys of Honor first team academic AllAmerican banners the banner the local Banner company is doing well in Chapel Hill James three no good and a good Rebound in traffic for M Ryan they will try to push it worked for them in the first half Ingrams three thats good push the ball electric by Kad and he throws strikes he doesnt throw balls high and wide he delivers right in the shot pocket nine out of 10 times connect he buries a three they left team open thats dangerous but kdo with seven assists no turnovers in 16 minutes hes a reclassified kid that could be a senior in high school this year however he is 19 so hes old for his class right man I talked to Hubert Davis about a month ago he said this kid sees it a play or two ahead of most well they set up another wide open three and Ryan carries it eight assists for Kad it all starts with that paint punch by Kad he goes right and rer and if you cant take it away hard to guard two in white Carolina N9 of 18 from three thats a 50 clip vavy lost the ball and its Carolina another turnover a lot of oneonone action from sanag esy I mean thats not even a screen set just kind of a fake screen that kadoo just works off of and theres that power push with speed that kadoo even off balance man the pass is thrown right at Bel level cannot do it any better goes to the bench Jimmy and they increase their lead CAD pushes again and theres going to be a foul underneath either on vesi yes it is on sanago vesi now Hubert told us this morning what an experience itll be for a guy like Brian and kadoo to play in this environment Ingram we havent seen how theyre going to deal with being at home in front of a white out and Id say theyre doing fine I thought it was a great Point by Hubert because theres 21000 here and the place was jumping and sometimes you worry about how your own guys go beyond the magic level as my head coach Eddie Sutton used to talk about they were at the right level from the opening tip PR season number one last year did make the tournament after a final four appearance for Hubert Davis a couple years ago if you look at this team and its early obviously jimy what a test here and they have the parts and the Pieces good luck again and he missed the layup Ryan a good pass from kadoo hes got that Vision a do that short tipped up and in by Josiah Jordan James yeah Im with you on North Carolina though it it it is early but the class of this league is Duke in North Carolina and Duke will have to be at least 10 points better than Arkansas tonight in Bud Walt Arena they have played in some hostile environments over the years but nothing like is waiting for them that theyre going to see when they walk out of that there you go kadoo Drew two that left Washington to clean it up connect he trades places James knocks down a three Josiah Jordan James is having a terrific game hes up to 17 on Seven of Nine shooting when you look at Tennessee they got Dalton comes in 38 from the three gainy 38 Josiah Jordan James 42 good shooting ball club that North Carolina has clamped down on so Applause farell hard drive and he will go to the free throw line D not be assertive with the dve one led to a followup FL concern because North Carolina has had a lot of freedom moving the ball anywhere anytime they want to and Tennessee came in the numbers said they were the best defensive team in the country but you know Baco is a type of kid that he knew he owed North Carolina a big time game on a big time stage he did not show up as a score in Atlanta as he dominated the glass but if you just sense the seriousness I did about him today when he was the first guy on the floor an hour before practice started more than capable of having that all americ type season and getting this tarhill team back to a final four look at the group that hes in only those three guys have 70 or more career double doubles pretty good company for the guy who named the Mondo burer Ziggler finds Adu and thats too strong Washington rips it down no sign of any let up here and the pass down low kick Davis three buries it poyer they moving that hot potato around yeah he gets that ball from his chin to the rim in a split second a small guard that gets it off quick again that ball movement from North Carolina has been so good just their awareness Washington noan always got a shooter on that backside bomb area total understanding of how theyre moving the ball as North Carolina 17 assists in the game Roy Williams told me he had a burger named after him as well is that right Im just thats what the coach said and when the coach speaks in this building what are you going to do question not of course he had a burger named after connect knocks down of Applause three 54 first round guys out of North Carolina in the NBA draft seven national titles 6 three first Applause allamericans Trimble all the way blocked that time by Adu whos it going to go against its going to be Tennessee basketball if youre Tennessee you look up just about 15 to go in the second half can you get this thing close to 10 with 10 minutes to go would that be a really aggressive push but thats the number that youre playing with right now after Rick Barnes do with a little slow they have found something with a in this second half ad had a fight himself after the way that uh he was watching Applause bot engram with 18 back on the floor Davis boy a lot of contact hes going to go to the free throw line to shoot a couple of course this being vwe and being here in North Carolina one of my good friends and of course one of the greatest alums ever from North Carolina stent Scott who played football here of course very involved he passed away from cancer but was so significant and continues to be the heart of some of the fundraising for the V Foundation he played football here he gave the commencement of dress here in 2001 he died in January of 20158 years ago get his impact on this campus to so many people here around the country to be felt through the vwh weve all been touched by that brutal disease like 100 of your donation goes to cancer research which is so important Jim its gamechanging research it really is and the number of people who survive and live after being D diagnosed with cancer is huge relative to where it was as recently as 20 years ago you can join the fight against it visit vorg donate 100 of your donation 100 goes directly to cancer research and of course we now see back on X dick vital voice slowly coming back nobody has done more in the fight against cancer that ridiculous you think of this week and you think of Jimmy V and then you think of Dick V oh my gosh and his commitment to that cancer research especially the Pediatric side of it and that entire year that dick by was battling back from cancer Rick bar sent him a prayer a texted personalized prayer every single day that Dicky V was going through that fight I think Rick bars is one of the guys that dick vital is going to have honored at his Galla coming up this next summer Davis pull up three way too strong the hustle will pay off and another rebound and that is going to be a shot clock violation unbelievable Hustle by Carolina and then the loose ball picked up by Trimble amongst three Tennessee players quicker more alert and more urgency by North Carolina tonight from the opening tip you got guys watching from Tennessee why the guys in white are pursuing the basketball an ugly film oh for Rick Barnes to digest when they get back to knoxfield foul on Jaylen Washington its a good story about Jim valana that was shared with us today I told you he was one and three in this building he won his last game here but when Carl Michael closed down they played one of the last games there may have been the last game there he was coach for North Carolina State the game ended the ball was being taken and he grabbed the basketball after a loss because he said I want to be the last guy to make a basket at carmik yeah he went made a layup right layup connect right off that inbounds thats been a play for Tennessee he buries another three and the lead is 1 you mentioned carmichel Auditorium I think about the old flip cards in the corner sure the guys used to stand there the score and we always thought it just to have an extra score for the players thats wrong de Smith wared it there so when he watched film he can always see what the score was because youre filming a game your student managers theyre not going up for the scoreboard they actually carried that tradition over into the dean dome for a couple of years got away from it connect thats thats what he can do we can talk about his lack of they got to run out they got two onone Trimble Ryan had it BL what a play by gaty this is a big trip here and theyre going to get a foul on for mat Ryan all of a sudden the momentum moves to Tennessee with Bott and cadil on the bench well Tennessee has 2 minutes and 39 seconds to work with to get this thing to a 10point game what effort and no give up out of gaining zai Ziggler puts the brakes on that defender on the trail side runs him over and a big possession right here for Tennessee to just have some type of belief that were hanging in this game Ka Zigler continues mentally to work back from the ACL physically hes there mentally its another challenge hes only got two points tonight on one of three shooting connects in the guy with 26 fade away and he will shoot to Ryan picks up another foul now Rick Barnes goes isolation for Dalton connect those are similar size guys similar athletic ability and cor MC Ryan just lost his discipline the very into of the play here we go woo pig is waiting on Duke 95 tonight right after us Bud Wallen what do you think that atmosphere will be like its going to be off the charts especially considering they named Bobby patrino the offensive coordinator for Arkansas football today that just the Mojo is working right now fville I got people texting me to out tickets Im camping out but I I dont feel the P those guys theyve been in big games before but that atmosphere will be unmatched its the 30th anniversary of that title game where Scotty Thurman knocked down a huge shot from that right side to give Arkansas a national championship I will say this Trevor Brazil from Arkansas went 0 for four against North Carolina down in Atlantis and only had two rebounds hes a pre season all SEC guy projected first round draft pick he has to show up tonight in fville for Arkansas to have any chance a made a decision yet on traymont Mark do they know if hes coming back to play I I would be very surprised if traymon Mark plays tonight I I think he might be even be another game away that was a very scary fall in Atlanta it took him 3 hours to get the feeling back in his left leg he that he had a 34point game going another loose ball and got to make sure in the corner there that Elliot kadoo is okay he ran right into the bench he was run over as Josiah Jordan James went to get the basketball there was no intent on it but you put yourself in kads shoes hes 61 Jordan James is 67 220 and theres no room to Applause land kind of landed awkwardly too slipping into the bench hes okay 15point game Tennessee had the defensive chops now to get a couple of stops in a row were about to find out and put game pressure on North Carolina he got K back in the game roic has the ball on the right wing Tan on the shot clock and Davis thought about a fade away he didnt take it now five cadil penetrates he got blocked by two different guys Phillips was the last one to come over James in the paint no good went after it bacock picks up it on the rebound and now AR has numbers Davis huge thats a huge turn right there Im telling you if you all the guy to catch it and the closest Defender is 6 feet or further all the analytics say that Balls going to drop about 47 48 of the time connect boy thats pretty he takes that one and hes got 29 RAV its the Long Reach of connect thats so hard to pick up on film but his ability to make guarded shots at The Rim not only from the threepoint line but that Long Reach they havent got it to a 10point game they still have 90 seconds to go but all right we got some complaints from Jay Williams J bis Danny Ferry called on social its a its a list you cant win because people have favorite players favorite schools but your teams would compete very well would very well if you dont agree with my five who do you take off a turn over there is this more about Tennessees effort or about lack of execution cuz it feels like Carolina gets a chance they are making the buckets yeah thats well Tennessee they got the fire lit underneath their rear ends at halftime my was probably pretty kind in terms of what he actually reported what actually happened WoW connect 301 just going right through North Carolinas defense hes physical Drive hes 11 of 14 from the floor hes missed three of his 14 shots 14 Point Le can they get it down to 10 Ingram double quickly and he throws it away gaining a foot race will win it lay it up and in here come the volunteers getting a little Restless inside the Dean Smith Center now the good teams have a way to figure it out within the game they dont wait till the next game or the next film session and Tennessee has pushed that button in this second half good pass inside Bott will go to the free throw line very different second half for Tennessee well D connect his confidence offensively is off the charts its a good as anybody in college basketball that drop coverage by B was had no impact at all and the you talked about gainy just wins the foot race to the ball you look all up all of a sudden and 21000 are dialed in here right now saying we got a lot of ball left in front of him saying who did Jimmy put on that ACC team all time my phones blowing up by former players and the AC no ones happy others do some fall into the others receiving vote category the great Kennedy dyes wants to know Bernard King question mark I I agree with her Special K from Special K to Special K a rare Miss by Bott 13 points Jim a three gets him to 10 there 1014 to go the connect has lived oneonone Ral Simmons the most ever against the Carolina team 35 connect good defense thats a jump ball did he have arm or was it all ball from RJ Davis he had arm and ball right in front of Ron grov connect drives this ball watch the reach in right there thats thats arm and ball but Ron Gro sees the ball first that got he got scraped on that elbow and have to either get this Blood issue fixed within 20 seconds Rick Barnes is talking to be official like well how do you think he got a bloody elbow may not have actually even occurred on that play but its such a big possession I talked about it four minutes ago at the 10minute Mark can you get it to a 10point game theyre capable right now with 14 on the shot clock gy can still bust a three connect got that arm wrapped theyve been very good Tennessee has in short clock situations from Baseline out of bounds under and now they go side out of bounds connect a dangerous guy as the trigger guy that you can lose if youre not careful theyre playing that oneonone game hes got Ingram on Applause him 5 Seconds to shoot it gy rises too strong Phillips may have pushed off from the backside and he did that was such a big possession norina got a chance to go down and continue to push this thing away from that 10point Music Mark FL go inside the Bon just look at Tennessees lineup who they had to try to check him with go horn series first I dive Bott back screen foring post him up this is Bott time right dont you freshman pH there is the double from Ziggler he knocked it out of bounds it will be an automatic double team with bot with his small lineup Ziggler is so quick and so low always at ball level so good at scraping down in those double team situations Withers is wide open underneath wide open and he missed the layup theyre turning it over theyre missing some shots they didnt and connect all the way to the r lays it up and in Dalton connect 33 points lead down to 11 graev he is a first round draft pick Dalton connect and no one thought that when they picked him up out of the portal but offensively he could score in an NBA game right now his career high is 34 hes one off at that kadell passes it up Ingram he made them all in the first half he missed that one theyll get another chance thats off and thats out of bounds off Carol game pressure is on North Carolina for the first time in this game and its all because of dton connect he was loose with the ball in the first half but hes much tighter now with the drive and hes keeping the ball lower he was high dribbling through traffic the first half hes low power dribbling the second half my gosh what a comeback by the volunteers heres a big one from Zigler he rattles it in a threepointer 8274 and Tennessee has made a statement you find out about your team in adversity way more than when things are rolling first time they are within single digit since the 1247 Mark of the first half great drive there a crossover by RJ Davis the senior such a good layup maker there was bodies all around for in white and his ability to lock in on that rim and that loses concentration connect double team he should have numbers James th out of three Bo Z would just hit one and hes comfortable and confident he would launch that one and he didnt and he missed the twopoint Applause shot AAU trying to get position on Phillips they threw it away good effort that time by Kade Phillips the freshman and you cant feed the post when you have to is a big concern for Hubert Davis what a comeback by the Tennessee Volunteers call people and tell them to put us back on a lot of people left he got to come back are you sure they left folks down in fville hostile is not a strong enough word for whats going on in Bud Walton Arena right now I dont know what the next word is but its above hostile Maron what happened during that timeout gold conne is given everything he has they were working on his right cab with a massage gun some cramping issues OB Les putting out a lot of effort in this comeback effort he had cramps in the Syracuse game he found Josiah Jordan James the lead once 24 is seven how about to fight in the toughness by conect because they doubled the ball out of his hands but the Risen fire to reverse the ball connect has grown up they go too here Jimmy and trapped on that sideline Davis Phillips The Freshman Bott the veteran Bott should own Phillips right now at The Rim Davis oh thats huge as she fired a Applause three The Moxy that this kids playing with this year is as good as youll see from a small guard con pulls up the front of Bott thats short maybe some tired legs cramping legs didnt have that elevation as good as hes been thats probably one that would hed like to have back I know Rick Barnes not at all pleased with first side of the floor no pass jumpers Davis pretty pass bot and theyre going to get changed he thought he had all ball foul on Josiah Jordan James watch dalon connect though two possessions ago the traing life out of him but he rises up and finds not only the this the second guy around round the skip pass was perfect and then look at RJ Davis real jumper Davis from that three ball right now so far this season at one time Jimmy has Tennessee allowed over 90 points since 2019 only once and that was to a Kentucky 2021 team they gave up 107 thats over 90 were talking about another free throw pull him within one of that watch Bob the other thing about his free throw RAB he doesnt stare down the rim hes gets now watch right here just at the last second gets his eyes on it and shoots it thats much more of a natural shooting stroke how many times in a ball game do you catch the ball and stare it down for six or seven seconds before you release it you dont hes turned his free throw into a much more natural shot Crow on his feet here at the Dean Smith Center for the first time all might B out of bounds and its going to be Carolina Ingram got a hand on it went off the connect Tennessee has been been so good in the second half playing with a clean Ball but just careless passes and Ingram talked about his versatility on offense he can literally and has guarded two through five this year for H pendo its going to be a foul on the floor before he shoots hey Jimmy Saturday the T heels open up conference play right here in Chaple hille theyre going to host Florida State 200 Eastern time on the ACC Network Conference play right over around the corner gives us an opportunity to kind of look at both of the conferences Tennessee was the preseason pick to win the SEC Kentucky has looked awfully impressive out of the gate last couple of games high scoring kind of back to the Feelgood days for Kentucky offensively Reed Shepard Dillingham theyve been outstanding a little Freer theyre a fun watch right now Kentucky is I would give them an advantage four or five weeks into the season over Tennessee at this point I I was on that Kentucky staff there will be a lot of dogs and a lot of babies named Reed over the next year in the blueg grass state right just mark it down gy too strong great Rebound in traffic by Bott got to make him you dug yourself a monster hole you got to make the open ones in the second half they caught a rebound away from another double double we saw you that impressive lift hes on he spins into the middle and in traffic Ingram picks up the rebound and he muscles it up and he will shoot a couple it was some contact and he may have hit his head on the floor as hes lifted up by his teammates well the free throw attempts in this game were getting ready to be what 249 in favor of North Carolina I thought bot got fouled right in front of the rim did a really good job of speed rolling that naked empty Corner ball screen action he didnt get the whistle but now Harrison Ingram goes to the line and this will be the 27th and 28th free throw attempt against Tennessee at nine at nine that is a major major story when remember Tennessee only eight freeth toe attempts in their last game against Kansas Harrison Ingram recently had said Id never had this much confidence here in Carolina and a day like this and in front of his crowd and the performance putting up its only going to increase look Hubert talked about it last year they they didnt have a reliable effective Wing player that could back somebody down that could extend with the threepointers that everybody we played had him I needed to get one inam is certainly delivered hes fil that void and the lead back up to 15 and the crowd back on its feet get corner and thats a big three it comes off the hand of gainy and a quick timeout for Tennessee the lead is 12 and it all starts again with Dalton connects toughness and size to get the ball out of the double team Swing Swing their comeback still get five minutes youre down 12 Eric muselman May coach the game without his shirt on weve seen him celebrate after big he made coach tonight without his shirt that have a positive impact it could or it could go south kill with 10 assists and no turnovers Ryan back in the game thats short ad picks it up they need stops they need points better to get on top of D connect he got a mismatch on the inside Kau fighting with all hes goty with four fouls they double him ad do was waiting for it eagler no good and a loose ball and it goes again to Carolina Hubert Davis doing all he can to make sure Dalton connect doesnt beat him has continued to constantly double the ball out of connects hands ingr again this is what they missed the last few years Davis now that Villanova backd down how about Villanova losing tonight to St Joes by double fidgets Zigler has a on the roll there it is and he had the alleyoop but that may be the fifth on Ryan and he is fouled out of the game cormack Ryan is out all right under four we go 9280 Tennessee with the ball when we come back ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires Blue Devils Razer backs coming up Final Four right here between Tennessee and in Carolina the sevenfooter that plays the guard position really can drive it can shoot it so good with both hands and thats where Trevon Brazil has to impact the game tonight for Arkansas you cannot allow Philip palsky to go in there and get 25 26 points Brazil has the athleticism and the link to stay up with him and make life difficult how impressive has Elliot Kau been in this ball game RAV he always have 10 assists and no turnovers no turnovers no turnovers that every day right with just one point thats an amazing stat that you would take absolutely as a head coach in your point guard big Miss there from zakai Ziggler a chance to pull it within 10 it stays 12 as he missed the free throw Rond Bott picks up another double double be first of his career double team on Ingram and then Zigler backs off 338 to go and heres the countdown with 5 seconds he got James in the air and he threw up an airball and another hustle rebound by Carolina that went off the iron good Hustle by Zigler to keep that from going out of bounds this is a must possession for Tennessee at least get to the free throw strike stop the clock but they cannot come up empty theyre going to hang in this game connecting the left corner now he comes out and picks up the ball hes got Trimble a great defender on him and he goes finger roll with the left the Long Reach again 35 its really unguardable cuz Trimble is the best oneonone Defender that Hubert Davis has and just no answer for the Long Reach of the law by Dolan kect they come down to free throws for Carolina theyve made 24 of 28 in this game another big possession for a team trying to come back from 24 down this is punch four for North Carolina theyre four guy backing in isolation Davis High arcing three2 strong loose ball out of bounds off Tennessee the film sessions going to include loose balls that went the way of North Carolina theyve been a step quicker since we started this game yes they Applause have Carolinas got Davis Bott and Ingram with 20 or more points tonight three guys 20 points or more pidel fires to the corner Davis by arer the floater no good and thats a good call there was a push from the back on bof not a real aggressive push but its just Applause enough for BT Smith to make the call connect right there gets his elbow yeah he gets his elbow and then extends it into the back could a call on Bott G pushed as well how big has Armando botts free throws been so far this season even in this game 10 of 11 so far tonight 22 points think career 69 60 or maybe even lower but last year was at 66 but simplified it one motion the costly ones though right now down the stretch 11 rebounds 22 points at 66 6 right last four years and 86 tonight now 10 of 12 and each one down the stretch here is huge little too strong there and Adu has it wow they will double connect again and get the ball out of his hands thats going to be a foul on Ingram Ravi why would you reach a foul 30 ft from the basket your double team is comeing to get the ball out of the hands of connect and now youre going to stop the clock and with canana lost their discipline against villain NOA they fouled three threepoint Shooters in that game which ultimately was probably the difference theyve left the door open now with another undisciplined play defensively here Davis described the winning against Arkansas as the happiest hes been as a head coach because of the response Barnes is getting a similar response tonight from his Tennessee team on a half he described as the worstest team has ever played since hes been in Tennessee throw the ever word Applause around hes waiting to get maack defensively with this well have 37 points as a visitor at the vindo Ral Simmons had the most ever against Carolina 37 so hes matched that that was in 1988 with Lal you take 8 you out and come you to the full court pass in whos that off of its off of gain they cant check until it gets to under two minutes but you got your full court your best manto man defensive squad for Tennessee is on the floor and Carolina has to handle it make a second or third cut Trimble got rid of it quickly neck almost had it but heres Kell and they will settle it down they led by 24 at one point and were going to get it time up let talk it over with 2 minutes and 1 second to go jimm in the NBA Friday night youll see the Celtics they are coming off a game in which they made 21 threes and theyre 8 and0 at home they will take on Joel embiid who is the leading scorer in the NBA the night cap is Kevin Durant whos second in the league in scoring at over 31 points a game joic is seventh in the NBA in scoring Boston the best record in the league thats a terrific double header on Friday night the ESPN NBA double dip well Dalton connect will be scoring next year in that league as well 37 is the most by a UNC visitor in the last 14 seasons and most against any UNC in any game since Malik monk had 47 December back in 2016 in Lexington all right with a 9284 score in a Timeout lets go back to KC in the studio yeah and ravy we want to let you know Duke in Arkansas is underway right now over on ESPN news no traymon Mark the huge story for the Razer backs Tyrese Proctor has an early three Arkansas has just answered a 43 lead its up next here on ESPN Ravi all KC thank you its really interesting what the message to Dalton connect is going to be because on one hand hes got 37 points hes kept them in this game but on the other hand we saw some of those decisions lack of hustle in the first half I wonder how you think Rick Barnes presents the postcript about tonights game to him I think its going to be a tale of two Hales this kid has grown up within this game tighter stronger tougher with the ball in traffic hes made winning plays even as a noncore although he has 37 and hes held his own defensively and it is a must stop possession for Rick barness guys where does Hubert Davis go after the timeout you love Koo Davis going downhill vott should have at least a free throw opportunity at the end of the POS Applause possession Davis pulls up thats a tough shot thats off to the right rebound byah Jordan James connect goes and gets the ball he drives and oh boy he may have hurt his leg it seemed to almost give out he didnt have any explosiveness off that left ankle going to tie that that shoe he went to take off J he just had no elevation watch that left ankle right there Ste on the foot of Trimble rolled that thing to the outside are you kidding me and he just stepped on the foot of Trimble there didnt appear to be a lot of contact created by Trimble but this is a a huge development as connect is unable able to get up with that left ankle roll well theyre already without toe aaka all night long Tennessee is because of the Roll ankle that occurred out in Maui is a big bruising sophomore that impacts the game defensively and on the boards the concern now for Tennessee obviously is the health of Dalton connect cuz we saw that thing roll out when he stepped on Seth trimbles foot he tried to tighten it up with his shoelaces then realized this is going to take more than tightening up my shoe grav its the last step on Trimble right here Music oh watch the replay hes unable to put any pressure on that left ankle as hes tried to get up and went back down as hes agonizing in pain with 37 points you can see slaps the floor in frustration medical staff Maiden wal out there to help the match off you can only hope if youre a Tennessee fan that thats an ankle sprain and not worse and one of the alltime great performances by a visitor the dean doome all on their feet showing their appreciation for this kids effort tonight and when he cramped up against Syracuse in the preseason tournament he then had said after hed never cramped up in his life he had never experienced that this is obviously not a cramp situation but Dalton connect sits on that bench somebody else will shoot the free throws for Tennessee obviously with a buck 39 to go Jonas ad do was going to be the free throw shooter yeah Hubert Davis gets to make the choice the injured player cant step to the charity tribe so they go to Adu ads one for one from the free throw line tonight 66 this year is AD do and two big ones right here with connect on the bench given what hes been able to do tonight you have to wonder where points are going to come from ad calmly knocks down that first free throw Tennessee has shot 65 from the field and 64 from three in the second half theyre going to sub a do out and get again a a more active quicker defender on the floor for their fullcourt press as he comes with Kade Applause Phillips you continue to work on the ankle of connect the pressure from Tennessee is Ingram and kadoo try to bring it up two possession game and Kad will be fouled by gain go to the line kadoo has attempted four free throws hes made one tonight well this is the next step for kadoo because right now hes not a closee out point guard from the free throw line r hes 52 from the chy stripe coming in and theres nothing theres nothing wrong with his stroke its not broke but he has got to become that late close out keep the ball in my hands trust me the free throw strike well done for Hubert Davis Elliot Kad a magical performance with the ball tonight running this high octane offense and its high octane against a good defense great defense in Tennessee theyve got 94 points no connect for Tennessee on the offensive end zler Dany Rises too strong rebound maak ripped at it thats off the foot of kadoo good Hustle by jamai mesak a good job by North Carolina though when they did switch they switched out and absorbed the ball got outside that threepoint line no airace for Tennessee to operate off of no Dalton connect on the floor he is on the bench with a ankle that was rolled he has 37 points and you almost have forgotten about Santiago vesy who checks back into the game well he comes for offense right now mhack the defender sits D wide open free short esy got the rebound and kicks it Zigler needs it no good and its Davis who pulls it down with a minute to go and an eightpoint lead got to get him right had two good really really good looks KY had one Ziggler had one Davis is a 91 free throw shooter this season and quite a statement for North Carolina especially in the first half and they opened up a 24point lead with less than a minute to go a chance to bump it back up to 10 well this is a year that North Carolina has their eyes set on establishing North Carolina back on the national level and their schedule now going forward Tennessee tonight they just came off of a tough two game stretch Villanova in Arkansas but Florida State as you mentioned earlier and then Yukon Kentucky Oklahoma all before the Christmas break and this team will be tested but they are built to pass every one of those tests they can beat anyone but I just mention that four game stretch coming up Carolinas made 28 free throws tonight Zieglers High three finds the bottom Rick Barnes was looking for a foul he didnt get the call sevenpoint cushion with 497 to go Rond bot 22 points 11 rebounds 10 of 13 from the free throw line hes so good on the move for a kid at 611 and timeing time again Hubert Davis got him the ball on the Move instead just camping him down on the low block and he just sent the message to Tennessees defense especially in the first half several times just right through the chin into the rim with the ball good with a finesse AR lets Crown tonights player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire and that is Armando bot they did a terrific job of getting him basketball he goes into double figures and rebounds in the second half nine turnovers total in the game 12 for Tennessee and you can see how that was such a onesided number in the first half its become a lot closer thus the game has become a lot closer well if youre just now joining this Rick Barnes was very clear with myON at halftime this is the worst Tennessee has played since Ive been the head coach in Knoxville in a half in a half but they have this is a team with a lot of maturity and a lot of Pride about how theyre supposed to play the game thats the biggest concern for Tennessee absolutely Dalton connect rolled his ankle he stepped on the foot of Seth Trimble and that left ankle roll he was in the middle of an historic offensive night here at the Dean Smith Center with 37 points on 13 of 17 shooting and in intense amount of pain the walks the last 50 seconds they get it into Davis the quick double team comes heres he going to go with it Zigglers in his face and he call a timeout and now North Carolina will be stuck on that Baseline and thats not an easy spot to get it in from Tennessee really good at face guarding and forcing North Carolina to work and then Davis had to pick up his dribble once he did hes only 6 feet tall on that length of Rick Mars press took away everything and theyre just a stop away and a steel away and a basket away from a lot of pressure still being on North Carolina if youre Hubert Davis right now youve got to get the dad gum ball all as Roy Williams would say inbound Music safely to your point you know you look at certain teams the way that it broke down for Tennessee playing Purdue and Kansas North Carolina nows going to deal with Yukon in Kentucky Yukon is another one of those teams the defending national champion whose early season schedule out of conference has been crazy they have a game Friday night against Kansas so Donovan Clingan at 7 two will deal with Hunter Dickson and then Tuesday they get Carolina that Yukon game is going to be at the Garden as part of our Jimmy V Classic on Tuesday I just I I I really believe Kentucky and Tennessee a little bit of separation between those two and everybody else in the SEC right now but that that League yes that league is extremely deep though rabby dont be surprised 8 n possibly 10 but here are youre stuck in this short corner for North Carolina not a lot of room to operate you cant back up as a passer tight space to work with brutal pass and that went off of the hands of Zigler now Harrison Ingram is stuck in the other short corner with not a lot of room work with see he cant back up because of how tight it is right there ideally you like to back him up as a passer if youre AUD you get right on top of that out of bounds line cuz officials will seldom call it even if youre jumping on it and take away everything you can if youre agent got to get it in and get it over B hes trapped now and he throws a great pass to Davis and theyre able to break it a winning cut by Davis and the Press breaker do will get fouled thats the guy they want to send to the free throw line hes made last couple this could all but salt it away thats a ridiculously hard place inbounds with a full court pressure and BR K did a really good job with a second cut kept the ball moving know has a chance to prove that coach you can trust me as we move forward to close out games I am tough enough to step up when I have to make spends a lot of time with Marcus pige working on his shot which has improved immensely not only the free throw but his jump shooting ability as well and the first free throw looks really good I cannot wait to get back to the room and watch Arkansas Duke coming up next and Ive been in Bud Walton you have two and the building is about to explode and that could happen multiple times tonight a chance for Arkansas to race what was a poor outing in Atlantis without tray on Mark as gy takes it to the hole he lays it up and lays it in another timeout is called by Rick Barnes sevenpoint game 25 to go back to KC for an update on that one yeah and Ravi weve been talking about no trayon Mark for Eric muselman who else is going to step up how about caleff battle from behind the ark knocking down the three 13s on the scoreboard in fville the longer that they keep that game competitive the louder and more difficult it comes for Duke yeah well kaleth battle is a big time score and Eric musin has big time Wings remember in that exhibition game they just pressured the heck out of Purdue for two hours and got the win I know its an exhibition game but it felt like a real one a tremendous early season test for Duke whos already lost one at home look at the ACC I think theres some separation right now as well with Duke and North Carolina from the rest of the ACC Applause yep well you take a look at the two huddles this was once a 24point game and now down to seven we only have 25 seconds to go a lot of folks including Tom ISO whos a good friend of Rick Barnes came out and said he know hes my buddy but lets put a little pressure on him this feels like a final four team theyve been to the Sweet 16 theyve made the NCA tournament the last 5 years in a row sweet 16 last year in 2018 do they have the pieces and maybe connect and gainy being the transfers can get them back there and now that weve seen Hubert Daviss team against a very good defensive Tennessee team put up near a 100 do they have the pieces to do that I dont think theres any question both these teams are capable of getting to the final four now its its nov I understand that but you just look at their roster how its built on both ends of the FL I love the football out of bounds play right now as your press breaker K do lost it and its on the ground and the possession arrow goes to Carolina and kdo is feeling a little pain on his head after that that that football out of bounds under is unguardable Ive yet to see it used where they dont get the ball inbound clean cuz youre sending trips right all over the floor with different cuts its a legal Play Starting Out of Bounds like that it becomes a foot race and its a foot race right back to the ball here theyre all holding up their five fingers to indicate five seconds Ingram gets it in and the Press breaker delivers and will be fouled good job by RJ Davis cuz M Shack was a primary defender on him and RJ Davis is so good and so fast and plays so low even as a cutter to cut to get yourself open when youre on an island with one of the better defenders in the SEC really well done by RJ Davis North Carolina for the game is shooting 83 from the free throw line they have made 31 free throws tonight 31 points from the free throw line just just simplify the game R You heard say it multiple times as much as weve been together over the years make your free throws make your layups win games every single time if you can find one Rondo burer youre in Chapel Hill they get to 100 as Ziggler drives hes going to get fouled by kadu thats one of those that well have Hubert and his coaching staff kind of shaking their head like what are we Applause doing stop the clock maybe give him two more points bring it back to seven will be shooting more free throws down the other end grav its a big step forward though for North Carolina they were the most disappointing team in college basketball last year start off number one that did not even make it to the NCAA tournament had all types of issues on the floor off the floor internally but this is a connected group and Tennessee to me is still one of the top 15 teams in college basketball and they absolutely punked The Volunteers in the first half they sure did hey 100 points gets everybody here and this is important for you okay some Bojangles biscuits tonight no theres a rip off the free throw miss it stays with Tennessee Gaines three no good in the rebound and that will do it with four seconds to go 100 points for Carolina and a statement win in front of a packed House of 21000 at the Dean Smith Center 192 was our final score Carolina over Tennessee virgin
