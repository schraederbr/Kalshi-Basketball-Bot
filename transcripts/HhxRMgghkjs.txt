their first game back from that This is the first of two regular season meetings between these two and we are underway It is Cardinals basketball cheering Looks like Duke may be starting out in a little zone Look they played a fair amount of zone against Georgia Tech to try to protect the paint and keep the Yellow Jackets out of the lane John Shy has not been thrilled with their defense in recent games Theyve allowed 83 points per game in their last three and the wins over Georgia Tech and Florida State were both narrow victories Conwell in the corner to knock down a three Louisville did a nice job of getting the ball into the middle and then spraying it out One of the issues with playing zone against Louisville they like to shoot the three ball as much as any team in the country Isaiah Evans keep an eye on him Hes coming off a 28point game against Florida State Patrick Gumba with a settle and comes up empty Conwell behind the back off the back of the rim and its down to Duke One of the things that Louisvilles got to do in this game they have to play good defense without fouling because Duke makes more free throws than their the opponents attempt on the season and they have committed 48 fouls in their last two games to just 35 for their opponents A real area of focus at practice yesterday for Pat Kelsey And there is the first foul of the night The Blue Devils ranked sixth in the nation Again the only loss for them a onepoint loss to Texas Tech back before the holidays a game you and I had Jay they led by 17 in the second half Couldnt make free throws Theyre that close to being undefeated but still we got the feeling from John Shire today theyre not exactly where he wants them to be right now Well the first two ACC games and Dukes 20 in the league Duke gave up 54 from the field 50 for three and gave up 83 points a game in those first two games against Florida State and Georgia Tech Pat Kelsey in his second year as the head coach here in Louisville after very successful stints at Winthr in the College of Charleston And if theres a coach in America who runs a more energetic practice than Pat Kelsey I dont think you and I have met him There isnt one Conwell again just got a little drag screen in transition And with Gunga playing in drop coverage that just gave enough room for Conwell to pull the trigger He can really score He is a very good shooter who had a tough night Friday at Stanford Two for 14 from three Hes two for two already tonight Cam Boozer reverses it up and in Boozer and Gunga went with a little four or five ball screen around the foul line And Boozer is so good at pivoting around big guys Is it too early for A HEAT CHECK HES THREE FOR THREE Not a heat check if you make it He is explosive cheering What a start for Ryan Conwell The transfer from Xavier cheering Heres Evans on the bounce Left hand No follow No Woolly on the baseline draws a foul and a terrific start at the offensive end for the Cardinals Ryan Conwell is off to a red hot start against the zone in the left corner Then off the drag screen up top pulling up and knocking down that left hand jumper and he doesnt need much room A little jab step and he nails his third three in as many tries Kobe Rogers with the ball The first sub into the game for either side He has taken the spot of Adrien Woolly The foul by the way was on Cameron Boozer Sernand Fu looking for a cutter instead Finds Rogers And now another touchdown low And Fu is fouled Itll be Gumba picking up his first So one on Boozer one on GBA early Yeah Boozer was on a closeout on a terrific shot fake by Woolly in the corner And then a really quick move by Son Fu to go baseline And Gumba after picking up the foul will sit John Sh makes his first sub of the game Itll be Malik Brown You have to know where Malik Brown is all the time because his hands are so good He gets a lot of steals and deflections Leads Duke in both categories CONWELL ON THE DRIVE THIS time and he missed the layup Hits the floor hard but is back up on his feet Looked like he was surprised he was that open Kaden Boozer end to end and he draws a foul Boy Conwell got a nice little screen from F to free him up but it was almost like he was shocked he w he wound up that open at the basket and was holding his wrist There it is again Holding his right hand He is a lefthanded player but is obviously in some discomfort Keeps looking down at that right hand cheering Kaden Boozer starting his third game in a row John Shier has gone from Dame Sar to Nicholas Jimena now to Kaden Boozer as starters over the course of the year for the Blue Devils Fu back to McNeely Another very dangerous shooter The lob up top Too far for Fu This is where Duke is dangerous In transition And Evans draws a foul If there was one word that Pat Kelsey said more than any other word in practice yesterday it was transition Yeah they really have four keys Transition You know you want to tilt the floor and run but also get back and sprint back And then Louisville really believes they need to rebound at an elite level to win this game They also have to show physicality and toughness at an elite level Woo Evans knocks down the first free throw Fu and McNeely will go out for Louisville Woolly returns and Ali Khalifa a sevenfooter who is an outstanding passer is into the game He and Fu split time at the five spot and the offense runs a little bit differently when Khalifa is in the game He is as good a passing big guy as there is in the country Hes got a 40 assist rate as a big guy when hes on the floor Its ridiculous He has had six assists on three different occasions and he doesnt play all that many minutes And Boozer playing off him a little bit as he hands it off to Woolly who left it short got a clean look from the baseline Whos such a good rebounder at both ends of the floor Evans lines up a three and buries it And again he is coming off a 28point game at Florida State and made six threes in that game on Saturday Woolly overhelp there You You got to stunt at the ball but you cannot come off Evans like that How about Khalifa Not a guy who shoots very often And he banks in a three And hes not even smiling about it Kind of shaking his head as he got back down the floor on defense This isnt billiards You dont have to call it Thatll snap a run for the Blue Devils Put the Cardinals back on top Kaden Boozer a strong driver couldnt knock it down Heres Conwell again Takes a bump Woolly soarses in trying to get a piece of it Back come the Blue Devils in transition Evans again and its all knotted up at 12 Well Louisville really went after the offensive glass but that put him behind the play and thats the kind of transition theyre trying to avoid giving Duke Great pass And Conwell whos been amber for the first time made the free throws and goes to the bench Hes got 11 for Louisville And Isaiah Evans has the last eight for Duke On Evans now Evans gets the shot off left it short Brown saves it but into the hands of Cany Roots Hes into the game for the first time for the Cardinals Woolly What a finish Well Adrien Woolly has had some really good games He had 19 against Tennessee 21 against Cal The lefty is a good scoreer Pat Kelsey got in the portal in the off season and brought in three shooters One of them is Conwell one of them is Woolly and the other one is Isaac McNeely whos 40 on the season for three They can really hurt you from beyond the arc But Cam Boozer needed to take that last opportunity Woolly switched off on him He needed to take advantage of that Khalifa to Rogers who misses the three And theres an example Khalifa had an open jumper from the elbow but his first priority the first thing he normally does is look to pass as Brown and McNeely got all tangled up Well playing with Khalifa you know if you get open hell find you Evans not this time Boy Pat Kelsey cant be happy with how many looks Evans has gotten He was a huge part of the conversation at their practice yesterday Roots misses a three Foster having a much better junior year Has bounced back very nicely from a tough season last year as a sophomore Hes open Misses the three They went with the double team as soon as Boozer put the ball on the deck Rogers Khalifa his second three and he didnt even bank this one in Duke has been laying off Alli Khalifa Maybe knocking down two threes is going to make them adjust and have to come out and guard him Just 28 from three on the season but two for two here tonight cheering Boozer over roots and Cam Boozer has his second field goal of the night Its almost like Camboozer cant touch the ball enough So many good things happen when he gets the ball Hes an excellent passer in addition to being the number one scorer in the ACC Khalifa again AGAIN this time hes smiling and so is everybody on the bench He has the nickname the Egyptian magician because of his passing cheering They might have to change his nickname Keeps knocking down threes I dont know that anybody in the building on either side could have envisioned him knocking down three early threes A battle underneath won by Rogers Roots again around and out on a three that would have torn the roof off the young center had it gone in Foster on the drive Dame Sar in the corner cheering Now Evans with a drive too strong off the glass Wally ahead of the pack All contact technical fouls Gunga remains in the game with two Hes a very important player at both ends of the floor for the Blue Devils Up and misses with the left and he just picked up number three cheering of Duke has missed So many bunnies around the basket not finishing plays And what a big sequence Gungma and Prior with the technicals And Gungma picks up his third Wow And just trying to go after the rebound after he missed and got a piece of Conwell So now Gumba is Conwell knocks one down for the baseline So theyre without Gunga probably for the rest of the half Malik Brown is in And this is the largest deficit not only of the game for Duke the largest deficit of the season for Duke Although Cam Boozer knocks down a three to quiet the crowd just a bit Yeah just a little pick and pop by Boozer and Duke needs to get the ball into him at every opportunity Hadley defended by Nicholas Jimena The pass deflected away stolen by Jimena Sar in transition draws a foul Foul number three Thats his first 15 Well take a look at Boozer here Sets a ball screen and then just slips right to the threepoint line Sander Pru a little bit slow and trying to recover because he wanted to be sure to take away the drive But thats the versatility of Camboozer So Sar at the line for two as we send you to Chris John Sh during that last time out just trying to calm everyone down and saying its okay We got to start chipping away and it starts on offense And to Jays point about not finishing drives he said I need more offense or more effort on the offensive end I need you to drive harder kick out stop with two feet more effort on that side And Sar drove hard got fouled and a 50 free throw shooter on the season Jay its been a a problem for him but he made both there McNeely open Doesnt need much And he knocks it down cheering Boy just a simple little handoff And Cam Boozer was right in the middle of the lane He wasnt up to touch and you get picked off on that McNeely is a great shooter not a good one Hes a great shooter Louisville top five in the nation both in made threes and attempted threes per game They went six for 27 in the loss to Stanford on Friday Theyve already made seven threes here tonight in just 10 tries Now watch Cam Boozer in the middle of the lane Hes not up to touch on Fu and Boozer Kate Boozer just get picked off by that little screen off the handoff and you give McNeely that much space Isaac McNeely is averaging about 15 points a game over his last three and at Virginia last year he shot 42 from three Led the ACC and there you see it already more made threes tonight than the entire game in the loss to Stanford on Friday Sar into Brown off his fingertips and out of bounds Boy really nice recovery by Conwell He came off of Kaden Boozer who he was guarding on the right side as that pass was being made He moved on the air time of the pass to get a piece of that Jason Prior Woolly in Prior goes back to the bench again Louisville playing without Mike L Brown Jr Theyre outstanding freshman point guard but Ryan Conwells gotten off to a phenomenal start tonight Hes got 13 And when youre seven for 10 from three as a team youre in pretty good shape And right now theyre in pretty good shape And without Brown in there youre going to get a screening foul on Sandanda Fu But without Mike El Brown in the game and available you know Javon Hadley is playing the point when hes in there That frees up Ryan Conwell and Isaac McNeely to work off of screens and operate more as scorers without having ball handling responsibilities Second on Fu He sits Khalifa back into the game Came into the game with five made threes on the season Hes three for three from beyond the arc already in this one The more ball screens that Duke can put Ali Khalifa in to test his mobility the better Camboozer driving on Hadley and lays it in Well a really nice job by Malik Brown to screen off Ali Khalifa so he couldnt get to try to block that shot or bother him And whoevers covering Boozer in this case Javon Hadley last time down is given up a ton of size Theres no real comparably sized fourman on the floor right now for the Cardinals Anytime Louisville misses they havent gotten an offensive rebound yet Boozer again So a layin and a three And here comes Cam Boozer with dad looking on You have to make him use that screen You know you cannot let Camboozer reject the ball screen Hes got the deficit down to five Louisvilles led by as many as 12 Another three This time its Hadley Malik Brown just playing so far off of Hadley to try to protect the lane and got screened on his way out to bother that shot Sar little shovel pass into Malik Brown who couldnt finish Boy another close in miss by Duke Theyve had so many opportunities at the rim Crowd wanted Khalifa to shoot at hand Hell hand it off to Conwell McNeely has it Boy Conwell and McNeely two very good shooters Both got very good looks Duke catches a break Was that their first offensive rebound of the game I believe it was a menu the save And yes it was their first offensive rebound of the game Brown kick ball and itll be Duke ball when we come back 731 to go Bit bigger here out of this timeout Cany roots is back into the game and he has been given the unenviable task of trying to defend Cameron Boozer Kaden Boozer puts it on the deck Sar extra pass in the corner Pena and it might have been partially deflected there by Khalifa Really good contest in the corner by Ali Khalifa Whoa what a finish by Roots the sophomore out of Washington DC Yeah Duke just didnt have the urgency to get back on that possession Duke had gotten it down to five Now its back up to 10 Boozer trying to back down Roots who made him work hard but Boozer finishes nonetheless Well he hasnt missed a shot in this game has he Nope Six for six 14 points Conwell with another one his fourth three of the half You have to pick up Ryan Conwell in the parking lot cheering Talk about a green light And why wouldnt you give him a green light the way he shoots it better than 1600 points in his career coming into this game tonight Evans misses the runner Khalifa the rebound Boy great defense by Conwell to challenge without fouling This is where Khalifa can be so dangerous But instead of passing hell dribble it down to the block 10 to shoot Woolly find to shoot into traffic Roots for three and Jmena with a nice seal and a foul by Khalifa As we check in with Chris and Camboozer just came out of the game but in that last huddle with Pat Kelsey he said Whoever is defending him I need you on him and I need you on him early and in a way that only Pat Kelsey can do it I need you on him Well not only do you have to have the primary defender on him Chris youre right but you have to show him a lot of bodies and that can be a challenge because you also have to recover to Duke shooters that Boozer is such an adept passer to find people Boozer has six of the eight made field goals that Duke has in this game Theyve gotten seven points from the line but theyve made eight field goals Hes got six How about Gumba back into the game with Boozer a little bit of a breather and even with a Gumba having three feeling he needs another big guy out there Conwell not this time What a rebound by Roots LOOK AT THAT EFFORT cheering Boy and Roots went right into the chest of Patrick Gunga trying to draw that fourth foul Gunga had to back off just a bit rather than challenge cheering Evans into the corner Jmena short Prior saved it Young had it but its Louisville Bull Boy Louisville is flying around on the defensive end Even when they make a mistake theyre playing so hard An excellent job by Roots of just discarding Jimemena and getting that offensive rebound Theyre plus five on the glass in this game but the overwhelming majority have been defensive rebounds They havent done much on the offensive glass before that Prior thinking about it Crowd urging him to shoot it and away from the ball Contact and a foul on Darren Harris of the Blue Devils Yeah its just a hold as trying to come off that handoff action with Prior He just held McNeely 16 fouls so no free throws Boy when this program is good this building is one of the best Its just a great scene Its a fabulous building Freedom Hall was great I think this is even better Woolly trying to snake his way in Prior could not knock down the three Boozer down with a rebound So Boozers back but Gumbas still in the game as Malik Brown has gone to the bench So Roots is going to be with Boozer and Prior will take Gumba cheering Foster from six feet away Soft touch Really first point Really good shot fake and drive Good strength by Caleb Foster who is a more of a scorer than a handler Conwell has it knocked away Evans and blocked out of bounds by Roots whos been alloozer and Isaiah Evans have combined for 22 of Dukes 29 points Turned over a really good double off the dribble by Isaac McNeely Came with high hands to get that deflection A smaller lineup on the floor right now for Louisville That is saved but taken away by Brown Foster with Prior on him Drives up lays it up and in A really good move by Caleb Foster Thought hed get it back to Boozer because Boozer had Kobe Rogers on him Woolly shakes a defender Prior for three and Louisville now nine for 19 from threepoint range 19 of their 29 field goal attempts have been threes Boozer not this time Harris the rebound Foster short tipped by Brown Harris wide open Another offensive rebound And Duke goes 0 for four All from threepoint range on that trip You give up that many offensive rebounds you almost expect to get scored upon Louisville dodged one there Duke now four for 15 from threepoint range Woolly by Boozer Too strong Brown wanted a whistle Didnt get it Boy Willie did such a good job of taking Boozer on and getting past him Foster the trailer is Evans and in and out And Evans looking up to Tatum out with that Achilles injury Hes been MVP good He put up 50 on Saturday against the Clippers applause This is a really important twominute period to end this first half Can Louisville keep or perhaps stretch out this lead or can Duke eat into it McNeely a rare miss from the free throw line as she goes one for two Boozer oneonone with Roots whos given Pat Kelsey great minutes off the bench Crosscourt to Evans The step in and this one will go That might have been the toughest shot hes taken all night and then made it Evans now three for 11 10 points on the night Khalifa you got to be kidding me Hes got four threes already Hes Steph Curry tonight Amazing applause And he didnt hesitate at all on that one But if theyre not going to guard you thats a green light especially if youre three for three Good pass Great cut by Harris Couldnt finish but a foul Maybe just a little bit of contact as Cany Roots swiped down with that right hand as he was passing by Darren Harris Im not sure there was much contact if any there He might have caught him on the left arm And you can hear not a popular call here at the Yum Center Harris to the line for two for the Blue Devils A lot of people look at those as late calls but really the officials want to take a beat to process the entire play before they blow the whistle Left arm there He might have just caught him there Its hard to tell for sure but the official was right there Eightpoint game as Harris sits and Sar returns And the crowd still in an angry mood as the Cardinals inbound So Duke looks like theyre going back to that 32 zone that they started the game in Khalifa bounce pass to Roots who missed it They tried to dunk it by just laying it in off the glass on the other side would have worked just fine And he wanted a foul call Did not get the whistle Foster Evans lost it but fortunate to get it back Offensive foul Cam Boozer his second applause Unless he police the ball Should that have been goalending As long as he didnt pull it down First of all the ball wasnt up there when he hit the rim But as long as he dont pull it down music Meanwhile a foul on Caleb Foster his second and Duke going back on offense Cameron de Boozer will check back into the game Darren Harris is coming in for Duke as well Cany Roots is going to the line You talk about an energetic nine minutes off the bench for Roots Hes got four points four rebounds two assists a block and a steal Hes done a great job with his energy as well Hes been all over the place And make or miss here When Duke gets the ball you have to keep an eye on Isaiah Evans and Cameron Boozer together Often times Evans will set a screen for Boozer and then just slip out to the threepoint line Kobe Rogers in for the Cardinals replacing McNeely Kobe Rogers a very good defender back into the game for the Cardinals And the lead is back to 10 applause Remember theyre doing this without Mike El Brown Jr cheering Boozer bringing it up for the Blue Devils cheering applause Pat Kelsey is yelling at Javon Hadley No fouls No fouls And they went with Evans trying to set the screen and then slip out of it Wow Knocks down a three Isaiah Evans now with 13 Time for Louisville Conwell with A QUICK ONE HADLEY WITH A FOLLOW cheering What a what a terrific answer to that three by Louisville and Javon Hadley a nan missed some shots later on in the half but still hes the high score in the game with 16 as half number two is underway Boozer off the leg of crew and an early Duke turnover Remember Patrick to the second Three fouls for the Blue Devils And Conwell tries to split the double loses the ball and is slow to get up Foster lost it got it back and laid it in and he has been very determined to drive and get to the rim here tonight Yeah thats six points now for Foster and did a great job of getting into the body of Sander Fu Conwell knocks down the floater Boy Conwell when he gets you on his back he came right off that screen and Gumbbo was down in the middle of the lane playing drop coverage That was excellent use of the screen by Ryan Conwell Averages 196 Hes got 18 in this one Gungba oneonone with Drew Conwell the help and a foul They could have gotten Conwell from the backside with that left hand swiping down And thats where you have to trust your big guy and make Gumba score over the top Conwell did a nice job coming down trying to get the strip but just reaching down He caught that left arm with his left arm to put Gumba at the foul line Number two on Conwell Gungba a 66 free throw shooter on the season Now when Dukes having such a tough time against your defense from the field the last thing you want to do is put them on the foul line The 47 points given up in the first half by the Blue Devils the most points they have given up in any half of any game this year And again remember John Sh we talked about it early really not happy with their recent defensive efforts coming into this game in the games against Georgia Tech and Florida State Both wins but both close wins Hadley back to Woolly He gets away from Evans but cant knock down the three And its out of bounds to D Well a transfer from Kennesaw State the Conference USA freshman of the year a season ago made 73 threes and averaged about 18 a game at Kennaw Foster wide open Looked like he had a toe on the line and it is called a two on the floor by the officials They didnt communicate Louisville the switch very well and Sandrew just couldnt get back out there Fu oneonone with Boozer Let the battle begin Fu lost it Youngs got it And its Duke Ball You cant take that many dribbles Just got to make a quick move Evans back to Gumba Lots of time cheering Foster Nice kick Evans again short on the three Louisville ball Great box out by Hadley on Gumba Hadley in transition up and in Boy Hadley just beat Gunga down the floor and put Boozer in a tough spot but a great shot fake by Javon Hadley Boozer to Boozer and through falls on him and is called for the foul Thatll be number three on Sander Fu But does any big guy in the country pivot with the basketball better than Cam Boozer That strong low base and his footwork just so difficult for anybody But Son had a tough time but Patrick Gunga behind the play and Hadley got down the middle of the four quickly But that shot fake to get Camboozer in the air just big time by Javon Hadley the Colorado transfer So Pruz gone to the bench with three Khalifa back in for Louisville as Evans knocks down the jumper Evans got the stagger off the inbound Hadley step back misses the three Evans the rebound and contact underneath and its going to be Khalifa this time called for the foul Khalipa was trying to get through Patrick Gunga as he just stopped in the lane Number two on Khalifa and the third committed by the Cardinals here in the second half Thats what Louis Carnosaki used to call Its just a subway push Come on ref Its a subway push The double on Camboozer Very good defense by McNeely on that cut Kaden Boozer off to his brother and itll go for Cameron Boozer Boozer doesnt play above the rim but he just gets into your chest and creates that space he needs to get the ball up and on the glass Duke has not led tonight Louisville has led by as many as 12 But here come the Blue Devils again Good hands by Khalifa and the save by Conwell Boy terrific job by Ali Khalifa to get a deflection and steal and Isaac McNeely in transition draws a foul Foul number six Malik Brown for Duke His first Two shots for McNeely Duke has been more active defensively to start this second half in the first four minutes And the line for the card is number 10 McNeely Hell shoot two cheering The college football playoff semifinals are coming your way on ESPN ESPN and the ESPN app It begins Thursday with Miami and Miss and the Verbo Fiesta Bowl And then Friday Oregon and Indiana the ChickfilA Peach Bowl Coverage of both games kicks off at 730 Eastern 430 Pacific What a great week of sports action And of course the National Championship game Monday Jan 19 also on ESPN McNeely with a foul for Louisville Well that was a long drive by Isaiah Evans on the right side Ryan Conwell wasnt really in the gap there He could have helped off a little bit more off of Kaden Boozer in that right corner So four fouls committed by the Cardinals in the first 356 here in the second half and it sends a very good shooter to the line for Duke and Evans Well its not just the free throws here Its getting closer to the bonus And the earlier that a team can get in the bonus the more you feel like you have to back off cuz then theres free throws on every common foul and the more they might start going inside time and time again to Camboozer Exactly Its more incentive to drive the ball and try to create contact cheering Evans has had to work hard tonight but hes now the leading scorer for the Blue Devils with 17 ahead of Cameron Boozer Hes been a Isaiah Evans been a much more aggressive driver this season Mostly a shooter last year Great rescreen Conwell driving by Boozer cheering Rogers the save and it is out of bounds to Duke as Rogers was not able to save it Rose family and he couldnt he couldnt get it out when he met P Rose He said My dad milk laughter and then they then they ushered him away He blew his opportunity Help by Rogers there on Boozer 10 on the shot clock Whoa Offensive foul A lot of contact there and its number three on Boozer Yeah I think John Sh saying Come on now That much contact isnt going to knock down a player as strong as Kai Roots but give Roots credit He was in great position cheering and just took it right in the chest to get that call Boozer with three He will stay Guns got three Hes on the bench now Dame Sar an excellent defender 68 long armed is guarding Conwell He is not even looking to help Hes just face guarding him Roots for three Rebound Sar Little hesitation there by Foster Keeps the dribble alive Sar knocked away by Khalifa And it is Duke Ball with 13 on the shot clock Well Ali Khalifa has made a couple of really nice defensive plays by just reading the eyes of the passer and did it again there to knock that ball away Hes guarding Malik Brown so hes not worried about Brown knocking down a perimeter shot Foster got his man in the air and will head to the free throw line Has been uber aggressive all night long Looked like Kobe Rogers got him coming in from the baseline side but Louisvilles got to keep Duke off the foul line Theyve racked up way too many fouls to start off this second half Coming up next here on ESPN we will take you into the Big 12 and specifically to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence Kansas Itll be the JayHawks hosting TCU John Shabi Fran Fchilla standing by waiting to bring you that one But Foster missed them both Duke has now attempted 18 free throws to just eight for the Cardinals McNeely Foster all over him McNeely spins into traffic A scrambly possession and eventually they give it up Sar to a trailing boozer and a chance for three Khalifa having to backpedal just stuck his left arm in to try to knock that ball away It wasnt the strongest of swipes but still picked up the foul And if youre going to foul you got to make it to where Boozer cant complete the play He just rim run after he gave the ball up right down the middle of the floor And thats not the kind of foul you want to pick up It is number three on Khalifa Smanda has three as well We have a lane violation Khalifa was in early A lane violation on the Cardinals And Boozer will get another shot as Khalifa with three goes out Fu whos got three comes back in cheering And it cost him a point Conwell back in the Ryan Conwell checks back in Now Dame Sar is picking up Conwell again And Sar is not coming off of him So hes not operating as a help defender Hes just gone Conwell and thats it And he is long and rangy A good defender So really what Conwell can do is set screens for others Here comes Fruit Here comes McNeely Boy a dangerous pass They were so close McNeely strong on the three Rebound Sar and the Blue Devils come up the court looking for their first lead of the night Duke has been a second half team all year long But our defense is ratcheting it up in this second half for it and then he rescended the ask So there didnt wind up Jay being a challenge on the play Foster to inbound Boozer takes a bump and will head to the free throw line and Sander Fu just picked up number four Yeah Javon Hadley tried to get a steal on the pass out to Cameron Boozer and when he overran it you know that just gave an open lane to the paint to Boozer and puts Ananda Fu in a really tough spot And another foul for Louisville that puts Duke on the foul line Theyve just given up way too many fouls and way too many free throws early in this second half Thats the seventh on the team And that would have been a shooting foul anyways obviously But going forward Ducas already in the bonus with a ton of time left as that free throw ties it Fu is going to come out Hes got four Khalifa has got three So Pac Prior is back in And to be in the bonus this early is a tremendous advantage for Duke You know Dukes only got two team fouls in this second half And Louisvilles going to have to do a much better job on the offensive end of running offense They got four turnovers in this second half They only had six in the first half total And Jay that is Dukes first lead of the game 5453 And keep your eye on Ryan Conwell Dame Sar with his length and athleticism Hes not even bothering to help out Hes just faceguarding Conwell everywhere he goes Woolly jump stop open is Prior Long rebound down to Brown And here come the Blue Devils Well that was an open shot but Duke would rather rather have Case Prior taking a three than McNeely or Conwell Louisville has not made a three yet here in the second half after making 10 in the first half Well Isaiah Evans just lost his footing and was had his feet out of bounds while he still had a finger on the ball So thats going to be Louisvilles ball Sars having a great impact in this second half with this defense on Conwell Does Louisville need a a Woolly or a McNeely or a Hadley to step up and provide them with some offense here the way that Sar is smothering Conwell Absolutely But they need someone else to handle it so that they can use Conwell as a screener to free people up But Sar you know is taking him on oneonone and then when Prior sets that screen Malik Brown just jumps out to blitz it and make him give it up Conwell takes a deep one and its Duke Bull Its just taken away the rhythm of Louisville in this second half I mean that shot was taken without a pass and it was a deep one cheering Good help there by Hadley Recovers to Boozer Foster driving Woolly up and in with the lead Again he is driving and getting a piece of the paint constantly here tonight You know hes 65 but Caleb Foster just stayed low and used leverage on Woolly to get through him and past him And a nice little reverse by Woolly to snap a 9 Duke run Beautiful spin move along the base Theyre screening us and allowing them to get downhill Its making it look too easy for him So we have to fix this right now and raise our level of intensity Remember the four things that he said at practice yesterday Said them live on air to Chris at halftime He felt they won all four of them in the first half transition rebounding toughness physicality but he does not feel as good about those things so far here in the second Well with the physicality theyre facing you really have to run through your cuts And Ryan Conwell being faceguarded by Domar just ran right through his chest trying to pick up that foul and did just the third team foul on the Blue Devils here in the second half to eight on the Cardinals Conwell to inbound Nearly taken away by Foster Woolly blocked by Brown Woolly for three Got it Their first made three of the second half Boy a really nice job by Isaac McNeely to get into the middle of the lane and find find Woolly Louisville really needed that bucket applause and cheering Sar misses it the other end Dwey one on four makes a good decision Conwell and the Cardinals lead applause Well Duke got crossmatched It wound up with Boozer on Conwell He just took him on applause Conwell 20 or more now for the eighth time this season Foster drives again and scores again Hes got a dozen Boy beautiful rejection of the ball screen to get that left hand drive Strong drive by Foster as the lead changes hands again A miss by Conwell He might have rushed that because he hasnt had many opportunities in this second half cheering Foster little push off got away with it Evans knocks down a corner three Boy Ryan Conwell stopped the help off and that left Isaiah Evans wide open in that left corner Evans fourth three of the game Hes got 23 What a find as Hadley hits Woolly for a bucket Boy really smart by Louisville to lift up their offense and that cut came right off Ali Khalifa Khalifa set a great screen to Chris Buttons point about the Louisville huddle past the midway point here in the second half cheering Foster gains the paint again and lays it in again Foster is 65 and hes showing his strength This one went right into the chest ESPN Conwell did not come back on the court out of that timeout Hadley gets a great look and its gathered by Gumba Nine minutes to go Duke by four cheering Theyre leaving the ball in the hands of Caleb Foster to let him make a play He has been aggressive and physical all night long putting it in a ball screen Good pass to Boozer up top to Gumba Yeah thats beautiful in that short roll Then Khalifa has got to come up and help And that just opens up the lob Beautifully done And they get McNeely free for a shot A tough one that he lets short And Rogers does get Louisville another possession But Isaac McNeely has had very few clean looks in this game for the Cardinals Yeah Tommy Sar put a lot of pressure on it Looked like he might even foul him but he was able just to pull up a little bit short And good news for Louisville Ryan Conwell back in the game And Sar going to go right back to Conwell And Conwell can take advantage of this face guarding by Sar by acting as a screener at times because youre certainly not going to see a switch if theyre face guarding All kinds of pressure on Conwell Still lots of time on the shot clock Hadley could not finish around Boozer Just a difficult shot especially when you dont have your dribble to try to pivot around In this half the Cardinals shooting just 33 and just one for 10 from three Brian Conwell has been exemplary So Louisville needs to have an answer Get a stop and run some offense Get a score And it starts with Foster again Boozers open Hits the three Boy when Foster drives there was some overhelp and that left Cameron Boozer wide open My goodness he is nine of 10 from the field A player of the year candidate playing at that level here tonight at a big road conference game Duke 2 and0 in the league Louisville one and one And they just got Gungba for a foul and thatll be his fourth Well theres no reason for Patrick Gung there to get a foul there You know Sandu came from the right side of the lane to the left Just did a little swim move on the baseline side and theres just no reason to foul there especially when you got three already And to Fr Hes playing with four McNes pass taken away by Evans and then tipped out of bounds by Conwell But Louisville has not been nearly as sharp offensively as they were for most of the first half And Dukes pressure has been the primary reason why but Louisvilles trying to thread some needles and theyve coughed it up They they had six turnovers in the first half Theyve got to have six in the second Duke did not get its first lead of the night until about 6 and 12 minutes into the second half Theyre on a 122 run right now and the lead is nine Sar looks for help finds Foster trying to turn the corner got pushed by Rogers And again one and one for Foster cheering Thursday the ACC Network has you covered for Miamis College Football Playoff semi pass presentation The crew on the sidelines commentary reaction and more Conwell the crossover Good D by Foster Conwell gets free and hits Nice job by Conwell at keeping his dribble alive Little Nash dribble and went right around Sonu He basically acted like a screener for him applause I dont know that Fosters come out of the game in the second half Why would you take him out Hes been out Hes the best hes played Hes had some really good games He played terrific at Michigan State but hes been even better in this second half Boozer defended by Hadley and a reachin foul And that is cheering a timeout And Chris Button telling us yes number two is on the back of that hoodie Does Louisville have a response Woolly baseline fouled by Foster That was a nice move by Adrien Woolly just to spin and get baseline to that left hand and force that foul Third on Foster sixth on the team So no free throws Boy Duke has been in the bonus since like the 13minute mark That is a long time to have to guard with every common foul Duke going to the foul line Theyve got quite a free throw And on the season Duke has made more free throws than their opponents have attempted And Duke has shot 26 tonight Louisville only eight but theyre going to the line here Second on SARS seventh on the team and Conwell to the line for one and one at the line three Conwell hell shoot for one and one Conwell has had such a a great season for Louisville He leads the Cardinals in scoring fifth in the ACC leads them in steals and the most prolific threepoint shooter in the league He has had at least three threes in 12 of their 15 games this season He started his career at USF then Indiana State then played for Shawn Miller at Xavier before transferring here to play from Pat Kelsey in the middle of Cardinal and hes got 24 Its a sevenpoint game and some pressure on Foster Can they get it over Sar the save and Boozer lays it in The assist to Brown Boy what a save by Dame Sar That ball looked like it could go out of bounds but he found Malik Brown who found Boozer What a great finish to that play Ky misses a three and its out of bounds off of Evans So its Louisville ball and Louisville cant get threes for Ryan Conwell and Isaac McNeely Its been others that Dukes forced to shoot it but thats a big time save by Domar And what a great pass by Malik Brown Duke had all of two assists in the first half Theyve got six so far here in the second half and they are shooting 81 in the second half 13 for 16 Conwell No Fu fouled Boy really nice job on the glass by Sand Fu He didnt give up to that blockout Just spun off of Malik Brown to get inside position number three on Malik Brown to send FU to the line FU is the leading rebounder for this Louisville team He averages over seven rebounds a game and one of the best offensive rebounders in the league Last three games averaging 15 points per game 10 rebounds per game Hes older from Germany played four years professionally there He has eligibility as a junior here in his first year in Louisville played in the Bundesliga Always wanted to say that I know it is fun to say that Im right with you there You can say it again if you want Bundesliga Okay enough laughter You made me once was cute Missed them both 70 shooter on the season Duke can take its time dont have to be in a hurry but you theyre going to either get it into Boozer or theyre going to drive this ball Remember FUs got four Boy Boozers strong Missed the lefthanded layin though F kind of got bumped off his spot but stuck with it and did the best he could Well the best you can do is keep him from getting to that left shoulder in his right hand Hadley left hand No rebound through Rogers and Louisville as hot as they were early from beyond the arc is as cold as theyve been here in the second half Well a really nice job by Caleb Foster to get in and help rebounding Hes had a a fantastic second half for Duke Louisville 1 for13 from threepoint range in the second half Could not miss in the first half Foster drives hesitates and hits And he as Jay said has been as important as Boozer or Evans or anybody else on this team here in this game Yeah in basketball low man wins And on these drives Caleb Foster has stayed low Hes used his leverage I mean hes 65 and hes shown great strength And another turnover for Louisville 17 points tonight for Caleb Foster Eight for 12 I think his career high is 18 that he had against Michigan State his first year in the Champions Classic Shot clock down to six Foster again Anything he wants right now Hes just playing with amazing pace Gets a defender on his hip Keeps him there Plays off two feet What a turnaround here in the second half Duke has outscored the Cardinals 4119 since the break Louisville led by as many as 12 midway through the first half And weve talked about Duke having been a second half team but their ability to put the first half in the rearview mirror and look like a different team in the second half really kind of amazing Around and out on SAR now 3 minutes to go A 25point swing in this game The tip up and in by Fruit and a timeout for Pat Kelsey and Louisville What a story Caleb Foster has been in the second half for the Blue Devils Four steals but really the star of the second half in my view has been Caleb Foster I mean Caleb Fosters got 19 points overall but in the second half hes got 15 of those 19 Hes been seven of eight from the field and has just dominated in the paint And Duke scored 22 paint points in this second half Theyve been outstanding getting the ball in the paint and drawing fouls Foster already with a careerhigh 19 make it down 20 in this game The junior has had one of the if not the best game that hes ever had in a Duke uniform No I think its the best game And he was really good against Michigan State Hes had some terrific moments this year but to have this high a level of performance on the road when Duke really needed it after taking a ton of punches in the first half really impressive performance by Caleb Foster And Dame Sar has been excellent as well Willie shut off on the baseline by Brown Cannot get a shot off over the size of Brown who blocks it and takes it away Now Malik Brown is one of the better defenders not only in the ACC but in the country At Syracuse he was on the ACCs all defensive team but hes got as good a pair of hands defensively as any front court player in the country Blue Devils not in a rush 215 to go Foster using the screen spins lost it and its Louisville ball but Foster gets back into the play to take it away Javon Hadley just never saw him when he was down just running back into the play trying to get it to McNeely And thats a thats a back breaker back to Foster 10 to shoot Evans and the rebound down to Khalifa but that clock keeps on ticking and its still a 12point game Blocked in the corner but Woolly got it back McNeely in and out And thats been the story for Louisville here in the second half Theyve only made one three in the second half after making 10 in the first 20 minutes Isaiah Evans with that block Hes a the second leading shot blocker on this team behind Gunga Hes got more blocks than Boozer has Remember he had five in the game Oh that was Gunga who had five No Evans also had five in the game against Florida Each of them did One minute One minute to go and the Blue Devils are going to win in impressive fashion here with a dominant second half to go to 30 in league play Louisville will drop to one and two in the ACC after losing at Stanford on Friday Up top theyre making it look easy Boozer to Brown for the slam and the exclamation point on the night Well Louisville will be a different team when Mike El Brown Jr gets back and healthy with that back injury Hadley and Khalifa will reverse it in He was a big story in the first half with four threes Dukes next game will be at home against SMU an SMU team that just beat North Carolina by 14 on the weekend Thats not what you often see And thats a a really good attribute for this team They get it over and can basically run out the rest of the clock unless Louisville decides to foul About 2 seconds separating the game clock and the shot clock Sar will lay it up A miss get it back and lay that one in But his defense on Conwell in the second half was a big part of Dukes ability to come back and win this game Khalifa with his fifth three of the night but its too little too late as the Duke Blue Devils the sixth ranked team in the nation will win 8473 here at the KFC Young Center in Louisville to go to fourth
