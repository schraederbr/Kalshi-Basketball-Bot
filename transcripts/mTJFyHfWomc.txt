Applause well be out there for this opening tip off the officials today Ted Valentine Tony Henderson and Isaac Barnett the lad of the three getting ready to toss the basketball up in the air NC State seeding the jump ball with Burns back in the 66 Dennis Parker Jr against the 610 Brandon Huntley Hatfield the day of ACC basketball is under under way Sky bark will get things going for the Cardinals here at the KFC Yum Center this great Marvel of a venue in college basketball should note that NC State is undefeated on the road so far this year 20 been over 20 years since they started 3 and0 on the road in ACC play and this is going to be a great matchup to watch this afternoon inside kind of an accidental kick task to the perimeter and Clark 3 rims out Dennis Parker Jr up the floor quickly and pressured immediately by hery Miller who creates a turnover thats what hes out there to do bring the energy you know he got a he got a start down in Miami it was more of a reward from Kenny Payne with the work that hes been doing in practice but a great run down from behind to cause the turnover his first career start on Wednesday he only scored 11 points All Season really didnt play a lot of time but was a you know great spark at the beginning of the game and you know a win a isnt going to mess around too much with the with the Mojo Jaden Taylor picks up the personal Kenny Payne off his first road win in the ACC a moment for Louisville fans to enjoy on Wednesday night see if they can follow it up I know Ive known Kenny for a long time we were teammates back with the in the in the late 80s and his demeanor didnt really change all that much even with that win a rounding out it was halfway down wouldnt stay for Miller the thing you get with o conell with the ball thats what hes a pass first guy hes not looking for his own offense but the ball he really moves the ball and he sets up his other guys to score CH clock at 12 pass was deflected by Miller and how impactful has Percy Miller in these first 80 Seconds thats what you know for a noon game you need a guy like that to get the energy going early to get everybody excited and enthused very active hands for him good Baseline inbounds and its Dennis Parker Jr with a quick First Step breaking away from yovanovich chance for a threepoint play thats just a breakdown and concentration defensively cant allow that initial that was just one pass for a layup and a threepoint play great execution and a nice cut by Parker Jr this freshman has been a revelation to the to the outside world to Kevin Keat hes been kind of what they expected him to be oh good defense by oconnell in the back court and it will be NC State ball Ill tell you G man I thought oconnell touched that last yeah and but and this is not reviewable this early in the game but this is what the free throw shooting and the and the good offense can do it allows NC State to set their pressure up and to get turnovers another Baseline inbounds and Casey Morel fumbles it away you mention the dynamic of the noon game as we see Kevin Keats in year seven as the sideline Commander for NC State you talk about this a lot you you really hated noon games didnt you I just for me personally I mean as a you know as a a bigger player it took me a while to get warmed up Im maybe a little little groggy as a broadcaster even right now basketballs very slippery for the first two minutes here yeah a little sloppy and uh at least at least some some dead ball turnovers right here and uh yeah this is nobody seems to want to get a handle the basketball this early but yeah it just you know the the game preparation is really compressed for a noon Applause game Morel back outside for oconnell to the basket high off the glass no good rebound Huntley Hatfield sky Clark is quick oh great defense by Parker denying at The Rim ahead to Taylor and a late whistle will send Jaden Taylor to the free throw Applause Music line well early on NC State is getting the whistles and that looked like actually a pretty good Block in uh NC State with some good size and the look ahead and the great thing about that pass is oconnell waited to give Taylor that pass in stride he didnt have to put the ball on the floor it was a great delivery great timing on the Applause play and this is an area you know Louisville does a a good part of their scoring at the free throw line and its category I thought they had to win in this game but so far NC State very early an advantage there both pack three for three at the line so far Kevin Keats talked about getting up and stopping the threepointers particularly thinking about James so Clark finds some space at the elbow doesnt get the bounce rebound for NC States Taylor and he felt his team not as good in Full Court defense this year but very good in the half court thats a mismatch Clark against Burns and he knew it in spun and early timeout for Kenny Payne right now they have yet to score NC State looking very Music sharp and there it is he sees it and just a good quick move he knows a double teams coming and Spins away from it what impresses you most about the big man DJ Burns well its just so very Nimble and very quick on his feet in the half court well we got an early touchdown for the wolf pack and it leads right into our promo to remind you that Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down the games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you will not find anywhere else super Wildcard Weekend begins today and the main story line is going to be the weather I think around the country its cold here in Louisville but not as cold as it is about 7 hours and 500 Mi West in Kansas City but thats thats why I loved and chose the sport of basketball its in this temperature controlled Arena EV and I hope that the players are thought out by Tuesday when when the fellas are analyzing the gam Inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central on the CW I was thinking G man the coldest basketball game you ever played in did the heat ever go out in Jersey or Philly uh actually the coldest game my freshman year during the uh oh this is this is going to really predate you the energy crisis in 76 we played in p and they didnt turn the heat on in the arena it was 55 in the Pittsburgh Civic Arena you hey we played in our warmups how you play in the cold not bad not good but not bad tell you Norman Nixon was a senior on that team with play Kan so Jaden Taylor just picked up his second personal foul so thats going to be something to monitor 1654 in the first first half DJ horn coming off the bench for the wolf pack for the first time and some guys react well to coming off the bench other guys dont and that was just blatant Steel by Trey white welcome rudley back to the court and the three from the corner goes for Michael oconnell 10 nothing packed boy and and Horn just came in that aggressive vented Applause Play Trey white his first game after missing the last three with a groin issue he looked good in practice yesterday but the Cardinals cant get out of their own way theyre 0 for four with four Applause turnovers theres the look and uh just a great find and uh thought about one team looking like its ready to play and another team Applause not well and you know you you you look and uh I dont know it uh Kevin keiths might have found something with oconnell out on the floor and may have to find a rotation with people around him Marcel attacking white tough turnaround Applause to the wolf pack are four for five the Cardinals are 0 for four with the four giveaways Tyler Johnson coming off the bench with Trey Applause white Johnson finally gets the Cardinals on the board thought we were going to have a shut out here after showing the Louisville Slugger in the open yeah I know you were going to go back to your uh minor league baseball calls and had a couple no hitters through the years did he travel yes he did good Valentine on the call on the Baseline well a new day good start for DJ Burns and Company on the road Utah and uh Dr Duncan Stein uh from here back living here and uh looks great and we had a great visit uh National Championship in uh with the doctors of dunk in 1980 Denny crums First National Championship here a final four I was one game away from getting two we got beat by Purdue in uh in the regional Final in in rup arena in 1970 in 1980 how would you compare Dr Duncan Stein versus David Thompson as a dunker about about the same I mean they were uh about similar size I mean you know just amazing to of what he did at his size and you know playing where he did a lot of people on the East Coast didnt see a lot of him during his his pro career rules of gravity did not apply Louisville gets a stop and a rebound from Trey white after the bucket from Mike James and Johnsons entry pass looking for Caleb Glenn negated by a reaching foul on cam Woods very much a bounce back year last year for Kevin Keats Applause uh 20 plus win an NCA tournament appearance for them he revamped his staff and of course he has a history here in Louisville went to his favorite spot Jeff rubies for dinner last night an assistant here under Rick patino traveling is the call on Parker thats four turnovers for each team in the opening 5 and a half minutes NC States a team that typically this year done a great job not turning the ball over one of the best in the country country second in the nation offensive turnover percentage only the rich the Richmond Spiders have turned it over less 126 of their turnovers or their possessions are turnovers appreciate our dude Ken P compiling those Applause numbers James hand off for Clark and look Trey white was scorching hot in practice yesterday but he had carry it over to the game so far today well the first step was practice yesterday and it was a good sign for him and just to get him back out on the floor how about the effort from both teams inside diara was turned away but Middlebrooks perseveres and free throws are coming and theyve been happy with Ben Middlebrooks in uh the transfer from Clemson had a double double early this year against Old Miss he brings size he brings strength Str he experience we thought of it as a game day trade when Jack Clark went down to Clemson on the same day that Middlebrooks came up to to Raleigh and Clark hasnt played a whole lot NC state has won that trade through the first half of the Season Clark unfortunately battling still battling the groin injury that he suffered last year those can take a long time yeah they and unfortunately its its tough and they linger and you think you youve gotten past it and you come back and it can recur very easily two for two at the line for the Fort Lauderdale native Ben Middlebrooks token full court pressure here on Tyler Johnson and this this type of pressure may not manifest itself early Evan but uh it may you know as the game goes along Louisville might get worn down by it great Hustle by Johnson after he nearly turned turn it over good recovery the crowd is really ready to erupt after what happened on Wednesday the Cardinals want to build on it this would be a big bucket here white buries the three you know a possession that was really ragged and going nowhere but saved by hustle and really a a a huge confidence Builder horn put on the line long two nothing but the bottom of the Applause which actually Kenny Payne said yesterday is something they could live with they really wanted to have long they could live with long contested twos GL a leaping catch surrounded by four Defenders and he scores anyway well thats what you want to do attack pressure to score not just to get by the pressure and then set up tough catch By Di on a pass that looks like it was headed to the second row and you can see the offense for NC State with oconnell out a little more ragged out there Evan DJ horn was two for 16 on Wednesday hes two for two today yeah and uh you know maybe that was good a good move getting him off the bench and uh calming him down a little bit correct myself hes two for three still a solid start yep and uh and and maybe you know also coming in and making that strong defensive play right out of the gate helped him theres the good Applause look reaching foul on Rice his first fourth on the wolf pack here in this first half NC States won the last two games in the series against Louisville before that the Cardinals at one six to the previous seven Trey white comes up shooting wow that is a huge Plus for get him into the game early but little surprised Hunter Hatfield hasnt scored in this game yet really hasnt gotten any touches quick shot won fall rice 0 for one and Louisville gradually G Moment yeah middle Brooks in the reaching foul that time and its you know its funny again the noon game it took about s minutes 6 minutes for both teams to really get into a rhythm in this game youre Applause right skot Clarks got a good head of hair doesnt he whats that skot Clarks got a good head of hair are you envious just appreciative oh what a defensive play not good handles that time from sky and Casey morcel lays it in well even and another even even the even this dead ball foul situation allows NC State to get in that pressure full court initially already seven points off turnovers for NC State moreel hes a cop shes a con and together this unlikely Duo makes the perfect pair its the CWs brand new show and its called wildcards and it premieres this Wednesday January 17th 87 Central right here on the CW Louisville mascot has often been known as a wild card super Wildcard Weekend with some breaking news Steelers bills has been moved from Sunday to Monday due to the expected winter lake effect snorm in Upstate New York its a its a busy time on the sports calendar Applause Mike big story for Louisville the bench scored nine of the 11 points so far in this game the big lift Trey white from huge inside Huntley Hatfield been very quiet so far that one wouldnt stay down diara pulls down the rebound halfway down and he needs to put pressure on DJ Burns make him defend and when he settles for a jump shot he bails him out a little bit at this end of the floor Kenny pay was really on Huntly half field in practice yesterday about how he needs to work defensively against Burns deny him inside make him forcing to receive a little bit farther out like this Bur 15 ft away clock Ling down rejected 710 of a second on the shot clock still a little still enough time to catch and shoot but thats just the length and uh him coming he actually went behind Burns good defensive series that time for Louisville buts see again these have been theyve been dead ball turnovers that uh NC state has had or shot clock violations and even with that they can still set up in this Applause pressure ahead its white two on one and hes blocked from behind by diara and that was a that was a lazy attempt at The Rim sloppy possession by Louisville and a sloppy half so far DJ horn around and out Curtis Williams pulls down the rebound tyar Johnson diara another rebound hes been active on the boards and a foul with NC tapate bringing it up to court number two on Trey white his return to the court may not last as long as he would have liked well and that was one that was absolutely unnecessary and you know for look I get it hes excited about being back on the court you know he wants to be over aggressive in that situation but you take yourself out of the game and out of the half by picking up that Applause foul 6 minutes five points two fouls well see whether we see him again the final 10 and 12 minutes of the first half theres a three from the corner Dennis Parker Jr continues to make good things happen for the pack yeah just a basic okell gets a high screen and they stick him Parker over in the over in the corner the defense gets pulled in and he gets a great look largest lead so far NC State up 13 Kurt Williams Applause responds well Kenny Payne talked about it you know he used to define himself by how many points he scored and you know Miami he had five assists in that game he did other things but uh he can shoot the basketball for sure Hearns over Huntley Applause Hatfield yeah he is very very good at putting the ball on the floor multiple times and for a giant dude a very soft touch yeah good feet and Burns going to get foul first personal on DJ theres the thing you know and the catch the first thing he does is look he sees all right is there a double team coming no double keeps his head up its all right its just me and him and he just uses his size to create some distance for the shot but the key was the first thing he looks and sees how hes being played defensively Williams same spot same result and and hes a guy for a freshman to get started quickly is is really important and they for for right now for especially you know you get a guy like Trey white in foul trouble for him to come in really a big plus quick answer just turn off the shot clock right now hadnt been a factor these last few Applause possessions five first tap points for o conell tough step back morcel nope and this Tempo favors NC State Applause Music slightly DJ just pick up his second yes he did yeah so Jaden Taylor picked up his second with 1654 to go and now with 841 left in the half burns with two personals how can Louisville take advantage of those two NC State starters being on the bench well you got one thing you get a team thats smaller out on the Music floor for NC stay so you get burns out you dont you dont have to double with Middlebrooks in there now you dont have to worry about doubling the post so you can stay at home at Shooters so that helps you Applause out and uh you know maybe explore getting um getting Huntley Hatfield some more touches down in the low block hes just 0 for one so far four rebounds but no points surprisingly Mike James only has two field goal attempts in the game as well neither of which is a three yeah maybe try to get him more involved in this offense middle Brooks versus Huntley Hatfield looking to pass okono pull up interesting hes been a little bit more aggressive offensively in this game Second Chance bucket for DJ horn this off the bench thing might work out yeah I was going to say that Kevin Kei May take a look at this rotation 31 points in first 12 minutes today for the wol pack he scored 54 and 40 yeah but you you look at you got you got moreel and Horn and Parker Jr out there around okono and you you got some scores around him and a guy who wants to distribute pack were two for 20 from three the other day four for seven today up a dozen leads Louisville it has been a wild week in the college basketball Universe top five teams going down left and right the common thread on the road and Conference play big big game in Lincoln Nebraska Purdue is not like being number one theyve been beaten multiple times this year there and Johnny Dawkins at UCF beating going in going in and beating Kansas Houston going down uh Rick Barnes losing to Mississippi State uh so North Carolina and Duke depending on the outcomes today should move up into the top 10 its been really volatile Evan this year theres been a lot of movement I dont know that there is a I dont know that theres a great dominant team out there and of course it makes tons of sense that on the week where all these top teams are losing on the road the Louisville Cardinals win on the road for the first time in 23 games yeah snapping a 22 Road game losing streak yeah thats that that game could have very easily made that list even though it didnt involve a top five Team final four team from a year ago Williams had it deflected by Applause morcel and though you know it seems even though the turnovers are even in this game so far which is surprising because NC State takes usually as you mentioned earlier takes such good care of the ball Louisvilles missed some really good scoring opportunities in the first 133 minutes points off turnovers is not even 7even to2 and NC States Applause favor and I think perhaps part of oconnell being out there early was defensively hes been in james Jersey throughout this first 13 minutes this is this is what this NC State team can do in the half court again I you know it it may not doesnt manifest itself necessarily in the first half but the last 10 minutes of the game teams get worn down oh he missed the front end of the one and one on the eighth team foul of the half first on oconnell and those are those are free throws that maybe could have gotten him into a good Rhythm offensively more C pull a three rebound finds Williams not necessarily a good shot in the offense early in the shot clock for him bad pass by Clark turnover number seven for Louisville Applause Ste out of bounds thats a tough 20 second seel couple of tough possessions for him early T early uh bad shot in the offense and then running out of real estate on the basement Applause Baseline Kevin Keats three and three so far in his career against Louisville as the head coach of the wolf pack this is you know with against James maybe James get him in get the ball down low to him hes got a size Advantage right there good job the guard wow he forced that one well but oconnell did nice job forcing him into a tough shot no call James a long look at one of the officials Tony Henderson and no words exchange just a long lir no play on at the KC Center yeah hes going to look at him and say you got a few inches on this guy you got to get a better shot than that dont look for dont look at me for any Applause advantage CH clocks down to Applause seven OK Connell crosscourt and Kenny Payne got out of the way and Danny Manning has the basketball said hello to Danny before the game did hes still enjoying the grind you got three coaches over there with NCA championship rings Dannys going to get to go back to Winston Salem for a couple of days cuz Louisvilles planning on staying in North Carolina after they play UNCC on Wednesday and then they got wake on Saturday a 900 game and then an early early afternoon game two and 12 days Applause later first on Parker ninth team foul so another one and one here for Louisville and they missed the first one on the first front end of it so that you know and one of the big things for Kevin Keat that he told us before the game was to keep Louisville off the free throw line which theyve really done well theyve defended without fouling for the most part in this game especially two shot fouls yep Clark over for five from the floor his first points of the day coming here at the line his impact late in Miami game that steel in three was a game changer really kind of a late dagger even though there was plenty of time left for Jim Lona Squad hard to believe that that Squad didnt score in the last three minutes at home it was stunning shot clock down to four cam Woods comes up short Clark the other way ahead to James for two good run out good luck ahead by Clark that time and it all starts with a solid defensive possession everybody compressed for NC State they had nobody back and transition defensively that was as good as Louisvilles look Mike James has made five threes in each of his last two games he has not attempted one so far today but thats a high percentage shot theres a good look at it and those are the type of plays that gets a guy into Rhythm gets a nice easy basket like that let see if uh lville can put a little uh run together to close out this half I dont know if you heard what Kenny Payne said to Louisville radio about Mike James after the Miami game he said quote Mike James is a spirit child his Spirit propels us not just when hes playing great but all the Music time yeah and you know and Im sure that theres a um you know theres a a big place in Kenny Paynes heart from a guy who they lost a ton of people in the portal who bailed on last years Squad but you know Mike James returned I came back from an A killes injury hes battled a lot out of the timeout Lille shows Zone trying to save some guys save some foul issues give NC State a little bit of a different look now matching up late in the shot clock OK conell diara on the glass called for an offensive foul couple of good defensive possessions and uh Mohamed diara and thats they want him to thats what thats what he does he gets on to the on the glass but the called for the push double bonus now for Louisville at the line NC State throughout the season has averaged 87 turnovers a game theyre sitting at eight turnovers so far today with 428 to go in the first half whats going on well that first four minutes for both teams was like nobody wanted to take ownership of the basketball everybody was half asleep yeah it was uh it was not pretty and apologize to the fans for that Caleb Glenn at the line the hometown kid sinks a pair after trailing by as many as 13 the Cardinals are back within six and more importantly the the crowd is back in the game DJ burns on the bench with two fouls so its inside the Middlebrooks who Powers it over the front Applause rim Scot Clark got away with a little bit of a walk on that he was kind of surprised to get the ball conell again right in on James keeping those arms straight up hanging to the air the tip wont go for Caleb Glenn Ill tell you what and maybe because they established it early but NC State is very physical with Louisvilles guards and there has not been a whistle I thought they could have gotten no Connell for a foul there on James but they have set the standard letting them play diara lost it out of bounds State ball eight to shoot and theyll have a timeout to diagram another Baseline out of bounds play three and a half to play in half number one for more than 150 years yeah NC State pitching a shut out in the first two and a half Innings of this game and uh then Louisville got into the swing of things and got Trey white came off the bench started producing some offense for this club Curtis Williams coming off the bench which he did very well down in Miami as well so a few story lines the bench playing very well for Louisville yeah three first half threes for the Cardinals two of them from Williams DJ horn coming off the bench for the first time hes got a couple threes eight points in 11 minutes middle Brooks yes sir and you know with with burns out of the game with some foul issues thats some pretty good offense for Middlebrooks inside only two points in the Carolina game hes got a quick six Applause today deflected into the back court James pursues it legally James against the bigger diara gets two really he noticed the switch that time he knew he could take him off of the dribble against oconnell that oconnell has been a tough match up for him but able to get by diara diara Rising fire well hes taking a couple shots that I dont think are in his offensive repertoire made one the other day but Im with you James Strip by Middlebrooks looose ball collected by oconnell open man is horn buckets 11 first half points for DJ horn in his first game coming off the bench Bo ell just said has a great sense of where his guys are and delivers them where they can get a great look at it James his first look from three and he was fouled cam Woods trying to contest yields three free throws the line for the car zero Mike James hell shoot two Mike James going back to the line 49 points in his last two ball games yikes 82 from the line this year hes missed two in a row one of which was a front end of the one and one yeah and thats you know again you dont want to risk a guy youve youve held in you know under control especially what hes been doing lately from the floor and you dont want to risk getting him going at the free throw line but hes underperformed there so far today thats more like it eight for Applause James NC States lead is 10 under two to play in this first half horn quick shot knocks down another three hes got 14 points in the half what what four of 16 game against North Carolina you know they 16 you know they those they go away quickly I you you hit that one shot and those become a distant memory kler Johnson The Freshman from Brooklyn with his first two 0 of three from three in that game so uh little Brooks on the dive cut surrounded kicks it out morcel fouled shooting a three teams trading fouls on three point field goal attempts wow coming up in the Subaru halftime report well hear from Tom wormy and Jordan Cornett were getting ready to call Florida State Notre Dame from The Joy Center we also have g mans midseason awards at the 15 game Mark looking forward to that got my black tie already to go yeah this uh you know the way this season goes I dont know how much those are those are worth as many crazy things have happened so far but well see carpets Applause ready State Louisville know a little bit about red carpet these two programs have combined for five national championships think about it over the last half century 10 of all the national championships have been won by either NC State or Louisville five of the last Applause 50 regardless of what the NCAA tries to vacate I saw them win Applause it both packed by 14 new largest lead for State inside Huntley Hatfield no tip yes Hy Hatfield and for him he finally gets on the uh on the scoring sheet his first two of the game he was a he was a huge part really uh out played omir down in Miami in that wi thir hit diara thinks differently this time middle Brooks going right at Hunton Hatfields chest wide left long rebound finds Williams one on three and a foul first on morcel Morel at the line for the Cs number one Williams hell shoot two H have you noticed anything different energywise body language Wise Louisville today versus Louisville on Wednesday cuz I think for the most part theyve played hard theyve been a little sloppy but both teams were sloppy with a new start and you know the shots havent gone in like they did in the first half on Wednesday but I feel like this game is closer than the score indicates what about you yeah I mean by definition they they were you know theyve got to be feeling better about themselves you know coming off that wind down in Miami um you know it does it does it change things overnight I get a a turn over but just a sloppy inbounds play Johnson doesnt get the bounce but more free throws are coming for the cards well Kevin ke is just irate and that was just miscommunication on the inbounds and a situation where youre going to probably have the last shot of the game and this has been how many shots have they had Evan where its just like the ball seemed like its gone halfway down and not quite in Huntley Hatfields had a couple James has had at least one Clark all that being said I mean uh you know NC States going to have the last possession its been a great bounceback game offensively for them despite the turnovers 44 points with nine turnovers DJ horn is already above his season average with 14 points and thats Off the Bench shot clock is off o Connell just a 16 foul on Louisville so Miller picks it up but they had one to give maybe he gave it a little early yeah Caleb Glenns returning for Kenny Payne doesnt want Mike James to pick up number two thats a smart sub and see that you know white picked up that second foul he is the only one whos in any kind of foul trouble for Louisville 5 Seconds horn has been the hot man he missed the bunny though and its out of bounds to Louisville with 13 to go does Kenny Payne get Mike James back in the game for this last 13 doesnt look like James is headed to the scorers table thatll be Clark inbounding Johnson the closest Cardinal looking near Mid Court oh James did come Applause back James is out there excuse me you got to throw a long pass going toward the basket just dont turn it over here and the first half comes to an uninspiring end but uh pretty I think it was Rando and boner but Im not sure and then boner drove um so no question about that but uh you know it was interesting 1980 in their first uh in their first national championship they were in the Metro conference I was you know talk D and uh talking to darl Griffith about that talking about their uh their moves around and eventually here to the ACC first shot of the second half missed three from DJ horns so he was I was curious to see whether he would start the second half or not so that question answered kind of like the team the way it ran with ok a lot on the four Williams misses over Burns and Taylor hasnt played for a while Rises up for the rebound Jaden Taylor left the game after 3 minutes and 6 seconds with his second foul and NC State into double digits in the turnover Department what is going on today well and that one had nothing to do with the defense that was just a careless Applause pass you see the look of cons face that is well characterized Mike and boy that was almost a 5sec count there because they double they they double team sky Clark and nobody else was back for the Applause Cardinals Curtis Williams starting the second half James on the runner it wont stay down for him boy he has had no easy looks at the basket to this point hanging in the air Jaden Taylor with his first field goal today big one for him he had some issues getting into this game two fou two personal fouls really wasnt a factor in that first half Caleb Glenn also scarting in the second half Huntley Hatfield surrounded by Red hes comfortable with that need to get him going good to see him score in close they also want to see if they could put some pressure on DJ Burns maybe get the third foul on him early in the second half I mean the fact that Louisville is within nine and Huntley Hatfield has four and Clark has two I think its its more due to the uncharacteristic turnovers that NC state has had in this game wow that pass drilled the rim and then the entry feed easily intercepted by Glenn and norly burns an excellent passer out of the post ker Alexander there soaring in for the pick Hunley half field short stays with it Glenn over to James into the lane tough shot goes and those were the shots that werent going in the first half that one hit the rim about four times before it went down Cardinals back within seven Ill give this new Mo time crowd a lot of credit today theyve really been looking to get to get this get into this game on a frigid day here in Kentucky not much warmer than it is in South Bend maybe a degree or two Morel missed it Huntley Hatfield the rebound Clark falling down to the corner for three first of the day for James for four point game well and credit Williams and we talked about it Kenny Payne give him an assist and rather than try to make an aggressive shot contested he gave it up for a better look Taylor Miss fires youre surprised Kevin Keats didnt call a time out there Mike yeah I think hes hes hes trying to wait maybe get a stop on this possession if they score he may be forced to take one here Hunley Hatfield going at Burns yes indeed time out NC State heres the look we talk about it the basketball going in in the second half for Louisville and heres the extra pass great look at the three from the corner 90 run Cardinals within two double header today is three of the four head coaches in our double header their son plays for the team KJ Keats xan Payne and of course Braden Shrewsberry coming off his best game yet as a member of the Fighting Irish and I would think that a lot of people would agree that uh Micah Shrewsberry and his Irish are overachieving this year at least what most people expenses and we got to do something about this rule in college basketball cuz we had a timeout just north of 16 and now we get a whistle so we promise well be right back and then were really heating things up its a lively atmosphere here at the KFC Yum Center on the edge of the Ohio river and downtown Louisville that guy wore his best Shades to the game so he expected to see great effort and see you know EV its it may not seem like a big thing but but Kevin keth had a burn a timeout yeah above the 16minute media timeout and that it may be a factor later on in this game he was he was 10 he was like 10 seconds away from getting under that 16minute Mark it was a 90 run that prompted Keats to Halt play both pack still have two timeouts left you know NC gets a stop on that last possession you know he doesnt have to do that tough shot turnaround Fade Away by Casey morcel and morcel had had a tough four minutes up to that stretch to start the second half so good basket for him coming out of the timeout with this end of the floor Cardinals have hit their last three shots Hunley Hatfield sets the screen Clark circles the wagons the big man with a hyphenated last name battling midd Brooks and before the shot midd Brooks whistled for a second personal foul can see middle Brooks can be in there and he can he can give up some fouls he can be physical with Huntley Hatfield you know they can throw three guys at him they can throw the at him for a stretch Kenny pay knows how important hun Hatfield is he said yesterday is a vital piece to everything we do both ends of the floor back to the big man thats the third plow on middle Brooks and a threepoint play opportunity for Brandon Hunley Hatfield well when youre a big guy and you face up that close to the basket its tough little fake for the Baseline clears himself up no double team help coming mid Brooks kind of on an island by himself there take me in the mind of the big man Defender there its tough I me you know when you when hes got the whole side isolated um he went to his left hand which was his off hand which is where you want to try to force him doesnt get the threepoint play the offensive player initiates the contact y I mean it wasnt necessarily a bad defensive play on the part of Middlebrooks but you just you know you cant follow in that situation oconnell turned away back outside horn he was Music bumped first on Clark shot clock back to 20 520 gone here in the second half just had a feeling things were not going to be easy today for NC State on the road even up 12 nothing the opening minutes but Morel starting to warm up hes in double figures now with 11 second underneath out of bounds play that was really easy too easy for NC State just a a quick pass and uh Morel very strong inside Clark beats o conell off the dribble going glass for two little hesitation move move that time got oconnell to stand to straighten up defensively first field goal for Sky teams trading baskets diara inside for Middle Brooks and before the shot they got Huntley Hatfield thats his first first 5 see now watch this this is a pass you you shouldnt be able to receive just right here he muscles inside especially James a bigger guy just a good take right there I mean he goes left but he finishes right with no shot blocking in there another Baseline out of bounds to defend does a better job yeah at least they force it out toward the half Applause court morel short jams the rebound Clark to the corner for the lead moreell rebounds the Williams missed but a travel in transition Louisville ball I I tell you what you know hes being aggressive Marcel coming out of the game they got to find a way to reignite DJ horn waren Ian he has not gotten many touches early in this second half hes looking a little frustrated out on the Applause Music floor and they went to Horn in the first possession of the half he missed lazy pass there diara the steel and the score that was a that was a nice defensive play and finish by Applause diara teams trading turnovers the last two possessions Huntley Hatfield fouled by diara fouls are piling up here over three in the half yeah both teams sitting with three team Applause fouls its number three for diara Middle Brooks has three Burns has two for Louisville Trey white has two no one else with multiple fouls well you know NC State is in a better position with their bigs to to burn fouls middle Brooks man just picked up number four no theyre going to give it to Horn rare to see DJ Burns not talking he loves to chirp not necessarily talking trash hes just a a chatty dude this is you know for hes going of coming back in the game right now but the so far you know in practice yesterday Louisville was really working on Hunter Hatfield running up and down the floor and uh you know so far that has not been a factor with Burns and getting easy baskets in transition lets see if that plays a role here with him with burns on the floor there have not been a ton of moments to cheer for the past season or so here in Louisville but the fans sensing that perhaps The Tide is turning Jaden Taylor missed a three long rebound tracked by white going right at Taylor Trey white ties the game well you talked about it they did five possessions yesterday with his group Kenny P Drew up five plays for for white and H he looked very comfortable oh that was blocked into the basket by Huntley Hatfield de horrible get credit for the two Applause wow fin only have feel couldnt do that again if you tried but thats what they want diar do at least be around the rim a tough pass Clark to the corner cor Williams puts the Cardinals in front Williams first lead of the day the corner three has been really kind to Louisville either side Burns kicks it oconnell sticks Applause Music it with nice in his vein W only seven of 28 from three coming in on the season not really a shot hes been looking for three for 23 in his last 14 games from Beyond The Arc Hunley Hatfield Applause nope there like I said hes hes been settling for the jump shot against Burns a beautiful pass up and under horn doesnt finish now but Hunley Hadfield enough challenge there to make him try a difficult shot Clark draws the foul on Taylor number three on Jaden called on the pass itll be Louisville ball when we come back 1047 to go interesting ball game here in Kentucky you know its interesting that its the first time that mik shwar has ever coached his son at any level and uh you know it was he would have gone to Penn State obviously but uh came along in the uh in the move to South Bend seems to be uh theres a lot of pressure as a coachs kid yeah and and he said hes really enjoying it Micah said hes really enjoying coaching his son and uh you know we saw it with uh with Jim beheim and uh with Buddy and Jimmy and uh you know that how that played out but that yeah that is that is not an easy thing going a break you saw Kenny pan lecturing Brandon Huntley Hatfield he doesnt settle it didnt get the call either but that was that was the the chat thats what it was about not settling for jump shots and going at Burns theyve been doubling on the dribble oh Burns foul from behind hes upset he didnt make the bucket well heres and heres the other heres what Kenny p is going to be upset about now the double team is coming from the top and what Huntley Hatfield has got to do is take away away the Baseline and thats exactly where Burns spun to quiet day so far for DJ Burns by his standards Four Points one Rebound in just 15 minutes as we shift toward the fourth quarter of this game game give me the key for each team to get this Victory today in your mind well I you know for for NC State um you know getting DJ horn reinvolved I think is going to be a big key um and also getting some turnovers and turning them into points something that the state has not done getting easy baskets fast break Applause points and uh Louisville again I think you know theyre sitting right now at NC State with five fouls to get into the bonus as quickly as they can and make the free throw line an ally for them under 10 minutes here in the second half Williams three that helps Curtis Williams four for six from downtown heres today to answer thats a big shot for DJ horn yeah I mean to not have gone back to him earlier I mean that was that was his first points in the second half Huntley Hatfield comes up empty again horn now five of eight from three back outside for Applause oconnell burns back in Huntley half field down in the short Corner thats nice yep I mean you you just tip your cap at that shot hes got a mean hes got great feet really a soft touch Louisvilles going to earn their 17 and 18th free throw attempts of the ball game they average better than 23 free throw attempts a game the line for the number Z Mike James well and the important thing too is that youre getting two free throws out of this and one more and you get into the bonus and its the fourth foul on Mohamad diara so but again the you know for the bigger guys for State youve got some fouls to burn there 11 State 13 of their 15 games this year has had fewer turnovers in their opponent that is not the case today 12 turnovers for Kevin keatss team just nine for Louisville back to a threepoint game and if you know really if that was one of the the big lessons if they took away from Miami as the turnovers they had only 12 in that game and they had a they had four in the first four minutes so you know value of the basketball is huge for this Music team entering Wednesday night NC State was three and0 they had a home game against Carolina and this road game against Louisville and you know when that game began this Louisville Cardinal hadnt won an ACC Road game in two years now now its interesting now you got Caleb Glenn at 66 whos really the backup who plays behind Hundley Hatfield hes guarding DJ burn trying to guard he disappears when hes behind him DJs something of a human eclipse Parker no Burns yes yeah he just kind of he just kind of willed him under the basket got an easy offensive rebound good luck Caleb youre a freshman go block out DJ Burns tyar Johnson important step back bucket for the Cardinals another thing to you look you asked about the change really this this Louisville team playing with confidence in the last eight minutes of this game open look oconnell makes the Cardinals pay for the double team 83s coming in on the year his second one of the game then he was just three for 20 three from Beyond The Arc his last 14 games before today Johnson fouled number four on Jaden Taylor NC State jumped out to it 12 nothing lead in the opening minutes but the Cardinals have fought their way back thats the good news and this Louisville team a very good free throw shooting team theyve left a couple at the line including a front end oneonone earlier Tyler Applause Johnson came off the bench again today at the line for the started five games in a row before coming off the bench against Miami but hes making progress eight points against the Hurricanes Johnson nine points so far today you know for Louisville they you know James is is rolling he looks to be headed toward another 20 plus game and Williams has been fabulous they need to get hle Hatfield consistent four of 10 shooting hes had some decent looks thats Louisville basketball we have seen spectacular effort at times from Louisville today defensively yeah just a little kind of little token pressure but uh Johnson long arms bothering that crosscourt Applause pass James working on Morel trying to post him up CH clock winding down Clark going Baseline over the Applause Music Applause backboard there was a nonzero chance that it was going to bounce three times on the backboard and fall in but it went the other way and in case youre wondering at home statistically that is countered as a team Applause rebound did you try to bribe the scorekeepers to get those countered your way theres a big three for TJ horn hes got 20 Off the Bench today for the pack yeah hes been a point of minute in this game just about great production for him yeah I always threw my hand up just just in case the score didnt get a good look at who had the rebound why not I got it he knocked it out of my hand Applause see 20 for horn Huntley Hatfield gives it to White first came back after missing three with a groin injury white little shimmy airball this a key defensive possession here for the Cardinals NC State trying to recreate some separation and thats a good way to do it pick and roll DJ Burns extends the lead to nine and Kenny Payne wants to talk and burns was really laboring on that play kind of set a high screen and then just walked into that layup you said it earlier Mike how Kenny pays demeanor didnt really change after Wednesdays game obviously he felt good but you know weve been around him a bunch over the past couple years hes been tremendously positive in the face of the adversity a lot of pressure I mean this is a very its a very proud program and a very impatient fan base uh you know For Better or For Worse and and uh this schedule Prov next the next four games are against the top teams in the league uh what about the the big four from North Carol yeah back road and uh and then oh yeah well he had to come home and Clemson and then well Virginia is you got to figure is going to be better as the year goes around Clemson was the talk of the league earlier theyve theyve hit a skid here lately tigers are going to drop out of the top 25 you would think interesting game starting at 200 as well wake in Virginia you talked about this is a critical offensive possession for the Cardinals Music seals Fighting Irish about 25 minutes from now as soon as were done here at the Yum Music Center some confusion with the officials it was a timeout after the bucket from burn so Louisville should be able to run the Baseline dont forget the biggest stars will gather the 29th annual Critics Choice Awards hosted by Mike J no hosted by Chelsea Handler tomorrow at 700 pm Eastern 400 pm Pacific on the CW you turned them down so they got chel you mentioned my Awards I had more than my share of critics over the Applause years thats a rough sequence for for the Cardinals a turnover and then a DJ horn driving layup you know I think and you know plenty of game left here but I think the question is going to be whether you know DJ horn is the guy who continues to come off the bench now hes hes in this game is going when we look at the score hes going to play starter minutes and again I think guys sometimes they let their pride get in the way about starting theres you know a big deal about it but hes going to look at the numbers at the end and say this isnt uh this isnt so bad Curtis Williams gave Louisville the 5554 lead with 1155 to go Williams then hit a three to tide at 58 since then NC state has reasserted itself and this and this is where and at the free throw line is where Lille could carve their way back into it a slow the game down if they could get the get some you know critical stops here locking in on horn is going to be huge Burns stays with a dribble tough shot wont fall James the rebound yeah they had to stay at home they let him play oneonone defensively he did a nice job a beautiful hesitation but Johnson cant spin it home rebound last Touch by NC State itll stay Louisville ball if Johnson was able to spin that home it would have matched his career high of 14 points easy shot but morelight he came over bothered his shot and forced him to go underneath and make it a more difficult Applause finish Cardinals nearly 3 minutes since their last field goal as we tick under 5 minutes to play and he stay r it up the defense theres no question Williams tough shot over Morell anyway now open shots tough while you know now his confidence is to the point where those tough shots are are makeable for him Williams one shy of his career best he scored 16 against Pepperdine back in December and I there I wouldnt be surprised to see 20 points broken for him as the season unfolds no he he can play 19yearold from Detroit you know and it we talk about the physicality of this game and I NC state established that with their guard play and its carried through this game and its been very physical and the and the referees have let them play on how much con you give o Connell for that yeah I mean its its been across the board really but they established that early on thats excellent Poise from a guy playing his 133rd college basketball game Morel now with 13 Huntley Hatfield Louisville needs it and Middlebrooks just picked up his fourth foul the third member of the pack with four personals yeah but hes when Burns is out hes got to feel like hes fighting against somebody four weight divisions lower and Kean I ask you this kindly who is the biggest dude you ever had to bang with on the Block um I mean artist Gilmore probably one of the strongest guy Bob lanir um I mean they were West unell theres some big there were there were some big guys roaming the Earth back what was lamb beer like to go oneonone against um you know he was he was he were he strong big guy was he dirty Jeff Ruland wasnt exactly soft under four minutes we Applause go chot clock down to seven Burns quadruple team nice pass Parker fouled thats DJ superpower is his vision out of the double triple or quadruple teams final meeting get timeout wol pack by eight 150 years Mike yeah Lille really made a nice run at the uh at the start of the second half they came out knocking down some threes you dont often highlight a 69 to 65 run over the the past 32 minutes well but when it comes on the heels of a 120 start I mean you know that it makes a difference but you know heres the thing and this is where NC State size more than anything I you look at the combination of middle Brooks diara and burns theyve combined for 21 points and 15 rebounds and theyve had uh 13 fouls to throw at Huntley Hatfield so you know you put that POS you put that position together and all that fire you know theyve been able to wear that down and more than offset his production theres no question this has been the game to watch in the early window in the ACC Carolinas up 30 something on Syracuse at the dean doome and and that being said this game far from over y well Louisville used a 90 run to close out Wednesdays win at Coral Gables yep Curtis Williams has been fabulous coming back and Trey white has been good in his Applause return having along with the Gman with you oconnell the long rebound ahead horn a wise yeah good slow down didnt have anybody inside for offensive rebounding waited for some red jerseys to join him hes also really close to the NC State bench so ke could have just dragged him off floor third base coach had the Hold sign up Tiara later in the shot clock puts it in yeah and thats they want him shooting a little bit closer to the basket not not those threes that he launched earlier six points nine rebounds for diara an effective 16 minutes in counting for him Johnson cant finish with a left hand Hatfield stays with it Clarks had a relatively quiet offensive day he stayed doing the job on the glass he had James wide open in the corner for a three Clarks now one for eight four points one rebound two assists and this is where that wear down Factor may be kicking in for NC State Louisville looking a little tired Burns backing down spinning scoring NC State in control here with two and a quarter left Clark needs it got it back to an 11point game Cardinals are going to need more possessions like that in the next two minutes to have a chance well more stops like that Johnson the steel and the slam and just like that its back to nine technically a three possession game season High 14 turnovers for NC State how much credit do you give Louisvilles defense yeah know theyve been active with their hands they gotten some turnover especially that one to get a live ball turnover turned into points tennis shoot Burns at the threepoint Applause Arc diara tips the rebound but white has it and the Cardinals keep this thing rolling kind of interesting there were some people leaving their seats who are now lingering up on The Concourse Huntley Hatfield yes and just like that the 14point deficit has been sliced in half and its an offensive foul on okono before the balls inbounded do not go anywhere Applause folks wow time out out Kenny pay 66 seconds left and those Cardinal fans are ready to Rejoice lets take a look at our key play brought to you by Hilton Hilton for the stay DJ horn has been the key guy off the bench for the wolf pack today no no question then you responded well didnt start for the first time and uh but he he picked up theyve made a key defensive play early on but then knocking down shots he has been solid eight of 13 six of nine coming off the two of 16 performance against the Tar Music Applause Heels wonder how many wackos will see at football game shirtless later today or tonight it is it is not a hypothermia ridden cold here inside the climate control KFC Yum Center its a 70 Run for the Cardinals in the last 63 seconds when it looked like NC State had put this thing away Clark kicks it James blocked but he stays with it to the basket pluss the foul what is happening W in that situ I one I cant believe o Connell blocked that shot to begin with James staying after it and thats the fifth on Middlebrooks oh conell doesnt get an assist for that does he I mean thats a tough play but what a play by J wow that that this has been an astounding turn of Applause events middle Brookss day is done six points four rebounds and 16 minutes in and out Huntley Hatfield tips the rebound white Dives on top the arrow belongs to the Cardinals Kenny ping couldnt have drown that Miss up any better this is why you stay till the end of the game Gman yeah its it there are people who stopped and are now watching from up in The Concourse not in their seats Applause with 209 left NC State led by 14 Huntley Hatfield over Burns its a threepoint game can you believe it very few Cardinals fans in their seats right now Burns pounding the dribble spinning poked away 12 to shoot 34 in the Applause game had no double team coming that time they Louisville staying home on all the shooters weve seen the wolf pack have some easy buckets on Baseline in bouns today may have missed horn under the hoop DJ horn with a left hand gets it to go and what the foul what a huge shot from the grad student he has been amazing this afternoon with his off and this is defensively this is what you want to do make him go to his off hand Big Time finish in the Applause crowd got 24 his high as a wolf pack was the Detroit Mercy game when he scored 26 only 28 points in his last three games since that Detroit contest but safe to say he has broken out of his shooting slump today threepoint play puts the pack up six with 312 left packs up theyre going to apply some just token pressure try to run some get just run a little time off no fouls here last touched by NC State so says Isaac Barnett Kevin Keats is begging for a replay review Ted Valentines waving him Applause back the reaction of the Wolfpack Defender seemed to make it look like it may have been off Louisville sky Clark needs it puts it in next foul will be one and one Cardinals need to foul at some point they got to foul quick they let valuable time go off the clock you could go for a 10second count in the back court theoretically but you get the foul with 146 left okay its not its not the double bonus so one and one hasnt been a great offensive day for Clark but hes had a couple gigantic makes from Beyond The Arc these last couple minutes yeah I mean that was uh a good 7 Seconds run off the clock DJ 75 clutch Moval with just one time out Music remaining timeout and no timeout C Cal are going to need to hurry wol pack by five Kenny Payne chooses to use his last timeout 146 to go and DJ horn got a new career high as a member of the wolf pack best performance ever came earlier in his career back at Illinois State against Northern Iowa at 34 still it was uh our for player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you ble Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom yeah DJ horn no question about it uh just the amazing performance Off the Bench nine of 14 six of nine from three perfect from the line also three assists for him to go along with a rebound outstanding effort coming back home to Raleigh its not about who starts its about who finishes hes played 34 Music minutes FY St can hang on here theyll be 4 one in the league their next two games are at home Tuesday against Wake Forest and in in the League this year Road wins are going to be like gold and

146 seconds away from a trip to an ice cream shot here in Louisville Kentucky Clark to Johnson needs to hurry with six seconds he fires and misses and diara has the rebound and that will do it 10 rebounds for Applause diara Valiant effort from Louisville coming back here 14 points down with two minutes to go cut it to three oh but now the fans are genuinely headed for the exits on a cold day here in the Derby City one and one diara sinks it really solid production out of their big players up front did what they had to do DJ horn really nice bounce back from a game against North Carolina
