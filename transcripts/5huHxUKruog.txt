losing season in 15 years Meanwhile Hampton second year under head coach Ivan Thomas They had a winning record last year for the first time since 2019 Hampton in the blue Virginia and the home whites cheering Captain Pirates one and one They opened with a close loss to Milwaukee and then beat up on MidAtlantic Christian Virginia opens into manto man Virginias got good size out on the perimeter cheering Shot clock down to two Some things dont change This is long and his three off the mark The rebound by Daniel Johnson a freshman captain a year ago His turnaround left that short Last touch Hampton So Virginia on the opening possession Maybe a nod to the past They get the offense of the other team to play late into the shot clock Well they did but they gave up an offensive rebound to Hampton and thats not part of the pass But this is going to be very interesting Hampton is not a team that really emphasizes the threepoint shot They emphasize energy and toughness and so look for them to do a little bit better job driving the ball to the basket Starting lineups for Virginia Malik Thomas averaged almost 20 a game at San Francisco last year And Sam Lewis on Q was the top threepoint shooter in the MAC So gone is the day of the packline defense Youll see a lot more of this fullcourt pressure Well they like to pressure fullourt They they theyre Virginias very deep They want to wear you down And what you saw on offense theyre not going to make three or four passes necessarily If they can get a three early in the shot clock theyre going to take it This is Jalique Gains Wyatt had a careerhigh 25 in the opener against Milwaukee Alorn State transfer His pass picked off by Thomas Virginia wants to run Thomas to the paint and he is fouled applause Now Malik Thomas is a guy who comes in with the reputation as being a pretty good threepoint shooter but last year at San Francisco he averaged almost seven free throw attempts a game So hes a guy who likes to take the ball hard to the basket Yeah thats a big part of his game He got to the free throw line as you mentioned in abundance and you know was drawing six plus fouls a game But its funny in his first two games and of course two games is is a very small sample size but in his first two games he took and made only four free throws And hes he shot the ball very poorly from three in the first two games And a guy like that if youre shooting it poorly drive the ball to the basket And last time out against North Carolina Central six assists a careerhigh So that wasnt in the original scouting report either name of the game Cody Williams zero in blue being defended by the BYU transfer Don Hall cheering ETN Strers saw the spectre of Grunlow whos got 10 blocks in two games Thatll give you a pause Strs Shot clock at two Theres another block by Grumlow and a shot clock violation You know so much is new Dan Some things dont change Well you know with Grunlow he barely left his feet for that And he doesnt swipe down with his arm He keeps his feet and just knocks the ball down Hes not trying to knock it into the third row I think hes going to be a really good shot blocker in the Atlantic Coast Conference You made a great point when we were talking at Shootaround He said with some of the new rules in place boy its going to pay to have an elite shot blocker as Struts is fouled attacking the rim Well and to get back to that and see you cant turn the ball over Hampton is a team again they they thrive on being tough and so you let their toughness get them into the game youre going to have a struggle on your hands But the way the rules have changed the block charge rule in particular used to be you could protect the basket by having a help defender slide in and take a charge But that doesnt really happen in todays game Friday night on ACCN Cameron Boozer and fourth ranked Duke hosting the fighting Larry Birds the Indiana State Sycamores And then Caleb Wilson off to an amazing start in his North Carolina career Hes at 20 plus points tonight against Ratford Three straight 20point games to begin his career UNC and NC Central on Friday night at the Dean Dome And he is a very articulate and expressive young man and confident Yes absolutely Why why not Ditter cheering to Grunlow The international connection Duter from Belgium Grunlow from Germany Well you just cant let Derritter stand in there and look around I mean you got to put some pressure on the ball You see what Hampton has done Theyve gone with three ball handlers on the floor Ele The rebound comes to Sam Lewis Toledos top scorer last year Now Tess Ditter 20 plus points in his first two games as a Cavaliier backing down Xavier Long who stole it away Derritter wanted a foul not called Nice job by Long who in the season opener 16 points 17 rebounds eight assists and a traveling violation on STS Well again now Derritter is a pretty tough guy to handle oneonone and this is just a great job by Long to maintain position Was there contact there Yes And you know he did get his arm in there and thats what Der was talking about but you know theres no there was no advantage disadvantage and so thats why there was no foul called although it the physical play inside is supposedly a point of emphasis Xavier Long is their Swiss Army knife defensively He can guard one through five Often defends the other teams best player And we get a foul on Cody Williams who got a little too handsy His first The long though is I mean hes big hes strong and you mentioned hes very versatile But even even for a player like that its going to be hard to defend Derritter time and time again oneonone down on the inside Ditter a 22yearold freshman spent five years playing professionally in Europe Hes got two years of eligibility at Virginia There he is Ditter The three too much Grunlow battling for it And its picked up by Unique Rink You look at Grunlow and and he can get a little stronger and that was a situation where a stronger guy just took the ball from him We heard Ivan Thomas the Hampton head coach at Shootaround tell his team cheering Hey were not the hunted tonight Were the hunter Here comes Rink cheering Theyve gotten away with an extra step Elely Shot clock at two Turns and connects Hampton is really off to a slow start but you can see what kind of battlers they are and Gruno fouled on the drive by Rink 74 Virginia music music every day and you know as a player I get more confidence I love I believe this Thursday Be sure to check it out Please welcome here team cheering Are you ready Is you ready You say you squad Is you ready Are you ready Is you ready Hey go Hey Yes music Heat music the great Ralph Samson in attendance And interestingly enough when Samson and Virginia beat Indiana in 1984 to get to the final four you know who was in attendance for that game None other than Ryan ODM music current head coach for Virginia His dad Dave at the time was an assistant for Terry Holland But Dave ODM Terry Holland two of the great people great coaches and great people in coaching music You played for Terry Holland Well you got to use your verbs correctly I was on the team when Terry Holland was the coach but uh Terry Holland had a massive influence on me Uh I owe an awful lot to him cheering Some subs in for Virginia Jakari White Hes instant offense off the bench North Dakota State transfer They also have Chance Mallerie Hes got the ball now Freshman from just up the road Lewis has his shot blocked and were going to get a foul And its on Hampton For those of you who just watched North Carolina Knockoff Ratford Virginia and Hampton off to lets say a scrappy start here at JPJ Mish Dan Bonner New look Virginia team new head coach in Ryan Odum A whole new roster Theyve got a couple of bigtime international players Hampton under secondyear head coach Ivan Thomas Last year the Pirates had a winning record for the first time since 2019 That last foul is on Chance Mallerie the freshman for Virginia Hang on a second The last foul is on Hampton Now they say its on Hampton Its going to be on Michael Eely Now Ivan Thomas is not happy about that Oh they changed the foul So Jalik Gaines Wyatt is charged with what is now his second foul He is one of their top offensive threats Had 25 in the season opener against Milwaukee and led Alcorn State in scoring last year The runner by Mallalerie with a little too much mustard I dont know that they changed the foul They called the foul on number two And I think that the scorers table got a little confused over there because Gaines Wyatt is number two for Hampton and Mer is number two for Virginia sweeping in the freshman Quinton Cooper Another foul down low cheering What we saw early in the game was Hampton struggle against the Virginia pressure But Hampton as we thought they might theyve been starting to take the ball driving it to the basket and that required Onenso to come over and try to block the shot And when a shot blocker goes if he doesnt get it that creates an offensive rebounding opportunity At the free throw line for Hampton Josh Ogendale who actually won in this arena back in 2021 as a member of the Iowa Hawkeyes Since then stops at Middle Tennessee Tennessee State and now Hampton Weve been talking about Virginias size but Rink who started the game is 610 Ogan is 7 feet tall cheering So and and Hampton has pretty good sized guards too This is not a matchup where Virginia is just dominant all the way across the board in terms of size You mentioned Ugo Onetso big shot blocker in there for Virginia Cavaliers sloppy early Gertrude kicks it out to Mallerie who knocks down the three Hes a local product and the way he plays hes got a chance to be a real fan favorite here But maybe you ought to put that one in the playwork Fumble the ball have it roll into the lane have your guy pick it up in the lane while hes sitting on his backside and kick it out for a three That works Fumble ruski is a play Ele knocks it down from the outside And this was a kid who was a former MAC rookie of the year at Sienna Averaged 13 a game there as a sophomore Then transferred to two lane Didnt play a whole lot Now has a key role here off the bench for Hampton Off the hands of Tess Ditter 69 22yearold freshman from Belgium Sorry Ger drops the ball Ditter goes down sitting on his backside gets it back to Gertrude and because the defense collapsed to try to get the ball that creates an open shot opportunity So thats what youre looking for Cause the defense to collapse into the lane kick it out for a three But thats not exactly the way you want to do it But Hampton has battled back into this game and you know they have really shown some pretty good toughness out here Theres Quinton Cooper big time scorer in high school The freshman tries to weave through a triple team and we get a whistle and its going to be an offensive foul He got the old hook in there Derritter does a really nice job moving his feet and there the hand hooks around and thats what the official sees that hes going right at le Jones and thats what Les Jones sees and so he calls the foul cheering Jakari White weaving inside cheering Mostly a threepoint shooter that time He takes it to the basket A lot of movement by Virginia particularly taking the ball attacking the basket Good ball movement good player movement cheering Virginia came into the game again small sample size but more than half their shots in the first two games threes Elely contested tough angle rips the rebound and they really want to push White is not gunshy No no hes not 17 a game at North Dakota State last year 40 from three Well they want to shoot the three but they want to shoot open threes Mallerie the three and a foul applause applause And sometimes you dont even need to be that open This is a really good screen by Anenzo And that I mean you make a three with somebody knocking you down Thats pretty impressive But from everything we hear about this kid theyre really excited about having him here Local kid And after the coaching change Ryan ODM was able to keep Mallerie who had committed to the old staff here in Charlottesville a young man who played his high school ball less than a mile from here at St Ans Bellfield once hit 11 threes in a game in high school They listen at 510 Im not sure hes that tall but hes about 190 lbs Hes very strong You know those of us that are 59 we always sign up for 510 We get that extra digit cheering This is Daniel Johnson Rim Thomass first recruit And another whistle down low Its against Hampton Chance Mallerie third straight game with at least two triples The local kid making good music music Reneov Dan Bonner The excitement for Virginia this season surrounds these two freshmen who are anything but freshman when it comes to experience Plenty of experience overseas playing in professional leagues And its very interesting Ditter we talked about him Hes a guy who can shoot the three He plays well inside Grunlow obviously a tremendous shot blocker who can score close to the basket And interestingly Grunlow and Onenso are both in the game at the same time So Virginia playing both the sevenfooters Nice turnaround jumper by Daniel Johnson who was on the CAL all rookie team last year He was a captain as a freshman And Ditter weve seen go for 20 points in each of his first two games Mallerie the drive the kick How about the three Ugo Onenzo his first career made threepoint basket Prior stops at the University of Kentucky in Kansas State His reputation is that elite shot blocker While he was at Kentucky he had 10 blocks in an SEC game against Miss had eight blocks in another game against Florida But this is really a nice play by Mallerie to get in there Again this is what Virginias trying to do Get the ball into the lane by the pass or the drive Its mostly been the drive today Make the defense commit and then try to get an open three On the back door cut count it Plus the basket Its Christian Watson who began his career with Miami in the ACC And that files on Thomas Thats two on Malik Thomas You know when when you got a couple of sevenfooters back behind you and you get beat you know you dont give up on the play but maybe you let the sevenfooters take care of it And Dan you got to think so much of that early in the season when you have a roster with 12 new players right Just learning how to play together which is lets be frank why you schedule games like this Thomaso hes got five He really moves well on Yenso Now that was a nice job by Thomas to get into the lane and draw the defense but Onenso is a guy who just really moves very well Ryan ODM told us today they feel he is an NBA talent Johnson over Thomas Silky smooth Daniel Johnson the teams top returning scorer And hes a tough guy you know hes a big guard And hes strong and hes not afraid Clearly Valeries got a couple of threes already Ono Okay you made one Maybe maybe thats enough for the night That was the heat check cheering Long nearly traveled Oandal almost turned it over Now does Thomas leading the break Puts it up and thats what he does best Get to the free throw line And particularly on if youre with him on the fast break you got to know hes going to go try to go to the basket And Hampton really bailed him out right there because he was off balance Foul is on Watson You think of what Virginia imported Seven transfers four who were all conference players including Malik Thomas three freshman and then the two international players in Derritter and Grunlow Ryan Odum coming over from VCU after leading the Rams to an A10 title last year I dont need to remind Virginia fans that he was once the head coach at UNMBC and he was he was the head coach at UNMBC There is he was the head coach some shared history if you want to call it that of the UNMBC team So but hes got deep ties He grew up in Charlottesville when his dad was an assistant coach for Terry Holland Really grew up in ACC country Dave Odum who was once the coach at Wake Forest was once a high school coach in Durham North Carolina Hes brought a different style to Virginia Youre seeing that now The packline defense is no more Theyll pick teams up fullourt Johnson No good Batted around Snagged by Grunlow applause Poked out of bounds by Daniel Johnson And one of the impressive things to me about Grunlow when he rebounds the ball he is looking to make an outlet pass as long as possible to get the offense off and running Heres Tessa Ritter 22yearold freshman cheering with a nice move down low And Virginias now made six of its last seven Ditter has already has shown us today his ability as a passer So you dont really want to try to help out against him but if you dont you let him get that close to the basket hes going to be hard to stop blocking foul called as Watson put it on the floor Its on Mallalerie and thats his second And we showed you a play earlier in the game where Derritter lost the ball trying to make this move but he hes just got too much strength If he can get that close to the basket if youre going to let him get there hes going to be hard to stop 69 240 cheering James Wyatt Shot clock at five at four Oandal cheering denied Johnson Did he beat the shot clock He did cheering D may check this But now nobodys you know everybodys talking about coaches challenges This is not a challenge This is not a challenge Youre not allowed to challenge this The review is for a potential shot clock violation And what what you want to watch is up above on on the right the clock is at zero It looks like the ball is still in the hands of the shooter Thats a shot clock violation music New roster new coach but the shot clock violation still plays at JPJ music music After review its been deemed a shot clock violation No basket screaming after review Its been deemed a shot clock violation No Denise Roth Dan Bonner What was surprising after the announcement was made in this building cheering somewhat of a muted response Have they moved on Uh there not very many of them here but you can see with the shot clock at the top of your screen the balls still in uh the hands of the shooter at the point that the clock was at zero Lewis nearly lost it That was a nice job by Daniel Johnson to get that off quickly though but he didnt have enough time And that was what was calling for it White lets it fly in and out Battle for the board Mapped out of bounds by Hampton and Rink Im not sure that thats the kind of threepoint shot that Ryan ODM is looking for They want to shoot the threes Last year at VCU 48 of their shot attempts were from three But Ryan ODM talks about maybe not taking the three Thats contested and that was a contested three and as you said earlier and as Ryan ODM told us today right now he feels the strength of this team Its the two bigs down low Thats one of them Ditter And here we have another oneonone opportunity for Ditter using the window It comes back to White Thats an open three Too strong Another offensive board Grunlo calling for it Shot clock at 12 They say the ball was tipped out It was Ivan Thomas secondyear head coach at Hampton 17 wins last year It was Hamptons first winning season since 2019 cheering Former Ed Culie assistant at Providence and Georgetown Shot clock at five At four kick to the corner Hall lets it go and hits He was on that BYU team that beat VCU in round one last year and got to the Sweet 16 cheering Watson turns it over Its really a nice job by Virginia to not get in a panic at the end of the shot clock Does that sound familiar And knocking it down And then Ditter showed you a really great skill for a big guy He runs back down the court and in transition hes able to cut off Watson whos a very quick player and force the turnover Gruno left it short Lewis tracks it down White catch and release Yes And a timeout by Hampton cheering Virginia six for 11 from threepoint land music And theyve got their largest lead Now Virginia they recruited a lot of guys who could shoot threes because they want to shoot the three The dribble penetration creates the open threepoint shot White knocks it down But the other key thing there is each of the last two threes that Virginia has made have come after an offensive rebound They the Cavaliers through in their first two games were have been tremendous on the offensive board and theyre continuing that tonight UVA in the midst of a 100 run and I think thats what youre going to see a lot this year Virginia as a very streaky team When the ball starts going in the basket you better you better be rescoring yourself There you go That was almost a big big double down low Weve seen that before Driving hard is Struts and he gets bailed out by the foul Well Grunlow is going to get called for the foul and he usually does such a good job going straight up but that time he jumped in to Struts And thats thats where Hampton has had their most their most significant success is when theyve been able to take the ball and drive it to the basket ETN brothers dad Lamont spent a couple of seasons in the NBA Redshirt sophomore from Newport News Spent some time in Boone North Carolina at App State Tester Ritter last year averaged a little more than nine per game in Spains top pro league And the baseline flush by St Louis Thats great ball movement applause initiated by Derritter cheering cheering Hall pokes it away Hampton cheering gathers Saw the long arms of Grunlow getting in the way of that Officials looking for help This is really good ball movement A nice job inside by Grunlow screening off the defender And this is the referees are getting together down here on the other end because Grunlow blocked the shot and the first thing the ball touched out of bounds I think it was Gaines Wyatt one of the Hampton players But thats thats more typical of Grunla going straight up not dropping your hands just blocking the shot with your wrist not trying to knock it into the 10th row 10 blocks in his first two games including seven in this past Friday against North Carolina Central Virginia with four blocks in the game so far cheering Ivan Thomas livid on the sideline Well now that ball is an out of bounds call So he cant challenge that if he wants to One thing now officials wont review out of bounds this year Thats one play that if you want to contest it its got to be challenged Yeah but you you dont have very many challenges You dont want to waste it Grunlow for Ditter No another offensive rebound and musling cheering it up and in is Sam Lewis The lead is now 20 Oandal nice move down low Hes 7 feet tall He weighs 275 lbs Hes going to be a load even for Grunlow in there if Grunlow has to play him oneonone Gallen Hall veteran point guard 61 starts at BYU applause And that is a foul away from the ball on Lewis I actually think they got Gruno Hes trying to get position inside and thats such a smart play by Hall It doesnt amount to anything but he sees the 7 foot we just said 7 foot 275lb guy gardener man went right by him So thats two on Grimllo and checking back in is Ugo Onenso Okay so 174 goes to the bench bring in another one and another guy who can block shots Yeah Is this Virginia or Florida State saw coming and Elijah Kennedy heard footsteps Lewis bodied up by Elely Virginia by 18 Derritter turns and hits cheering Boy thats a tough shot That was not bad defense Thats a really good shot And that time Virginia they everybody was standing around watching the guy dribble And thats not what weve seen cheering earlier in the game When guys dribbling there you get good movement by the Cavaliers But not that time But just the strength of Ditter solved that problem Strs baseline drive nearly lost it Immediate time out with 343 Tess Ditter spent five years playing professionally in Europe Played in Spain last year Hes got music four for Virginia music Everybody remember Ryan music ODM back in Charlottesville He uh was a player at Hampton Sydney On the left you see Griff Aldridge who was music his roommate now his assistant coach and hes been his assistant coach at a number of stops ODM coached with Seth Greenberg at Virginia Tech Got his music first head coaching job at Lenor Ry and then UNMBC was part of that 161 upset of Virginia Utah State VCU where he won an A10 championship and now at Virginia and we talked to him about you know being back home and hes talked a lot about coming home to Charlottesville where he spent a lot of his format of years and watching dad on the bench with Terry Holland That was one tough shot by Xavier A lot of the Hampton shots even some of the ones theyve made have been tough looks Lot down inside is picked off Nice job by Kennedy That pass was really telegraphed Long picked up by Derritter Almost lost it Mallerie gets in there Jump ball Possession arrow Virginia Thats a really great defensive play by Mallalerie Shows you the kind of intensity with which he plays You know created that loose ball situation and then went down and got it The balls loose and he sees it and he just jumps on it and it possession arrow favors Virginia But you know heres heres a guard and hes following a big guy whos dribbling the ball maybe where he shouldnt And so he left his own man and really nice play Hes been instant energy just a catalyst when hes in the game Couple of threes Well here now hes playing with Hall Thats so they got the two point guards in the game at the same time Ryan ODMs obviously music trying a lot of different lineup combinations He told us hes still figuring out the combinations that work the best as we get a foul down low Derritter is really confident with the basketball You Hes on the perimeter and usually a big guy on the perimeter is not going to try to drive by a guard but he does He figures he can get in there and create a mismatch situation off the dribble Cody Williams picks up his second Well we talked about the fact that Derritter has played overseas last year in Spain And the thing you have to understand about Derritter is he was not the star of his team in Spain He was like a complimentary player And here he is the guy whos supposed to be the main guy And thats always an adjustment even for somebody with as much basketball experience as Ditter Now they call him the tank But you can certainly understand why Elely defended by Mallalerie Two and a half to go Opening half Virginia in control Open denied by Onenso Boy he is he is some shot blocker Virginias got five blocks as a team Derritter inside He blocked a shot on one end He ran to the other end to get the offensive rebound Dana this guys the backup center Seven points for Ugo Onenso Former KState Wildcat former Kentucky Wildat Shot clock inside of 10 Long backing down to Riddle through the contact Well he initiated the contact Thats really a good no call Oh and Yenso had another one He knew it Well and Yenso we talked about his athleticism and its on display here Nice block shot He gets it and hes going to make the outlet pass Then he just runs the court Derritter is surrounded in there Nobody even sees Onyo coming How do you miss that guy Not a bad first half Seven points three blocks coming off the bench You get the sense And I know right now the competition cheering isnt ACC competition with Ryder NC Central and Hampton but with the size and the pedigree of a couple of these shot blockers Virginia should be amongst the ACC leaders and block shots Well you certainly think so Paul wants a pick The lane opens the lob to Onenzo Wow what a pass that was Hes got nine to go along with five rebounds and three blocks With that dribble penetration Virginia has forced help and kicked it out for threes And that time it lobbed for an easy dunk Lewis disrupting cheering Mallerie takes a big hit going for the loose ball and a foul is called You know every time there is some scrum after the ball today it seems that Malleries in the middle of it And hes going to have the opportunity to shoot free throws here He took a little bit of a shot though Hes needs to walk down there a little slowly I think Not the biggest guy 5 10 Virginia 7 for8 at the line today They were 57 in the first two games And thats that was really a surprise that everybody who was shooting free poorly from the free throw line is pretty good free throw shooter But again through two games its the old small sample size Yes absolutely cheering Its like your batting average after two games you know and got 160 more to play cheering About a 5second differential Johnson tough contested shot A lot of shots like that by Hampton Yeah but the thing that forced that was Mallerie Malleries chasing around causing a lot of problems there Not only guarding his own guy but helping out Valeries got nine Ono cheering puts the ribbon on a superb first half Shoot some threes and youre going to put on defensive pressure and get up and down the court on offense Youre going to be a team that is capable of going on runs Long in the post double team Stru the kick out raises the side of the rim Elely the follower Hampton finally gets over the 20 point mark Virginia with that 19point first half They held a team under 20 in a half for the 40th time since the start of the 2018 2019 season applause Test the Ritter big size advantage using it Follows his miss Itll stay with Virginia 18 to shoot You know Ditter did everything right except then he short armed the shot but he chases it down I mean Str is out there thinking Somebody come and help me please Hampton with a much different lineup to begin the second half Another offensive rebound Sam Lewis Malik Thomas he was a 20point scoreer at San Fran last year and hes got six You got to respect that threepoint shot even though he hasnt shot well from three so far this season But you know he gives you that pump fake you go after it and then that gets him right to the basket 39 from three last year cheering Jalik gains Wyatt cheering the Alcorn State transfer He ran into Sequoas Paul open blocked Strers closed down quick Lewis lines it up Thats the eighth three by Virginia Well and thats the way its gone for Virginia tonight You get a three blocked you kick it out and you get another one But Ditter on that last defensive stand he did a great job moving his feet staying in front of Gaines Wyatt and that allowed Grunlow to make the block Virginia with six blocks already 20 blocks in the first two games for UVA Long it will stay with Hampton but the shot clock inside of three Thats another great job by Ditter moving his feet We talked about the skill Long has and one of his good great abilities his ability to drive the ball to the basket but he couldnt get around Ditter Elely that did not hit rim and a shot clock violation Elie had more time than that You didnt need to take that kind You had enough time to catch the ball there make a pass maybe get a little bit better shot A highly contested three Its an air ball Its not what Ivan Thomas was looking for cheering Lewis shoots over Peter Oduro Sam Lewis was the top threepoint shooter in the MAC last year at Toledo Well he you hes feeling it He made Hes made a couple threes in this half and that wasnt necessarily great movement by the Cavaliers Just a couple of dribbles The defensive bit took one step back and that was all Lewis needed Lewis with 13 Three triples Loose ball and Elely gets it past Grunlo Thats twice now that Elely has got it past Grunlo here in this second half Skip pass Thomas Bang applause cheering And they get a foul on Hall got a little too handsy In their first two games Virginia was shooting 33 from beyond the arc and they were 60 almost 60 in the first half and theyre better than that in this half You mentioned him Malik Thomas Sam Lewis Jakari White all these guys came in with considerable threepoint shooting pedigree And then you you throw in Onenso who changed the scouting report overnight by knocking down a couple threes Hes knocked down a couple threes Hes not going to be one of your great threepoint shooters But if he is they become incredibly hard to defend But he has demonstrated that you cant leave him alone out there So heres another example Youre driving the ball to the basket Youre trying to defend Wat Watson driving the ball to the basket Leave him for your sevenfooter back there Yeah Sam Lewis instead committed the foul No you understand Lewis is trying to stay with him but okay now youre youre beaten and so leave it for the other guy You know hes back there cheering Now if youre Lewis in that situation you just got to make him slow down to give Grunlow a chance to get there Johan Grunllo spent the last two seasons in the basketball bundesliga which is Germanys top pro league and he was tied for second in that league in blocks last year and again thats a a considerable pro league out in Germany 20 years old guess who his teammate was on that German team last year Jaden Gardner who used to play at Virginia well you get you get those kind of connections Thats how somebody who played in the Bundesliga last year gets to Charlottesville From the Bundesliga to JPJ Quite the journey for Johan Grunlo music music 2 the threepoint shot has been falling music for Virginia 10 of 17 tonight Well part of their identity is going to be music threepoint shooting Now theyre not going to do nothing but shoot threes but we said last year Ryan ODMs team at music VCU 48 of their attempts were from threepoint range So they recruited threepoint shooters and these are outstanding threepoint shooting percentages Now of course today the Cavaliers are shooting 59 from three So when you recruit threepoint music shooters and youre going to play a style thats not based on threepoint shooting but relies heavily on threepoint shooting and youre going to make 60 of your threes youre going to be pretty good And whats going to be fascinating is they have the two bigs Theyve got Derritter theyve got Grunlow Were starting to see what Onenso can do as well Inside outside Weve seen this before It may even be something where on the nights where the threepoint shot is not falling You got a pretty good fall back option with the guys down low That time Grunlow was open Lewis at the side of the backboard Nice move by Elely to the T That really was a nice move by Elely But did you see how quickly Grunlow got up the floor He came close to blocking that thing See thats the other thing with these big guys They can really run Screen and roll out there Bruno wants it Well they should throw it to him Hes got STRs against him cheering Gruno wants it again Finally Hall able to find his big Well if youre going to work as hard as Grunlow is working particularly when you create a mismatch like that throw him the ball Spoken from experience reward the big man Well no Oh I nobody should ever have rewarded me I could never get open anyway Its hard to get open when youre sitting on the sideline But uh big guys work hard You got to reward them It stays with Hampton You know I really I really like Virginias point guard rotation as well Got the veteran in Hall the Greenhorn and Mallerie and music they got Grunllo the 20yearold freshman from Germany for the flush music Watch Sync Swipe Personalized Now available on the ESPN app Virginias been blocking shots all night really threw their first two plus games Kunlos got 13 blocks Onensos got nine blocks Theyve got a alltime shot blocker watching and Ralph Samson and block a lot more shots to catch him But Dan you go back to the era when Samson was in college and you know right around the same time where you had Elijahan at Houston Euing at Georgetown and it was the age of the big man And thats been a position that has been deemphasized in recent years the traditional big man And the big man certainly has evolved But is that wheel about to rotate you know back to the beginning Are we kind of in the midst of a revolution here where there is the big man making a comeback if you will Things always go in cycles And cheering the one thing you Well you never throw out old suits No you can throw out old suits Uh the the thing is that the big guys were watching today in todays game theyre all theyre all very mobile Uh and you dont have as many like strictly back to the basket guys Now youve had Zachi was a back to the basket guy So you have a variety of different kinds of big guys that weve seen in the last couple years But as teams work on shooting the three you got to get out to defend the three and that opens up the areas on the inside for big guys Again very early in the season and rider NC Central Hampton Thats not what Virginias going to face in the ACC Is on gets another dunk Hes got 14 points Hampton finishes at the other end but early on the returns have some promise for Virginia in terms of how the pieces look And then its on Ryan ODM to make them fit and find the right combinations Lets see And this is another problem that teams are going to have And I dont care who you are defending Ritter when they clear the side for him and he starts backing you down That is a very very difficult thing to defend And you know youre talking about the level of competition This is a very good Hampton team You mentioned before they won 17 games last year Theyve got size Theyve got guys who can shoot the ball And its just the thing is the Hampton hadnt been bad tonight Virginia has just been very very good Ivan Thomas the Hampton head coach just watched Cody Williams pick up his third foul moments after Daniel Johnson picked up a foul cheering Mallerie too easy Well he just he just provides so much energy when he is on the court I mean he sticks his nose in there defensively He looks for his opportunities offensively cheering Hes got 11 One of three Cavaliers in double figures Cooper Thomas Carells cheering Thomas almost walked and its tipped out of bounds by Johnson Sunday afternoon its an ACC Network womens basketball double header at 3 Eastern Georgia Tech hosting Jacksonville music Then Florida State hosting Indiana in Tallahassee applause Entering the game for UVA Martin Carrer Redshirt freshman who was with Ryan ODM at VCU but red shirted last year Hes a Frenchman And Johnson called for the reaching Hes another one of those guys who can shoot it And we havent even really mentioned Devin Tillis whos injured for Virginia They are hoping to get him back at some point this month He adds another shooter to this UVA roster Now hes a big versatile guy You know 67 and and he can shoot the ball Jussi Irvine transfer Got two shooters there battling for that pass and Thomas and White Thomas called for the offensive foul Devin Tillis a UC Irvine transfer where he averaged almost 14 a game last year helping Irvine to the NIT championship And you know its not just another shooter its age and experience He turns 25 next month Well hes 67 He weighs 240 lbs as you say he has a lot of experience and in their first game his knee just blew up and so or Ryan ODM made it clear to us hes going to be a part of this rotation I was actually in their uh open exhibition against Villanova that you know suddenly he didnt feel any pain or anything but suddenly his knee just blew up and he had surgery and they expect they hope hell be back very soon Onensos been everywhere So has Mallalerie Yeah Onenso Onenso had the ball and got it taken from him and Mallerie just took it back with Chance Mallerie The way he plays the infectious style Theres a little Kihei Clark there but hes a better shooter Hes bulkier kid too Uh but thats you know lets lets pull back a little bit Kihei Clark had one of the outstanding careers here Now when you think of where Kihei was as a freshman though Still got some Kihei Clark jerseys He played on some teams that did some winning Well you know you play on a national championship team and get There you go See and you were talking earlier about how the expectations never change at Virginia When you got one of those things hanging in your gym youre going to have some expectations Its funny right 2019 doesnt seem like that long ago but guys like Kihei who spend their entire careers with one program Ono gets another block Those have become unicorns in college basketball What a bounce pass that was Great ball movement White knocks down the three applause and cheering His fan section loves it to Jacob Absolutely Well Thomas actually got himself caught up in the air and he was going to try to throw you know a pass in the air and he thought Wait a minute I cant get it through there And somehow he bounced it Another rebound by On Yenso Hes closing in on a double double Too strong And guess whos there And Im telling you he is going to run to the basket Youve got to block him out And then did you see how quickly he got down the floor Thats a bad idea Ugo Oneno on the defensive end And then the ball movement like a symphony And Jakari music White knocks down the open tray music music The excitement around the Virginia basketball program centers a lot around guys like Tessa music Ritter from Belgium Johan Bunllo from Germany Its part of a trend in college basketball You see it in the ACC I got to see Luca Bogavatz last week at North Carolina Another guy who played a lot of pro ball in Europe Dame Sar certainly at Duke There is uh not just international imports in the ACC but these guys are seasoned a lot of them Theyve played pro ball in Europe And when you look at the success of some of these European players in the NBA it tells you what kind of basketball youre getting overseas these days Well and the players who are coming over from the pro leagues in Europe are coming over because they can make more money playing NCA basketball than they can playing professional basketball in Europe Yeah imagine saying that sentence a few years ago Mallerie again in the middle of it all Draws the foul Fourth foul on Cody Williams Virginia has kept the pressure on tonight both offensively and defensively Chance Mallalerie has a chance to become a fan favorite Thats where he played his high school ball Stfield and Bellefield and music uh less than a mile from JPJ Nicely done there by a production crew Virginia in the midst of its third 100 run Elely from the outside Hes got 14 to lead Hampton Elely has really done a nice job He scored inside a couple times Hes knocked down a couple of threes Look out Ornso tried to finesse it in along the trailer He pulls and connects Ivan Thomas isnt happy with whats gone on tonight but his every once in a while his team has shown some flashes That time they didnt get back on defense cheering Jakari likes that one Hampton gives it right back Onenso to Mallerie Slicing dicing and finishing Its hard not to like the way he plays Well theres something wrong with you if you dont like the way he plays I mean theres a lot of enthusiasm out there Hes using his strength He makes threes He attacks the basket Now itll be interesting Hes whether when he plays in the Atlantic Coast Conference whether his size will be a detriment because hell be playing against bigger guards than hes seen out here Hes got 16 tonight And thats not to detract from his skills at all I think he I think hell be very successful in the Atlantic Coast Conference number two player coming out of the state of Virginia pulls down a rebound top 70 player and they had committed to the old staff and a big recruiting coup by Ryan ODM to keep him home Gertrude too much off the shot fake cheering over Onenso We havent said that too often Well hes gone over Grunlow a couple times That time he went over on Yen on on Yenso I see if youre going to throw the pass to on Yenso throw it up at the basket cheering That surprised him Watson the pullback play getting a little bit ragged here as Ryan ODM calling out a play trying to get things organized Onenso in the low post Now that was some catch in the low post Hes got a careerhigh 18 Hes also got 10 rebounds So Virginia now at 80 points at the 837 mark of this second half Its the first time Virginia has scored 80 or more points in the first three games of a season consecutively since 06 07 In the entire Tony Bennett era they only had one threegame stretch where they scored 80 points in three straight cheering James Wyatt ball out of control cheering gets it back in and out Offensive rebound Another chance And this time Shalik Gaines Wyatt hits the three Again they dont rely heavily on the three but coming into this game in their first two games they shot 42 from out there and theyve really struggled shooting the three tonight And I think the reason theyre kicking it out for threes now is nobody wants to try to shoot it over on Yenszo See they need to stop throwing the ball down low to him Throw it up to him That one offline STS Thomas blocked at the rim STS there Grunlo getting ready to check in for Onenso who looks like he needs a breather Well hes played very hard Of course he needs a breather Gertrude the rebound off the Johnson miss Throw it to him Gertude takes it himself Elijah Gertrude missed all of last season with a right leg injury Lone returning scholarship player Virginia almost doubling up Hampton Its 8242 music Get the snorts And its been a clinic Virginia tonight 59 from the field and 11 of 19 from the three They got good ball movement at the bench Dan Bonner has been a huge factor Guys like Mallalerie Onenso Jakari White and the the the kind of energy that they have supplied off the bench Onenso Weve been talking about him He just runs cheering Hes on the bench Welldeserved rest with Grunlow back in Cooper pulls Batted around and finally it comes to Johnson cheering Little sky hook over Grunlow Offensive rebound Three on the way Not there Gertrude gathers Now you brought up the point earlier in the game guys like Bruno Derritter supporting players on their teams in Europe when they played professionally Now they get their star turn here at Virginia On the other hand a lot of the transfers that Ryan ODM brought in including Malik Thomas they were the alphas on their old team and they now have to adjust to more of a supporting role And thats why its so difficult to put a team together in this day and age because youve got that kind of situation just about with every team Gertrude lines up a three Too strong and the rebound to Haskins Another freshman for Hampton 13 in blue Aiden Haskins and Ryan ODM still trying out different combinations trying to see what people can do You know as the season goes along hes not going to play a rotation thats this extensive Lewis and Derritter getting ready to check in That is Martin cheering Carrer One of the advantages of playing a lot of guys everybody just keeps running and keeps playing career from the southwest part of France the Aquitane region They got a fascinating history It was like part of France then part of England then went back to France got one tipped Thats another block shot It sure is Thats eight blocks 28 blocks now in almost three games for Virginia Groomlow through the contact plus one And that was a really good play by Groomlow because one of the things that the guards if youre a guard you have to be able to do is you got to be able to get the ball to the big guy when hes open and hes at his best advantage Gertrude was a little slow getting turned and so Gruno really had to fight off the defender Oduro doing a nice job but committing the foul But Grunlow was open and then he started to get covered up You got to if youre going to use your big guys effectively you got to throw them the ball when theyre open in an optimum position And you wondered if something was said to Gertrude who before the last break scored on a basket and you rightly pointed out hey Onensos open throw him the ball Well its one of those situations where yeah youd like him to throw Onenso the ball but hes dribbling it Nobody stopped him He went right to the basket Sometimes when you make that pass thats what causes a problem The guy drops the ball I did say throwing the ball because on Yenszo I was just so impressed because he had asked to come out of the game He was obviously very tired There was somebody waiting over at the scorers table for him and that he still he ran the court and got himself under the basket wide open Long three by Thomas No And the old adage reward the bigs for running the floor cheering Now Virginia looks to be in his zone here Well again youre trying things cheering cheering at games like these for teams like Virginia 12 new players You get to work with different lineups You kind of get a sense of who plays well together Grunlo going strong to the rim and a chance for one more And for a team like Hampton a game like this is a scouting report for themselves before they go into colonial play Virginias going to expose all your weaknesses And if you do things music well then it plays against UVA Itll play in the Colonial music music What is 308 remaining here in regulation Any shop Dan Bonner Ryan Odum emptying some of his bench including Desmond Roberts the sophomore from Charlottesville number 13 As you look at the new coaches in the ACC this year Will Wade made a splash in the transfer portal got Darien Williams Jai Lucas at Miami and uh Florida State Florida That was quite a game tonight Now the Seinals you know theyre like everybody else You get a new coach and you you got a whole new team and they play very competitively against the defending national champions Lost 7876 That was a Florida State team that was near the bottom of the ACC last year You know again you dont want to you dont want to put too much faith if thats the right word in what youve seen against obviously inferior competition in your first three games But what Ryan ODM has to be happy about is his his team has flashed a great deal of potential Obviously theyve got size theyve got ball handlers they can pressure you on defense That that there is some talent and some depth there that that has to make you optimistic Carter Lang a walkon denied And you know on a night when you know Ditter who had been their top scoreer through two games really not much of an offensive factor they got to win by 40 Yeah theyve got five guys in double figures and Ditter in one of them Malleries had a nice game 16 points Lang from the corner Crowd wanted that one to go in Rebound to Cooper Freshman leading the charge almost lost it Gathers and scores How did he get that over Malleries head Stolen away and knocked in the back court but we get a foul Well everybody getting a chance to play now for the Cavaliers including the coachs son Owen Odum checking into the game Final 90 seconds here in Charlottesville Now one of the things Ryan ODM I wanted to see his team do today was just finish the game off They didnt quite do that against NC Central let their foot off the gas in the second half once they had the big lead We havent really seen that tonight as Kennedy hits the three from the outside The Texas State transfer that Virginia has shot the ball so well today And you know lots of times when you shoot the ball well you just you play defense better Youre more aggressive But I thought it was their aggressiveness that led to their good shooting in the first place Ran tries to follow the miss and we get a foul down low and Hampton they you know this is the first game in a pretty extensive road trip for them Theyve got a theyre going to start doing the New England tour Theyre going to Brown and then they play Holy Cross and theyre at Boston College Now they dont come back home until the 25th of November when they take on Maryland Eastern Shore ODM with the rebound to coachs kid Now Carrera Gertrude sweeps in Dan Its an awfully small sample size and the competition again is not ACC competition but through three games what is you know one thing that jumps out about this Virginia team if youre going to score 91 points youre going to be hard to beat Uh you know and as silly as that sounds that the whole object of basketball is to score more points cheering than your opponent And I you know had a a basketball coach a high school coach over in Stanton used to tell me you know if you score if you hold them to 40 points you only got to score 41 to win And my argument always was yeah but if you get 90 they got to get 91 to beat you And what were seeing here with this Cavaliier team through the first three games their defense has been solid that they really put a lot of points on the board 80 plus in the first two games music 91 tonight
