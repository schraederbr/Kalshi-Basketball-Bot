in the home whites with the script lettering across the chest orange striping down the side kinus travels in gold with white numerals and nem McLoud to jump Center the balls up and once again he wins it easily tipping the ball back to Judah minz Syracuse has the games first possession and works at the end to our left smallish Gathering here at the dome in this second game of the season Min just pass midcourt bounces into the right perimeter for Justin Taylor kesa spreads the floor comes way out defensive Taylor inside the arc flips it out for Starling sees a path down the middle of the lane flips the ball up front rimit in and a foul JJ Starling draws one early a chance at a threepoint play to get us going the fouls on TJ gadon his first and thats what JJ Starling does thats what he brings to this team you know things broke down right there they didnt run anything and the offense didnt screen well gave it to Starling he just took it hard right to the basket pressure on the defense YN figur to do that quite a bit Starling and and Mintz in particular free throw is spit out by the rim and the orange will settle with two to get it going after one possession two nothing C 30 seconds gone Kinesis ball right end at the hash mark on the right its seam endall oneheaded pass above the arc then below the free throw line on the left for staveski drives the Baseline nobody home he got by mince whos saying hey where was my safety help and staveski got right to the rim laid it up and it nice drive by steisy but again youre right no help at all from turys on the weak side just less than a minute gone open man right side Justin Taylor quick release for three back of the rim no good in the air theres a whistle from official Bert Smith and hes got a foul on kishis Frank Mitchell may have held McLoud as he was going for the board there first foul on Mitchell too early on the griffs Bert Smith is from Buffalo New York is that right Baseline throw in for Jud minz all the way out to midcourt and JJ starling nem McLoud with a high pick and roll second Defender comes on a hedge Starling unloads right to mince and gets it back Starling elevates a three it twists and hits with a thud and brought down off the rim by stesy starts the break Blows By mince kick out left side Jumper in the air iton all no and brought down on the far side by Chris Bell into the front Court Starling Malik Brown already at the scores table for the orange Starling lobbing right to the rim short of the basket for McLoud he fakes then he banks it up and off the glass to score it is 42 cuse and Malik called back to the scores table you get a basket and you can stay in the game thats exactly what happened right there with McLoud stesy step back did not pull the trigger endall feeds Mitchell left of the lane turning into McLoud handing back off Wing left jumper from there no but a foul Gadson had it swept out of his hands but another whistle from Bert Smith and a foul on Chris Bell is the oranges first just under two minutes played here at the DOL its the orange four Kinesis 2 two shot comj so at the line is TJ gadon 67 from New York started his college career at George Mason averaged seven and a half points four and a half rebounds last year for Kenisha and the free throw is good do you find coach are you turned off at all or theres more of a story now in college basketball you cant just assume if a guy played last year that he played at the school that hes with now and uh a little more background weve got to fill in here yeah youre absolutely right then you know when you look at their team you say Okay transferred from where and you know he transferred from someplace you theres going to be three or four of them at least on this team and thats the the state of the game these days both free throws good were tied at four cuse ball Left End Starling just pass the line to MZ rocket pass into the corner Bell wants three its an airball but a good pass to McLoud in the lane kick out for Starling clock did not reset Jumper in the air around the rim and off minz got thrown down off the Starling Miss teski dribbles it out bounce pass to a cutting teammate in the lane and McLoud takes a whack thats a foul Frank Mitchell on the take mcclouds first team second Mitchell at the line for two and one of the things theyll be watching early in the year here is how does Adrien atre work the officials and hes up into the year of Ron Grover early I like it I like it you know I mean the last thing you want is for the officials to say oh Adrian AR hes a great guy he doesnt say anything you know thats not what you want Mitchell has some heft to him 68240 at the line and the free throws around the rim and off hes from Toronto always a little bit of an issue if youre trying to make that transition from a Canadian school to an American one so he had to sit out last year while they figured that out second free throw back rim and no good McLoud an easy rebound games tied at four sleepy start mints into the front Court off the screen from a cloud tries to turn the corner overhead past left side Bell drives the Baseline against eond doall had it stripped out of his hands in Pursuit is Taylor into the corner and shoveled and pulled out by the Dutchman for kesas they look to take the lead here good hit ahead and short Corner left off the pass from staveski its Mitchell backing down McLoud left mid post turns in the lane tried to hook him and a travel is called by official Roger aers so it was a little slow developing for kishis and a golden Griffin turnover Cirus turned it over the last time with Chris Bell and I think Chris Bells got to relax hes playing so tight right now like hes got to make every shot hes got to make every play just got to relax and play good enough that he can do that in baseball Parlin its like trying to hit a 10run homer right it doesnt exist so yes you just got to chip away what you can do up top Starling to the near side left slashing in Bell to the rim flips it up and scores a drive to the basket for Chris Bell for a dece orange in front 64 Q spy two three minutes Gone staveski With The Ball under his arm calling a play one hands at beyond the arc on the right for TJ Gadson at the hash mark between the circles now for Yuri Fritz handing it off left side back to zesi shot clock 10 he splits the defense but the Eraser at the rim blocks it away McLoud On The Run its Starling hit ahead Taylor wants three on the left give him three thats how you do that and the orangs are up nine to four thats how you push it great defensive play by McLoud thats what hes in there for and then they push it right out and look for that wide openen three four of the Syracuse five starters have scored mince the lone exception foul line drawn right at is eight bouncing into Fritz got a step on Taylor hes bumped and the ball goes out of bounds over the Baseline itll stay with the grips underneath first sub in the game for kesas is Trey dinkin 62 Jr from Chester PA Junior cowage transfer he replaces gadon so they get quite a bit smaller here 62 in for 67 and now another change as Joe Jones Buffalo native and a grad transfer to kishis is into the game for the first time he replaced Mitchell kesas ball up the Baseline out bound shot clock at eight staveski trying to throw it all the way to the back line batted Away by McLoud hes going to make it awfully difficult to move the ball near the rim yes he is minz on the crossover dribble trying to shed Fritz and steady he picks up a second Defender flips it into the corner left to Starling on the push and his Pink Shoes in the paint his shot back of the rib no good another rebound for staveski small player on the floor pushes it over the timeline met by minz keeps it going to the left alley throwing out for dinkin a pump fake back to stesy in the right corner mince pokes it free teski recovers its in front of the orange bench goes by McLoud on the switch throws into the left corner for dkin under a white headband shot clock 10 sos playing really good defensively right now crossover dribble NBA 3 on the left off the glass and down for Trey Jenkins first threepointer of the game for Kinesis 9 to7 the score thats why they put him in the game make that three off the backboard thats right orange ball left end at the free throw line Judah turns and fires 14footer guess what he hit the deck trying to get a foul this time no whistle broke it out by staveski crosscourt near side endall Rises for a triple leaves it short offensive rebound by his countryman Fritz works his way back in against McLoud drops back to eall right of the lane shovel foul line Fritz met there by mince and he plays it out above the line on the push left sides toes in amongst the big people throws out front five on the timer now for dinkin crossover dribble to the free throw line right elbow jumper dinkin halfway down and out punched Away by McLoud and starlings got it for the quees orange by two with the ball Starling near side F line extended B at triple try and its down the middle Chris Bell matches his Five Points from Monday night and the orange lead is five Chris Bell makes a driving basket the last time down that kind of got him going a little bit stesy top of the key three is around the rim and off easy rebound for Starling staveski is very active pitch ahead McLoud beat everybody down the floor good find by Starling for the catch easy layup timeout reg making a difference here in the middle on defense too six minutes played kishs ball right end the floor orange working on subs for the first time have Malik Brown back at the scores table but all the starters on the floor at the moment out top for kesas TJ gon whos already gotten a breather and his return oneonone with Chris Bell above the threepoint AR in the game for the first time is Cam pesi hes on the left wing into the lane flashing to the basket theres a foul on the take by Joe Jones and care provider of Syracuse Athletics at the line for kishis Bryce oo senior from Dallas free throw good and another one coming for oo last year 47 foul shooter one of two on the Strip rebound easily for nem McLoud so much of what McLoud does you dont want to discredit him he just makes it look easy at 74 and as big as he is hes also super athletic a pass me his way on a pick and roll broke it up loose ball to Justin Taylor he misses a 15footer brought down by Fritz and the break going the other way for kesas off the high pick and roll its dinkin to the rim scoop shot banked in off the window for dinkin and five for him 1410 now Taylor head of the key got it from minz the orange trying to push even off a make there seven minutes gone Syracuse with the ball by four JJ Starling between the circles for Mintz foul line left Taylor extra pass into the left corner for Bell in front of the Kisha bench he rips a three its an airball too deep and it bounces to gadon now coming out of the back court is dkin two at the scores table for the orangs now as kader Copeland is there as well look at to check in no subs for the first s minutes of the game outside left its gadston back around the horn to the right and police with his hair teased out Fritz high low open underneath is oo bank shot good Starling again kind of looking well where was the support there defensively first field goal for oo and its a twopoint game kind of look like what kesas is doing on the offensive end here theyre isolating making a couple nice passes and getting to it mince pushing hard from the left his Defender just kind of whiffed after a little contact dinkin was sheded easily and mince has his first point so now all five starters are in the scorebook and its going to be a line change for the oranges as Kyle cuff joins those at the scorers table dinkin shot hits with a th on the rim taken down by Taylor orange by four into the front court its Mintz played eight minutes and change timeout coming up into the right corner its Bell up along the threepoint Arc Taylor drives in the lane to the rack and he slams it down with both hands Justin Taylor the jam by six Taylor shows that he can do more than just take threes puts the ball on the floor goes right to the basket with authority and to his credit Chris Bells done the same too on a driving take to the basket somebody whos perceived to be primarily a shooter Fritz handoff Wing right to Gadson shot clock 10 foul on extended left its police defended up by Starling along the Baseline they play it above the foul line to Fritz in the lane Bell tripped up shots off the glass no and Roger AES I believe blowing his whistle for the first time this one go at the line for Kinesis Yuri Fritz sophomore from the Netherlands and his shot rattles around the rim and off average two points a game a year ago also a bit of a knee injury did not play after mid January this is kind of game too that if youre going to hang in here you got to make free throws yeah you know theyre now three for eight I believe from the free throw line and both misses there for Fritz orange ball into the front Court was Starling Syracuse by six Starling a lefthand dribble against the double team out front to his right is Kyle cuff first Subs in the game for the orange cuff Copeland and brown on the floor with JJ Starling and Justin Taylor shot clock 10 down the right alley Starling hooks a pass it to the right corner cuff he was standing on the sideline huh you said that in the last game a little bit too that coach Jim Bano always said theres a reason why they have lines around the basketball court youre not supposed to go outside those lines and in this day and age its the same look at the court here is the same size as Kansas and everywhere else hes playing in his career sixpoint Syracuse lead gadon up top his three is around the rim and in gadon drops the Triple A Kinesis team that average eight and a half threepoint hits per game last year among the best in the Metro Atlantic double pump shot Copeland probably thought better of that the Metro Atlantic double pump shot Copeland probably thought better of that look at a tie it his top of the key pop is Off the Mark Copeland pokes it into the middle where police uh takes it away pesi to the left side now up top for Fritz pass to the right side and again on the line in this case is TJ gadston so the court has shrunk on them a little bit obviously yeah its not the same you dont remember maybe theyre more used to playing at the Riley Center with her hands right there you cant step remember Jean Hackman and hoers you know hey 15t 10 ft you know just the same as our J back inory Starling wide to the right down below the free throw line right sideline is Taylor had it stripped comes all the way out near midcourt to recover on his left is Starling with his shirt untuck tries to blow by against pesi bank shot with continuation yes scor the goal and the foul on pesi his first team foul three on the griffs TSH teski had been out and now he replaces pesi 949 to go in the opening half and the orange lead by five NBA move by JJ Starling and continuation play got it Starling has missed the Oranges only free throw attempt of the night hes at the line looking to get the lead back to six he flips it up and its around the rim and off tight rims tonight 20 15 dinkin angles left on the hand off to stesy they reverse it back with a pass to the right side for gadston and then foul line left its dinkin again shot clock at 12 dinkin to Fritz to the foul line put it on the deck sloppy to the floor Brown Dives in bending over cuups got it and hes body blocked by Fritz foul on the Kinesis big man his first teams fourth orange were trying to get headed up the floor there non shooting foul and a side out on the rear court for the C leading 20 to5 you know Kisha just looks better they look better than what theyve been they playing with some confidence theyre older you can tell that theyve returned a number of players from last years team and well only 21 games total the last two years yeah Brown Around the Horn to the near side left for copelan overhead pass look away feed down inside for the jam by Malik Brown Great lead from Copeland its 22 Applause 15 staveski to the far sideline at quarter Court back up top to Fritz back door dinkin Elevate Starling got in the air so did Brown and dinkin shot is good off the bank pretty moved by Trey dinkin seven points to lead the grips its 2217 hes come off the bench and done a terrific job here for them played quite a bit last year average 20 minutes a game Taylor long jumper right side goes begging off the rim and Straight Out of Bounds under the watch of Frank Mitchell its Kisha ball dinkin was a parttime starter last year 11 starts and 20 minutes of playing time per game 8 and a half minutes to go in the first Syracuse by five and Kinesis walks it up staveski handoff Wing right to dinkin staveski runs the Baseline hes got it back in the left corner and knocked out of his hands by Justin Taylor coach ay calling for a moving screen against kishis not given Baseline throw in for teski and he Loops it out top to gadston stesy whos really came in as their best player good seal inside a feed for Mitchell got the defender on his back caught it and dunked first points for mitell in the game its a ThreePoint Contest yeah and you know this is a stet is their best play and he really has hasnt done a whole lot so far well he hes been looking for everybody else hes scored only two points but you can tell hes the guy whos kind of making them go hes playing at a different speed slashing from the right and right to the rim goes Kadir Copeland that was a burst of athleticism for the jam you know cope he does something every play sure does good bad indifferent hes involved in every play orange by five staveski out of the Trap down inside throws up top along the Baseline lob it low and left for Mitchell Brown on him Bank Shot Mitchell no tipped in the air by Brown and Taylors got it for the cuse up ahead Starlin eyes up on the dribble retreats to the sideline to a cutting mince down the alley right impeded by staveski again minz was getting that foul call Early in the exhibition season and last game not tonight going the other way Mitchell to the rim and hes followed by Copeland Mitchell looks like a below the rim type player crew that has referee Judah a number of times last last year um and I think you know the Fallen for that he likes to draw contact all the time then he falls on the ground and sometimes inexperienced refs are going to give it to him these guys are not Roger As one of the most recognizable and Veteran officials in college basketball with Ron Grover and Bert Smith all uh NCAA tournament caliber first free throw for Mitchell was windblown somebody must open the door open the back door he didnt get it uh anywhere close second one he over corrects its off the bracket no good and kesas is three of 10 from the free throw line in the game Mitchells 0 for four himself thats not good no 2419 Syracuse with the lead and the ball slashing from the left JJ Starling Bank Shot no Mitchells got the rebound in the last lap there outlets to a speedy dinkin into the front Court Blows By brown but got in too deep and threw it away intercepted by Mintz into the front court minz with the rearview mirror to his left Starling back up top to minz top of the key three on its way and pure for Judah minz fun to see those two work together Syracuse by eight B lead of the game for the orange yep unselfish on both parts to get to the open spot and uh Judy shot doesnt look great but doesnt make any difference as long as it goes in even the footwork getting into it uh a little questionable maybe but uh it goes Music down orange by eight stesy step back after the push off against Starling right the rim no good Min has the board unloads to The Far Side for Copeland into the front Court spinning at the free throw line to the rack no off the windows teski has the board its oneonone on the counter strike bounce pass right stesy to dinkin slammed to the deck by Mint dinkin missed badly the foul on Judah its his first team Sixth and dinkin will get two at the line in an eightpoint game he knew that was coming Judah couldnt get there to get in front his body in front so you know thats going to be what uh referees are looking for in that kind of a play dinkin at the stripe free throws on its way and good think its an 83 foul shooter a year ago so he ought to be one to get the back on track at the line 2720 orange second free throw very short puns in the air by Copeland loose to the corner Starling runs it down for the orange six minutes to go first half H by seven Starling turns over a left hand dribble off a flat screen from Malik Brown plays it to Brown back door pass abute to men hes up the elevator for a twohand slam just kind of climb the ladder there right up the ramp and down I like the fact that Judah minz acknowledged that Malik Brown just made a beautiful pass to him too Mitchell with a screen for staveski they feed Mitchell left low block backs his way down turns his shoulder into Brown kind of an Up and Under and brown faded away Mitchell put it in with the right hand 2922 as long as he doesnt have to get to the foul line perfect crossover for Starling throws it back above the threepoint Arc for mint plays it into the left corner elevating for three Taylor count it Justin Taylor with his second three of the game eight points total orange by 10 for the first time great screen too that allowed tail to pop open in the corner sesy left hand dribble off the left elbow deep in the left corner for dinkin watched by Starling pull up 14 footer around the rim and off Mitchells got the offensive board wheels back after a fake and scores against Brown good play by Mitchell half dozen for him beautiful play by Mitchell on the inside used that big body of his to to move Malik Brown out Starling on pick and roll action to Brown off the right elbow further left its minz gets a step on staveski throws back up top to Starling and further right to Taylor Starling fakes right drives left has the ball knocked off himself I believe out of bounds it is kishis basketball Syracuse Subs Kyle cuff and nem McLoud return they replace Malik Brown and JJ Starling orange by 8 425 to play in this first half game number two of the Season at the dlm the orange are also o home next week against kishis and then gone for a while between the circles out front Bryce oo to his right staveski theyre calling for it inside with Mitchell spinning up top jumper for endall is good with the foul line SE Mall his first points of the Season it is 32 to 26 mince to Copeland just passed midcourt now Taylor crossover dribble to the near side left cuff elevates for three its pure Kyle cuff second three as an orangeman and Syracuse leads 3526 and I think Kyle cuff is a shooter I think hes somebody thats going to come off the bench and give you a big lift offensively Yep this year yeah Mitchell dribble hand off out top with stesy Mitchell gets it back great pass Mitchell got styed by cuff but a foul called Ron gr said he got him in the head first foul on cuff seventh on the team 328 to play first half Timeout on the floor Bo well walk into the locker room in halftime and say hey fellas we make some free throws and this game is you know two or three point difference here well minimum you have four points out there maybe six in what is a ninepoint game free throw very short Syracuse uh not exactly a shooting uh Exposition at the uh line either exhibition they have gone 0 for two tell you what Mitchell is a horse inside though hes 0 for six at the line so youre going to have a hack of Mitchell here if this game gets close offensive rebound to gadston then eond doall miss long rebound starts the break into the front court its mince into the paint forc the pass through the hands of McLoud too hot to handle and McLoud thought it was going to be a shot so that thats the type of turnover that uh mince will work to avoid yeah and thats one of the ones that McLoud thats a hard pass for him to catch hes in traffic well youre better off putting it on the rim no matter what he can go get there if its a Miss shot good feed into oo got inside position against Taylor and rings the bell oo with five in the orange lead cut to seven nice backo play by Kus foul line left its Taylor left of the lane minz got shoved by staveski on the catch foul against Taj staveski is his first team foul five so made their last three threes which is news they were one two for eight before that now theyre five for 11 well made five total in the opener Monday theyve got five in this game and 11 tries kesa substitution Frank Mitchell checks out starting fiveman Yuri Fritz back in mins the trigger man on the Baseline works at the end two our left 253 to go in the half a deep 5sec count tried to throw it off somebody and missed basically comes out and intercepted easily by Kinesis so thats two empty trips really on Judah minz didnt get a lot of help there from open receivers Fritz up top near side right it is gadston low and right Fritz shot pinned against the window by McLoud and the Ricochet down to Taylor of the orange men to the front court with a sevenpoint lead eyes up slipping the screen McLoud Min to the free throw line flips up short from 14 offensive rebound put back yes coure mlau he makes it look easy doesnt he block out at one end runs down the court hes below the r he runs much better than weve given him credit for yep Four Points matches his Monday output in 10 minutes seski to Fritz Fritz got it back from oo watched by the smaller cuff out top Fritz on the handoff jumper no and Taylors got the rebound off the bounce on the Gaton Miss Outlet Far Side for cuff speeding into the front Court crossover dribble at PACE flips it up from 14 no and McLoud got just one hand on it out of bounds it goes to the griffs orange sub JJ Starling returns replacing Kyle cuff the orange restore the starting lineup Syracuse by nine cough pushes the ball like the rest of the guards at Sak hon looking for that first shot coming off for the break Im not sure Adrien arre wanted that particular shot that time but thats what youre going to live with if youre going to play up and down quick thats what youre going to have foul line left Gaton floats in misses a 12footer offensive rebound quick put back for Yuri Fritz his first points 3730 obviously one of the concerns of cuse has this year is can they rebound the ball and uh somebody should have had that defensive rebound we see Malik Brown coming in to take that somebodys Place Taylor at the right point to the sideline for Mintz behind the back dribble overhead past deep left corner for Starling 10 on the timer he works his way into the paint turns and fires over eond doll good on the fadeaway for JJ staring six points for the bville B orange by n not an easy shot right there stesy weaving through traffic sees a path against McLoud nahem recovers and knocks that one against the underside of the back for out of the outlet its Taylor to Starling in the lane with a hammer down throws it back to Mintz little hesitation there cant get clear for a shot throws it Opposite to Bell down the middle of the lane switches to the right hand and floats it in seven points for Chris Bell orange by 11 final minute of the first half floating shot by oo is good off the back iron Bryce oo with seven points orange have not taken a timeout in this half and the final 30 seconds theyre going to get it over mid Court I would imagine call timeout here red is asking for it and now they finally get that administered probably could put a little time on the clock if needed but at the moment it uh is set for 18 seconds left in the half and a time out the cant take with you to the second half anyway theyre going to draw something up here you know weve seen in the Jim bam era what would happen right now whoever is going to be throughout the years they would give their oneonone player this time it looks like it probably be Judah minz just to stand at half court and take the last shot create and make whatever you can out of out of that play well see if they do this with Adrian doesnt mean they literally have to take the last shot right but theyre the one thats going to be the Creator youre going to uh work off the fact that the defense is keyed toward junam min May create an opening uh for somebody else on his penetration but hes certainly uh late in the shot clock is adept at uh getting to his spots and his shot and in some cases getting to the free throw line and the key thing is to make sure you got the last shot dont take a shot before time so that they can get an opportunity the opponent so whatever it is either you know got to go to the half with KES is not having any more than 32 absolutely absolutely orange by nine quarter Court throw in near sideline for JJ Starling plays it to Mint along the right boundary there is a foul to give for kesas teski is up on Mintz so he can take some chances defensively if youre kesas teski bodies up minz down the right side of the lane misses the shot Kinesis could get a shot here offens oh defensive rebound for gadon and he was juggling it in the back court that is a travel side out Syracuse with under three seconds to go kesis really should give the foul here they didnt have to last time and they probably should have gotten a shot off he sure could have you know and uh they tried to push it up but well see if Kenisha is going to foul Starling to throw in again at that same spot they give him some space into Malik Brown poked free loose to the floor and sts got it but no time to do gets the first possession of the second half in a ninepoint game which Syracuse has not trailed and Kisha sh 53 in the first half Kisha 46 and theyre looking saying were four for 14 from the foul line you know you make half of those and its a fivepoint game or so here Denis ball left end in the gold uniforms up top of seam eond doall and a pass down along the Baseline stesy had a different idea and then as he tried to choke back the pass it went over the Baseline a turnover by the golden Griffins turnovers were six a piece in the first half orange ball right end with mint out of the back court met by stesy hand it off to Taylor mince gets it back down the lane to the left low block throw it out for a bell triple try right to the rim no good and an uncontested rebound for Frank Mitchell of kesas staveski near side for eond doall left to the Lane now Mitchell turns to face McLoud now backs into him leans in the lane into the paint cant get McLoud off his feet Banks out no and McLoud just held his ground and ran down the rebound thats excellent work a terrific defense by McLoud slash into the basket Starling cant be stopped and he draws a foul just saw a path there to accelerate Blow by everybody to the rim foul on itend doall is his first you know were going to say that all year long really that thats JJ starlings game right there get it and get to the rim and hes strong enough and he jumps well enough its really difficult to try to keep him in front of you Starling at the line looking to convert on a threepoint play he had 10 in his Syracuse debut here Monday night free throws around the rim and off this has been brutal free throw shooting for these teams four for 17 combined at the line oh for three for JJ yep yeah hes the only player to get to the line for Syracuse Orange by 11 between the circles its Fritz low right Mitchell again just keeping his feet on the ground is McLoud throw it out to staveski McLoud at 74 he doesnt need to jump so he doesnt have to bite on fakes behind the back dribbles teski flips it up leaves it short long rebound he runs it down himself the Energizer Bunny into the right corner up the right sideline for eond doll starters for both teams on the floor to begin the second half 90 seconds gone slashing in from the left is teski throw it out for Mitchell not a threat from Deep drives into the lane Bank Shot is good for Frank Mitchell first points of the half for kinus Mitchell has eight in the game Syracuse leaves 4334 thats the one time that somebody like mcclouds going to have trouble defensively if you have to come way out McLoud on the pick and roll is bumped on the catch his shot short foul called on Yuri Fritz of kesas his second second this half on the griffs it is a shooting foul for nem McLoud lets see if his Lucks any better at the line the orange uh 0 for three but all of that by JJ Starling shooting toward the student section end is it did they maybe change the distance of the line or something as people are confused the first ones off the bracket for NE does feel a little chilly in there maybe yeah doors are open or something yeah wow second free throw that Balls a soft ball in his hands he puts it up and in so a bronx cheer on the first made free throw of the game for the orange only took five attempts 4434 Point topoint passing gadston to Eon doall behind the line teski stepping back is three is short long Ricochet staveski gets it threads it inside to Fritz and he is roofed inside Jud minz elevating to knock it away probably not the best perimeter defense there for the orange but theyre able to uh block the shot and live to uh now play Baseline defense orange by 10 griffs ball left end forc it into Mitchell again on the up and under block shot McLoud Mitchell got it back shoves cross the paint to Fritz another rejection for nahem and then on the third attempt he could not quite get to gadston who lays it in gadon on the third effort scores if anybody else could get back and dig in on those rebounds McLoud whos a career high in rebounding theyre in a block shots rather is six against Louisville but uh you figure he could do that on a fairly regular basis Starling a right alley Drive is held the foul on TJ gadon of kinus his second team foul three Cloud already has what five block shots and a couple other that might not be in the stat sheet but certainly were intimidation ones one more would match his career best mid December last year against the Louisville team that really struggled a year ago he had six free throw here back rim front rim and no good for Starling 0 for four I dont recall a game where you seen two players have this level of struggle at the line Starling is 0 for four Frank Mitchell doesnt want to hear about it hes missed all six of his tries two more fouls what uh did the first one not count that wasnt a threepoint shot no so how did he gets three shots first one didnt count oh lande violation on first I dont know was that what it was okay so on his second crack in his first free throw he made it 4536 and another free throw for Starling on its way hes got kind of a double pump motion that leads to violations offensive rebound off the Miss by McLoud he throws it out to midcourt mince puts his head down on a drive misses the shot stuffed by the rim Fritz has the rebound to staveski through the middle in the lane right to the rim up with the right off the glass and in Taj staveski pushed the base hes got four points its 4538 mince with a right hand bounce to the ACC logo his pass to the wing is intercepted going the other way two on one endall to the rim finishes with the right timeout coach he is a good player by far the smallest player on the floor yep six feet tall in their exhibition game against the Toronto Metro he had 11 points and seven rebounds or seven assists rather and four steals in that game out of the back court Starling fivepoint Syracuse lead now its been as high as a 11 in this game Taylor between the circles to the near side right its cuff low right wide of the lane McLoud back to the basket works his way down flips it out for cuff on the ring sets a screen for him then slips that into the lane kick it out for Bell left side three on the shot clock pull up 15 footer no offensive rebound McLoud and there was nowhere for him to come down Mitchell was in his way foul on Mitchells is second man

in the right corner press shot clock here for the orange Starling hammers the right hand dribble one hand pass for cuff triggers a three out front line drive is short tip is around and off no for McLoud but theres another foul inside and it is on gadston of Kinesis his third so free throws here for McLoud who was fouled while attempting a tip off the rebound looks like no fouls going to be attempted must be on the inside but Ill tell you what maard is changed hes okay hes changed I thought the last one maybe shouldnt have been a shooting foul and this one should have been yeah and its

Starling foul line extended on the far side dribbles with a right into the paint fading away left to right misses the righty Runner cleaned up though by McLoud out to Bell he fakes he fires from 17 at

second half Taylor gets a A go here driving on eond doall high glass shot is good and one Taylor strong enough to force that one off the window and its in eall the foul is his third and you were talking about getting Taylor going hes up to 10 points now and should have a chance at an easy 11th at the line you know Taylors a scorer I mean you know you got to keep him involved at all times and get him shots and uh you know sometimes they forget about him a little bit when theyre penetrating and the guards are really get into the basket so line Taylor at the stripe 76 at the line last year 5142 the orange in front free throw is nothing but net for Justin Taylor so hes got a fourpoint play from Monday a threepoint play tonight its a 10point Syracuse lead just under 6 minutes gone in the

mince leans in stesy relents and minz rings the bell first points of the half for Judah and his nine points on the night are the margin 5445 Judas struggled so far here trying to get the shots that he

of it f on stesy is his second second half team foul number eight on kesas the have just W therell be plenty of free throws down the stretch if that keeps up 5748 mins looking to convert thats good you can go the whole season not have two fourpoint plays but the orange have them in backtoback games Taylor and now minz angling left on the bounces dinkin Brown went by and may have clipped him on the way and an extra step turns it over for dinkin should have put the ball up on the glass instead he travels 10point Syracuse lead theyve got the ball back with 1220 to go right Starling to walk it up dinkin picks him up at 34 Court Starling to the near side for minz into the right corner Kadir Copeland drives the Baseline as Defender Falls Copeland lost the grip got it back goes opposite for

he can all of a sudden be doing nothing and then all of a sudden taking over this game thats exactly what hes done the last two or three SL down the F on the dribble youre looking at what ccus does they put tremendous pressure on the defense they just keep flying up and just pushing it and pushing it and you better be in there I mean they can score a lot of points in a hurry and I think thats what Adrien arrey and his staff really wants to try to try to get up as many shots as they can and as quick as they can as play resumes Judah connects on the free throw to convert a threepoint play just at a sevenpoint play and in a 44 second period of game action the orange outscored Kisha 7 nothing theyve opened the lead to 13 biggest of the night 11 A2 minutes to go at the Left End of the

throw is good had 20 on Monday night a foul on Mitchell of kesas his third orange by 16 biggest lead of the game Left Hand dribble for pesi now into the middle dinkin hops on the dribble wide to the right with a shot clock at 10 streaking in the lane pesi high glass shot is altered by Brown got a piece of it Loose to the floor Taylor held donts uh touched there down inside by Kus player oo who

mince is guarded in the rear Court by seski over the timeline about to reach the quarter pole here orange leading by 16 with just more than 10 minutes to go Starling down the alley left Starling off the glass curling his way in JJ startling banks at home and a timeout taken with 101 to go by Reggie Witherspoon so well step aside the orange have open open healthcare provider of Syracuse Athletics Kish SP Left End Syracuse by 18 try dinkin to his left for cam pesi Taj daveski pretty regular player does not leave the game much calling for the ball on the perimeters its backed down by oo turns

3 minutes 12 nothing run B play back in to midcourt near side left it is pesi end the game for the first time TJ Porter Junior cows transfer long jumper stes hit two deep ones this time off the bracket and a long rebound Tracked Down by Kadir Copeland of the orange thats funny we see Adrien ay the first couple exhibition games and actually the game against New Hampshire to he did not get off the bench right yeah going to the rim reverse layup is good for Kadir copelan he has not been on the bench since hes been up the whole game year exhorting not yelling at the referees but just exhorting and his teammate and then pushing him on offense and defense and doing a great job stesy eyes the rim to the free throw line hooks the pass out left side jumper for dkin down the middle a three yeah this customary for the head coaches to be more on their feet than on their seat just as you said that Audrey uh put his butt on the seat for a millisecond and popped right back up to bark at the defense orange by 17 Copeland on the push down the right side of the lane hung in the air and got fouled oo hit him on the shoulder comes back again to like working the officials and everything its 11 to one and fouls in the second half yeah its a little bit different too but you know you look at with circus to they bring cader Copeland off of the bench and he just takes it to the basket takes it to the basket thats its a constant pressure against this defense feet huh yeah I mean its its something when youre looking at and you say boy you better you better be ready for this all the time and uh you know maybe they can get away from theyre not we know theyre not a great shooting team but if they can make enough of them so that they can come out and guard you you know youre going to get that opening on the inside C bricks the free throw and is do another can you be less reliant on the three playing that way as you say it is a ying and yang you got to make something from long range in order to force the defense to be honest yeah you do and they made three in a row and that was like making eight in a row for circus so Force the defense to come out and guard him then opens it up and theyre able to drive right to the basket C made the second of two free throws the orig for the game are six of 16 from threepoint range Kisha is about the same five of 15 between the circles dinkin off the elbow right steps back left side Porter a three twisting off the bracket no long rebound stesy the guards got it and he leans back in with the bank shot count it a dozen for him its now 6953 he has he came as advertised Ill tell you what hes tough hes quick he plays hard hes guarding UD to Min all over the court Taj seski front man there 12 points eight boards for him and three assists quick ball movement for the orange to Taylor at the dotted line throwing it out to Mintz swim move as he goes in again to the deck on a wild shot off the side of the backboard no good but the foul will send him to the line TJ Porter the personal his first team foul number 618 in the second half on Kus and mitz to the line Im surprised that you have got that call that time uh by a experienced official in Roger SS um Jud was out of control was kind of fly to the side and uh but he sells it Ill tell you he does thats foul I mean he if if thats a skill and it is I guess he is doing it at an elite level yeah free throw good for Judah back toback 20 point games to open the season for him at 20 or better Nine times a year ago flips this free throw up and its in the bottom Judah perfect at the line thats the other part of it got to be a good free throw shooter if youre going to draw that much contact and get to the line as often as he does the lead swells back to 17 7 20 to play Porter twists up a three left side of his head and its good TJ Porter 68 Jr from Atlanta first points of the Season began his cows career at Charleston Southern those are his first points as a Griff I think syracus has done a really nice job defensively here in the second half they uh foul as mince goes in just yep uncanny TJ gadston the guilty party here its his fourth 14 fouls in the second half and still seven minutes to go Judah minz to the line so we talked the other night about oh drawing 10 fouls like how big a deal is he going to do it multiple times draw 10 fouls in a game free throw front rim around and off and another one to come you know I wouldnt put anything by him I mean he knows how to draw fouls theres no question of that and uh the longer the game goes on hes not going to change his game at all hes going to play the exact same way pressure charge it to the basket and uh see what happens from there made the second free throw 22 points for him in the lane little curl in a basket for kishis 7471 cam pesi with his twopoint field goal first of the year five points for him 74 61 orange by 13 Bell looked to pass then says Ah Ill shoot it reluctantly and he
