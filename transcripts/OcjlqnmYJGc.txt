NC State in the throwback uniforms tonight the white with red State across the chest and we are underway as Ben Middlebrooks wins the tip for the wolf pack the Hawks of Maryland Eastern Shore in the road black uniforms first touch for DJ Burns spins Baseline and scores Andy stayed immediately into pressures we get to look at the starting five for the Hawks Chase Davis has emerged as a leader for this team that like most teams across the country like NC state has a lot of new pieces still trying to figure out how they all fit together here in the non conference Ellis with the bucket theyve had some really good games early on obviously coaches trying to get a feel for lineups and things like that they play with a lot of toughness really good defensively uh and as you saw in the first possession theyre just going to have to find a way to guard DJ Burns all night Applause here is DJ horn their leading score at Boston College with 21 points missing his first shot and hes coming off some season highs over at Boston College so again theyre kind of running with hot with the shooting so expect him to kind of continue that on tonight 15 to shoot for Ellis this is Tyler Mack on the left wing their leading scorer Troy hubad going to work and its going to be a fun battle to watch all night hubad against Burns itll be Hawks basketball coached by Jason kton in his Fifth Season leading them to their best season in terms of win percentage at over 58 last year 18 wins he was a finalist for the Benjo Coach of the Year award doing a tremendous job but has eight newcomers yeah I mean hes going to have his hands violation hes going to have his hands tonight obviously as you mentioned a lot of new guys coming in so again just trying to implement that and obviously theyve had a a kind of rough patch here with being on the road uh for quite some time so coming into a hostile environment at the Reynolds Coliseum so theyve got their hands full tonight for sure as you see lost their top four scores from last season coming off a loss in Greenville to East Carolina on Monday he was pleased with their defensive performance they held the Pirates to just 63 points but said they have to limit turnover against an NC State team that loves to force them middle Brooks turns it over as hes spun into pressure and the jump ball will be Hawks ball possession favoring the visitors Im not a good lip reader but it looked like coach ke just said give the big fell of the ball they ran that first play uh on the very first possession Ivers cut cross screen uh and DJ was open there but Jaden kind of didnt see him um and Coach Keats told him make sure we get him the ball just a couple minutes gone by in this matchup these two teams last played in 2018 as Ellis knocks down the jumper and thatll be an interesting action you know they get both of the bigs in the ball screen obviously DJ burns doesnt want to do the switch so itll be interesting to see if they kind of go to that as a goto to force DJ in that pick and roll action with middle Brooks middle Brooks starting his second straight game for Coach Kei Taylor was stripped it goes right to Burns in a good spot and theres his jump hook no good thats really good activity on the defensive end active hands forcing a contested shot finish with the rebound and then theyre able to get into their half court offense hes top five in NC State history in shooting percentage and thats the shot hes not going to miss very often better than 55 for his career theyre going to theyre going to live with that anytime he has two two feet in the paint uh NC States going to live with that shot all night skip pass Taylor off a one dribble and I dont know if theyll give DJ horn the assist on that one uh but thats just really good eye especially DJ drawing in the defender on his role uh and Jaden being ready to spot up for the pull up Taylor coming off an 18point performance against Boston College hupstead High off the back Applause iron upstead dealt with a lot of foul trouble in Greenville as Taylor is hot early yeah he had phenomenal second half against Boston College so obviously bringing the energy and uh bringing it here this is one of the things that he did very very well he had three straight possessions where hes able to get a deflection or a steal at Boston College four steals in total in that game to lead the wolf back Ellis needs help double team comes and theres a turnover theres that activity by Taylor with the hands able to get out transition and this is what NC State wants to do Jaden Taylor has seven of the first nine for NC State next whistle will bring us to our median Music timeout Ellis has all four for the Hawks this is Deontay Johnson theyll give upstead of Applause Music touch and another Applause Music turnover and thats what theyre known for just really good defensive tenacity each every night possession arrow going Inc States way Taylor has seven already in immediate timeout a special surprise for NC State linebacker Payton Wilson as he was informed in front of this crowd that he is the buckus award winner as the nations top linebacker it came as a surprise to him a surprise announcement but maybe no surprise he won the award he had 138 tackles this year Scott well deserved for him and just for him to be able to share that moment you know with his family there you can see the emotion on his parents face uh its going to be a night that hes always going to remember and its well deserve chanting his name as he exited the court Mo Diora throws down a dunk on his first touch of the night and again thats another good look by DJ horn obviously having the season high five assists the other night already with two early ones finding his teammates Applause pull up from Davis is good Chase Davis the junior taking on a leadership Applause Music roll thats good action just kind of getting that dho being able to get the ball in your right hand pick your spot to the elbow and just rise up and knock down a shot preseason all M horn an open Corner three and he rattles it home ly State clicking offensively early if youre just joining us Jaden Taylor had seven points before the first media Applause Timeout on six of eight shooting so the Hawks are going to have to find a way to get some stops and for some tough ones nearly a backourt violation ball was tipped 12 to shoot for hupstead and the Hawks and at the scores table Brion pass and MJ rice set to check in would be the NC State debut for Rice jump ball favoring the Hawks and rice gets a nice hand from this Applause crowd and thats kind of kind of been an anticipated you know when are you going to see him everybodys waiting when are you going to see him so its a nice gesture for the crowd to you know bring him up and and welcome him welcome to NC State sophomore guard hes from Henderson North Carol Ina spent one year at Kansas took part in summer workouts with NC State but then stepped away from the team for personal reasons hes been working his way back into shape first practice was the Monday right before Thanksgiving a former fourstar recruit his highly anticipated debut and it comes here tonight in Reynolds Coliseum yeah and I think especially with some of these lineups that youve seen given DJ some good rest played 37 minutes the other night at Boston College these are going to be some really good defensive lineups so itll be interesting to see try to get him a little bit more CU they dont want to play in those full 37 minutes so what they can do especially on the defensive end with him out Michael oconnell into the game again along with pass Dennis Parker Jr and modara active hands from deanii Claxton both of these teams very deep and thats what what they want to do just keep them active hands keep them in front of you make them take those tough shots over the top theyve gotten way too many easy ones uh to start so thats one thing the Hawks got to do a really good job of is just being long and active and making them take the tough one r with his first basket as NC State player I got a feeling hes been dreaming about that one that was a tough take waiting to be back and first first offensive possession able to get a Music bucket he made 23 appearances at Kansas last year averaged better than seven points per game and better than two points per game thats a good drop down pass by Claxton there pick and roll and able to drop it off for the big for an easy two Victory no Boya seeing his first minutes tonight de up on diara Got Deep long rebound taken by Ellis Applause Music Applause all right Scott break it down for me what do you see here he is pick and roll one of the things that hes probably not known for as much but able to use his body create the space and finish over top the defender so you see he can take it to the basket yeah thats one he was out here shooting early kind of like you used to do yeah he was getting up a lot of Threes you know and thats one of the things you know you dont get to see much about them but these kids develop so much over the summer and work on game and again he may not be known for as much as maybe pick and roll and downhill action but obviously showing that hes worked on that over the summer for Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause sure Parker was fouled almost came back down for a travel but hes fouled by Toby Music Applause mzi Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Big Show by naoya and he commenced the blocking foul time out here in Reynolds Coliseum valano Arena it is the Music week is my mind my heart and my soul you cant touch those three things its vwe at ESPN a time when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is game Chang changing research that help save lives you can join fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research diara going hard to the basket already has one dunk tonight and hell go to the line to shoot too hes coming off a career game against Boston College finished just short of a double double eight points but it was the 18 rebound thats the story yeah thats crash in the glass but thats one of the reasons why they brought him in there he just has that effort each and every night crashes not only on the defensive rebound but also on the offensive rebound and you know coach Keats has got to be proud they drop a play out of out of bounds to be able to get the slip uh unfortunately not be able to capitalize on the first free throw but the execution was was really good have to think coach Keats is liking what hes seen so far his team with a ninepoint lead shooting 70 and they forced four turnovers already how are they having so much success on the offensive end Scott well I think theyre doing a really good job early on especially sharing the ball and then obviously you know creating that Havoc which is something that they always try to do always try to get those deflections uh but sharing the ball in this end giving everybody to love and getting the best shot Applause possible CLA in the backup point guard never received that pass disrupted by Jaden Taylor and thats a little bit of that kind of 221 press that looks a little bit like manto man but uh with the the long and athletic guards that they have uh its easy for them to get a lot of deflection like I mentioned earlier they want 40 per game uh and thats why they do a lot of pressure and they emphasize it a lot in the practice these teams want to do some similar things as a 10sec violation occurs you know last year Maryland Eastern Shore led the nation in Steels and in turnovers forced and on their warmup shirts the word tenacity across the chest that is what coach Crafton wants them to play with yeah he definitely instills him with that tenacity the toughness uh but again you know like we mentioned they theyre implementing a lot of new players so hes got to kind of teach that to this so that they know the system what exactly he wants to do and Im sure after they get through this tough little stretch that they have uh theyre going to be much better off to be able to get home and and really start to implement some of that stuff more cell with a nice turn around and thats just good defense you know hes right there with him good contest sometimes you just got to tap him on the back and say good shot so again the Hawks contending with the pressure they just do break the timeline with two seconds to spare Clon fouled I believe this will be on Taylor it is on Taylor well we highlighted Casey morcel in the open hes been hot lately hes their leading score yeah and this is one of the things that hes really improved on over the summer being able bble to put the ball on the floor and be able to score multiple Music ways yeah last year playing with tquan Smith and Jarel Joiner a lot of times it was catch and shoot yeah he he just wasnt asked to do as much and thats one of the things about players is some sometimes you got to make a little sacrifice for the betterment of the team and I think thats one of the things that he did this year and with them moving on they know they need scoring so then he can kind of showcase what hes able to do several subs for Coach Crafton got Elijah Wilson out there handling the basketball hupstead back in as well leading scorer and rebounder and Deontay Johnson dribbled it off of his knee and out of Music Applause bounds again pretty good possession just got to secure the ball before finish Deon Johnson from the Bronx one of several players from New York City its coach Crafton has great ties there from the city they recruit there and also in the DMV offensive foul here they could have had a little better space in there Parker kind of drives wants to go Baseline but DJs kind of mucking it up right there at the Block so obviously good action being aggressive uh but again you see DJ right there hes trying to attack and theres just not a lot of space for it charge or not I dont know but again you just got to have a little bit better spacing I thought initially they were calling that on Parker it was on DJ Burns oh they caught it on DJ yeah at least thats what the official stats have it as I would have had to see it again cuz I was only looking at Barker yeah DJ I think was just trying to get out of the way nine to shoot Johnson off a Music screen gets his own rebound off a tip from Ellis Wilson cant Music hit get held the Pirates to 63 but struggled to score did the Hawks as morcel hits the back iron yeah and thats one of the things if they can get stops tonight and obviously make a couple shots kind of space the floor a little bit uh it can keep them in this game you mentioned theyve been away from home in the midst of a seven game Road swing they were supposed to have a home game on December 1st against Hampton that game was postponed great pass hubad feeds ell for the L in and youve seen early on they really want to kind of get to that back cut so NC States going to have to do a good job of kind of chesting up putting the arm bar and eliminating those back Cuts Ellis goes right through Di and hell be whistled to the foul all right so we knew hubad can score he can rebound but did you know hes got that in his back too hes doing a good job looking them and Y are kind of falling in love with watching the ball and able to take advantage of the back cut so Von Ellis is sophomore from Chicago Leading The Way with six points he had 12 in 24 minutes against East Carolina on Music Applause Monday Music Burns tough shot and hupstead saves it before it goes over the Music Baseline Music this is Johnson Davis has it in his hands with five to shoot hell hoist up a three and knocks it down and thats just good oneonone right there able to kind of rise up and get the shot but early in that possession they did a really good job of moving the ball uh so again anytime you can get the ball moving and get those touches youre going to get this better effort on the defensive end as well he is their top threepoint threat as morcel will not get continuation here 37 on the year for Davis which is already pretty good and then even more so when you consider that hes got the ball in his hands a lot in situations like that end of shot clock yeah I said anytime you kind of have that volume and especially when you know hes on the Scout teams are trying to take him away because they know hes a good player you know to shoot at that high a clip is really something Applause horn with a nice move steps through the lane for two and hes had a really good start this game able to get the bucket uh get a couple good looks as well as kind of getting his teammates involved so this is a really good start for Applause him the lead back up to eight and a foul called before that ball found its way to morel and believe they just signal its on Music tay it is on Taylor thats his Music second so Taylor out and MJ rice replacing Music him Music Applause Music Applause upad steps through on burns and hell shoot two when we come back from the under eight timeout NC State leading by eight here in the Heritage game David Thompson in the house for this one Liberty Mutual customize my car insurance and that statue turned out perfectly that that is the image that you think of when you think of David Thompson he wasnt the first player to ever score on an alley but he and teammates Monty Tow and Tim stod are often credited with popularizing that play because when he played from 1967 to 1977 because the Lu Cinder rule there was no dunking allowed and so when you have a 44 in vertical just throw it up and lay it in and honestly I think it have to be harder to score just trying to drop it in the basket than actually dunking so uh it just shows how good he was of a basketball player middle Brooks is fouled by Israel Applause Music yaw greatest player in ACC history threetime ACC Player of the Year and a threetime Music AllAmerican the number 44 the only number retired in NC State B basketball history this is how good David Thompson was okay he was the number one pick in the NBA and the ABA draft he decided to go to the ABA with the Denver Nuggets where he won Rookie of the Year and you know one of the things thats not on there and I Ive been lucky enough to shake his hand and kind of get to know him over the years hes just a great human being um obviously were going to talk all night about how great of a basketball player he was but he was also just a great down toe human being so he won the ABA rookie of the year right the NBA Rookie of the Year that year was Alvin Adams David Thompson was so good that Alvin Adams began his accepting speech of the NBA Rookie of the Year by thanking David Thompson for choosing the ABA because he knew he wouldnt be rookie of the year if he had been in the NBA and he didnt lie he didnt lie so uh good on him for noticing it sometimes you got to get lucky with that stuff n Smith Basketball Hall of Fame induct in 1996 of course leading NC State to the 1974 National Championship Over Marquette but it was the semifinal game against Bill Walton and UCLA and they ran college basketball at that time Bill Walton once describing David Thompson as Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant and LeBron James rolled into one yeah they took down somewhat of a dynasty and its just one of those things you know I was lucky enough to play for Monte toal and get all the stories of just how good you know that lineup and roster was and I think thats one of the things you know David Thompson all the individual success hes ever had you know he always credits his Music Applause teammates Tommy burles is here tonight along with Phil Spence Ben Mooks to shoot Music two Sunday afternoon we have a womens basketball double header on the ACC Network work du Duke hosting Florida G Coast at noon Eastern Florida GF Coast is already beaten North Carolina this year thats followed by number 18 Louisville who won four straight and Kentucky both games are also available on the ESPN half speaking of womens basketball NC State womens basketball up to number three in the AP pole they were honored at the Under 12 timeout to a standing ovation morcel with the steel and Applause finish and were going to be a broken record thats kind of what makes this team go being able to get those deflection Steals and getting those easy baskets out in transition see State struggled to score in Oxford at Old Miss in transition but was back to its old ways in the win over Boston College on Saturday to open up ACCC play one and0 no whistle as okell hits the deck weve had a lot of TI tonight this one going the way of the Hawks a lot of thats just too Scrappy teams this is both coaches have very similar identity they want to play with toughness they want to defend so its going to be one of those games that youre going to see a lot of bodies hit the floor thats the second turnover forced by Maryland Eastern Shore let see state is for seven already and looking for more here with full court Music Applause Music pressure Applause Music 10point Advantage for NC State shooting hasnt cooled off much right it was 70 early its still at 63 yeah still shooting at a high CLP but again a lot of those are kind of these turnovers right here Casey getting out getting easy layups DJ coming off pick and roll getting easy looks and defense to offense the r cleans the glass and here comes the wolf back okell with his second turnover in his many Music possessions hste with the third effort fans wanted offensive goal ending I thought it was out of the cylinder what did you see Scott uh it was really close it was hard to tell from this angle but again Casey being able to Sprint back on defense alter the shot and thats where you got to have your teammates never quit on a play even if you think theyre getting the layup Sprint back and maybe he can get that Music rebound NC State shooting one and one Music here shooting the ball well from the field but just three of six from the line so far this would be DJ horn foul on Clacks to his first teams ninth so its the double bonus after these free throws the rest the way for and and DJ was one of those that did a really good job at the Boston College game especially in the overtime being able to close it out by knocking down free throws and there it ISS seven of eight in that overtime but he misses the front end of the one and one LJ Thomas into the game for the first time for NC State as he picks up Clon across mid Court picked up the dribble in a bad spot hpad helps him Music out and a steel from di transition triple in and out for more selar another rebound and he has such great energy Off the Bench and he does a good job its one of those things I was able to play with a guy named Richard how that was able to see where the ball comes off the rim and hes really good especially on those offensive rebounds be able to see the shot be up see that its long or short and be able to kind of figure out where its going to come off that Rim Richard how what a great rebounder here at NC State and diara matching Richard how his last time out against Boston College airball for mck are with 18 boards against Boston College as horn cant hit thats the most in an ACC game for an NC State player sixyearold teammate Richard how against Duke in 2013 yeah 10 board slot 18 and I was not a very good rebounder so I was blessed to be able to play next to him so the to clean everything up for Music Applause Music Applause Music me what a move Dennis Parker Jr I think thats one of the things that he brings this team he plays a lot of the fourth position but he moves athletically like a guard and can put it on the floor Diora turns over hpad and at the under four break its NC State leading by 12 largest lead of the game we talk forever about the future back with Scottwood my name is Andrew Sanders the Heritage game tonight NC State with its largest lead now up to 12 and a big part of that is the turnover numbers yeah and you know coach kton one of the things that he talked about was 17 turnovers against ECU a knew NC State wanted to kind of create that so you know taking care of the ball but NC States doing a good job with the pressure and having active Music hands nearly a turnover fortunate deflection to diara who spins Baseline and scores he is had an incredible couple minutes here yeah and thats one of the things you know the Hawks dont have a whole lot of size down low so theyre able to be able to take advantage that whether its DJ Burns whether its mod diara so good drop step finish and thats one of the areas that they can really attack Five Points two boards and a force steel also Marcel good help defense good ball movement Clon with the three its the extra pass off of Tyler Mack and thats the type of offense you want they get the paint touched they kick it they were able to take the shot but they turned it down to make that extra to get a good Music look coach Crafton telling me that his team has shown some glimpses of who they can be this year a nice win over pen and in certain spurts like that possession right there you see their potential yeah they and they played some tough opponents so far in the year so theyre really getting a feel for what they got and its really going to test them so once they get into conference play theyve been able to prove a little bit that theyve been able to do it against some really good opponents seven to shoot for Clon and the Hawks hubad beats the shot clock Applause buzzer so two great possessions there backto back threes Thomass attempt spins out hell shoot two and Clon just being patient understanding the time on the clock uh being able to get off that pick and roll pick and pop with the big fella but you see here just having good patience being able to drag diara into that paint and open things up for the three hpad now with points to go along with four rebounds and he knocks down the three also you know his favorite movie is Star Wars Empire Strikes Back which I feel like is fitting tonight when were honoring the Music Skywalker ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tan bomb weekdays from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement at 4 Eastern theyll continue talking college football and have the latest from around the conference on the AC Network and the ESPN app and ns dats already gone 11 deep and theyre really getting into that roster so expected that pressure is going to be there all night foul on zero DJ horn thats his Music first Applause Music upstead who missed the Liberty game has Music started all seven others Applause now has made a nice jump from year one to year two on the shore one year at Penola College Off the Bench last year averaged five points per game averaging 11 and eight so far Music a nice bounce back game for him three fouls in just 10 minutes limiting him on Monday against East Carolina he gets a nice hand as he makes his way to the bench and 95 seconds to go its just a sevenpoint game the three ball and hubad getting them back into this half and its been ugly at times but I think theyve done a really good job just kind of slowing it down controlling the pressure and being able to get good shots in the half court by5 Parker its also helped cut into the score that NC State is starting to come back down to earth a little bit shooting percentage are still up near 60 we get a timeout and well take it with Music them Music Applause Maryland Eastern Shore calling timeout down nine and with 103 to go maybe a chance to go two for one here yeah I think thats one of the things theyre trying to do but ultimately get a good shot out of this timeout especially kind of giving up back to back threes Parker able to get the offensive rebound put back but they just want to get a good look here so they can kind of close that Gap to before to Applause happen this honks team played in camer indor Stadium last year against Duke so it felt like theyd be ready for this opportunity excited certainly to play against another ACC Foe on the road Deontay Johnson to hubad another triple and out and after watching I think they took the time out to get hubad back in there so they get a good offensive Applause possession Thomas connects on a three from straight on thats a good extra pass Casey didnt have his feet fully set was able to find open man at the top LJ Thomas Hawks can have the last possession of the first Applause half this is Elijah Applause Wilson Ellis St Fade Away NC State goes into the halftime locker room leading by 12 stick with us at a halftime a great video on the legendary David Thompson a little easier for the Hawks that they were just in Greenville North Carolina against ECU on Monday night so short drive over Burns well he had the first points of the first half thats all he had in the first half was that first bucket but they go right to him for the first Basket in half number two yeah thats an action that they really were able to exploit in the Boston College game just kind of setting that pin down action for the best shooter which is Casey on the court space it be able to give it to him in the middle of the pain to be able to work 17 points for Burns in 37 minutes against Boston College huad misses it off the window Davis got it and Davis doing a good job of creating those extra possessions and finish with pull Music up Taylor missed the lay in saves it a Mor cell and somehow it comes all the way across to Parker but saves out of bounds the whistle came a little late thats why I think there was some confusion thats on the opposite corner for us so we couldnt see it yeah I couldnt tell if it was the foot out of bounds ball out of bounds but uh clearly the official didnt like it Johnson lost it wol back basketball our officials tonight Clarence Armstrong Shan Hall and Jenna Renault again just those active Hands by the wolf pack even though they get beat on the initial Drive they dont give up continue to Chase and get a hand on the basketball and heres one of the most pin down plays that theyre trying to get DJ the ball hard foul by Davis as he helps up Applause Taylor thats one of the things Taylors done really well for the pack is just kind of that one guy thats always in aggressive mode especially on the offensive end being able to attack you know DJ Burns hasnt shot a lot of free throws this year but Jaden Taylor is doing a really good job of attacking here you trying theyre trying to set the cross screen so he sees everybody kind of high and goes to attack obviously DJ comes through a little bit late to kind of mess up some of the spacing but especially when theyre all high at the free throw line just able to attack off of Applause it upep blows by burs for the Bas here thats just good action they just did everything with high Pace making the big fella get moving and and attacking a close out so a good job of going hard the whole possession and creating an an Music Applause Music advantage Taylor hes been their top threepoint shooter this season got the tip from Bones and the basket theres kind of that attack mode misses the three but DJs able to get a hand on it and create it back out to Taylor uh but always attacking trying to get to the rim Taylor at just over 48 from three entering tonights Applause Music game again this would be the match up to watch hubad against Applause Burns oh Taylor lost the basketball Applause maybe a little bit too much Attack Mode on that side a nice pass there for the basket cuz Dennis Parker Jr was going up high for the block he made a good business decision to drop that Music off Burns got to his spot and hes fouled you know talking to coach Crafton I asked him about about guarding DJ Burns because hes one of the most unique players in college basketball and he said look obviously we have our our our game plan and we have to throw multiple looks at him because you cant just defend him one way throughout the whole game he said the biggest thing though you have to do your work early if you just let him get in his spot and catch deep its going to be a long night yes especially when he gets 2 feet in the paint so theyre trying to limit and push that out as far as they can get tonight at 10 Eastern after the mens basketball double header on acc Network the nothing butet crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and look ahead of the best games on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place on the ACC Network and the ESPN app oconnell before the ball was inbounded called for the foul as he was grabbing Deontay Johnson ells been quiet in this game so far no points couple of turnovers and whistled there for that Applause Music Applause foul back with a deep three and he knew it out of the hands hes been getting him up pretty quick all night so you know he has the confidence and able to get that DHL at the top and knock down a long range three so most of the recruiting done by barly Eastern Shore is hubad reaching in on burns here a lot of their guys coming from New York are coming from the DMV ma is from Michigan two years at Henry Ford Jr College thats one of those that theyre that we talked about earlier you know not letting them get deep its just so hard when hes got those two paint 2 ft right next to the semicircle upstead picking up his second foul did he want to pick up his third thir and so Burns right to work for two more and the lead back into double Applause Music Applause Music figures nice pass from Mack hubad cant lay it in Ellis cant either again that was really good action just unable to finish at The Rim Music last Touch by oon out of bounds itll be Maryland Eastern Shore basketball when we come back Tyler Mack showing off the range getting a dhoo at the top they call his number for number 44 at half timee he was honored on the court joined by Eddie FB Tony ferles Mark mher Howard picket Phil Spence that great 1974 National Championship team which will be celebrated all year for NC State as part of their anniversary and ending UCLAs sevenyear title run an incredible team yeah I mean phenomenal one of the best teams ever assembled obviously not in being able to play as freshman year um its one of those teams thats going to go down as one of arguably one of the greatest in you know college basketball history 10 seconds before oconnell Hit the Floor going for the loose ball David Thompson of course greatest player in ACC history threetime allamerican theres the team pictured after the win over Marquette but also allamericans Tommy burles the 7 fo4 Center and the 57 point guard Monte to as well Tim Stoddard who along with to helped throw those alleyoop to David Thompson he played power forward he also pitched in the big leagues and mo Rivers who just passed away last month in the back court with Monte to Phil Spence whos the Sixth Man on that team Burns basket lost the foul thats where theyre just going to have to throw bodies at the big F its going to be tough for them especially with their size uh playing him oneonone you know getting in a little bit of foul trouble now not a lot of size theyre going to have start sending some bodies trying to get the ball out of his hands we played a great video at halim on David Thompson and as they honored him on the court at the end they played a different video some messages from former teammates Monte to but also former competitors and I think you mentioned you know what a great guy he was off the court its one thing when your teammates say he was an incredible teammate but also when your opponents speak so highly of you and Elmore uh said you know you broke my heart a few times in the ACC tournaments but talked about what a great competitor he was and and Bill Walton as well he got a laugh from the crowd and he started the video by saying David Thompson you ruined my life but Im just finally getting over March of 1974 well I think thats just one of the things he earned so much respect from a competitors by how hard he played obviously how good he played so being able to see them you know on the Jumbotron talk so highly about him you know just speaks volumes about the player he Music was 10point lead for the wolf back Clon well we have a foul on Glon here is he off up the ball and then grabbed Taylor and then probably ended up being a good foul cuz if Taylor would have been able to grab it he was all for the races I think its its great that this Heritage game is being played between NC State and Maryland Eastern Shore because the Hawks also have some great history relating to 1974 as horn pours in a three thats just phenomenal vision by DJ Burns catching it in the middle of the Zone swinging it Opposite and Horn having the feet down and ready so the Hawks have never played in the NCAA tournament but in 1974 they became the first ever HBCU to receive an invite to the NIT remember this was back in the NCAA tournament when they only took 25 teams thats why lynore was saying David Thompson you broke my heart because you had to win the ACC tournament to go to the NCAA tournament and you know Bill Walton first pick Tommy burles in 74 but Ruben Collins and T Skinner and William Gordon all played for Maryland Eastern Shore and they won a game in that nit they were still a member of the niia so they actually got fined for take accepting the invite to that tournament but they were a absolute Powerhouse averaging 93 points per game that year and keep in mind that was before the invention of the threepoint line Scott i take the as well uh thats Elite level scoring I dont know if any of my teams even with the threepoint line and some of the offensive power power we had even average that many points so it just shows of kind of the the offensive ability but going back to those logos Elite logos those old school logos look phenomenal its an elite finish by DJ horn in transition but Seattle Super Sonics yeah they I think theyre deserving of an NBA team they had a lot of fun they always filled out that crowd back with the Ray Allen Group a really good crew NC State Defense to offense and the lead and here you go this is one of the things they were able to kind of get back in it obviously sitting there Claxton being able to knock down a shot Clon getting the paint touch the hubad if theyre going to be able to kind of get back in this thing this is one of the things theyre going to have to do is knock down some threes and really put the pressure on ins date to push out that pressure and really create some Havoc Maryland Eastern Shore five for 13 from Beyond The Arc so far Applause tonight like you said thats kind of kept them in this game when theyve been able to get shots right you dont get a shot when you turn the ball over and that has been an issue with 10 so far yeah Ma made one down on this end and they cut the deficit to 10 there but then they kind of gave up that turnover and then they gave up that they kind of went zone for possession and DJ horn made a really good pass for a Applause three I think we have a push on MJ rice before yes that is the call here so no block charge obviously oconnell was trying to take a charge but they call Rice being on the hip of Israel yaw before the contact yeah he got him a little bit down low maybe tripped him and got him off balance to start uh but it looked like he was trying to go to Euro Step and just kind of tripped them up a little bit so ya to the free throw line the sophomore from Guyana one year at ASA Brooklyn College before Music Applause transferring missing both free Applause Music Applause throws Taylor in rhythm in and out I think DJ horn honestly had the first shot where he got that dribble handoff action pin down dribble handoff uh but chose to pass it up youre not passing that one up probably not but I I could see why he he he gave it but I would also say that that was a designed play for him out of the timeout so I would shoot it and another foul on rice here as he fouls the three point shooter thats Elijah Wilson it takes a little while to kind of get your feet under you right remember hes making his NC State debut tonight yeah you just got to give him a little bit of space thats one of the things that they the referees before every season they come and talk to you and they preach all right listen give them room to land and he was a little bit more aggressive on that close out Sunday afternoon womens basketball a double header on the ACC Network Carol Lawson and her Duke Blue Devils hosting Florida Gulf Coast at noon Eastern then Jeff walls in 18th rank Louisville theyve won four straight going up against Kyra El and Kentucky both games are also available on the ESPN Applause app we talk about the threepoint shooting Mike could get the Hawks back in this game oh and Di is going to be called for a foul here and he had no idea that Wilson was coming around I dont see how he could be called for a foul here St yeah Id have to see it again but it looked like he may have had his elbow out just a little bit which is maybe more of a untraditional position uh but Im always for good effort I like good effort so we well let it slide upad deep position blocked by the bo are crash in the glass Applause hard and thats just an effort basket and thats how theyre going to get back in this game just playing hard the tenacity that we spoke on the toughness you know they got it to 11 they missed a few free throws would probably have it back in a single digits but again theyre kind of bringing that intensity and putting the pressure back on NC State I think he got away with a little bit of a Applause walk MJ rice with the an one Music opportunity the lead back to 13 Michael O Connell doing a good job of putting the ball on the floor maybe got away with a walk but MJ rice cutting behind the defender and finishing Music strong 10 offensive rebounds in the game and this is how you got to do it do some of the Dirty Work upstead in there just battling continuing to keep it on the glass and ultimately finishing with the bucket thats the type plays that theyre going to need to really get back in this thing their team motto is one way and I I asked coach Crafton in your own words what what does one way mean and he said you know it its really two things its two words tenacity like we talked about on the front of their warmups uh tenacity which is our Edge we have to play with that edge we have to play Scrappy the other word is family thats our togetherness on and off the court and I think theyre showing that tenacity here tonight with the 10 offensive rebounds whether its the three or getting to the free throw line weve seen them do more in the last couple of minutes hitting the offensive glass thats how they can get back in this yeah and I think you know we havent really been able to show them on camera at a timeout but if you watch them on timeout usually a lot of people are kind of walking around looking in the stands they literally have their hands on each others back the whole time locked in and engaged to what coach Crafton is saying and again here is that speed and tenacity they dont score on the initial turnover on the fast break but again hubad Sprint in the floor and being able to put it back in just an 11point game with an 11 and a half to play here in the second half upstead hard show Parker Juniors Music open and NC State gets an offensive reset all the way in the back court goes Taylor for Music it Music and those are the ones who just they trying to get back in it just got to find a way to not give up two offensive POS offensive rebounds in The Possession and give yourself a Applause chance big basket for burns there like you say three per times the charm on that possession for the wolf pack Davis to the Baseline upstead wow well he only had three threes on the year coming in hes got two in this game nobody stops Jaden Taylor Jay hes always in attack mode always looking to get downhill always looking to get to the free throw line and thats just one of the things with them just always in that in that go mode even on the defensive Applause end and Taylor got out to the hot start tonight for NC State gotten off to a hot start on the season hes only behind we say Casey Morel is the leading score hes averaging 141 Taylors at 14 even so hes right there in the mix and hes maybe been their best defender so far and on a team that is well balanced he might be their overall best player yeah and thats one of the things that weve always talked about is they just have all that balance and I think since the second game you know J Taylor has been the primary ball uh Defender and again just kind of creating that Havoc LJ doing a good job of being patient getting into the body and finishing well hes athletic and tremendous body control there to stay on balance Ellis goes right at Burns and gets the roll and the pace is picked up here in the last couple minutes Scott yeah I just had my stats just the wind from them running up and down the court just blew blew right back into my lap that sounds like hyperbole hes not joking we felt that game speed Marcel bobbled it and was pushed again thats where you see you know a lot of people dont talk about it but DJ Burns is just a phenomenal passer theres not many bigs in the country that can throw that back Music door one and one for KC morel Music scenario tonight where NC state has struggled from the line just seven of Music 16 ACC PM with Mark paner and Taylor tan balb weekday from Mark Charlotte studio in his basement at 4 Eastern theyll continue talking college football and have the latest from around the conference on the ACC Network and the ESPN app got to love it from Marks studio in his basement cuz hes got the dogs there I I would set I would love to have my dogs on set the problem is my kids would be all over the place talking college football again Payton Wilson being honored in the first half and learning that he won the buckus award as the nations top linebacker he and several of his teammates a nine win season Under head coach Dave Doran and heading to the PopTarts Bowl in Orlando to take on Kansas State thatll be one watch Ellis doesnt get the roll this time and then gets called for a push in the back and this is going to be free throws again it almost looked like Ellis was anticipating contact and Casey kind of just backed off of him and let him have the easy one and threw him off a little Music bit and we talked about free throws earlier you know NC State not having the best free throw game but for the season theyve been pretty solid all year long at the free throw Applause Music line that foul to second on Ellis 19 fouls for the Hawks theyve been pretty well balanced Claxton and Claxton and hubad both have three a number of players with two for NC State Taylors playing with three Burns and rice the only players with two and NC State Morel makes both of the one and one theyre in the double bonus the rest of the way and again thats how they closed out their ACC victory in Chestnut Hill against Boston College they very well might be tested from the line remaining 9 Minutes of this game but the lead is getting stretched out 6448 really good screen screen Applause Davis how good is Jaden Taylor in the open floor hes just so strong and physical hes able and he kind of slow his body down he takes that left step Euro steps back across but hes just such a physical aggressive guard here he just sends him to the left steps back across and finishes on the other side of the basket through contact saw Johnson slapping at the ball there his first Music foul Axton nice find Ellis with a flush I was about to say he picked a really bad spot to pick up his dribble but again Ellis made himself available and they made a really good pass finished with the dunp Devon Ellis he plays basketball righthanded hes primarily lefthanded in everything else in like that time he used both hands for the twohanded Music jam thats one of the things about theen date team especially outside of DJ Burns theyre looking to switch and they do a really good job of switching aggressive and making this offense start really far Applause out that was a threepoint takedown in wrestling LJ Thomas with the steel will head to the under eight time out the wolf back up 16 one way to avoid expensive car repair Music bills 6650 andc State out in front of Maryland Eastern Shore during that media timeout LJ Thomas with the steel they did review this foul it is the fourth foul on Deonte Claxton but upon review rulle is just a common foul and he is going to stay out there with the four fouls a little bit of sweep of the leg But ultimately trying to go for the ball and sure nothing bad there so again dont show sportsmanship there to LJ Thomas uh NC State in the bonus the double bonus Applause now LJ Thomas has seen his minutes increase as this season has gone along making his fifth appearance of the year didnt score against Boston College but played six minutes and really came in in that Las Vegas trip yeah hes just a really good decision maker for this team hes not going to make a lot of mistakes he understands his role hes going to get some of those pain touches and create for others but ultimately just a good decision making point guard for him Thomas now with seven points he is really putting on the in the work on the defensive end he got a deflection there and hes fouled as he picks up yet another steel and again thats just the effort of LJ the whole time dogging him on defense on this end and then able to get a hand on the ball uh and again sacrifices his body to dive and and draws another foul thats the kind of play thats going to you see why his minutes are increasing yeah I mean thats thats any kid out there thats watching is listen if you give effort whether its 2 minutes 4 minutes 6 minutes make the most of your minutes you know make make the coach see that you bring value in the minutes that youre on the court and its one of the things that LJ has continued to do and Coach Keats is rewarding them for it two minutes becomes five becomes 10 Its a Grind its its not easy its hard to get minutes out out here on the court especially with you know what type of talent is out there at all times so you got to make yourself stick out and a lot of ways to do it is diving on the court and doing a little bit of the Dirty Work that some people dont want to do thats supposed to be the fifth foul on Claxton thats what they have the official stats as but Clon staying on the floor and I thought they called it on hubs dead Music Applause maybe see if maybe Applause they reverse wont go but a foul is called and well theyre changing they must have changed that Music Applause foul Applause Music yeah they are in the process of changing and I think it might go to hubad instead if so thats his Applause fourth it is on HUB so now four on Claxton and four on the leading score and rebound or Applause Music hon Ellis one of the seven transfers on this team from State Fair Junior College Ellis comes out Israel yaw will check in havent seen then Middlebrooks in a while have the start tonight but just 6 minutes so far Again Taylor catching shoot hes nearly at 50 yeah now DJ Horns going to get the assist on that one but you got to give at least half and some of the credit over to DJ Burns for setting a really good screen upstead to the basket for two more playing with those four fouls and playing well hes got 18 as does Taylor Taylor calling for it horn doesnt look his way theyre going to get a touch to DJ Birds instead yeah Burns had CLA them on him for a little while and they kind of missed it but it all works out for the pack you talked about that aspect of his game hes unselfish and he finds more cell latest 21 they get the Applause Music switch surprised they didnt try to Poe upstead with more cell on it yeah ball screen and switch back try to take advantage of the mismatch cuz middle Brooks and and Marcel are just sitting there switching everything so find the mismatch and and attack andc stle attack and Applause transition at the same spot that he hit a huge three with 230 left in overtime against Boston College yeah and you got to give credit credit to LJ Thomas I feel like kind of his effort and what he bring during his his minutes was able to create create some energy for this team Davis with his smile and more so couldnt help but Smile as well as he banged out one in they all count the same man they all count the same you play golf too right no pictures on the score card that is for sure they still counted as one two and Applause three and hubad with four Burns pretty on the Baseline the spin and the shot Applause youre so worried about taking away his left hand and he spins back Baseline I dont know how you defend that just hard to guard and honestly thats theyre going to go back and watch it on Game film and thats going to be what they want to do you know force him that way force him take some jump shots but again hes just such an elite score see State now up to 80 just under 5 minutes to play diara set to check back in both teams utilizing their depth mle Brooks would have been his first three of the Year Burns has the touch on the Music Applause Music Applause tip Music Applause Taylors got Music 21 DJ Burns was already pass half court cuz he knew that one was good wol pack starting to make this thing a little bit ugly now Davis Banks it in and they love playing at this pace its a 454 Point second half for NC State as we hit the final media timeout greatness is a feeling making threes made a pull up in the first half then hes able to kind of get out and transition so hes been able to do it at all three levels of the game hes also added four rebounds two assists and two steals so hes mixing it up not only just scoring the ball 21 on the knights he is not out there right now dont know if well see him again with NC State leading 8561 Bon pass and MJ rice and join the back court rice at three ball he was working on that shot hours before this game and he makes his first career three at NC State he was making it a high clip and he was ready check back in knock it down rice with seven points now in in his Applause Music Applause debut Wilson cant answer diar is running the Music floor and a reaching foul on Wilson therell be two free throws for Dior MJ rice coming off the pick and roll gets a switch but they dont switch aggressive able to knock it Music down so deard to shoot two seven points five rebounds tonight he had eight points and again the 18 rebounds at Boston College the most for NC State in an ACC game since Richard how against Duke back when you played Scott yeah I I I might have made a lot of Threes during my time but Richard said a lot of really good screens for me so uh hes just one of those guys that battled very similar to how di is sticks his nose in there and finishes with a lot of rebounds Dior gets a nice hand coming out as does Ernest Ross getting a hand coming Music in Alice tough fade away a little short and and lost with the Music rebound good box out rice cant get the stick back second effort he gets it and he can just tell he strong even on the first one that he missed he kind of cleared two guys out just by lifting up his arm so uh thats one of the things that hes just going to add you youve seen him make a three youve seen him get all the way to the rim and hes also going to be down there battling for some offensive rebounds again Maryland Eastern Shore held ECU to 63 points on Monday night mle Brook with a huge rejection NC state has scored 54 points in this half by the way we mentioned that game against Duke weve got some video from that game Scott yeah again Richard how setting in a really good screen and um there were some words said that if my kids are watching tonight were not going to say them live on air so Ill keep those to myself but it was a double technical the technical double technical I want to be very clear Thon got one as well so it was kind of a wash I mean its cool you made the shot but looked to me like and this is my first time seeing that footage probably since that game but looked to me like you kicked out the legs there I did I kicked my legs out a lot you know I was one of those guys that tried to draw the foul and especially when youre shooting 90 from the free throw line you got to try to get there cuz Im not driving in the paint and getting the easy ones I got to draw them when Im shooting Music threes but thats one of the good memories being able to beat Duke be able to enjoy it with your teammates but uh yeah I uh I definitely uh kicked the legs and me and Thorton went out we like the whole story is we went at it for a while for three or four possessions and then finally I got an opportunity to make one and just so happen to be on him so I gave him a a piece of my mind Im just glad people cant lip read anymore glad we were able to go back in the in the vault and find some footage from that game thats way back back when I had a had no beard the baby face Music Applause Scott Im sure Richard how would approve yeah you know he kind of said it with a a beautiful manicured beard for every game uh he called it beard gang back then and I was never able to join the beard game uh so a few years later when I was able to get a little bit of peach fuzz on my beard uh I was able to properly join uh his beard game so it was a great honor to be able to do that line to Applause Music Applause shoot Ma has that range hes shown it not this time rice on the push oh MJ rice oh my goodness welcome back MJ rice thats how you make a first impression MJ just being the athlete that he is you know last year at Kansas they talked about it wasnt able to really showcase and transfer back home to NC State and Sh that he can get up and Rise High woo that got the fans on their feet yeah and you know thats got to feel good for a kid you know someone that steps away from the game the game that they love and its its what theyve played and be able to come out here and just showcase your skills and perform so you know hes feeling really good again this is the first time NC State fans are seeing him now Ernest Ross Glides to the bucket Applause were starting to see a little bit of athleticism on both sides P Brooks with the foul itll be two shots kichi oo his first minutes of the night and hell shoot two from the Bronx he hasnt played in Reynolds before but hes actually played NC State before hes an Austin he transfer he scored three points and had three rebounds against ncu State last year in the opener the fans here want a free chicken sandwich they get away he misses the second and he does Devin gats says no shots Jordy still will dribble it out well they tried to yeah and I think Maryland Eastern Shores just theyve had a tough little stretch here being on the road obviously early on theyve had Temple theyve had Notre Dame Liberty theyve had ECU theyve had a tough schedule so kind of able to diagnose some things and and get back there in the lab when they get home and and enjoy their bent for sure 9361 the final score NC State improves to 6 and2 and
