has benefited from more touches Earl Grant told us and increased offensive production one of the best offensive players in the league in the last eight games but hell be up against it tonight and the man is jumping against his PJ Hall thats a matchup to watch as the ball be thrown in the air by Lee Cassell and we are underway with Clemson and their basketball thats such a big matchup with PJ Hall and Quentin post Clemsons offense has been operating fluidly all year Tyson the air ball theyll hear it from this small throng thats a rarity not once in your career did you airball it ah a couple of times you only get concerned when you air ball a two in a row after the air balls the next one will worry right now you shoot the first win and get it out your system PC starting lineup with Makai Ashton Lankford in there he has the ball as it goes out of bounds and Ashton Lankford is clearly The Man Behind their engine yeah I mean the issue with BC right now is looking for that third score you know Ashton Langford is scoring on the perimeter Quentin posted scoring in the permanent inside theyre looking for a third guy to help those two guys out and theyre gonna need that they want to continue to the best basketball that theyre playing right now winners two of their last three Clemson averaging 75 points per game theyre shooting 47 percent as Tyson takes the Deep three and Nails it so so much for the air ball Hunter Tyson showing why he is such a threat you know what you gotta shoot the next one right thats thats what they taught you not me I was firmly on the bench that just shows you the confidence he has you take it just shoot an air ball and you come right behind and take the next one Zachary rims out Tyson has the rebound what does BC need to do to be effective offensive ball again take their shots they cant get they cant get frustrated you got to milk the shot clock a little bit control the pace of this game and you get the rhythm of the game and see whos making shots you got to get the ball in closed hands On Cue misses a shot I jinxed him well he didnt miss much against Virginia on Saturday Chase Hunter is called for the offensive foul by Brian OConnell as part of this officiating crew with Lee Cassell and Clarence Armstrong great job moving his feet Makai Lynx was one of the better onball Defenders there sticks his chest on Chase Hunter great call draws the foul Chase hunter gets an early sub you dont want him getting in foul trouble hes just getting back from an injury its not quite yet tip top shape so you want to get him out let him catch his breath slow things down get him back out there so you like that decision early I do because hes a Difference Maker for this team you know having him out there hes a guy that can go get your basket when needed late in the game and again hes working his way back into shape 26 points for Hunter against Florida State and theres Thriller on Saturday afternoon As the ball goes out of bounds coach Brad bronnell 13th season Clemson South Carolina hes piled up the victories with 236 403 in his career stability hes brought that stability and consistency to the program hes one of the best coaches in the country and hes definitely one of the best in the ACC and and I every program in the league knows when they play against the Clemson Tiger or Brad Romel coach team just so much respect for him and so super excited for him to be 101 this year leading the ACC one of the biggest surprises by far PJ all moments ago with the bucket heres a fade away by post PC remains cold Prince aligbe The Freshman from Minneapolis nice move and cannot complete the basket but still maneuvering well in the post and Brownells counterpowers Earl Grant his second year at BC they used to work together Earl Grant four years as a Clemson assistant speaking with Brad bronnell earlier he said this is a tough game for him because he doesnt like to go against his old assistant coaches he feels like if he beats them it still doesnt feel great no when you got so much mutual respect for one another you just you cheering for each other until you got to compete against one another and someone has to win it League Bay at the line first point of the game for BC the foul was on Josh Beadle theyve racked a point guard in the game for Chase Hunter Prince the league Bay you know how difficult it is as a freshman to develop your offense on both ends of the floor and hes still searching a bit well you expect that but the great thing you want to see early on here is he gets his first basketball going to the offensive glass getting that and then making a strong move inside hes not built like a typical freshman you dont have freshman walking on campus built like that young man fourstar recruit for Earl Grant and his staff DC at the line 72 percent theyve been better lately Hunter Tyson to Dylan Hunter skips one to beatle Music this Clemson Tiger team its so difficult to prepare for because they run so many different sets and it forces you to really focus on your principles defensively because you just have no idea what theyre going to run and good defense by BC stolen by McLaughlin heres Ashton Lankford and hell hold was there a difficult team to prepare for because Clemson can be delivered but because they also speed you up right defensively theyre one of the better defensive teams in the league you know theyre physical theyre tough theyre going to guard you but on the opposite end they run so many more to multifaceted sets and attack you in so many different ways and different levels and its just difficult to prepare for they run so many plays I was joking with Earl Grant early and he said Burnell probably put in three or four new plays to throw throw the Scout report out of the window and stick to our principles TJ Hall straight up with a three and the rebound Corral by Elite both teams grinder on offense in the early going in an offensive foul is called by Brian OConnell these are two better of the better defensive teams in the league I mean Boston College that cant score it as well thats Clemson Tigers but theyre one of the better defensive teams and again this is where Earl Grant gets it from the two physical tough teams and this game will be an oldfashioned just throwback of who rebounds the basketball and who that turn it over and they will review just see if it was a foul is on quit post what do you think I dont know about that one I think it is high but I dont think its anything to it if they call the foul thats okay but its not a no flagrant or anything that nature nothing in Temple just trying to swim move and get in front and got a little high Applause and if youre BC you dont want to get those type of fouls if you get fouls on your big guy on your best player you want them to earn it a game like this playing against the number one team in the ACC you dont want to pick up those type of fouls now Alex Hemingway has checked in the ball game for the Tigers hes a good part of their backcourt gives them another option as 10 games hunter Tyson he hits the three his second three of the night Tyson has advertised such a difficult guard for anybody hes just a constant bucket at his height hes just 68 hes just elevating the shooting over guys you got to beat her on the catch if not you know for some of these smaller Defenders it just doesnt see you when he releases it you see oh for five from the field kayash de Lankford trying to knife through but its batted away Hemingway Scoops it up Hemingway senior from Newburgh Indiana played in 12 games started 12 and a foul thats on Devin McLaughlin is first and we will take our first time out Eagles cold not so much for Clemson with the early leads Boulevard for conference wins in a season theres at 10 now and how about that Randolph childrens seven wins when trailing at halftime and terrific month of January tells you tells you their intestinal fortitude is strong leadership you know what it is its a player land program you got great coaching but when you got leaders like Hunter Tyson and you got really good players the preseason second team in PJ hall and then you got a garden when things break down and Chase Hunter you can give him the ball too and make plays they have the ingredients to be the team to win the ACC and I think right now I dont think anyone can argue with their resume how about were at the end of January and theyre gonna have their 11th Victory they had 11 2018 and you remember back in 1952 in the Southern Conference when they had 11 wins I was around back then maybe all right you can Enlighten us later but I like their chances of breaking that record I do Im pushing my chips in Im pushing all my chips to the table no way by shuffling to give ten to two leads seven of the 10 points have come off BC turnovers the concerning part is for BC early is even guys like shuffling he comes in and usually the ball mover so for him to come in and get going offensively they have enough scoring where does BC go now and thats a good start right there getting to the pullup jump shot by Michael the astral language production better along with post and Zachary theyve averaged to combined 45 points over the last five games thats 65 percent of the BC scoring during that span large part of that from Quint post and a foul called on Mason Matson off the BC bench Makai coming off the pin down just curling getting into his range midrange shot there thats within his wheelhouse hes not a great threepoint shooter but the midrange shots at his size and athleticism was a must he has to get into the paint tonight to score but and create for others his other teammates but knocked on him has always been he cant shoot oh its not his strength he can take and make open shots but his ability and his athletic system to get in the paint and again hes going to have to score tonight and make the job easier for some of his teammates as well the pretty move lefthander Josh Beadle is getting more and more confidence coming up Brad Brownells bench hes giving these guys confidence when you defend hes giving him more freedom on the offensive end its just a great drive and now theyre getting scoring out of guys if he usually dont get a lot of scoring out of and like I said you focus on those main guys and now theyre having the road players that are beating you and again this is why theyre leading the ACC Zachary to the Baseline awkward shot but effective hes a big lead guard hes 210 215 pounds so scoring in the post so this team has to get other guys involved and we talked about it that third lead score behind posting behind Lakes for this gotta be sack Heming away Off the Mark and the rebound engulfed by TJ Bickerstaff has been a conundrum for the BC coaching staff this year and thats punched away another turnover for the Eagles yeah coughed up by Hemingway Ashton Langford foul line jumper thats an empty possession that they love to have back right the slow start shooting basketball but they got to continue to defend theyre only down six points this is the end of the floor they got to continue to stay in it in shefflin to Hall with a hook is that a good idea I think its a great idea whenever you can get the ball in the PJ all his hands and post did a good job pushing him off the spot not letting them get it close to the basket Clinton post the up fake and easy pickings for the seven footer just a great move there I mean hes just so skilled hes putting it down on the floor you know on the floor and you have to honor him on a perimeter and he puts it down takes advantage up and gets a shovel pump fake against the angle great job after the media timeout the Eagles have increased their offensive production but all Nails Nails the three PJ Hall similar to Hunter Tyson has that type of ring right he loves and he went right back at post hey youre gonna score on me Im gonna come right back and screw on you big men tend to play the game against each other they dont care what the The Score says if you score with me Im gonna go back at you thats what you saw there but guards dont do that I did it but I bet you might have done it a few times she just wants it twice beetle down the lane but an offensive foul so both teams a little bit off kilter but Josh beetle is giving Clemson some nice push off the bench he has hes just got the offensive foul there but this time turns the corner pulls up for the nice Runner there but the 20th right tigers with a seven point lead at BC PJ Hall he had a 1710 game in Florida State Saturday and like Hunter Tyson hes been a walking bucket PJ Halls been outstanding I mean early in the year I mean hes playing great basketball now and I think hes the key to this team because hes allowed coach Burnell to coach him hard Drive by The Freshman Guard from Houston Chas Kellys Off the Mark as he is inserted into the ball game for the first time Quentin post is on the BC bench and there was some frustrations during the last time out over at the BC huddle yeah I mean these guys are frustrated the ball didnt go on in but theres no reason for those guys to panic they got to continue to fight defeat and they will on this end of the floor they just have to get something going on the offensive end Chase Hunter hits the Baseline shot off their bench after he picked up one foul 90 seconds into the ball game also Ben Middlebrooks is in the ball game wearing number 10 for Clemson liberally substituting yeah Clemson just gets to come at you with so many different ways they go at you early on it was Hunter Tyson and his PJ Hall and now Chase hunter gets going and those are the offensive guys that gets it going they just continually coming at you and they solidify their rotation its just gonna be a tough team to play against and I do believe this isnt a fluke they are so far the best team in the ACC we feel like theyre disrespected and bradell shared that sentiment I do I I think the net rankings and everything no one really gives this team the amount of respect but when you play against him in the eye test they have been the most consistent team that Ive seen in the ACC this year and I dont really think its been close I dont think theres any question about that Applause Music Chase Hunter to RJ Godfrey into the pose for Middlebrooks banging with Devin McLaughlin and Matson has the rebounds okay this is the end of the floor for BC Eagles where do you go with Talent thats on the floor now where do you go for offense I think thats the question that they have to ask us right now plantar bottom Perimeter at some point someone has to get the ball in the paint the opposed up or dribble penetration Kelly takes the three do you like that idea or no well again okay we talked about getting paint touches and this is a freshman coming in hes been working really hard and I think you should see Earl Grant rewarding his young guy with playing time but thats the difference in the game you got a another guard coming in at Chase Hunter he gets in the paint and he draws fouls uh Zachary and heres our Wednesday college basketball doubleheader on HCC Network and the ESPN app Blake kinson and Pitt theyre in Chapel Hill to take out our Armando Bay cut Caleb love in North Carolina at seven Eastern and its down the road to Raleigh for quavion Smith jarkel Joyner NC State hosting Matthew Cleveland and Florida State dont miss it on accn its going to be so much movement in the ACC in every conference for the month of February right now but those are some great matchups and every game seems to have so much pressure on you to try to get it done right I always thought January was moving monthly college basketball people are saying its February its absolutely February because you youve either dug yourself in a hole and youre trying to fight out of it or youre just trying to sustain what you already had Clemson largest lead of the game on a seven to nothing run Applause post back in the ball game skips it to Mason Matson and he Nails the three great job by post getting the ball inside it again it doesnt have to be in dribble penetration but a nice post touch there he swings and skips it over three so again play inside out for a team that struggles to shoot the basketball shots come a lot easier when you get the ball to the paint like that or post touch thats in the Cincinnati transfer 27 from Beyond The Arc thats his 24th three of the season Middlebrooks Maneuvers but he ran under the wall otherwise known as quick post great post defense thereby Applause name post its just too easy yeah Applause but whats good for this team and why post is so important is that they need him to score but he also has to initiate offense and someone else has got to help him yeah they ran into a triple team three too strong and Clarence Armstrong says its a foul on BC again this isnt a play they just theyre not playing outside they get the ball in the post forces helped to come and just skip skips it over for Madisons wide open three he may shoot 27 but when you get open looks like that the percentages go up capable of shooting the basketball at a lot higher clip than that and again if he gets open looks like that from close I expect him to knock him down he also has two fouls that was his foul seconds ago Hunter and Chaz Kelly with a rebound Clemson three for eight from distance and sometimes you see Boston College because the inability to score like that they got to post guards and they play inverted meaning post on the perimeter like that and you post a guard because of post ability to knock down threes and Zachary again is a big lead guard gets inside and scores his second Basket in the post and hes only shooting 39 percent as production is down from last year when he was a major focal point from them especially from the outside he led them in threepoint shooting but his hardworking and his creativity on the floor thats been much better defensive effort here great defense Bob BC there you drive but Off the Mark Elite Bay walled them off here come the Eagles thought about a 25footer logo post I thought hes going to pull it yikes scoring throughout of more than two minutes for Clemson believe they in the post gets doubled Zachary the three hes got another high percentage shot to get the ball in the post Forces help kicks it out again second threepoint shot hes kicked out to a teammate and again great things happen when you put the ball in Quinns close Hands and eights enough they run around for BC and they started on this end of the floor theyre defending right now keeping the ball in front Tyson oh man hell stop that tide no he just tells him hes just too small keep the noise down Im the ACC player of the year right now just give me the ball and get out of the way such a tough guard eight points for Tyson post swings it to Madison Applause you can live with that again another drive another creative opportunity there by posting for a three quick trigger for you yeah its a little quick you know those are the reasons why to run when guys thats another part of this team but they got to develop they shot quick shots couple turnovers and BC gets back in the game hunter Tyson just scores in the post again and then you take a quick shot you want to run your offense and continue to execute posts with a three I think thats a fatigue shot there hes been playing NonStop and the balls been going through his hand and you got to watch it figs tend to foul when they get tired first by PJ all and here comes Mason Matson had numbers now he slows it a little bit a league Bay trailing good pass to post beautiful no look great on selfish basketball by The Freshman there wasnt a big man for all this hes been setting up guys a way to get the big man easy when theyre all penetration Clemson has only made one of their last eight shots a 102 PC run and quick post bringing BC Tigers back into this game here I mean PC Eagles out there getting to a spot elevating over telling the crowd calm down I got this guys he snapped the 80 run from BC and then Quinn post just been outstanding just finding his teammates there hes got two assistant both to play the threepoint shots to six points which is vital right now for BC so hes scoring and hes also assistant so we got to get someone else to help him initiate an offense for for the Eagles and he had to use the mass first half against Louisville and he hasnt let go of it since that point I think he likes it I think he looks like a Marvel character well when youre playing as good as hes playing right now and wait hes played the last few games I think I keep it on I wonder if hes superstitious or not yeah could be Ill tell you what he has done and hes defended PJ Hall exceptionally well his size and physicality has bothered DJ all in the post and theres good reason there a shot clock violation a turnover so you think theyre flustering for himself he is just look at his defense in the post here I mean this is a preseason allsecond team post guy there and he hasnt had much success there in the post and I know Elite came in and got a deflection on it and the post has been offstanding on both ends of the floor lets see if he can sustain it whats the counter for Brad bronnell he has multiple weapons I think on the offensive thing they just got to continue to defend and they will defend but getting the player of the year right now the ball put the ball in Hunter Tysons hands on the offensive end he and Chase on him thats in the past to post who gets tripled now to Elite Bay a double yeah thats a shot he needs to hit yeah with a freshman there the rotation came down itd be better for him if he was to swung it out on the perimeter and found a teammate shuffling has trouble handling it and a species ball heres our Thursday night womens basketball doubleheader as Celeste Taylor leads the balanced attack of the 16th ranked Blue Devils when they host bit at six Eastern then Diamond Johnson at number 15 NC State take on Georgia Tech should be another terrific night for womens Hoops on accn and the ESPN app turnovers piling up for both teams great pass to Zachary another nice smoke a quick post big man is showing everything hes defending hes creating and hes scoring hes hes accepted the challenge tonight you can tell the matchup with PJ Hall hes been challenged and hes answering that challenge right now Randolph Childress at Wake Forest hes probably passed a little bit better than I did I know my teammates would agree with these but you never met a shot you didnt like right but when you My Philosophy is you walk in the gym youre open if you can see the rim youre open youre shooting oh its good there is a what a block by Makai Ashton Lankford UC definitely has cranked up its intensity on both ends of the floor and riding a 122 run I asked to Lankford trying to break some ankles and he hits the shot instead first lead of the game for BC lets get into his spots again we talked about it there was two guys posting Langford are the guys offensively to get it going again hes getting to that midrange shot shes not a great threepoint shooter but hes a really good midrange jump shooter Jason Paul and the post the hook is a pretty one nice answer great job just like I said a really good player difficult shot he makes difficult shots post I thought did a really good job pushing him off the lane just extending them a little bit but again posters outstanding player and TJ Hall is hes up for the challenge as well Bastion from the elbow and Hunter Tyson with the board but you have liked the more deliberate possession you want to have it where you want the ball to touch post hands a little bit again but I think hes tired as well you can see him here but hes been so effective on both ends you cant take him out of the game hes turnover with a high for Clemson Madison trying to back in on Hemingway just returning from an injury plantar fasciitis for Hemingway Mr Langford in the lane post and he connects oh hes industrious you dont want to give a team of the perimeter Ill go get it off the glass and create and finish he is doing it all for the BCE and a timeout for Brad Brownell as quick post is starting to field in the post part of a 164 run shot goes up he just goes in no one boxes amount cleans up the mess push the BC Eagles up one Music but that was impressive and when post has been impressive for the Eagles as they lead by one hes Randolph childrens great to have you with us on acc Network Hunter Tyson all spinning move by Dylan Hunter and has batted Away by Alice these are two really good defensive physical teams there would be nothing easy and theyre gonna have to earn it then right now DC is getting good things on the offensive end when the post touched the ball he scored or assisted on 12 of the last 16 BC points Felipe brims out Applause good looking shot there just moving the ball around so you dont have a problem with that no theyre gonna need someone else to try to knock down shots again at some point in time more in the second half youre going to see if both fatigues or not but hes doing a great job someone else has to step up on the offensive end dicey pass by shuffling Here Comes Jayden Zachary and hes got the easy bucket great defense turning into the offense again is what year BC Eagles is going to need to do if they want to pull off the upset continue to be great on the defensive end and again two physical teams thats six points on nine Clemson turnovers for the Eagles they only average 11 turnovers per game Applause and he lays it in Eagles a fivepoint lead their largest of the game great job on the defense again turning in defense in the offense and again coach talked about coach Earl Grant talking about grinding on both ends of the floor another turnover here they clearly are flemished on the offensive end why is that happening just to defensive pressure to pressure them to extending their pressure theyre blowing up screens creating turnovers getting into passing Lanes again this team is just flusters nothings coming easy and this is credit to BC this team can defend they just have trouble scoring in the offensive end but when you can create offense like that you dont need to worry about executing delays and theres a belief system probably in place now for the Eagles against the 20th ranked team in the country and that timeout for BC 30 seconds timeout we will take a 32nd TO as well right back at it after this in Chestnut Hill seconds and a half and coming up with a halftime report great Studio crew Kelsey Riggs Carlos Boozer and Joe Berry first half highlights and stats as well and an energized Earl Grant he has reason to be optimistic he should be the team is competing the way he competes you should see his defensive stands we got to get him at some point in his defensive stands I dont think any coach coaches the game in a better defensive stance Im really amazed that he still wears his suits because the way hes in the stage I thought hed rip them by now I thought hed wear more of the sweats but her old Grand team is taking his identity there theyre Scrappy as ever some have called him the best stress coach in the league would you agree I wouldnt disagree with that at all but he sure has the best defensive stands I can tell you that hes he spends maybe 10 minutes a game in the defensive stance thats impressive at his age hes just he spends more time doing that than I ever did when I played Applause all right what are you doing on this possession for the Eagles Ill put the ball in post hands and let him create four on the shot clock for Zachary hes got it great job by Zachary again using his size hes not didnt get by but he pivots and creates space shot by Hunter is an air ball a 224 run for these seven seconds as they hold the seven point halftime lead trap Rondell knew would be a dog fight and its proven to be Zachary gets the ball here just drives spins gets and take Rhythm pull up jump shots gotten off to a good start Ray first half here by the BC Eagles Earl Grant joining us 102 is ultra impressive and good news for Clemson theyve won three of their last four games they have trailed at halftime including at FSU on Saturday and BC 45 percent are offensive production has increased the last five games funky Clemson you have it right where you want him right you want to spot him come out second half and play your best basketball so play the percentages it was there Jewish points scored the half but thats a good start from the kayash to Langford and they go back door from post hey another great post pass by post again hes creating the offense if hes not scoring his assistant awning and hes just been the best player on the board so far this game Tyson Scoops up the loose ball and the first foul of the half it only took 28 seconds great play coming out at halftime there design call clear out the side back door cut by Langford there just a great pass by post this is an underrated skill set for big its just ability to pass its one of those things people dont discuss it allows this BC team to play inverted and what I mean by that is poster guards up that weve seen him do with Jade Zachary and put him on a perimeter dribble handoffs and back door passes like weve seen just there second foul on Devin McLaughlin who gets his first start of the season for the injured Demar Lankford who hurt his knee in their Virginia loss Saturday shocked to see him not playing I thought he practiced a little bit yesterday when I stepped both my head to Jim and saw him moving a little bit so I must have tried to warm up and couldnt give it a go today hope he recovers quickly hes one of the more athletic players they have its brother Makai with the ball Prince the league Bay freshman from Minneapolis in the post for quick post theyll take advantage did a great job of pushing PJ all he was fronting him in a pose walked him up the lane great job just throwing it over the top post and Zachary of goodbye for 21 points a foul line Jumper by Chase Hunter Brad Brownells said moments ago to us we need to relax how do you read into that probably he just wants the ball to move a little bit you know theyre shooting quick shots just execute your offense he knows this group is going to continue to defend but right now theyre playing out a character on the offensive end kept alive for a moment by post and here comes Clemson Chauncey Wiggins to chase Hunter Off the Mark soap was shot by Chase there Chase Hunter there just didnt knock it down I mean he didnt get back didnt match up DC Eagles and he punished he took the right shot just didnt make it gotta knock that down and Im sure for him he wont get me any easy looks like that could take by Devin McLaughlin as he drew contact from Chauncey Wiggins first foul on the way to this five straight road games trailing at halftime we just told you that you can do that one theres seven and four overall but you were on a coaching staff for many years at Wake Forest thats probably not what we wanted to eat what you want to hear thats not a stat that you want to be proud of but again its familiar you know you know you guys have done it before so the message is like hey guys weve been here lets get back to moving to basketball in the office and right now what they cannot do is allow their lack of scoring affect their defensive intensity right now and again shots will come and go and his team is too talented on the offensive end theyll figure that out Eagles have their largest lead of the night foreign in the first half defense was tenacious in the late stages of the first half of the Eagles hunt to the fade away that was nice difficult shot but again if you want to know why this team is different than its been in years past because at the end of the day late shot clock play you can put the ball and Chase Hunters hands and he can make plays just like that that was a difficult shot hes making and he has made difficult shots the zone is that effective for Clemson the lob to mcglockton Applause three by Makaya Langford left him open on the left wing didnt rebound it got a second chance ones got the rebound even kick it outside and astral language just knocked down an open three again would you have gone to a Zone hes just trying to mix things up here both teams are offensive foul on Chase Hunter as he ran into Jim Zachary its a great job BC Eagles getting in front of the basketball there Zachary again is just playing on both ends of the floor offensive rebound by McLaughlin kicks off the Langford putting the Eagles up 12 right now theres a lot of belief in this building if they can win this game they know theyre going to defend and its coach Earl Grant told these guys lets keep grinding keep grinding keep passing the ball keep sharing the ball right now Clemsons gone Zone and mixing up the Zone theyre trying to figure something out here these shoes only one of eight games in the series Clemson has a 208 edge Zachary from Ash to Langford Malik casell said he stepped out of bounds Applause Music in civilian clothes with a lower body injury and hes instant offense hell shoot from anywhere hes 25 years old he was with BC last year and he led their comeback at Clemson they came from 23 down to stunt the Tigers last year Im obviously upset with that young man because when he was he was in BC a year ago when he had an Insomnia Cookie nil deal and had me eating him and he lost 60 pounds and I think he gave me 50 of those pounds that he lost thats not a fair trade no no not at all not at all so Applause um yeah I banned cookies for 2023 because of grabbing gallons I I cant bear cookies so that would not go well in my diet well I dont know how well its going how long its gonna last but its you know were only 31 days in how about the Steel by Ashton Langford and the quick hands and post hits the floor with a Vengeance of PJ Hall is upset getting chippy I think its just posters trying to catch his breath sometimes well youre a veteran guy flooring hes been outstanding on both ends of the floor and got a tough foul there and it just takes a nap Applause its a soft spot yeah taking a nap there sometimes you just need a pillow right I think the officials gonna take a look at that too for PJ Hall they got it theyre wearing his leg right there he plays with a lot of emotion foul was on post his second we will take a look and then come back as BC has a nine point lead Clemson Clemson starts the game with a nine to nothing run led by as many as 23 points with seven minutes remaining in the first half but Makai has to Lankford 17 of his game high 19 in the second half DC then took their first and only lead of the game with 26 seconds left as Brevin Galloway knocked down the threepointer he had 18 and bcns a ninegame losing skid to Clemson Galloway and the portal goes to Clemson used to be a College of Charleston and China worked his way back from a lower body injury and great for him just to go back home as well absolutely and Earl Grant has known him since he was 12 he hasnt played from him in the College of Charleston following him up here and then spending his last season in college back home just a bad foul there probably a threepoint shooter there and thats on Quinton post his third so PJ Hall hits the deck and moments ago they reviewed the foul it was just a common foul on post hes going to have to exit with eight points and his impact has been so much more than just those eight points hes assisting on quite a bit of points so lets see what now where VCs offense comes from Hunter Tyson to the hall front court has been outstanding all year for the 20th ranked Tigers Hunter Nails it so Clemson with a little kick in its step trailing by seven it just got multiple guys and multiple ways to attack you and youre gonna see them go back to the 32 Zone there and again the post is not his influence is not just his passion he may be the best shooter for the BC Eagles and having him out of the game you want to force them to take jump shots Langford gets swatted by all Bickerstaff doubled 50 pass a lead day with the three and hes got it how about that the hometown roll for Prince alibe great basketball there just moving to basketball so unselfish playing basketball rewards good bad good passing Hunter Tyson got Zachary in the air he made him pay if youre wondering why hes the leading candidate for Player of the Year thats it hes time and time again when his team is down he just steps up big moments knock down big shots and again theyre gonna need to lean on him he has it going so far offensively to Clemson and theyve been struggling on the end of the floor after Lankford from Deep a league Bay working hard and theres contacts great job there just great behind the back pass by McLaughlin there and finding the league fan in the corner and hes doing it all right now scoring on the offensive end and again part of Tyson tells him anything you can do Im the best threepoint shooter on this point tonight and hes been silenced in the crowd telling him the showing night just freshman year Prince League Bay has been doing a lot of different things you know scoring inside going to the offensive blast and his physicality is just something you just dont see very often as a freshman and they raved about him and I think hes his upside tremendous theres some Madison checks in for Devin McLaughlin accident in the first half was a contributor with five points and a threepointer because Clemsons in that 32 Zone you see Madisons coming in and then hes knocked down pretty early in this game and hes a shooter so you want to kind of get him in because youre looking for offense and you know with this lineup you dont have a lot of a shooting from a high to threepoint line so you just want to get another shooter out there while Clemson Tigers are in the zone Lee Bay late stages of the clock and hes feeling it isnt it ball to the middle of that zone going oneonone and he shimmy and talking to the crowd as hes going back down the floor Second Chance points plus 11 for BC Tyson and a foul thats on Jaden Zachary his second just catch us in the middle of that zone and faces up on PJ Hall and just gets into a rhythm shot wonderful pull up there and thats the most dangerous spot of any zone is catching the ball around that free throw line area you want to put one of your better more creative players in that position and freshman is stepping up so far but replay but Jalen Suggs and Chad Holmgren and Minnehaha Academy so that team was loaded you know he feels he belongs if he plays with those guys and hes showing why he deserves some national recognition as well right now Roger Tyson 14 points and hes one shy of his sees an average of 16 Here Comes RJ Godfrey replacing Chauncey Wiggins for the Tigers every Thursday at 10 East should run after our womens basketball doubleheader theyre nothing but neck crew breaks down the night in the ACC with highlights of analysis on every womens game and a look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week coverage you can only get one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere Clemsons come out they switched out of the zone and theyre back in their mantoman is that the right decision I think he only went to the zone to give him create some Rhythm but they struggled to rebound out of it so since they rebounded and heard him a couple of times and with three pointers and get into the foul line and getting the ball there to Prince Alibi in the middle of it so now theyre going back man to man and I think theyll stick with their man defense right now its a third foul on Josh Peter on a fourth pass by Zachary scooped up by Tyson Here Comes Beetle on the front foot Tyson the trailer Applause Godfrey son of Randall Godfrey 11year NFL veteran linebacker and the floater by Chase Hunter hes starting to come on hes getting to that pain hes missed a couple of shots early but the credit to him really talented offensive player when hes not making threes hes driving a basketball and getting into bank Creek Langford from the elbow Applause just us patience is coming off he puts that on his hip gets to a spot just shoots the floater over just big time basketball play there and again he is one of the big reasons why this team is just so dangerous because he gives them something that they hadnt had in quite some time hes a late clock guy that could create for himself and others they just attacked you in so many different ways rearhigh 26 at Florida State Saturday Paul used it on the front rim offensive rebound by RJ Godfrey as he tried to knife through the defense it looks like Elite Bay hurt his right arm and this is we talked about you know wheres the offense going to come from we know what Tim Clemsons going to continue to attack you Godfrey comes in fights for the offensive rebound which is what you want to see with freshmen you dont run a lot of plays for him he just comes in Off the Bench its not really a scoring option gets himself going by attacking the glass Godfreys scoreless in seven minutes thats the first foul on TJ Bickerstaff Devin McLaughlin back in for BC along with Ben Middlebrooks so Clemson middle Brooks is the nephew of Danny Cannell its an athletic family weve got quite a bit of Athletics out there tonight game of bloodline of superstars here the brothers yeah between the hunters for Clemson theyre both on the Clemson bench you got the Langford Brothers for BC got TJ Bickerstaff with the bicker staff family yeah and more importantly we got ourselves a heck of a basketball game here yes we do as thicker staff is tied up nice pass in the post for TJ that is a big time block there by middelburg coming over the basketball is flying around and thats just an excellent block there and then draws the foul on Baker staff second foul in the last minute on TJ Bickerstaff and which is the frustration fell yeah he got his shot blocked and you know its just a little bit of frustration there but again the problem is again posters on the bench picked up that foul where is the offense gonna come from for this team right now and Clemson just continues to run their offense and have they still got their scores on the bench DJ hauls out but they have this guy here thats a weakness for PC the scoring droughts and great observation on your part with post on the bench Here Comes bickers staff Clemson has made five of its last eight shots BC had led by as many as 12 points so what are you going to run now what are you going to do Zacharys hows it going and he has the balls in his hands and now they put a bigger body on him so he cant post up so now this is where Makai Lankford has to get the ball in his hands and try to create there Zachary behind the back five to shoot hell take it and hell air ball it dicey possession by BC and the tigers are climbing back in they look like they have some Renewed Energy and consistency Music Applause BCs seven footer who is that mass man thats quick post his three fouls and since he left 425 Clemson outscored BC 116 since that third foul yeah you can feel the momentum shifting back into Clemson they would get back into this game and you know great call about Earl Grant the question is going to be is where they stay man theyre looking like theyve extended the pressure here theyre going to be a two two one I think theyve Fallen back into the zone and try to protect him theres too many bodies and too many people to attack him with and you dont want him picking up his profile because if he does that hes gonna have to sit out so I expected two two one maybe back to some type of zone or something like that they got to figure out a way to try to protect them and they stand man to man right now whats the counter on offense for Clemson continue to attack post Beetle from the elbow rebound kept alive heres Godfrey Bill Brooks triple teamed and comes away with a 5050 ball excellent Hustle by Ben Middlebrooks great job just keeping the ball alive here a screened by metalwicks on Matson and a switch post on Chase Hunter I have to shoot out of bounds just a gutsy call by Earl Grant and staff theyre switching five there late clock and the Clinton post from Chase Hunter there and he actually did a great job defending Here Comes PJ all back in for Middlebrooks all seven points two fouls has played nine minutes inbound to Tyson its at rip or blocked in the board great stages of the shot clock again hey great job there defensively regarding the Baseline out of bounds play forcing them just to throw it in bounds and taking a contested shot and Clarence Armstrong calls a foul on the Tigers Applause tomorrows national Signing Day and the Huddle crew will break down all the ACC recruits during our Signing Day special the guys will look at the top storylines for each school and talk to coaches from across the conference coverage begins at six Eastern on accn and the ESPN app first foul on Hunter Tyson great great veteran play there by Zachary just stopping as he came up the ball scream forcing Hunter Tyson to run up his back created the foul oh bumped by post and an offensive foul thats his fourth five as he was trying to bump PJ Hall as problematic for the Eagles theyve been competing against each other all game theyve been theyve been fighting its been a tough physical game theyve been challenging each other and again its a good call you know the defensive player is entitled to that position you know you cant go through his chest after you get it once and youre coaching guys if you do it once the second one you go down because youre entitled to that position you dont like to call if youre an Eagles fan but its the actor right though and the Eagles are scoreless in the last four minutes and hes going to have to sit for an extended period of time now with four fouls Applause its McLaughlin and bicker staff in their front Court Fade Away Hunter Tyson too strong godfreed tips it out of bounds PC ball Godfreys getting his hands in a lot of basketball theyre a tough difficult Fade Away there those are the kind of shots that Hunter Tyson usually makes as well but theyre starting to get their hands on loose balls 50 50 balls and right now its just a critical point for DC where do they go in the offensive end what would you do has to be Zachary of length review one of those two guys has to create even if someone else scores the ball has to be in their hands and they got to make plays but its got to come within a flow of the offense you dont want to over dribble right now the ball is moving just like that getting them on the move and cutting and playing Applause Ashton Langford on the bait Baseline log three Matson rims out and the rebound for Clemson and Beetle and Chase Hunter ran into a Defender and its mataiash to Langford with a foul his first so the chipping is continues physical teams I know we got one and one here and you dont like the cause I know the fans dont but reaches across his body there I think its reached in with the right hand didnt hit across his body he has an argument there but I often tell the guys I dont know if the referees have ever changed the foul fall when theyve called it I hadnt seen one yet I dont know about you I have not seen it you played youve played a long time that could be a historic night Chestnut Hill the first time for everything as they say but Clemson the clear Edge in the second half with a four point scoring Edge 1915 at the moment DC LED 30 to 23 at halftime throw the records out I mean its Road wins I dont care what the conference is row wins are just tough to come by you know role players for home teams tend to play a little bit better you just dont know which youre going to get a lot of times and were seeing this BC team play good basketball so far an underrated aspect of Clemson is their free throw success theyre 10 for 10 from the line and 79 percent on the season first in the ACC and even when Clemson is struggling they were able to put the ball in Chase Hunters hands and for him to make plays Beetle to Tyson takes it on Zachary thats a shot he usually hits and its Clemson ball Godfrey defense has been a bonus for the Tigers done a great job there he comes over and blocks the shot hes been so active and not needing him to score hes been defending hes been getting his hands on loose balls on offensive rebounds and everything just having a real impact on the game that that doesnt necessarily show up in the statue so Makai Ashton Lankford to the bench and Chaz Kelly gets a shot the Freshman from Houston Music presumed backup point guard Donald hand is out for the season with a torn ACL theyre expecting a lot out of him highly touted freshman foul line jumper and Zachary with a rebound where does the offense come from for BC right now they got the ball in Zachary hands got a couple of young guys out there on the floor a couple of freshmen and the ball has to move and you really only have one Creator on the floor in that Zachary and thats not necessarily his strength Zachary gets doubled and a foul thats on RJ Godfrey is first and your point is magnified 607 without a bucket for BC thats the scoring you got to put the ball and Zach Zacharys hand there to create theres no other creators on the floor hes got two freshmen you see hes got to get Lancer back in but Outpost theyre pretty much onedimensional right now in the offensive end Clemson has missed this last eight shots Applause Kelly to Bickerstaff Zachary the bump and the miss the rebound for Tyson here comes the Tigers they got numbers that they need him Godfrey ran into the wall oh Kevin McLaughlin County forum and some dance moves looks like Randolph childrens back in the day pull that off couldnt you I could when I had better knees and a better back and a better hip Laughter well Mr stats Dave chorus doing a great job for us tonight and six and a half minutes without a point for BC they missed the last six field was Clemson six for six from the line in the last five and a half minutes but they missed their last eight field goals theres a lid on both on the basket for both teams right now but Clemson has clawed back in it because theyve been able to get to the free throw line theyve put you know theyve gotten into the bonus theyve driven the basketball theyve been the more attacking team and they have multiple guys that can do it the issue with the Eagles is that right now without Langford with post being in foul trouble its its Langford or exactly right now and Zacharys not in the game so lets see if one of these young guys steps up for BC and RJ Godfrey ties it up Clemson a perfect 12 for 12 on the line Music Jazz Kelly the drive and the bucket he was aggressive you can tell he wanted it freshman is not afraid of the moment there gets to drive the ball downhill didnt settle for any jump shots attacked them attack the rim and be able to get that one to go in the only averages two points per game in 13 minutes of action TJ Hall called for a travel 14 turnover of the night for Clemson great defense there in the post taking away that strong side and Jazz Kelly getting to that right hand driving hard and finishing it is a great sight to see for the young guys practice well this week and hes rewarding Earl Grant for giving him the playing time you spoke with him yesterday I just challenged him a little bit told him he needed to spend more time working out and just staff Raves about him and his practice habits wasnt working out to the production that he wanted and he to his credit owned up to it and happy to see that such a quick turnaround that hes getting the opportunity to play to Langford great job there freshman play we talking about that he just scored before and that time drove and found a teammate and again keep him on defense they can make them guard for 30 40 seconds so thats what you want to do with teams in a game like this you dont need to take quick shots and try to force things like that thats dribbling through traffic by Ashton Lankford and that cant happen great job there liquor staff just coming in reaching from behind and again when youre not scoring those are the type of things you need to do help your team pull off the upset right now this is just a rock fight just two physical team thats familiar with each other great on ball defense there by Kylie and he finds Victor stop who pays for it hits the Deck card that picture tells the story as hell go to the line just great on board I mean Thai Lake was a great onball defender Chase Hunter relaxes there and Piper takes his money from him and right past and fine there biggest stabs gonna have to earn this one the hard way no easy layup here not the game like this first foul on PJ Hall Ashton rank for the candidate for ACC all defensive teams hes a really good on ball Defender and its one of those if their record was better hed get more recognition for that I mean hes definitely one of the better defenders in this league it is deserving of all ACC caliber defensive play and because their team is in the left place he doesnt get the recognition that he sore you know deserves on plays like that and doing a really good job and one of the reasons why Chase Hunter is not shooting a great percentage tonight Here Comes hunter from the elbow and way off kicker stopped the beneficiary Clemson shooting rows continue theyre 28 percent in the second half five for 18 and sometimes when you dont get a steal you pressure the ball and get a quick shot like that and thats just as easy thats just as quick as much of a turnover there as a turnover that he had the last possession a testament to the fierce defense by BC the pass Vickers staff oh my goodness quite the left hand great five great finish in traffic with the river lay up there and Clemson needs a timeout TJ bitterstaff Athletics this was special for BC straight pass a great finish there Hunter Tyson leads them is scoring at 16 per game he has 15 Randolph but hes only attempted nine shots he had it going early there and he seemed to be the one guy thats comfortable right now and its capable of turning the switch and getting the offensive you know getting things going on the offensive end right now lets see if they come out of the timeout with some type of design play to help get hit the ball and get him going theres a deep three by Tyson backgrounded Prince Ali Bay the rebound great job coming out of timeout design that played for him it was a slip screen he faked the screen and picked and popped and BC was on top of it they switched and was able to contest it Clemson has missed his last 10 shots League Bay eyes to three Chase Hunters got it good execution there good look you can make that at this time with the league Bay corralling it has eight points and seven rebounds hes done his really good job again hes such a physical player and he doesnt have to have the ball to have an impact on the game and hes showing you that Applause Zachary deliberate draining the shot clock TJ bicker staff to the rack moments ago an athletic maneuver converted by bicker staff both teams having trouble shooting the ball cleansing 32 percent PC 39 percent Hall to three no Godfrey Scoops it up for Tyson air ball for Hunter Tyson second air ball tonight seemed to be settling quite a bit theyre getting jump shot happy for Clemson they have to get back to attack in the paint if they want to get back in this game scoreless in their last four plus minutes you see one on a six and a half minutes scoring drought a league Bay blocks good defense by Godfrey hes been industrious Applause both teams right now and Balls got to move and you want to get a pain touch here you want to get somebody close to the basket jump shots not falling looks like shot fake just like that get to your midrange Chase Hunter tied up by Zachary possession so BC has sled for 19 minutes and 42 seconds theyre smelling an upset with under three to play in Chestnut Hill teen in the second half PC survived his abdoms and they lead by five theyve actually increased the lead at a fourpoint lead at 10 13 which is about another rep five and were at a critical point here this game Clemson feels like theres a lid on the basket lets see what theyre going to run coming to execute out of this Baseline out of bounds Chase Hunter the lob for PJ Hall Eagles in man all lost it taken away by picker stop Eagles doing a nice job collapsing in the post quick hands there strip PJ Hall on the way up and so what he had a lane at it get the ball and drive in and just quick hands got a deflection a good steal they need a good possession here UBC where are they going Applause posters in the game now so you want to see him touch on the perimeter but hes a great job theyre going to play inverted like they usually have done in early in his game and you could just space him at the at the threepoint line 37 to shoot for the Eagles just coming over DJ comes over and strips got away with a file here but its not about they dont call it no sir sometimes its better to be lucky than good and I think thicker staff might have got away with one there see if they can reward him Zachary finds Lankford on the wing hell launch back iron rebound Hunter Tyson tough possession Clemson has missed its last 15 field goal attempts Tyson rolling and blocked by Bickerstaff but a foul maybe a makeup call well that was some contact there you could have called travel but then he drives left here and he spins back in in the paint runs into his own man and difficult call there if youre in a bicker stab doesnt like it at all third on Bickerstaff a bewilder Daryl Grant Tyson was stuck on 15 now hes at his season average of 16 three rebounds shy of his 10th DoubleDouble hes done his part he hadnt had a lot of help this game I mean no one else is really stepped up Hunter Tysons had it you know hes just done with Player of the Year cannons as you expect him to do and Chase Hunter has 12 and kind of chipped in but he hasnt had his normal consistent efficient game and besides that no one else is really giving him much Clemson Perfect 14 free throw attempts 14 makes under two minutes to play in regulation good pass Ashton Langford goes back door how do you like that great job terrific ball Movement by BC and Bickerstaff heres all the hook it was awkward and he draws contact post physicality and his size was giving PJ Halls Fitz and he just hasnt been able to get as deep as he went to in a post and posters just walled up and his size and length is really bothering tonight hes able to get the offensive rebound there and a lot of basketball still left to play for sure Music youd like to see Paul probably get it face up and move him a little bit right now hes getting into a physical match with the post and he needs to get more on the driving and getting angles on foul was on Ashton Lankford his second fourth point game all has eight his only shot 12 times hes made three he has grabbed nine rebounds and he gets the honest roll keeps it at one possession game Applause a lot of time left if youre Clemson you just want to get a stop limit him into one shot and rebound if youre BC here I think you can continue with the same formula you keep post on the perimeter with the ball and you play inverted let the guards get downhill in the paint and attack league base swings it to Ash to Langford seven on the shot clock screen by post and he goes to the rock yeah you get him loose and theyll take advantage and he hits the deck Eagles up by five theyve been feisty all night lake has been really good just his decision making and his play making here in the second half down a stretcher for BC Eagles Chase Hunter for three no and Jen Zachary has good and here comes a foul by Hunter Tyson towards mid Court this crowd grew as the game went along the student section is heated up throughout the year at County forum and theyre setting a 42nd away upset just a great Drive coming off the ball spring there gets the angle on PJ Hall gets a quick to the glass tries to throw a quick foul there in the inbound play hes played really well hes finishing this game for BC hes trying to get a closer tonight hes tired of losing his team is playing good basketball today one of two or three I know people didnt expect them to win this game maybe but again its Road games are hard to play and his team has started BC team has started to play better on the offensive end and a steal again thats the story of their game their commitment to defense Clemsons trying the ball over an alarming rate and if you coach Burnell theres got to be some level of concern because even in the Virginia Tech game they only mounted 51 points in that game and theyre on Pace to do that again right now so theyve been to have theyve been some some offensive woes here but this team continues to defend you you only get that 54 points offensive roles you can you can kind of work on stunning Randolph but theyve missed their last 17 shots Clemson has not had a field goal in the last 1244 its hard to imagine pretty hard to match but again credit to BC some of thats been the defensive effort theyve forced a ton of turnovers in the first half they continue to do so in the second half theyve been theyve been physical theyve competed they fought and Eric there theyre 32 seconds away from a welldeserved win we looked at each other when Clemson was up by 11 and we both said oh look down for stories I started looking in my bag on storage to talk about like oh lets make it away again credit to Errol Grant and his staff and those guys are just keep plugging along and theyre no different than where they were last year for whatever reason this team gets better and better as the year goes on and you know we talked about it I think if this team was healthier you see a better than better position I think people just dont understand the the how many games theyve missed and we talked about as good a players post is hes only played in nine games yeah we take a 30second timeout Ash to Lankford has made his last 23 free throws and BC leads by seven theyre not calling timeout so well keep it here for a moment that they were we will stay here and theres that graphic 23 straight at the line and you mentioned how successful Clemson has been theyre perfect 16 out of 16 but they havent been able to shoot straight 19 in the second half of the Tigers five for 26 from the field two for ten from three and now they go to a timeout we will take it as well BC can they hang on for the upset seven both teams bonus two timeouts remaining anxious moments for fans anxious moments for the Eagles and the Tigers right now with your BC you just got to get the ball in bounds Clemson has to foul immediately so you want to get the ball to Langston and or any good Shooters they have to foul theyre going to try to get a quick trap deer got to be strong with the ball to get it out of traffic they do get the foul on Mason Matson she goes down hard Zacharys letting the crowd know its okay to cheer now I think this is safe I think were gonna finish this Hickory has had a good night he has he hadnt scored here in the second half but when they needed him in the first half hes delivered he scored all 13 of his of his points in the first half just a heck of a game by that young man and probably did more creating in the second half Clemsons only lost once since midDecember so they do lose this theyll fall to 102 in their last 12 theyre trying to equal their 11 wins in the ACC which retires School record but two makes by Madsen money shots as theyre up by nine and Matson out the substitute offense for defense with TJ Bickerstaff a midcourt Hemingway look out Godfrey tracks it down Clemson with 17 turnovers shot clocked off Tyson got it Hunter Tyson Big Time shot he has 20 points yeah hes really been the only ass on the offensive end he had not had a lot of help today and just comes off and raises up at 68 just difficult for most guards to try to get out there and bother his shot needed a lot more a lot earlier in the game and again theyre still fighting to competing here theyre only down six that was their first field goal since 1316 remained in the ball game both teams struggled and the credit to these guys they just defended and thats a lot goes to BC they continue to defend continue to believe heres our Wednesday college basketball doubleheader on an ACC network of the ESPN app Blake ginson and fifth are in Chapel Hill to take on Armando big Caleb love in North Carolina at seven Eastern and its down the road to Raleigh for turquian Smith jart Kell Joyner and NC State taking on Matthew Cleveland and Florida State do not miss a moment of the action on accn Applause all right offensively 172 remaining for the Eagles where are you going just got to put the ball in length for his hand and theyre gonna theyre gonna try to get a quick tie up with quick trap if not theyre gonna foul post pounded and fouled by Hunter Tyson hes a good guy you want to put in line two hes shooting 97 hes only this one all year so I think not many teams has a luxury of putting this Center on did you just Jinx him up no know hes hes theres no pressure on these free throws time is Clemsons enemy right now I think hes fine I love how you say that here yeah its easier now yeah theres no pressure back in your days with the dates easy would you whatd you hit for the free throw on you scored over 2200 points no clue I dont have no idea no I would never know 80 oh for career yeah yeah in the 80s in the 80s yeah fine all my coaches would have rung my neck if I missed if I shot anything below the mid 80s in the free throw I would add a difficult time she gets two post trying to intercept it stairs he collides with a few of the BC football players he might have hurt one of those guys because he is coming over there he might have won that Oklahoma drill Laughter Tyson hes got it again hes scored their last five points UC has made its last six foul shots in e3s when youre in this situation because youre just trading two for two when you knock down your free throws Music and a league Bay is at the line Eagles will have Syracuse County forum on Saturday at five on acc Network that game is sold out Syracuse played well last night but lost to Virginia at the Dome and some good action around the league tonight as always in the ACC time to move theres a lot a lot of good basketball every game seems to matter I mean its almost like youre winning is like it doubles and losing it like stubble its just so much and bro winning on a road is just so hard its just such a I cant state it enough there are no gimmies you can throw the records out this time of year theres so much to play for eign Applause against the ranked opponent this season the most in five years as BC meets the number 20 team in the country now scored him 3231 in the second half they trailed 198 early in the first half they ended the half on a 225 run and it was a game of bursts for the Eagles but especially on the defensive end thats where they won the game a 417 turnover their defense is outstanding and when they didnt force the turnover they actually sped Clemson up and took quick shots with uh this is effective as
