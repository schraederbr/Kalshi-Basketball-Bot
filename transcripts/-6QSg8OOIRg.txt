12 s and 5 two in the conference and we are underway the opening tip is controlled by the demon deons by the way its about 8° it feels like outside shocking here in Winston Salem winter time has its grips right now the first Fired Up by HTH he cant hit it close in along the Applause Baseline Al Kau taking over the point guard of for North Carolina has a lot of success getting into paint when he wants to get there getting it downstairs the first foul of the night North Carolina getting it inside to Jaylen Washington as he takes the hit in the opening seconds here and the first foul will go on Fon Reed the sevenfooter and which has been such an issue for Fon Reed throughout his time here in Winston saem is staying out of foul trouble you see early in the game yber Davis wants to get the basketball inside to jayen Washington to see if they can find a way to get readed on the bench early in this one Washington at 610 and too strong in the first one hes only 63 you say well hes 610 usually for North Carolina you look around and there are five or six other guys about 69ine 16 they normally start two guys at least 69 at least 69 so its a different North Carolina team for those who havent seen it its no longer a two big lineup now its four guards now the guards are Elite however a small group of guards on the Music perimeter we see OB what the guards allow North Carolina to do picking up 94 ft going for the L but picked off by Powell he read that one beautifully and heres Jackson the multitalented freshman coming in averaging 15 points a game he can hit the three that has been a real struggle for North Carolina that particular stat a midrange jumper they hit it on of twos and pow knocks down that one about 55 from twopoint land and Drake pal making his presence felt early in this game on both ends the floor Elite defensive play turns into a buckle for him on the offensive end Johnson into the paint and the first jumper on the way from Salis wont go hes only 32 from Beyond the threepoint line neither one of these teams make that a specialty but will lift this one from way downtown and that clangs away ugly and giveway force a lot of credit getting back defensively and building the wall around RJ Davis normally thats a bucket for Davis in transition but Steve Forbes talked to us about how well they play 49 of their shots come in transition ild the hard no point guard finding his way into the paint he thought he had a foul on the elbow re picks it off going up strong he cant convert but hell draw a foul it thought for sure he was hit on the arm but there was no whistle on that one and a foul committed by Drake Powell and thats number one on him Davis youre number four for North Carolina what has been a problem for North Carolina showing itself early in this game taking care of their defensive board OB you and I have done a lot of North Carolina games over the past 10 years and one thing you know for certain is the fact that they always are one of the best rebounding teams not only in the ACC but in the country right now in the offensive rebounding standpoint North Carolina is 16th in the ACC out of 18 teams so where they normally get low the offensive production theyve got havent gotten it this year Well there it is for you 16th out of 18 in that category offensive rebounding for Huberts team we chatted with him today during his shoter round he likes his team a lot he loves his kids theyre not a noisy group he really doesnt have a leader one really vocal guy and thats the difference from where last year they had a course both Harrison Ingram and cor M Ryan who transferred in however we very vocal to go along with ar bacock whos been a leader for really 5 years hbert said I really have to be the voice I have to be the Catalyst at this point thats interesting when you have plays like happened in the last couple of seconds on Saturday Washington denied right up in his grill Spiller has sent it Applause back Salis off to Johnson trying to get around kadell that should be a pretty good battle tonight nice spin move and hell draw the foul I tell you what if were going to see the two guys at six feet out here battling in the post were in for an entertaining night but on this end of the floor Spillers doing a great job plays much bigger than his 68 stature the long arms allow him to get the the block against Washington on the interior yeah hes the number three rebounder in the conference at that size and and again hes a guy that really plays much bigger presents a problem for North Carolina because he goes to the offensive glass extremely well but also has the ability to stretch it from Beyond a threepoint Arc so been a great addition to this group of course I dont think theres anyone in the ACC thats made transfers look as good as Steve Forbes has when you consider the guys that hes had here L Williams AC player here a couple seasons ago out of Applause state and tied of the Applause Music Applause Three cross cour Davis sixo grag gets it off to Kad listed at six feet and a whistle Doug sha with the whistle and the foul and a personal here will go against Washington thats his first first turnover for North Carolina had a season low five turnovers vers Stanford and you mentioned Hubert Davis was extremely upbeat for a coach thats lost his last game normally we see coaches coming in and how focused they are but Huber was very positive about his group and shoot around today you said I got a lot of really good kids theres so much fun to be around lost a lot of close games though and a sweet touch there by Johnson Tyler Johnson the sixo sophomore out of Brooklyn with a bucket and OB we see the guards once again going to the post Ty Johnson taking Elliot Kad to the block and going to get a bucket Jackson lines up a long one got it with a three thats welcome sign Ian Jackson did not make a threepointer for the first time in the previous seven games for him where he has been scoring lights out over 20 points per game in ACC play Salis nearly had it poked away Fall Away around and out at Jackson the previous seven games averaged 23 points a game only six against Stanford hell fire again too strong this time Applause hild to the Baseline got Airborne tough pass picked off Davis will run knocked away hell recover it North Carolina not a good threepoint shooting team but going after it early Jackson is one of the guys who can 39 and he got a good look on the last two possessions unable to knock him down but Huer Davis will be the first to tell you that hes thats one guy he doesnt have to tell to shoot the basketball and Salis just lost the handle on it and rolled off his hand and out back over to Carolina theyve already turned it over three times so a 65 lead here for North Carolina opening minutes here in Winston Music Salem has a number of opportunities in its upcoming Five game stretch but hunter Salis took it a step further he said these are the kinds of games youn and if you want to get into the NCAA tournament he said we have to get into the NCAA tournament and this is the stretch that gives this team and opportunities to build some momentum with the five games ahead on their schedule fellas absolutely and when you consider this game alone you think about the fact that the last three times the tar Hills have been in this building W force is beaten by average larg than 15 points per game so the demonas have had success under Steve Forbes against the heels here at home where theyre N9 and0 this season looking to go 10 and0 for the fourth consecutive Year Ron gr with a stoppage in play there 1535 to go here in the first half in a clock issue so setting it at 28 seconds on the shot clock in for Davis noi I had to go over and apologize if about God Ron R earlier because after Cooper flag all but admitted to said something on his technical foul the other day and I said that he didnt say anything so I had to make sure I made good with my guy like Ellie K makes good on the three from the wi knocked that down to make it 95 he was pretty Sly with when he said it we couldnt pick it up on the replay but he did admit later you know what Id rather not repeat what I said which is basically saying yes I did it indeed Sal dumping down for Reed averaging 86 rebounds the game the seven quarter backing into the working hard on the dribble and draws a whistle that was with just seven to shoot and itll be Lu the 68 Junior out of Orlando to pick up the personal were talking about North Carolina now and their tournament resume at 12 7 52 in the conference and no doubt Carolina has played a very tough schedule Kansas Auburn Alabama Michigan State Florida but they have lost them all and thats the thing playing bring schedule but you got to throw some wins in there against those teams part of the reason why North Carolina according to our Joe lardi is one of the last R teams of what they buy right now so they need this win just as badly as do the Demon Deacons a very important game in ACC play looko with a quick five points comes in averaging 10 points a game for the Tar Heels Reed up top heres Salis pretty quiet so far his elbow jump for no tipped again and controlled by Carolina lets see if they push it here with Davis they get to him quickly set tremble now in the game whos been pretty consistent or at least was until a head injury in practice off the window nicely done back to back drive by El Kad getting to The Rim finishing kads doing a much better job of going to the rim to score and then passing once the Defenders make him I believe the scouting report on him is to make him score in comparison to finding his teammates on the outside hes doing it so far and a whistle this will go the other way with 1338 to go in the first half and back to that move a moment ago yeah a nice cross for Kad getting to the rim and then shielded off very well by venal L going off his teammates back to get the easy layup but back to back buckets for Kad as he continues to get downhill against a w Force team that defensively has made significant improvements this year in comparison to the four previous years on the coach four he just picked up a second foul for w so keep an eye on that could again on the attack and one he is the Energizer right now for the Tar Heels and going to the 10 with authority and not as though Elliot K would have been deterred by F Reed being on the floor however with no shot blocker out there at this point he gets an easy Lane right down the middle of wake Force defense and has scored the last seven points for North Carolina they open it up 157 they got Wake Forest on their heels early on well ellot kadoo has been the man so far for North Carolina he is on a run all by himself yeah hes already knocked down at three but hes done the majority of his damage getting to the rim Elliot kadu attacking the basket and when you consider the fact that he already has nine of North Carolinas 15 points opportunity to get the double figures here in the first s minutes of the game and makes that a threepoint play hes got 10 fast points its out score wake force on his own 107 and this is an area where North Carolina playing a smaller lineup is able to really pick up and do the job defensively Hubert Davis going with full court pressure the Trap forcing another turnover by the demon Deacon but five already for Wake Forest Luben on the inbounds the 68 Jr at 13 against Stanford dribble straight on no Dre Harris The Freshman from Salsbury North Carolina off to Spillers and hild theres a reach there by Trimble and number one on the Junior and heres our big 12 sec Wednesday basketball double header on ESPN 2 number 12 Kansas against TCU at 7 Eastern and then number 16 Old Miss will battle number 13 Texas AM on the inbounds downstairs for Spillers and lost it you can see theres been a concerted effort by the Demon Deacons to get the basketball inside weve seen their guards posting up we see Spillers trying to get opportunity but they havent been able to handle the basketball now six turnovers to only two field goals made for the Demon Deacons here in the first seven minutes of this Music Applause Music game Pass Washington cant grab that one as Withers tried to rifle that one underneath and right by him and the second turnover for the tar Hills lost another close one on Saturday One That Got Away they were up five with about four minutes to go RJ Davis said we should have won that game heres h got a good look one and done and thats the area of concern right now for North Carolina finishing defensive possessions you got to stop but you got to go finish it with the defensive board Jayla Watton doing a great job going out of his area to come up with the defensive board Davis on Sal gave it away H with with the pick across midcourt hell jump into the paint cant finish it it spins into the back court down for it Spillers except Trimble trying to tie that one up its going to be a foul anytime a player has the basketball you basically go over their back to try to get it thats going to be a foul off of what would have been another transition opportunity for North Carolina turns into a turnover and now the tar Hills have turned it over three times themselves only had five a season low in the game against stford on Saturday already three here in less than eight minutes of play now Hubert said that was great but they turned them into 11 points and so so Stanford capitalized on each one of those turnovers one point game made all the difference it was slicing inside off the backboard and we certainly need some offensive life and another whistle 16 to9 North Carolina we will take the break 1158 to go in the half wake mans not too pleased right now Music hey the recipient of the 2025 Pete muff courage Award Star this award is presented annually to a student ath orness who demonstrates the level of resilience and courage he displayed while ping ALS p w welcome back to ljbm Coliseum here in Winston Salem where North line lead weight fors 16 to9 we saw Hubert Davis really imploring his players and being the vocal leader that he wants his team to be but he told us this is the quietest team hes ever been around and I talked to Ian Jackson about becoming a leader and Ian Jackson told me fellas it was weird for him he was afraid to step on someones toes and hes still sort of learning how to grow in that leadership BR and it feels like other players are having some of the same challenges which is why Hubert has been so involved as a vocal leader with with this group yeah one of the things we got to see there it wasnt just hu its also Shawn may of course a former allamerican for North Carolina having to be the one being vocal but as as mys report basically says you know do want to step on anyones toes the last time North Carolina played in this building after they lost and they got blown out honestly Amo Bott called out his team talking about how much he loved the University of North Carolina and how they had to be better right now Hubert Davis doesnt have anyone on his roster that will do that maybe it is Ian Jackson but I OB I dont know that its healthy not to have someone whos going to step up like that you figure one guy or or a couple of guys certainly the older guys might be you know more vocal than anybody else but that was surprising to here that he didnt have one guy he could rely on like an arm B yeah and he took some time to think about it and one of the things when you consider that of course RJ Davis reigning ACC Player of the Year you would expect what to be that guy but thats just not his personality it is in Jacksons personality and it may have to come from the Freshman yeah had a whistle with 11 minutes to go in the half by the way neither RJ Davis or Hunter Sal have scored in this game two heavyweight scorers 17 a game for RJ Salis at 20 points a game and a number two scorer in the conference both Chile at the outset and this is a team that RJ Davis has had a tremendous amount of success against but its also a different wake Force Team defensively as you see Davis have to make a take a tough shot there unable to get it to go hes only 29 from the threepoint line Carolina just 33 as a team wake only makes 29 from three hild attacking and hell go to the line as he hits the deck the senior out of Worthing England he a very good foul shooter wake is the only ACC school this season to have two different players score 30 in a game Hildreth got 31 against Miami Salis got 30 against Stanford and one of the areas of concern for w force is they have to heavily rely on both hildr and sales to provide the offense those two guys in their win at Virginia Tech scored a combin 45 points again so when you consider that these are the two guys that theyre getting the majority of the offense from theres no one truly creating plays for others nothing more exemplary than that but right now Wake Forest has zero assists and six turnovers already so they thats the one area of concern for Coach Forbes is no one creates opportunities for others Washington picked up his second foul for Carolina hes on the bench but weight creeping a little bit closer so our Stars to watch so far have been really cold its fitting though sure single digits outside my goodness getting it downstairs and collapsing on defense Wake Forest with the rejection is hildr great job by Salis denying that opportunity though I mean again Hunter Sal talked to us about the fact that its they put a lot of work in this summer and a different defensive mentality for Coach Forbes group theyre holding teams to under 40 field goal shooting this season they get a lot of deflections a lot of Steels wait for his does to spin by H and rejected right out of the sky Luben getting up there and saying no no no shot clock down to five Cameron hild attacking the basket the nice spin but Vin Allen Luben coming over a little bit of contact there with that left forearm now Ws got to be quick here on the inbound of Salis shot clock down to two he will drive it in the fall away and he makes one if youre Hubert Davis and Hunter Sal has to make plays like that to get his first points of the game youll live with that shooting over two North Carolina Defenders to get a contested twopoint shot thats fine for North Carolina defensively but good to see Hunter Alis on the board Withers going strong and a whistle 932 and an offensive foul on Withers his first Hunter Sal as the shot clock is going down just makes a great individual play using his size to shoot over the smaller guard able to knock down his first bucket of the evening so wake with the opportunity to tie the game see if Salis is getting rolling now after that short jumper pow on him Harris getting downstairs off the side of that backboard this is where Carolina so dangerous Jackson going up and slams it down I didnt even know it was that dangerous I knew it was dangerous hild and a whistle spectacular dunk by Ian Jackson at 64 getting high in the sky Ian Jackson we talked about dangerous Ian Jackson elevating over the top of Salis who just blocked a shot on one end on the defensive end this time no chance going up against The elitely Talented freshman Mercy foul here by Luma to put h at the line he sinks the first one that was one of the better dunks of the Season okay now we look at this and weve had the conversation before myin meaf has been involved do you put this dunk over the Cooper flag dunk against Pittsburgh OB you were there on the call for both Ill take this one Ill take this one right here that that was special well lets put it this way they were both special they were both spectacular 64 heres kads been on a hot streak 10 points to lead all scorers and Takes a Tumble as hes tripped Applause up and slow to rise here the sophomore from New Jersey getting back on his feet man has he been active yes he has kadoo has been in attack mode already 10 points from him an efficient four of five from the field one of two from Beyond the threepoint Arc and has three assist to zero turnovers so you have to say that he has been the Catalyst for what North Carolinas been able to do offensively here this evening rebound comes out high and another foul at 843 to go in half number one okay Tyson in the game 67 junr for North Carolina but this one goes against Parker Frederickson for Wake then time to shoot one and one Tyson to the line and with a lot of time left in the half Tyson had one standout game against L back in December he put in 23 but has not scored more than three points in any game since and again the the raise of level has been different but whats so different OB is when youre the guy at a lower level school and then you come to a North Carolina and now youre you know a piece youre a role player theres a difference in your level of confidence you know Hunter Sal talked about about his confidence when coming from gonzago where he wasnt much of a factor to being at w Force but he was the guy his confidence skyrocketed from that pal went for a reverse but he was shut down so Carolina on top 1950 hildor looking inside Rickson can hit the threepointer that one rolls away but itll stay right on the S and now J Davis who took a bit of a blow is coming back on returns Carina and with Jaylen Washington getting in the foul trouble claw getting minutes right now really is that third big for the tar Hills V Allen Luben on the bench as well so claw getting minutes and making his presence fell on the defensive end Johnson around the back hes scuffled beyond the threepoint line so hes going to take a twopointer but its going to be offensive foul on Johnson so thatll be his second personal sophomore out of Brooklyn and the Louisville Transfer and now Salis who also got a breather back on Hunter Salis was just named ACC player of the week last year First Team all ACC and with Johnson getting that second foul now Hunter Salis has to go back to the point guard position where he started the majority of the beginning of the season and struggled offensively until they kind of got him off the ball as we SP speak about struggling offensively the ACC Player of the Year RJ Davis gets his first basket on the evening determined move and another foul on the drive OB Ive been waiting for this media timeout because we get the show we know about Captain Jack lets call him Captain dangerous from here on out look out high he gets above the square and finishing strong so nice we had to see it Music Thrice in Winston Salem where North Carolina leads Wake Forest 21 15 after that Ian Jackson dunk on what felt like generations of weight Forest players Chris Paul probably felt that but Ian Jackson told me that he is always trying to get better he texts Huber Davis every single night and he ask him how do I get better and Hubert Davis responds this is how you get better he gives him advice he says sometimes he texts him and he doesnt get a response to the following morning because Huberts asleep but Ian said he is constantly looking for feedback and information on how he can continue to grow his game fellas so the the message this time from Hubert was how about when you play weight tomorrow a sensational eye popping dunk that everyone will be talking about for the following week I I think that was that was a great information great advice and well received by Ian Jackson but myin one of the reasons why he doesnt is because he texts him at 1230 am every night and Hubert toldy said you know its always exact and he says coach Davis and Hubert responds player Jackson how can I get better just that another and Hubert loves it and again when you look at this team who is in me of honestly a energy lead a vocal leader ianos could absolutely be that as he mentioned tomor he doesnt want to step on toes but I mean this is Big Boy basketball sometimes it has to happen at this level it was trying to slice through but another foul in the paint with 715 to go had a lot of whistles here in the last seven or eight minutes the foul against Carolina those are piling up for the Tar Heels you know and and to add to that RJ Davis all americ the season ago AC play Year OB he would not mind at all with Ian Jackson coming in being the vocal leader of this team because he understands that thats not who he is its not his personality hes not going to f that now from an example standpoint the way you have to defend the way you have to play for North Carolina RJ Davis can absolutely be that but when it comes to being a leader on the court RJ would have zero problem with in being the vocal guy 217 hild with to shoot again the tough hard noose guard excellent Defender too and hes had a good half with nine I love watching C play he gets after on both ends of the floor just gave a souvenir to someone off the floor throwing off his tape I believe but doesnt stop him from getting after defending Elliot K as hes taken on that roll now after kadoo got hot and a blocking foul here against wake in the paints and itll go against Harris as Claude is able to come in Harris steps in but the difference is you have to have both of your feet set before I mean well before theres any contact I believe the Harris was still moving in it is very difficult to be a secondary Defender and get an offensive foul in todays game and thats by Design clud missing on the front end and again wake for us with an opportunity to tie heres Spillers on the high Applause post Salis trying to work draws two Defenders shot clock inside 10 hris again with it shoulder down spins around cant stick it spers will give him a second Applause effort Salis attacking again with the fall away and no just not much fallen for him so far tonight but they continue to attack and thats the thing that you have to love about the Demon Deacons regardless as to how was gone shooting the basketball right now Hunter Salas one of seven but he continues to try to get in the painted area hes not jacking up threes and those are shots that eventually will go down for Sals Applause Tyson thought about it be on the threepoint line working on Frederickson now he will lift it and missed ugly weve seen a few of those tonight frankly by both teams but that was a settle shot that was because FR was doing the job defensively and in Tysons space not allowing him to be comfortable and Tyson decided to settle on that one and takes a very tough shot hey coming up Thursday number five LSU take number two South Carolina thats at 800 eastern time in womens college basketball the game day crew makes their first stop of the Season at Colonial Life Arena in Columbia at 7 on ESPN ESPN plus and Disney plus now Tai claw picking up a foul so his second foul hell go have a seat and James Brown the fourth Center will come in for Carolina right now Hubert Davis going deep into his bench Brown has only played in four of the ACC games to this point Claude had only played in one and right now so youve got brown and Tyson on the floor together and Seth Trimble coming back on two for Hubbert Davis H by the way with 10 points for w Forest Music Applause G do on the drive and kick hell swing it for Davis wide open got it RJ Davis with his second made field goal and more importantly a three thats where hes really struggled throughout this season not even at 30 right now even though hes climbing the charts amongst ACC great shooting the three put it out had a great game as Fredericks and lip cant connect Davis had a great game against W Forest last year with 36 and you know how fast he can heat up as we approach the 5minute mark in the first half Davis wants to drive it heres the kick for triple too strong its one thing you can say about RJ Davis he hasnt worried about his own hes continued to try to make plays for his teammates as well as assist numbers are up even though his scorings been down a bit Salis again yes nice FY touch four points for Hunter Salis and getting to the midrange the the two shots that hes made are probably the toughest shots hes had to take throughout this game both fadeaways from each side way down that one clangs away by Jackson again with that left shoulder now but it misses Jackson to the open floor thats been incredible already tonight Airborne off the window what a tough angle but a smart play by Ian Jackson as he sees Cameron Hilder getting back wanting to take that charge and is able to avoid it going to the Sid still taking the contact finishing off the glass Jackson with Applause seven along with one of the great dunks of the Applause Season Salis again with a quick dribble knocks down another one hes starting to get rolling but there going to get Spillers for the foul after the bucket but Obie remember we talked about those are the shots that were used to see Hunter Salis make he continues to get in the painted area has knocked down two in a row to get the Demon Deacons within three ke looking forward to you guys at halftime foul trouble really something to look at the rest of the way here at 350 to go in the half North Carolina has four guys with two Wake Forest has three guys with two yeah its been everyone up front seems to have gotten into foul trouble throughout this game and so this ones going to have a lot to do with the guards and what theyre able to do during their time on the court and thats an advantage to North Carolina although Hunter Salis and Cameron Hiller make up a great backourt there are four guys in North Carolina to give them an advantage so some of the bigs are going have to get back into this and make a difference way for good hits second in 2723 the heels and a press and once again out of the made free throws an opportunity to get some pressure on just token pressure to see if they get an early turnover and slow down weight force and then get back defensively Hunter Salis all of a sudden has that look in his eyes hit a couple of midrange Applause shots again drawing double teams Frederickson downstairs for Spillers trying to operate lost the handle got it back sticks it in and he can be the Difference Maker because it has the ability to be able to score on the Block but also defend the rim SPS could be a difference for the demon that third score that they need Sal with a pull up long range Music no and the tap will be controlled back to kdo heres Davis hes going to fire it in and out got a wide open look theres quickly back into the paint plucked away BR got a hand on it heres Trimble lifting up high and it rolls off the 10 the second effort and a traveling violation the fifth turnover for the tar Hills which matches their game from Saturday where they had a season low but how about for the Demon Deacons seven turnovers but Obi I dont know that Ive ever seen a of basketball where a team does not have one assist they dont have an assist yet now they come into this game only a plus three on the season 210 assists to 207 turnovers an ACC play plus one 72 to 71 which now you would have to consider them a 6 with a 0 to7 ratio here tonight so about two and 1 half before halftime more heavy contact thatll go the other way Applause 2725 North Carolina and coming up ACC mens basketball on Wednesday weve got Syracuse and little John taking on Clemson thatll be followed by Florida State squaring off against Cal that is Wednesday ACC basketball Applause Davis on Salas and knocked Away by North Carolina another turnover thats six for the heels season recap two AP ranked teams right now because Louisville has gotten into the top 25 Duke the number two team in the country yeah we heard Kevin teasing what Louisville is doing at SMU right now going to be interesting to see because youre talking about two of the better teams in the league but got to give r a tremendous amount of credit for the bounce back pacs get giving those guys this season Salis on the dribble from the foul line and no one and done I believe that was blocked by Drake pal hes showing off his defensive PR here throughout this game a beautiful play on the steel oh thats a dime you got to shoot that OB yeah decided not to Jackson batted away and a clean theft Salis going one on three and tipped out off of North Music Applause Carolina and back on for the Demon Deacons Trayvon Spillers they get the 67 senior back on the floor here for the last minute and a half and a shove on the inbounds c a lock lot of fouls in this first half its been pretty darn physical yeah its been physical and it hasnt been clean basketball neither of the teams handling the basketball extremely well but Hubert Davis no but heres the thing though as he gets upset you got to give Hubert David tremendous amount of credit because he takes his glasses off first and then he puts them he places them on the score table and then he goes off so now youll see him go back and get his glasses relatively soon but when hes upset he doesnt want to have his glasses on and you know thats a lot of selfc constraint by by right now hes still steaming yeah so hes not going to put it back on that might get foged up hild with another one got it so here we are 2727 and again both these teams have to feel good about where they are because neither team has played well to this point but could not convert on the bank shot as H puts the glasses back on hes calmed down a little bit now beyond the Applause three W Forest has been trailing most of this half hildr will lift and he cant hit the triple On The Run Davis knock it wait lefthanded yes hell lay in love that attack by RJ Davis just 101 he and Hunter sales is able to get to the rim use the opposite hand for the bucket Dallas on Music Davis 45 before halftime all the way to the Baseline lifting up no whistle Davis saves it allj Davis drives it and a foul and this is one of the areas where RJ Davis was so special a season too it was getting to the free throw line and you see hes staying in attack mode right now attacking in transition not not worrying about the jump shot and settling for threes gets to the basket gets fouled gets to the free throw line of course where hes North Carolinas alltime free throw percentage leader and continuing to try to add to that throughout his career so to the line at 87 Huber Davis he told us he was great but he doesnt have to play tonight but OB he is definitely expending some energy over there on the side lot and Davis drops in number one we it 25 fouls in this first half so thick with whistles for you and I this is nothing after the foul Fest we watched in College Station Texas a week and a half ago where there were 88 foul shots taken in a game that didnt go overtime foul we had a double technical here car two James Brown so one James Brown haris and the other on Juke Harris and Wake Forest you got the two freshman getting the double Applause technical so 352 to go OB neither are in the game did that happen as they were checking out was there something said to each other I believe that might be true cu haris headed to the bench and he mentioned Brown as well another one coming here for Davis might have been off that foul shot and he sinks it so North Carolina by Applause four so have had a little bit of everything the technicals off setting and heres to a second half without so many whistles Frederickson hild trying to attack and tapped Away by North Carolina lets go back to that Double T oh there it is but he was speaking to Hunter Sal thats not juk Harris they pick up Harris saying that should have heres hildr with two on the shot clock a fall away yes he hits a twopointer fou with a heave but that would not have counted anyway and we are at halftime with North Carolina on top 31 to 20s making a run at it as well I think its a pretty fair debate I want to see him again underway here in the second half and lets see if the caliber play gets a little better well it does right away on the Slam by Washington as he elevates off the alley great execution to start the half for the tar Hills getting Jaylen Washington back on the floor missed the majority of it with the two fouls but Hubert Davis has to love the execution on play number one ild bouncing downstairs getting it inside for re and a basket how about the response from Steve Forbes and Fon Reed going inside early getting a bucket Reed who got some foul trouble many guys did right away heres Jackson from the corner and a rebound right to Hunter Salis Salis began to heat up with some midrange jumpers right at the end of the first half OB Hunter Salas and Cameron hild and matching three of 11 from the field I believe kadoo got a piece of that one its hard for me to imagine that Salis was shot a wide open airball like that I thought could got a piece of that one now North Carolina comes away with it tonights game track is brought to you by eade from Morgan Stanley Davis averaging 17 nine so far tonight heres pow the launch he got a really good look neither of these teams shoot it particularly well Salis at 20 points a game only six so far and Wake Forest was able to play the entire first half without an assist yeah got their first assist here start the second half Im not sure Ive seen that in the game before OB where a team just absolutely gets zero assist you dont have to really work that hard to get one right almost by accident yes pal rifles the pass out so thatll be eight turnovers for the heels they lead by two there was no representative from the L standing by ready to whisk that first half out to the gallery and hang it it was pretty ugly at Music times L Forest last lead by the way it was 53 heres Spillers back off for Johnson who came in averaging only five a game and they kick it back but thats just a tough pass for Johnson understanding that F Reed had not even established post position so jayen washingon has the freedom to be able to run right in this steing that that P Kau splits The Defenders and SWOT it away Wake Forest a couple of times able to do that Spillers and Reed and spillers got the hand on it and but to watch as eff Reed gets there it was never a time that he got a chance to establish post position Tyler Johnson trying to throw that basketball and lead him but Reed had never even gotten the body on Washington allowing Washington to be able to come over get the easy steal four to get off a shot Davis denied one to get off a shot hell launch that one and rebounded by Reed Salis looking for a blow by left is short Davis the other way with a full head of steeve RJ great job by F Reed staying vertical on that possession sure did hen lost it and a whistle with 17 18 to go in the contest just havent seen the star show up yet tonight Salis and Davis you know Id love to get mys take on this because we talked with Hunter Silas earlier and he was talking about games like this are the games that you dream of it gives you an opportunity to be a to put your team in a position to play in NCA tournament Im wondering if Hunters put a little too much thought process into this game Reed rolling to the 10 and slaming that one down here has six so back to even Ethan Reed making his presence felt here got in early foul trouble in the first half trying his best to stay on the floor here throughout this second half and be productive off the fingertips that is out of play off Washington you see the Post Feed Reed has a run and then immediately finds the camera after the Finish allowing everyone at home to realize now hes showing up the play made the first took the first half off 86 rebounds a game for the sevenfooter out of Richmond Applause Virginia hand off for Salis trying to get by Davis and thatll roll out and thats the type of play you want to see from Hunter sales using that 6 fo five frame going up against a much smaller guard but using the physicality to be able to give Advantage at a rim been a long time since wake had the lead Salis with eight pull up by Davis swishes that one in thats how RJ Davis has Hur wake force in the past getting to the midrange and knocking down a bunch of twos we saw him do that a season ago Johnson over the shoulder Reed with a long one too strong good fought with the bigs heres the pass and laid up and in on a sweet run Davis for two North Carolina in transition is where theyre at their best thats a beautiful F from Elliot Kad getting RJ Davis an easy one now Davis backto back Music Applause Music buckets Music Salis Davis on his hip keeps on moving and backs it out once again Hunter Sal is getting to his spot recognizing that RJ Davis once he gives him a little bit of body knocks him off balance he can shoot right over the top now Davis and Sal playing with some at two oh beautiful five and a big time Slam by Luben the seventh dime already by Elliot Kad hes been in double figures a number of times this season he started the game off scoring but now hes finding his teammates last two or three minutes more like it huh yeah this is the basketball we were expecting from these two teams coming in with such great offensive stars ild with another turnar around loves that move lots of iron but itll drop for him but look how quickly Carina goes back at you you cannot rest e forbs told us earlier that you got to get guys back makes misses it does not matter when youre playing against the tar Hills you got to make sure you get back in your defensive transition ild with the Music personal spending time at number one Tennessee was the number six right now taking on Auburn our Sonic Blockbuster on Saturday at 830 on ESPN Big Time match up no Janai broom but you consider Chaz air coming in fourth in the SEC in scoring going up against the Rival and the reason theres a rivalry there of course thats the Bruce Pearl game you got to remember Bruce Pearl was a legend coaching at Tennessee now doing it the alltime wins leader at Auburn boy it is a cold night to be outside and beond the threepoint line inside here as to see Wake Forest 0 for eight beyond the threepoint line North Carolina now three for 18 after that Miss ouch North Carolina I believe only made five threes in their loss on Saturday five of 18 from Beyond the arch so theyve been struggling to shoot the basketball from three may need to take a page out of the book of The Demon Deacons to attack the paint Johnson driving it leading in shot and a big rebound by Luben FDO is not going to wait quickly on the other end Tribble went for the rebound lost the handle now Scramble for it in the paint still no whistle and now a late one possession would go to the other end of the floor with 1404 to go theyre still fighting still fighting and Ron gr and Doug shs and Paul cells going in to break it up now the big football game was last night but the difference is when you see Fon Reed go to the ground forgive me that Spillers with the basketball hes on his back which means the ball is still exposed Elliot Kad going after it and even though North Carolina does not get the possession they get the arrow going back so flipping that arrow is always going to be important great job by the officiating group getting in the mix of Ron gr right in the bottom of the pile so w trying to grab the lead tied to Applause 39 Johnson long pass heres Spillers to left got it with the three and they finally hit one we talked about his ability to stretch the floor no better time for Spillers than knock down his first three then to give the Demon Deacons the lead K trible round the back did a good job keeping in that foot down but couldnt hit the shot so now wake trying to build on the Slender lead got a mismatch with Davis trying to go Spiller on the interior H good look no missed Opportunity by the DEA deacons Hunter Sal looked at it early but when it wasnt there they didnt work to get the ball inside but North Carolina ends up turning it over giving it right back to the de theyve kicked it back 10 times Applause tonight Drake po The Freshman is back on now for North Carolina coming off the bench by far hes been their best threepoint man at 41 and Trimble will get a Applause rest weight coming in 14 and four they have a five game winning streak theyre nine and0 at home won five in a r ACC for the first time since Applause 0405 Reed handing off for Salis Sal again packed house here Winston Salem and with n seconds on the shot clock to reach by Davis to commit the foul OB Ive been here before when I may have made a play on the court that my coach didnt like getting this look coming off the floor is not good hu Davis still dapping up Seth tremble but he was absolutely not happy with the play of tremble on the last possession and Steve Forbes cant be happy with what he just saw from Hunter sales shooting the three from the wing wide right did not touch a thing and the crowd coming to life in support of the Demon Deacons heres Davis to fire once again good looking shot off the hand got a great look Elliot kdo is creating opportunities for his teammates as he turns that one over he lost it Johnson HRI banging with pal trying to muscle his way into main he did for two and then makes the jester saying that Drake pal whos about 3 to 4 in taller than Hil is too small so wake has their biggest lead of the game at Five K over for the corner pow a rainbow no h with another rebound and and the tie turning right now anyway in wakes favor they have the momentum but wake force is used to having success in this building against Carolina theyve won the last three here by a margin of 15 plus so when you consider Cameron hilers has never lost to North Carolina on this floor Eon Reed out of the double Johnson from the corner a line drive triple and its a 10 run for wake and its its a timeout North Carolina well OB we knew that the first half could not go as poorly as it did in the second half so we knew we were going to see some action on this second half and we have absolutely gotten it from the Demon Deacons so just over 11 minutes to go and W for is coming alive offensively I mean this took 12 seconds before hildr got that shot in the air you talk about a guy who worked for it and earned lead up by 8 with 11 minutes to go for Carolina North Carolina has not scored the last 4 minutes and 6 seconds of action so when you consider wake for is not only getting the job done offensively theyve locked in defensively as well Ty Hills looking for a hot hand Davis up to set of screen Jackson Jackson will fire it up and around it out but thats a settle shot OB coming out of a timeout Im sure Hubert Davis had something in mind he his team to be able to run Im not sure that it starts I mean it ends with Ian Jackson catching in the corner facing up and just shooting a settle Music three Johnson with a bounds for hildr whos been the top scorer tonight for Wake Johnsons open cant cash it in re punched it out Salis with Applause another OB right now wake Force has an eightpoint lead with Cam hild in Sal is combining for 10 of 31 from the field and 0 of nine from three Carolina needs a smart shot Pals Music open and they have gone over 5 minutes without a Point North Carolina now three of 22 from Beyond The Arc so neither of these teams have been shooting the basketball great however wake Force has to like where they are right now not shooting well but getting the job done on the defensive end hbert told us today he expects this team will shoot the ball better hes surprised they have not not in a game for the whole season Salis on the bounce gets two more and its up to 10 for Wake Forest what think for certain Hunter Sal Camry Hill theyre not going to stop theyre not concerned about what the numbers look like theyre going to do everything they can to try to help their team win this game pow left to shoot it and swishes it in Dr wild freshman out of Pittsboro North Carolina at 17 against SMU so he can score absolutely at McDon all Amer big time player and also playing really out of position right now hes not a power forward but really playing more of the four spot right now with a small lineup for the tah and a turnover and a reach by Salis hell commit the foul to slow down Koo thatll be his second W Forest on on top 49 41 under nine to Music go an incredible story out of California can still do some Music good dumping it downstairs and a quick strike for Luben and the second time weve seen Carolina go to that action getting the easy bucket for Luben off of a stagger screen and thats the type of execution I believe Hubert Davis wants to see especially for team coming out of a Applause timeout H trying to return in favor inside for Reed its going to be knocked out of play by Carolina with just over eight minutes to go in a lowc scoring Affair here in Winston Salem then Wake Forest from the corner to put it in HTH looking for somebody up top here for Johnson shot clock of factor down to six hell drive it Reed lays it up and in great job by Tyler Johnson recognizing as the Defenders went to block his shot dropping it off allowing e Reed to get the easy one a wake without an assist in the first half thats pretty amazing but five in the second half Davis gets a good clean look and a three and they need that one badly they absolutely did and they need to get their ACC Player of the Year candidate going here in this second half and really the second half of the Season it has not been the type of season RJ Davis was expecting coming in nor that we were expecting of him over 2400 points in his career in Carolina Salis seems to be hunting for a little contact heres Spillers too strong Applause and a window opening up here for the tar Hills behind Davis 5146 Applause week dubert Davis was hopping mad about something Canó straight on got it and rattles home a couple of big shots here for the heels he wanted Elliot Kau to come over and set a screen on the big so that they could get it ball screen action going with RJ Davis but all that matters it ends up in the hands of Elliot Kau and he made good and made it a twopoint game Music tell them again Sean let them know forget about what those numbers say w Forest had a 10point lead when it was 4939 Carolina went over 5 minutes without a basket since then they have a 10 two run and thats been the difference in this game Elliot Kau making plays with his passing also with his scoring throughout this game and Im with sea P shoot his got shoot as well you should be hes a very bright young man hilds on the attack scoop and no but hell be headed to the Line North Carolinas played in so many close ones Saturday another one they got away as they lost 7271 look at these and you know obviously some terrific opponents there Kansas was number one at the time Michigan States outstanding that was a threepoint loss but then not winning the game thats the kicker five and three and you know in those one possession games right now but its not against the teams that they need some now the UCLA win was a very good win for for the tar Hills but when you consider their schedule throughout this year y day was always test his team with a very tough schedule so that is never going to be in question but they have it won many of those matchups versus the ranked teams so far this year not enough of them you know youre five and three in one possession games do sound so bad but Hubers like I want to be eight and0 absolutely well I mean again that Hubert is extremely competitive weve seen him on the sidelines throughout this game a very soft spoken mild mannered person but hes an elite competitor and he wants to win every time out sure was there a player over the top its Luben for the stuff but the execution from North Carolina really since they went through that they are now starting to carve way force apart theyre getting everything they want right at The Rim Kad is staying in the painted area so the action is picked up for the Char heels offensively K T assist Hill take it a tumble no whistle there he just slipped Salis gives it up Johnson trying to take the Baseline thats a difficult shot on a Tribble and it rolls out so Carolina again with a full head of steam tar Hills can Tire Take the Lead its Kad driving it lost it and a rejection Again by Spillers back for Salas Sal trying to spin and draws a foul in the paint so thatll go against kdo is second early in the game a lot of guys were creeping toward foul trouble but theyve done a good job playing with those fouls but one of the things thats happened in the second half OB weve seen a lot of is guys going to the basket looking for fouls trying to get fouls and the second half hasnt been called the same way theyve allowed a little more contact to happen throughout this second half and guys looking for fouls have often F themselves with Miss opportunities easy opportunities or turnover well I asked you in halftime is it the officials or is it the players you said its a lot of both but the players really have to adapt thats it you got to understand the way the game is being called and adjust to it B bang on Target by Withers jayen Withers and North Carolina surging here and they have grabbed the lead again with five minutes to go big bucket by jayen Withers right there stepping up and giving the tar Hills the lead right back and huba Dav is leaning on his veteran and Withers now in his fifth year to make a play so now they get nervous here Winston Salem H withth again into the body of dribble and fires it up no rebound up and in by Spillers that has been the Achilles heel of the tar Hills throughout this season giving up offensive rebound Second Chance points the numbers havent been great for the Demon Deacons thats the only the eight offensive board but yet a damaging one withs couldnt make it two for two wake by one and the ball under four and a half to go and in the heart of the ACC tonight Wake Forest looking for their 15th win dumped off for Reed the cut spells with a slam screaming in from the basine for the dun great find by F Reed to be able to find Spillers who didnt settle and wait for the basketball to come along the threepoint line he made something happen OB t is looking for an answer down by three Kad hitting the deck taken away by Johnson no whistle lays it up and draws the foul now kadoo trying to slice The Defenders to gasty Tumble no whistle screen of roll action getting the basketball to Fon Reed in the middle of the paint the nice F from Sal even nicer find from Fon Reed to Spillers who finishes off with the Highlight slam SVP thank you my friend yes it is heated up here the last five or six minutes play has certainly been elevated it absolutely has and you got to if youre going to be on SVP later talking highlights you absolutely have to elevate your play Scott man pel in Atlanta last night for the national championship game back in studio today talking t the Tiger Golf League hes all over the place theres no stopping him and another guy Tyler hansbro no stopping him with his spectacular career number one alltime scorer in North Carolina working a little tarel radio Johnson at the line how about RJ Davis number two all time now in scoring at the University of North K in four and a half Seasons MH and still no shot of catching Tyler hbor who did it in Five Seasons still about 4 to 500 points ahead of Applause Music RJ Kido back for tremble Ks had a great game dishing the basketball but how about that acrobatic shot thatll fall in for Trimble and Trimble not going to be denied on that possession he was set on getting into the painted area and was able to do so and then able to find his way off the glass well but so were coming down the stretch with three minutes to go Reed rolling hard and a block got it back laid it up draws the foul Washington got the first one commits the foul on the second and thatll be his third and the crowd Here Wanting a go CH however I thought that was a great block by jayen Washington but give Fon Reed a lot of credit for sticking to it Washington bumped off catches that at his height that is a great block but Fon Reed sticking with it getting it back and then the pump fake to draw the foul good no call 258 to go re at the line 66 and all net on the first one Reed playing for his third School in Wake also at LSU and Gonzaga before that he was teammates with Hunter Salis at Gonzaga Hunter was involved in the recruitment process to get epon Reed here Hunter was already decided to come to W Force when Fon Reed decided to visit so Hunter got involved in the recruiting and theyve been a pretty forward combination for the last two seasons here in West 131 Zone defensively from weit back out for G Trimble Davis wants to shoot it way downt Reed plucks away the rebound and caral it thats a great rebound by E Reed was able to hold off Wasington with his right arm and still be able to gather it with his left to finish the defensive possession Wake Forest needs a win with some impact this would qualify tonight 27 to go Salis harassed back for Reed shot clock at Applause seven hildr heres Salis to drive the Fall Away got it he has 14 how about Hunter Sal the patience and the Poise knowing the shot clock was going down but also recognizing he had more than enough time to get to his spot the kick Jackson too strong rebound comes to Hill W comes away with another one 6256 the Demon Deacons and they can take some time running some clock under 90 seconds to Applause play Reed pass is tipped away nearly stolen but Salis picks it up for Spillers and another block underneath and a whistle now theyre going to look at this one and see if thats goal tending but there was a foul underneath and Ron gr signaling that they will take a look at that one to see if this will be one free throw to try to complete a threepoint play or if it will be two shots now once again Washington rising up and Spiller saying count that basket take another look the foul is on the outside you see as Washington comes over thats the first block which was a clean block but here Elliot Kau has an arm in on Spiller I believe that foul went to kadoo Washington feeling as though he gets a good block on that Music possession now youre right about the foul on kdo 64 56 thats three on kdo as they take a look I think its a good block I believe the ball has reached his Peak but its not coming down going to be interesting what they come back with and I couldnt see what did they call on the floor OB do you know what was called well K was hit with a foul but as far as it Go the call of basket interference stands so they called it interference call of Golding stands W farest one shot in which the ball was at its peak so Im not sure if it was coming down or not but not enough evidence to overturn what the call was on the floor thats why it was important to be able to see what the call was I dont think there was evidence either way to be able to overturn it its also one shot here as Spillers will be at the line one more look great angle here and its at its peak so again if you want to say that thats on the way down so be it but I dont think theres enough evidence either way to be able to determine or to overturn what was actually called on the floor its a huge play and hes at the line Spillers to shoot one time with a minute 18 to go and connects to make it 6556 this is a 122 run by Wake Forest at the end of the game and Steve forb has really changed this game by going with the 131 Zone boy re did a great job staying home on that and not lungy to commit a foul the fans are open in full throats here in Winston Salem leading 6556 and very patiently running time off the clock 46 seconds to go a loose ball collected by Carolina as K went down for it Tribble on the other end lays it up in in no foul but a timeout with 393 to go and we will take the break 30 seconds right back to Winston Salem Applause Music Applause he 39 seconds to go wake for is down the stretch well they have grabbed the lead here and a couple of big calls have gone their way and it hasnt been a pretty game W for shooting 40 from the floor North Carolina just over 38 however for Steve Forbes if you can win a game shooting 40 against the Tar Heels you will absolutely take it each and every time well no question about that so 393 left W Forest trying to win their sixth consecutive game pass just got to re they break it dos it over the top you dont need it right there Steve for just got his hands on his head Davis off the window for two you cant try to make that play at that time bring it back out run the clock the Highlight is not worth it theyre going to take a look at the clock here as Paul sells immediately went over to the monitor with Doug sha 25 one showing and a fivepoint lead for the Demon Deacons as Steve Forbes tries to eek out a victory over arrival in front of a packed house tonight here in Winston Salem and Coach Forbes trying to keep his cool right now after watching Tyler Johnson Tred to throw the lob after the basket the clock continued to run 254 on the game clock all right so it goes to 254 and Cameron hild with the 64 senior to get it in and immediately they get a foul epon Reed who only shoots 66 at the line but L really good last time down but great foul by RJ Davis right there the committing the foul and then trying to go with the track just in case its not called but very little time going off the clock eight seconds so re to the line its a one and one for Applause him and the first one from the Music sevenfooter and hes look very smooth here late in the game when hes had to hit him and after Reed is had a productive second half for for the Demon Deacons five of six from excuse me five of five from the free throw line 11 points for him an efficient three of five from the field read second fin the money again weigh by seven gó back for Jackson Davis steps and launches to Strong itll stay on this end with 138 to go North Carolina ball North Carolina losing a heartbreaker on their home floor at Chapel Hill on Saturday figured theyd have a battle right now to the bloody end here tonight and another timeout Doug shs going to go over and see make sure they got possession under two minutes you can look to see who the basketball went off of and from the replay that we saw on the Jumbotron here that could very well go back to the Demon Music Deacons V looked as though Vin Allen Ls hand may have been the last one on it love to get a look at it on ier up here here we go as it comes off the glass Cameron hilden V Allen Luben involved but does luans left hand touch that last on the way out looked like it did on that one on that angle and lets see if they agree take another oh this will be a great aim shout out to our camera crew look at the left hand of Luben is that the last one on the basketball that is a great View and it was called North Carolinas basketball on the floor there may be enough evidence on that one to overturn it and give the basketball to out b stand Carolina ball just stick with Carolina I guess Im 0 for Tuesday right now still got time we get almost 14 seconds yeah to get another one right so itll be Kad to put it Music in heres Washington swishes it in a threepointer in a Timeout and he can make those thats the thing he hasnt shot the B that may be his first make of the Season yeah he had been 0 for 10 from three but Hubert Davis has been encouraging him to take shots because he can make them let me tell you who else knows about his shooting ability Steve Forbes he told his pregame he said I watched this young man shoot as a freshman he did not miss granted was in warmups Etc but again he talked about his shooting touch as Jaya Wasington knocks down his first three of the season to make it a fourpoint game so theres our reset Wake Forest with the ball North Carolina has the possession arrow Wake Forest has two timeouts Carolina spent their last one so right now for North Carolina of course you have to pressure see if you get a quick turnover if not you foul immediately but give the Demon Deacons a lot of credit 84 from the free throw line 21 of 25 throughout this game they havent shot the basketball well at all only two of 15 for three but theyve taken care of business at the free throw strike and thats been the difference between the two teams throughout this game yeah theyve actually been one of the better foul shooting teams in the conference 75 even better than that as you point out tonight theyve made him when theyve had to make them 117 to go and Wake Forest up by four with the ball and trying to squeeze out a victory here tonight against North Carolina a loss for the Tar Heels would drop them to 12 and8 on the season W Forest looking to approve to 15 and four but work to be done but this would be a step in the right direction for Wake Forest theyve got a tough schedule upcoming would love to start it off with this one who are they going to get theyre going to get the do I Music believe yeah he foued Hunter Salis thats number Applause four so heres the thing Obi you dont necessarily want to send Hunter Sal to the free throw line but its not a bad F because theres no time running off the clock so kadoo tries to wrap up tries to wrap up Salis as you see gets the hands around his back and then goes down to make it look as though sales pushes off but but when its all said and done 117 remaining no time goes off the clock those are the way you want to be able to foul Sal misses the front end of the one and one and a reach and a foul by Johnson the slow down could go with 83 to play and I understand what coach Forbes is doing right here because they have bows to give so you dont want to allow North Carolina to get a good look from three especially you can kill more time by fouling and making it to where its only an opportunity for them to get one shot off therefore the three doesnt hurt you as long as you dont foul there still 3D give this is where I believe in in college basketball they should Implement a couple of the NBA rules one of them being if you foul and the ball has not been inbounded you immediately get one one shot and the ball back the same thing would happen with Elliot kdo on the last possession however also any foul you only get two fouls in the last two minutes after that second foul youre going to shoot free throw you mentioned this the upcoming schedule and why tonight is so big on its own Duke comes to town here on Saturday well have that for you on ESPN and then they go to Louisville who just got into the top 25 for the first time this season a vastly improved Louisville Cardinal team and if I heard correctly over the PA here Louisville was putting a hurting on SMU 45 to 20 at halftime so Louisville playing its best basketball of the Season as you mentioned jumping into the top 25 great job by the cards resurging in the ACC this season officials again over at the monitor with Steve forb scheduled very aggressively outside the ACC playing Florida Xavier Michigan Texas AM hoping an elusive CAA tournament bid would land Winston Winston Salem come March we shall see theyve reset the clock to Applause 88 kot inbound Jackson deep in the corner and knocked Away by hildr 72 to go and great Hands by Cameron hildr he wants them to go look and see if that basketball actually went off of Ian Jackson Applause Washington turns fires no not this time Salis draws the foul with 34 Applause left they just missed one on the other end itll be three on tremble and back to the other end to Applause shoot and he can ice it he can put this one away 34 honestly should be enough even if he does doesnt get anything going here at the free throw line but you got to make sure you stay away you got to remember Elliot Kad with the fourpoint play to win the game at Notre Dame one and one and missed again heres tremble fouled again in the back court as he heaved it up there with 14 to go so Hunter Salis had a chance to end the ball game hes a great foul shooter up near 90 and still having fouls to give Cameron hild gives the foul only 14 remaining and right now its just stay away Davis turns fires swishes that one in so that will count but theres your final score 6766
