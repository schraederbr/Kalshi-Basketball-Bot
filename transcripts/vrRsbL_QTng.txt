Forest a phenomenal perimeter shooter hes got to be able to handle the ball shoot and defend well that tees it up nicely were all set to get things tipped off and we are underway Wake Forest gets the opening tip and the Demon Deacons basketball season has begun Music defense out of Fairfield Wake Forest will try to move the ball go some inside touches get the perimeter game going gotta Crash Your Glass and then you missed shot tie up will be alive to get things started and a whistle will foul underneath the basket made it against Davion Bradford theres cook with his first personal foul challenge is going to be how will he play against the bigs of Wake Forest Carr being 610 Matthew March being 71 and a chance at a threepoint play right off the bat Andrew Carr with the bucket and the foul he talks about cars Morgan 610 goes inside hes able to get the score there using the left hand youre going to enjoy watching Andrew Carr the transfer from Delaware at 37 blocks of season to go can also step out and make that midrange shot in the Deep three heads 17 of those one year ago at Delaware Nails the loan a free throw attempt 66 percent a season ago at Delaware Fairfield starting five Caleb Fields Jake wojic Supreme cook Alan gene rose and Makai Willis This Is A Team stand features a lot of transfers on their roster I mean this is pretty talented a bunch for the Metro Atlantic yeah and youre thinking you know Wake Forest has got a lot of transfers this teams got about seven or eight guys that are just stepped on the court for the first time airball sailed by Makai Willis only played four games for the Stags last year due to injury but Music to some of the beat riders that cover this team headed by Jay Young of course as you see there they Rave about Makai Willis and the potential that he has to be a star for this Fairfield team meanwhile Taylor Appleby Williamson Carr in Bradford you see there the five and heres Carr again with a hammer his ability to move from side to side very very athletic I think youre going to like that theyre going to try to get him in isolations trying to go ISO and try to go the lob up the top from time to time Andrew Carr is going to be fun to watch this season hes already got five points as the Deeks do spin in the lane heres Fields caught about a three they go underneath Supreme cook had it tipped maybe second chance at it but draws a whistle again being able to have a big move a little rub Spring right through the top catches and finishes it strong nice player right to Boom very unselfish by Damon I mean Williams lets see if he sets the screen and that screen is defeated he can pop out and take that jump shot if you go high low great half court execution by Wake Forest in their first possession rattles through for cook first point of the night for the Stags the foul is charged to Davion Bradford Bradford you speak about transferring Bradford one of those transfers from Kansas State goes seven feet tall two of two in the trip for cook Music back to the Deeks it goes Radford out of the high post hand to Tyree Appleby Music and out of bounds the call itll stick with the Demon Deacons Music oh no thats going to be a foul on wojin how many times you say this today I transfer and logic play the first couple Seasons up in Richmond last year was a preseason in the third Team all Mac player in AAC and uh you know smart can score the basketball a very solid Defender nice find by Applebee but oh dice on the three from Lucas Taylor a foul on the rebound a little slow things down as Fairfield has a chance to Traverse the length of the Court well heres Jay Young fourth season at the helm of Fairfield but dont let that single digit number fool you hes got over 30 years of experience foreign Bradford charged with the foul hes got two so thats some early trouble for the seven footer for Wake Forest Music Applause looking for cook inside tipped away out of bounds back to wake it goes I have to do if you wait for us is youre gonna have to defend side screens defend the pick and roll action they give you a lot of looks similar to what youd see out of Princeton a lot of twoman basketball trying to get some back screens and youve got to be you got to be on your toes you got to communicate very well Gotta Have Your Head on a swivel if youre a Defender are a long way from the hoop yeah great gifts to the outside Taylor back out to Carr pulls up a three its off the side cook reels it in Music Stags looking to move it ahead and the back dribble woojick feeding cook as your isolation into post utilizing that pivot foot leads the baby hook short had it back momentarily but its ripped away by Appleby a step into the lane banking but no basket offensive foul Steve Forbes last seasons ACC coach of the year first Wake Forest coach to win that honor since skip Prosser back in 2003 great season the Dukes had 25 and 10 just missed the NCAA bid did a nice run in the NIT last year this year with new players pretty much everywhere bound not sure what youre going to get out of Demon Deacons early but Ill tell you what theyre going to be an exciting basketball team and and if you know Steve Forbes like we know Steve Forbes theyre going to put it up theyre going to defend and theyre gonna have some fun doing it yeah theyre going to play with some Tempo when they can for sure Andrew Carr charged with the personal foul keeps it with Fairfield thats his first car matched up against Chrysler project to the corner and a three rattles off out of the hand of Zach Chrisler Music his car again Lucas Taylor whips it around Music now Ty Appleby and a pullup Zach Keller cant hit back and forth we go Fairfield with it hand off Chrysler again long this time dont expect that to carry on for too long hes a 32 or so percent threepoint shooter Music couple crosses Applause and is contacted and found but Wake Forest with a basket for a lead five to two All Points coming via Andrew Carr Fairfield Stags team paying visit to Wake Forest this evening we talked about Supreme cook youve seen wojin TJ long is another one of those guys who was contributor a season ago Chris Mido Alan gene rose and Zach Chrisler whos got a couple of Misses from long range but can be dangerous shooting the basketball and interesting as you look at TJ long did not have a start last year but was his number two returning threepoint shooter for these bathroom games not down 52 he and William combined for 112 of 251 that they made last year I say that because thats the type of guy that can hurt you the ball game like this you dont think of him you dont think of him but hes a nail nails down shots Damian Williamson with it for Wake Forest a good job taking away his first move splits Defenders had a shot rejected Chris Mino with the block keeps it with Wake Forest but just one second on the shot clock Chris Mido long its 16 comes good Hill prayer right there at 15 blocks a season to go gets his first this year Music tough situation for the Demon Deacons here one second on the shot clock Williamson tried it Falling Away Music and now the Stags with Chrisler again in the corner pump fakes on the three this time field guard at 62 transferred from Poland Marine after three years Applause penetrate heres long in the corner it rattles off all right so fairfields Mo theyre going to put up a lot of three balls yeah Music put up threes and theyre gonna do a decent job rebounding as well they get the one and done Fields a step in transition puts it off the side even that lob a moment ago thanks for us some kind of athletic moves good block a whistle foul as Andrew Carr was approaching the basket hes got all five of wake forests so far its charged a Chrysler of Fairfield first on him fifth already for the team is Cameron Hildreth checks in hell give Ty Appleby a breeder for Wake Forest I like Hillcrest he gives you that intensity that toughness hell dive after a loose ball hell make an inside basket well get it put back hell get a suit hell create some chaos some way to try to get this team going Williamson out of the inbound a step back sails it over the rim Music tomato he lives heres long again the double team five on the shot clock for the Stags Bryson goodyn just checked in turn it off in time great defense at time for Wake Forest Paul was trying to reverse would not allowed in reverse and did a nice job defending when the guy tried to step under and take the shot thats thats the type of defense that you hope your teams going to play all season long good possession for The Kinks Bryson goodyn by the way if you were tuned in as a Wake Forest fan and you recognize that name used to play at Syracuse hit a game winner at Syracuse against the Demon Deacons back in 2020 Carr roughs his way through the lane and drops it in love the physicality of Andrew Carr goes in Jump stops Powers inside the bank gets a basket he made in game off back iron yay didnt get a ton of playing time with Syracuse and he spent the last two seasons at Providence another Miss from Deep for the Stags Wake Forest again with it Fairfield on a scoring drought of over five minutes now Hildreth against long draws a second Defender out for three and that ones off back iron William City cant hit Retreats back into defense Fields crosses him up and then is Bodied thatll go against Hildreth taught a freshman Colorado and foul charged to Keller rather than Hildreth there Music Andrew Carr will check out in favor of Matthew Marsh the sophomore and their Supreme Cooks first buck nice to the inside and rub that time and cooked very patient get the defender off his feet and then steps under his scores nice and bound set behind the back triple falling away it skips over the cylinder nice try there but back to the Stags Music cook again going through him good Ein thought about the three back to cook step against mosh goes underneath him and then over the top for the slave he told you he could do damage inside youve seen two great examples would you love that little move little duck in stepped under there and then used the left hand with the jam nice play by the big guy Supreme cook Williamson meanwhile all right a dribbling hes back out to the perimeter Music Applause Bobby Clinton for Wake Forest the scoop shot almost got it to fall but it rolls off cook with the board no Wake Forest offensive flow right now Fairfield within a point heres Bryson good eye grips the bottom of and then gets the whistle and chance it a fourpoint play foreign Music Supreme steps through prior to that threepointer just before the break by Bryson godine of Fairfield Supreme cook for the Stags Andrew Carr for the Demon Deacons had their teams points in totality six for Supreme Cooks so far seven for Andrew Carr as godine looks to potentially complete a fourpoint play Music Applause Music Applause gets it to go threepoint lead for the Stags sort of the problems that wake has is the size of what they have on their side defensively creates some matchup problems so Ill be shocked right now next few possessions wake scores see if coach Forbes a size or extend his defense Philly just to try to put some pressure take uh uh Fairfield out of their comfort zone theyre getting a lot of shots right now and one out of seven for three line and eventually those shots if they get those looks are going to fall so lets see if he extends and pressure or put some maybe smaller thicker lineup on the floor wait before its one of its last 10 from the field make it 11 as Appleby cant hit the layup and then lost footing for Matthew Marsh results in a travel and I cant wait to see Tyree Appleby in the open court to transfer from Florida guys got great quickness it was a decent threepoint shooter but can beat you so many ways off the bounce but not really had the chance so far to get the ball down the court in transition your Supreme cook again little baby hook that was smooth it drops in to give him a thats too easy if you had Willis on the same side so if you brought the double team hes going to kick it through Willis from the three pump fake for Hildreth nice find to the opposite corner in the three rips the net another one for Andrew Carr we talked about it earlier on Andrew Carr showing his versatility of being able to score inside as he got most of the points and step out for a three its 17 a year ago as a blue end hes got all 10 of the Demon Deacons points thus far right in the interesting out of Fairfield making those bigs come out in oneonone defensive then you try to drive by him and drive offensive board just for a moment for Supreme cook had it taken away in transition extra pass Corner three well over the rim Music Applause thats uncharacteristic that kind of Miss for Hildreth is theres a foul on the other end Applause Applebee seventh team foul for Wake Forest Music the one and one we go to the freethrow linear take the shot dont cast your glass dont get back on D pick up a cheap foul in this again you put your right now this game is a Fairfield Temple game Appleby checks out with his second personal they first want to make so Jalen Leach will get a second Fairfield will seasonally go averaging about 67 68 points a ball game and right now youre not even pays for that but they want to control the tempo make Wake Forest work on defense and try to get the high percentage shot although like you mentioned earlier theyre not afraid to take they knock down threes he had 14 games a year ago we had seven or more three so they dont mind taking threes but they want to work their offense Outside Inside Out if that makes any sense look for your previous shot youll get it lets go inside dont get it go back outside as soon again yeah Fairfield taking advantage of the free throw line so far too five for five from the strike like that action Music so were looking for car again Applause extra ball down to Williamson who gets it from the corner nice job of Mildred to make the extra pass Norm Williamson was trading there on the weak side on the base to make the knock jump that knock down jumper Williamson with the quick release finally got a really clean look at the basket Hometown guy from WinstonSalem on the defense there and Bryson godine gets his second to fall only made eight threes a season ago why was it Providence so again you know youre talking about didnt really find his really spot to score man thats a good basketball I could start going back to his old form wow that makes his team even more loaded no doubt about it Hildreth gets two back for the Deeks Music I like when Gilbert get active maybe you could pass a moment ago gets a basket there frees up some space and TJ long hits the three I remember we talked a moment ago about TJ long did not get a star the season to go but he can come off the bench and fire it up and there again a good look on the on the reverse weak side bam knocks a three down 2015 Fairfield with the lead Hildreth ooh looking for Carr that was almost such a good sneaky pass and then goodyn stepped out of bounds before he corrouted Music Applause Music first game you never know what youre gonna get out of either team youre on the road how are you going to respond to that home team with so many new faces for this Wake Forest basketball team you know how they gonna play one of the things that coach Forbes was talking about the other day was trying to get separation trying to get guys to step up so youve got a definitive four five six seven eight players physical move commits the offensive foul Music and stand when a game is going like this offensively for Wake Forest you get more of those moments right like he did here with Hildreth and then we saw it with Appleby earlier exactly and and the longer that you can keep this crowd on their hands and make way for us continue to think theres that knock down three a moment ago the better off is going to be for family man we talked about how comfortable they were running their offense and a push on the layup attempt by Caleb fields cant hit hell go to the free throw line its a fivepoint lead for the Stags Fairfield up 2015 here at Wake Forest punch early here for Wake Forest in their season opener at their home venue Joel Coliseum fivepoint lead for the Fairfield Stags who have a game under their belt this season a loss at Rutgers 7865 was the final there Applause free throw one and one for Caleb fields misses and will not get another and Rutgers game was an exhibition while Wake Forest trying again from threepoint range Hildreth unsuccessful the movement look at the movement around the perimeter right now wasting a little more job kind of a little bit of job putting more pressure on the basketball but right now you know bathrooms just kind of moving from side to side inside outside good defensive turnover yeah but but again thats because your guard tried to drive a little too far because he was comfortable they Wade did a nice job reacting at the end of the play but you know see your team and theyre moving the ball inside out side to side yeah theyre in some kind of offensive flow Applause Music Ill just not to take the screen from car instead gives for a three It thuds Off and a rebound for Fairfield Music whips it around Alan gene rose back in hes one of the starters sat for a few moments outside catch and shoot the three off the front side a tip out nearly favored Fairfield Lucas Taylor able to reel it in and get it to hildred back to Taylor the three is through Music good job there on the on the secondary break just finding your your guy being in the open spot Lucas Taylor a nice five fan sophomore makes a nice jump shot gets his first one of the night so his first field goal made as a member of the Demon Deacons officially one point last season on a free throw Music Williamson physical defense knocked out of bounds and stays with Wake Forest and it feels does a really nice job of playing that off the bounce and getting a piece of the ball without fouling second time tonight that Williamson has driven into paint and had somebody from the backside come up and block the shot pass in and its banked in for the Wake Forest bucket Music Bobby Clinton Fairfield rather trying to answer right away getting it to Supreme cook we talk about it a lot being able to score whats your philosophy some teams try to score some team try to get the ball in bounds that was an active score that time Clinton catches the ball in rotation after the little screen a little rub and goes up without hesitation uses his size and his lens at six nine to get the basket ball on Wake forests Lucas Taylor Supreme cook with two on the way two of two from the stripes so far tonight scored on the first Music decision only a 60 Music and as we talked about earlier it does all a lot of his damage on the glass Applause seven chance opportunity seven double doubles last season for the Stags as he cant connect on either free throw high ball screen thats nice car a lot of space goes into the lane but commits the charge well its unfortunate because he actually traveled I think before they had the uh the offensive foul lets take a look here where we missed the beginning of that but theres a good defensive effort there above the cylinder in the offensive and kicks to charge and again what youre doing right now is youre planning to fairfields hands If You Wake Forest and if your family you love the Temple of this ball game look at the ball movement great space and you got to get something out of there because I aint lost his handle out of bounds but it was tipped my car checks out for Wake Forest Davion Bradford back in after committing couple of fouls early bring him in some good move good move counteract about what Supreme could be able to do inside keeping balls alive this is a good matchup right here cook tries to spin it spin off of Bradford and puts it in off the glass and Bradford wanted to be careful he didnt want to pick up that third foul and cook knew that so he took right to the body of the big guy and gets it off the glass and breaks in nearly threeminute scoring drought for the Stags now off of the ball Music to Bryson good eye number seven on Fairfield so free throws the rest of the way for Wake Forest Music Cameron Hildreth 70 percent from the stripe a season ago Music Mason will get a second Music Geeks back within one Music took hands off Jean Rose in traffic hesitates and weaves his way through for the bucket wow a lot of things going over that plate almost got picked on the backside thought he traveled got itself together used the glass got a basket threepoint lead for Fairfield four to play in the first and Williamson is bumped from behind it leads to a Timeout on the floor Fairfield ahead by three here at the Joel Music go inside hes cooking inside right there by his little head shows new off the inbound play drop step using the L boss the NBA move with the left hand watch this supreme going inside look up so hes really making you work as a Defender and no every time you start the ball hes got it in the bank and somebodys behind him cant let that do you know why because his Supreme postplay thats right he has been the superior scorer for the Stags so far tonight only Fairfield player in double figures with those ten hed love the inside position he catches the basketball he doesnt mess around with hes got an idea of his move hes also got the counter ready in case you defend that tough to defend free throws coming out of the timeout Davion Williamson with a one and one got the first so well see a second and now what you want to do havent seen that highlight youre saying to your post guys youve got to do a better job either front him or side post you know and be on the Baseline side and be up top but you cant let him continue to get the ball that easy and then also your guards cant let the guard make that easier pass so its a twofold thing see hes getting Grady inside positions not too much you can do because hes good in here 2 for Williamson a very good freethrow shooter now Fairfield with a one point lead good eye pass wasnt there inside misses the three and a foul on the rebound gives it back to Wake Forest Kai Willis charged with the personal foul to be one and one on the other end again we talked about Makai Willis earlier only played like four or five ball games a season ago but a lot of fans may remember him having played early on in his career forward state athletic guy at 6869 Music Bobby Clinton first to go longbodied freshman 610 out of Sweden and only under 17 and under 19 teams Music to have a nice career rate for us bigger gets a little stronger Music tail end Supreme cook with his fifth rebound Music Guy game Alan gene rose works all the way into the paint and receives contact on the shot attuned is that gonna be on Bradford Bradford avoids his third Taylor commits his second came over the hill so violently thats what she wanted to do but he came over and a lot of times officials would kind of forget about the earlier bumps inside and kind of take that call gene rose just a 58 percent freethrow shooter for his career so what youre saying is if your game is closed so you can file him Im not saying it I might be suggesting it implying it Music its early in the season but hey numbers are the numbers Cameron Hildreth now back to the basket hop into the lane nobody else there with him somehow got the shot off and cleans it up himself every teams got to have a cam hildred Throne to take just the guy that does the Dirty Work didnt mind mixing it up he worked hard to get those two points missed the shot one way got the rebound followed and gets the score our drive for Good Eye Has it ripped away Wake Forest with Williamson Banks it in count it no oh I saw the punching motion that you did that looked like a counted but that was a punch in the opposite direction expensive foul lets take a look at this again down down the only thing I cant tell is where the feet okay heres this might be a better look great job guys looks like hes above the restricted R and if he is I I can sell that car I dont I dont necessarily like it but I can sell it I can say yeah youre a weight fan its a pretty good car Bryson godine meanwhile air balls to three prior to that shot and in the words of our guy Rasheed was the ball dont lie so he shot a handball so it must have been a bad cop did I hit hit a couple early on in this game wake me just sit down right now to double up Hildreth again all alone in that corner of the floor this time he gets fouled on the shot attempt until it guys somebodys got to be a cutter it was basically four red shirts below the block basically guarding or watching Guild would be trying to make these posts move there was no cutter there was nobody on the ball side or better yet on the weak side for him to reverse the basketball team unfortunately hes able to get it up get some contact and he goes to the line third of the night from the line for Hildreth hes three for three now Zach Keller reenters as does Chris maido you have Mido in the ball game along with Supreme cook youve got not only great size but those long arms that can get those rebounds and block shots if youre trying to run stuff into paint Ed with the last couple times try to post up those guys take that away good movement here Music Idaho High post back to fields short on the three gets his own rebound Music shooter long with the three thuds off the back of the iron he shot 40 percent a year ago good defense by Wake Forest and then Williamson with it in transition as it knocked away a foul that goes against Mido and sends Williamson to the freethrow line he just love it when youve got a guard that can handle the ball and score under control watch how Williamson just takes it down the floor youre not sure is he going to take the jumper is he going to drive and score under control stops for a second gets the defender on his feet and goes and his shots gets blocked from the weak side but the foul has already been committed on the ground and this just that was a play when Williamson was completely in control remembering what happened to him or possession of something when he drove on the other side and got the offensive cost smart play by the scenery from WinstonSalem first team preseason all ACC its one of two Music this has not been a walk in the park of the first half of the season for Wake Forest but they find themselves ahead as we near halftime thank you Applause Music Fields penetrates has it ripped away Williamson blocked well what an effort by good eye and then the three on the other side too strong Music ahead to hildred and pulls back the reins nice job Music great block on one is probably play on the rebound Catching Fire free rattle it rattles through Clinton Music very impressive score aside you know if the secondary has a great look at the top of the key buries the three and once a timeout Wake Forest its biggest lead of the ninth 24 seconds remaining in the first half Bobby Clinton with the latest Wake Forest threepointer hes one of four Demon Deacons players to make from deep and it makes it 10 consecutive points scored by Wake Forest Music Applause possession arrow is also going to go to way of Fairfield so you get a score against the first position right in this basketball Jean Rose drives from the high post and thatll do it for the first half of action from Joel Coliseum Wake Forest with some life heading into the locker room 10 consecutive points and they lead it by seven Applause Music Steve Forbes would like to get his first win of the season in year number three at the helm of Wake Forest first possession belongs to Fairfield Music wow okay going inside out Supreme cook Falling Away cant hit its rebounded by Ty Appleby of Wake Forest it was kind of a lazy shot by cook over Bradford I think theyll try to attack him a little bit more lets see if they can also get their burger guys Applause cook forces the shared possession flips the arrow but it stays with Wake Forest a lot of effort out of supreme cook on both ends of the floor for Bradford fate gets his man in the air and then it was blocked by the secondary Defender Alan gene rose couple of attempts for Bradford and a whistle to realize how long this Fairfield basketball team is Alan gene rose was about 67 hes also a senior he just does a great job of holding positioning and going up strong and getting the block Music number of key transfers for Wake Forest including Davion Bradford we havent seen jaoitsuka yet hes out with injury but then the others I mean Ty Appleby he led the Florida Gators and assists each of the last two seasons these are Big pieces being brought in by Steve Ford we havent really seen him I mean you know so far fall down the floor Terror Cleveland State before he went to Florida yeah and just picked up and just really expanded his game talking about his time at Cleveland State maybe not a stretch to say one of the best assist men one of the best point guards in Horizon league history and he was that good for Wake Forest he rose again a crossover long arm scoop shot a tip forward for Appleby but wojic ends up with it for Fairfield logics been kind of quiet tonight also not even taking a shot by my notes a rebounds a couple of personal fouls early though so only five minutes played in the first half but hes one of those guys that can get hot quickly and they were very very strong very smart fundamental guy I mentioned earlier Applause Music theres a three up and off The Far Side for wojic his first attempt no good foreign Music Applause Music really nice penetration great look Music Chris smido against Bradford Banks it in wow they give us a shrug little MJ shrug yeah brings it within six for the Stags Music its green Applebee drawn the double team into Bradford and a little off balance could have been ugly attempt but he draws the foul watch motto inside taking away slides your feet readjust no travel no foul just play basketball like thats all thats all we get Bradford gets a couple of free throws one point on one of two from the stripes so far tonight and banks in the first moments in Kansas State not a big score averaging about four ball game but you know get some glass got a few blocks high percentage scored a ball much he had a lot of high percentage I think he shot him over 60 percent just over 60 percent also 60 from the free throw line he gets both there foreign to an eightpoint lead for the Demon Deacons Music Bradfords going to guard motto and hes a basket was going to be a person to be a passer take the midrange shot and also be a supreme lets see how much they try to keep involved his hands in a friend you know two to shoot wojic with a shot as the shot clock expires misses another three Bradford the board Music is moving it around the perimeter of car penetrates cant hit transition for gene rose tries to take it himself and is foul itll go against Lucas Taylor Music times today even teams really had an opportunity to take it from one end to the other to kind of get the transition basket Stan thats charged to Tyree Appleby you see him pleading his case there sir thats number three Music Applause I instinctively said Taylor on the foul I thought he was for sure who was going to be charged either way Jean Rose cant hit the free throw will be again still trying to understand why he was called for the personal foul Applause Jean Rose misses another Applause foreign Applause offensive board in the slam for Andrew Carr his first point since he got the first 10 of the game for Wake Forest Music mojic thought about another three through the Double T Nifty move after the pass by Mida yeah this matchup that youre seeing for Wake Forest might have whos gonna be that guy that you might want to use as a scoring threat score or a passive Music get by leech but thats because he kicked his leg up eight point lead for Wake Forest and a Timeout on the floor its day one of the college hoop season here at the Joel about the reloading jobs Steve Forbes had to do with this Wake Forest team a couple of players that just recently exited the program on this list of Demon Deacons on NBA rosters see Yolandas Williams there at the bottom dick loravia with the Memphis Grizzlies of course Chris Paul there he is helping the rappies here too in a way Towers here some recent and that long ago but a little further out success for the Demon Deacons at the next level is they lead it by eight Music Appleby over to Hildreth out of the timeout steps through the lane that hop there Hildreth hes gritty inside thats what Im saying earlier in the game is it God I have a guy even right now when the Geeks have a lead its still a lot of time to play this game and the crowds kind of down everybodys kind of you watching and hildred kind of comes in there and stirs it up and gives you a play gives you a reason to get off your feet it might be a score it might be a defensive play could be a hustle play it could be a free throw that goes to the top and it comes down but it gives you something to get excited about it he played the more energy in the building the more energy by his teammates the harder he plays the harder he plays better things go for Wake Forest get the friendly roll there yeah this is a big possession Fairfield theyve been stuck Music and they they need to find a way to get a basket they look inside back out good on a pump fake strong on the midrange Bradford comes down with the rebound if its back to Wake Forest good look like dying 10 out of 33 shoes questions the age of three three inside the paint if you just be patient again where did that ball start and entered inside and I think if I if Im Fairfield Ive got to find a way to exploit that matchup Music heres car a little head fake works his way into the paint and just bullies his way to another bucket hes acting with great footwork on the bottom too to just kind of get himself set get squared and when he does just elevates timeout called by Jay Young the head coach at Fairfield its an 11 Point deficit for the Stags the largest of the day in favor of Wake Forest Ry got some range good hands there finishes with the plug gotta have your big guys have some great footwork inside step through knows its gonna be contacted father every chance to play Andrew guard is a beautiful way for us having a really nice basketball game with 14 points but most importantly taking care of his shot six out of nine from the field and doing it a number of ways as you saw in the highlights there hes got it from Long Range he can hit shots out there follow on the rebound and then the dunk game at 6 10 10 caused a lot of matchup problems starting the season knock it down a three at 17 in his previous school I think hes going to be a guy who can stretching for a lot of ways look at that guy Supreme cook muscles it up and in I havent talked about cooking much in the second half thats his first bucket of half number two he became him involved offensively better he is offensively the better hes going to be defensively getting rebounds swatting some shots Cameron hildred wow the body controlled it even have a chance to make that but it pops out you gotta go back inside cook spins away from his man and draws the foul Lucas Taylor thought he had ripped it away cleanly and the foul will be charged Davion Bradford watch this quick spin move right there gets into funerals here theres a contact initially Ben Taylor comes over with a steal you may have gotten steal but the big guy coming in the foul from the back number three on Bradford after those two early in the first half Fields with an open look from three but there was a reason and a foul cold Applause cream cook on the screen attempt Music Music lets see seems like hes okay right now so he tries to get active and try to score on this airfields still hanging around cant have any defensive breakdowns right now Williamson has it ripped away good Ein pulls back Music mojic thought about the three draws in car over to the corner three short offensive rebound fields from Deep cant hit and cars hipped it out of bounds but he had a guy up there with him gene rose the last to touch him maybe even three depending on how you score it looks for Fairfield not able to knock anything down Lake Forest once again Dodges the bullet Fairfield doing a nice job moving the ball getting a second chance opportunity up a long rebound off the three not able to get it the ball reflected off the Fairfield player yeah Stan I mean especially considering Fairfield prioritizes the three ball theyre three of 18 from D still to be within single digits here theyre Scrappy Music no drip kind of poked away from behind a whistle talk about them being a scrappy team one of the ways they had a lot of success last year was he go to the free throw line they they made more free throws than their opponents 15 times but nine and six when they made more free throws than their opponent and this game alone you know that theyre six of 13 in the line with the Demon Deacons 12 or 17 so you add those free throws you add in the building from Fairfield to Mike shots gives you a weight for us deep but you know again theres a church of the two of these guys Cameron Hills misses the front end and gets it back to the Stags Mr free throw can you take advantage of it a better matchup man whos Bradford car thats what Id be looking for Bradford got the three foul whos he guarding gene rose is fouled Bobby Clinton commits the personal first on him third on Wake Forest coach recognize what I was seeing too they were trying to work isolation on whoever the big guy had with his third foul Music Applause Music heres wojic looking for Willis down low pass was tipped but pulled in gene rose against Keller Shields pulls it in with one second to shoot and berries at the shot clock wow Applause and the white was going on the ball was in the air Kelly did a nice job stopping the Baseline Drive you had to kick it out Music what I found and its back within six for Fairfield Music Applause first

about it they go underneath to Willis Applause good ball movement long with a dribble inside and thugs it off the rim Music Applause Music Applause Music a little pick and pop Keller it rattles out Music logic threw the extra attention and lost his handle numbers for Wake Forest alive Applause good push ahead Applebee takes it down throws it up clickman having a nice game in his debut also for Wake Forest with the stuff just the second assist of the night for Ty Appleby and an eightpoint lead for Wake Forest as that one an Aaron shot and out of bounds Applause extraordinary assist man with the LOB ster a little spark of light for Wake Forest Fairfield was opening game of the season for Fairfield and Wake Forest this is what the next few weeks look like before the Stags those Towson and Mercer matchups are at a neutral site so it results in the first eight games of the Season being played on the road yes Music Applause right cam Hildreth stopping a spin in the lane it rolls out and a whistle following Applause Music a long charge with the personal foul hes first for Fairfield so Hilder is going to go back to the free throw line really forcing the issue on a number of occasions Ive seen him at this the stripe a lot hes four of seven tonight one and one here and he misses talked about that free throw marches Wake Forest down 1218 teams online at once long three attempted by long and he airballs it as long as a guide Its accustomed to making some jumpers and hes only hes one of eight shooting finally was open for a second and just bam you know never got his feet set never really saw the rim tried to get it up there Music yeah that was one of those empty possessions if youre Fairfield gotta you cant give away those double the basket hasnt poked away and stolen Music Mido finds long in the corner here he goes his second made three much better shot that time had his feet set eyes on the basket caught turned and knocked it down long made the allconference rookie team a season ago with Fairfield shot 40 percent from three and now a foul on the other side and hes a streaky shooter but but could have some games he had he came against Loyola where he had five threes and also followed it up against Ryder with seven so again hes a good guy that can catch and shoot and Ive been trying to beat you off the bounce too much and you saw an example of that on the shot he missed on the right side but on the left left side Wing got his feet set bam buried it Mino commits his third it sends Clinton into the freethrow line for Wake Forest and so we won in one whos team foul number nine on Fairfield so from here on out Deeks will be shooting two years Music now two for three from the free throw line tonight hell get another for him hes up to nine points and now double figures smooth for Wake Forest smooth stroke very confident comfortable at the freethrow line lets leave see what they do out of that he rose out of the corner and tried to bounce it block the block Keller got a hand on Music Applause Music Applebee pick and roll finds Keller foul under the bucket theyll be charged to took it down and now Keller goes to the line to shoot two its number three on Bryson goodout Music Taylor hits the first 610 out of Highlands Ranch Colorado Zach Keller led the team in rebounds in their exhibition against WinstonSalem State with seven Music when you look at the big guys you look at you know obviously size but you know can you run can he catch whats his footwork like and and you liked it this is the guy that had 610 you know if you get out on the perimeter he needs some weight I mean he just needs to get a little more time to make sure hes a basketball player good ball movement and TJ long with two consecutive makes from threepoint range is Catching Fire and hes warming up catching shoot guy right we talked about that kitchen shoot guy second best returning threepoint shooter found this spot once again thats going to be a way reverts the direction of the basketball I mean were with the two possessions here fivepoint game still plenty of basketball left 8 51 I think they got killer on the screen off the ball offensive foul on Keller youve got a long hes being guarded by the freshman see what happens here Alan gene rose a stutter tries to go inside great defense Keller swallowed it up talk about that talk about being able to play with his feet Applebee Keller for three yeah there it is there we go I mean that was a great example of what we were talking about right there here in the video Work footwork played Without fouling got a steal spotted up got his puppy set knocked it down up and down defensive play followed by the offensive make and its an eightpoint lead for Wake Forest excellent secrets for him Music whoa high off the glass Music it had some words for some people in the front row and then an apology for somebody I think that was the official yeah back Keller again left it short car tried on the offensive rebound and it goes to a Timeout on the floor Apple be the dish and Keller sees an opener for Wake Forest and well it doesnt get much easier our five opponent they face Georgia on Friday a look at the early going of their nonconference schedule they do get to go to Montego Bay Jamaica for the Jersey Mikes Jamaica classic that includes the LaSalle game and then Georgetown or LMU Music so let me see if I got this right because I said a minute ago women are going to Bahamas in next week or two and men are going to Jamaica yeah we had both games thats all weve heard about and and somehow somehow nobody like like okay I guess its in the mirror I guess my I get my plane ticket to the fam because Im waiting in the morning when I get to the mailbox I guess to him conbact contact cam Hildreth commits the foul I mean like weathers good its not like Im gonna eat that much I mean its gonna play some golf backs been bothering me playing a little golfing go to do the games Im easy give me a tshirt now be happy but at least take me Music youre not one of those people thats looking forward to cooler days ahead Caleb feels off the mark on the three he gets a second chance send it full second chance opportunity berries a three we got a ball game its within a score for Fairfield threepoint lead for Wake Forest and a foul at the perimeter Music shot there inside you dont get it kick it out because your defense is gonna scramble and just ready to shoot the basketball and Fields is done I was about to say its really done a nice job and taking away some of the speed of Applebee hes able to bury that three got a little too close that time and Ill send Applebee to the free throw line Appleby a few assists thats his first point oh of two from the field including one threepointer missed but hes not been able to go from end to end with the basketball like he wants to like hes accustomed to doing Music Applause you know if youre into that part of the ball game five point a couple possessions either way value the basketball make sure youre getting high percentage shots and whatever you do get back on defense Fields against Appleby now they go inside heres Willis with the left started one way started in the middle of floor drop step goes inside makes it an easy lay a big pivot move by Willis he had a couple of personal fouls early hes had trouble getting involved in this one his first bucket brings it back within three Davion Williamson from the corner ricochets and the rebound goes to Fairfield let the ball go inside first if youre Fairfield make them work Fields dribbles around his man and buries the long two and is a onepoint game with under six minutes to play here at the Joel and if you let a team hang around and hang around and find their Rhythm eventually some bad things can happen to you if youre the other team and so far now youve got Fields playing very comfortable theyre going inside finding some ways to get some baskets long finally knocked down a couple jump shots one point game with 556 remaining Wake Forest Steve Forbes calls this time out Fairfield three of their last three from the field the Demon Deacons field goalless in the last almost two and a half minutes Music and what do they do and move the basketball in we had kick out she had Shooters waiting if you didnt have the shot she made the extra pass and when you did make the extra pass that guy was ready to knock down the shot so its been in Rhythm for its been in Rhythm for Fairfield and we talk about them getting some Rhythm you can begin to see it then Wake Forest has got a saddle in on the defensive side and this has got to be a solid execution ball lets see if they their car gets a touch or Williamson those are the guys Id want to touch this right now car immediately gives it back to Hildreth puts up the floater and it rattles through great recognition by huge as I tell you hes a scrappy guy saw that the Baseline was available new to take the 10foot jumper pulls up and knocks it in hes into double figures now 10 points for the Demon Deacons its three points the game long one four long and just rolls out oh a heartbreaking mess and a foul following watch this recognition heres the Baseline gets it she knows hes got a definitive to try to block the shot so he doesnt attack him any further get through your spot and then just Elevate right outside the lane gets a big basket a rim around wow that should have gone down for long doesnt and then they get a foul call on Fairfield tough break on the other end itll be Applebees shooting free throws where hes two of two in recent memory make it three of three from the strike Music Wake Forest had several games this season ago where they made over 20 free throws with two more made today they will have made 20 free throws began being able to knock the free throws down especially in the final four or five minutes of a ball game can be definitely the difference between winning and losing a season to go to Detroit ninth in the ACC shooting 73 for the line to the fivepoint game Music Applause and nearly a steal for Appleby for example right there the quickness to the Applebee possesses and in the passing Lane nearly was able to take that length Applause Music since you cook back in the game hes gonna be matched up against a car yeah Applause Fields open look too strong but an offensive rebound wont you hesitates but makes it in first basket of the night from woji couldnt have come at a bigger and better time got the offensive rebound got in the paint new is going to be contested took his time gets it off the glass Applause Stags and Deeks trading buckets at this point four and a half to play a one possession game Applause tough bucket 12 points for him now Baseline Runner a moment ago this time uses his offensive moves gets in the glass gets in the area scores long one for logic rolls off Applebees going to try to use numbers looks to take it himself and its tipped away Fairfield basketball Music Applause Appleby now oh of just three field goal attempts today Applause Music Applause Applause cutter good open floor you like the balance of their offense right now Fields done about the three a hop into the lane trying to hand it to Supreme cook and its ripped away Hildreth has come up so big in so many spots for Wake Forest yeah and Fields has got to take that shot I know he likes you being unselfish and then Hildreth gives it away cook with the Steal cannot mess around on this possession Fairfield Music theyre within five at the Joel season opener for both of these teams 3 23 to play we got a game chance opportunity Baseline left crossover a little floater from about eight feet thats nice watch this drive inside he knows theres gonna be some contact it doesnt matter to him yeah I got that cam Hills are just coming and been that person to kind of give the energy to Wake Forest and try to get them over the hump in game number one of the Season Fairfield playing the Demon Deacons close when theyve needed a bucket cam Hildreth has been the one to will his way to the hoop a timeout tough shot made it made it made an easy shot of tough one by being off balance Wake Forest now with it just over three to play will be under the basket almost got a chance at a threepoint play two free throws it is for Ty Appleby hes been a little slow to get going offensively but this is where he has found some production four of four from the stripes so far tonight Music more rebounds a few assists to go with it for Applebee tonight just pushing the basketball creating Chaos on the defensive end and that chaos can turn into easy transition baskets from Wake Forest Fields has done a nice job and contained his speed and also you know not turning the ball up during the easy shots for easy steals Supreme Cooks number five in red back in for Fairfield hes working with four personal fouls feels the step back oh he uses at a steady ball game not not very flashy 11th point of the game but just done some smart things some big shots as the Stags are trying to stay in this Applebees to the rack theres that speed you see him turn the corner zipped right through a few Defenders on that one for his first field goal wow Wake Forest trying to put this one away Music Applause Music and a foul after the handoff to Appleby I dont get charged to TJ long Music you need that guy thats willing to make a play theres a split the defender the quickness before they could get in the defensive stance before they could turn their heads halfway was buying Music that kind of quickness that kind of allaround play something Wake Forest fans looking very much forward to this season is Camp Hildreth hits his fifth free throw of the 90s five of nine Applebees ability to break down the defense at the last moment he didnt make the pass or in his last couple possessions score and cam childrens thats playing basketball on both ends Music that was his team High tenth a free throw attempt tonight cook after the cut wide open Lane to the hoop cant flush it but is fouled by Carl the car is very fortunate that he was able to file it because had he not been able to that would have been the newest poster going around the campus at Fairfield University come Monday and Tuesday of next week give me a couple days to make the poster get it out go two of four so far at the line making two of five yeah probably would have photoshopped yeah but you just you just superimpose a chefs hat on him right yeah Supreme go Supreme cook I could see that making its rounds on Twitter oh no question about it its the second pulls it back within eight Music this is from Applebee is so dangerous a good ball handler hes got great vision and then the speed will make you work on defense Applebees pulls from three to strong rebounded thats Bobby quintman nice job on a freshman Mildred extra pass Williamson gets it for three what a smart play by clintman to get the rebound could have gone up and scored I probably would have he kicked it out they make an extra pass trying to wide open Williamson for the berry three TJ long the quick pull from three and a one and done quintman fouled watched his play penetration speak pass over there gets it but it all started because of what the Freshman from Sweden did he got the rebound he was in the paint Im sure Id probably put that back up herself I probably would have followed it up I mean lets be honest with you but he had the understanding of the game understanding the concept of time in school the ball moving keep the ball moving they make you free throw didnt do that but I like that its a smart play hes had a nice day view this stand is really the key in this game the free throw discrepancies yes indeed have been the decider thats a tip number 33 for Wake Forest as a team theyve hit 24 of them you compare that to just seven of 15 for Fairfield I told you they they made 23 throws or more seven times a season ago desperation time for Fairfield and they cough it up Applause getting ready to play the fight song in just a few seconds theres a foul by Caleb fields maybe Williamson will go to the free throw line Music Ill tell you what though I like this Fairfield basketball team I Im very impressed and you watch them on tape and he did a lot of really good things but again this is the first game of the season you dont know what players are going to do and you got a lot of Youth on the team and some transfers and their preseason picked uh was five in the conference and uh you know Iona we know what coach potato is going to do we know about Manhattan what whats going on there Riders always picked up the pediac has always been a team thats just been able to battle in the conference so you know well see but I think you keep your eyes open if youre if youre watching basketball fairfields going to be a team that people recording and as they go Fields gets another three and a timeout call that brings it within 11 you talk about the Metro Atlantic too I mean the talk of the college basketball world was the peacocks yeah out of St Peters too thats thats that was a scenario that gives any team like Fairfield a sense of belief right the the gap between you and the major programs yeah are not its not as big as you might think this years St Peters preseason pick number nine in the Metro Atlantic new coaches there but uh this is a very good conference and you know we know we know the legacy of Rick Pitino what he could do and Iona has been a team that uh you know the force so is a very good win for a young Wake Forest team I mean Im counting this a win with 39 seconds ago but you know you never know you dont keep up but I I saw a lot of things out of Fairfield thats going to let me say okay let me follow them a little bit more as the season goes on yeah for sure I think both Fairfield and Wake Forest from teams are gonna are gonna be a lot better January and they are today yeah Im gonna grow theyre going to continue to grow and of course you notice Manhattan number two yeah I mean who knows what thats going to look like yeah all the disarrays exactly and one who didnt want to go too deep into that just theres a lot of stuff going on but yeah but I mean youre right Id suffice it all to say thats a conference Fairfield can definitely contend Within Music amp will be across the timeline Carr and now Wake Forest is going to hang on Music so an eight second difference between the shot clock and the game clock and a foul committed by wojin did not do it everybody didnt do everything that we hoped they would and build them but thats not a thats not a negative way for us thats a positive for for Fairfield of the things they did but we saw the speed at the end of the game of Appleby and we saw a great start by Andrew Carr Andrew Carr kind of set the table with his midrange shot the finish of the dunk and then again you get Cam hildren coming in just being relentless on both ends of the floor and in between that you know Williamson finally was able to find the range in the jump shot played solid defense when they needed to and and you know again its continuous work in progress and theyre going to get better I I like I like transform Squad and I just seen it because were watching today I think its a team but you know theyre gonna take some lumps maybe but all teams do yeah they lost a number of key components right I mean the ACC Player of the Year and alondis Williams Jake laravia on to the pros at the next level a guy like Carter Witt transferred hes hes at Furman now I mean whatd you say I mean we showed it weve got two guys are on this floor a year ago you know that are now in the NBA so I mean its a lot of production one of them being the ACC player of the year so Music Bulldogs coming to town yeah and something to hang your hat on if youre Fairfield oh the question an impressive effort just got it out in the late going by Wake Forest as it is all formalities now with that foul and Damian Williamson headed to the freethrow line by my last goal I 8 for 29 from the three line for uh Fairfield from Fairfield is that about right its 8 29th there that is exactly right native 29 so so you know and they have they have players on this team who are capable of shooting us way better wojic 0 of 3 long three of ten not bad but he can catch fire well the Chrysler uh no two two shots Beaufort threes did make one Scotty made 25 threes a year ago yeah so some shots didnt fall no Fields I think just picked up his fifth yep and and he gave you some some moments and he was a more of a of a past first guy at Bowling Green but uh yeah I I I like this team Music up to a 12 point lead again for Wake Forest and they take over possession as the buzzer sounds a consolation dunk for cam Hildreth in the first win of the season for that man on the right there Steve Forbes pleasantries with Jay Young the Fairfield head coach all right so Wake Forest gutted it out first win of the season a 12 point difference between they and the Stags
