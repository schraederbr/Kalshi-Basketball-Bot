and West both of these teams have done the same thing they started a little slowly but theyve really put things together they have their rotations the way they want theyve got the lineups that theyre looking for and so I I expect this to be an outstanding game Panthers win the tap theyll control the ball The Freshman low works with Henson theres Austin of course the transfer from High Point Carrington and feder Rico fill out the card for Jeff table heres low skipping across for Hinson three ball away to start the game front rim Miss and beatman who fills just about every stat column for Tony Bennett hes the headliner with roie McNeely dun and Jordan Miner who if theres a turnkey to Virginias season the insertion of Miner into the starting lineup in a unique way perhaps brought Virginia together collectively heres Batman feeding Miner and the Cavaliers on the board first and of course very few people do that as well as Reese beakman driving the ball into the lane in finding an open player nice catch nice pass you see the backourt of Carrington in low Henson Austin feder Rico and then Ill tell you about ishma Leed who comes off the bench for Jeff Capel and again here is bman and Henson Blake will taking foul line fallway spins in now Wes he missed a wide open three and that was a tough contested shot against a very good defensive player now admittedly he has a couple of inches on him but thats what Hinson does he can make really tough shots mcne against the Freshman from Missouri City Texas Jaylen low and now beakman against Carrington its quite a test for low and Carrington theres roie it was an airball and then low couldnt control the loose ball it will go to Virginia Dan Jeff cable mentioned specifically today Austin low Carrington theyve never played Virginia theyve never been in this building he was concerned about that from an atmosphere standpoint and how they they would handle it but Virginias a different animal you can you can practice against what Virginia does but you cant really simulate it and you can say guard that guy cuz hes going to shoot threes a rare trip inside the threepoint line for mcney and he has really improved inside the threepoint line during this Virginia winning streak Henson against D backing them down all the way to the block he leverages and scores on the up and under crafty move by Blake Henson but you see that was totally oneonone and he used his physical strength against done and Im telling you when Hinson gets it down there hes shooting it he is not passing it in 12 ACC games he only has five assists here is Batman inside Miner over the top of feder Rico Carrington clears it for the Panthers Virginia wants to keep pit out of the transition chance Carrington a three one and done and McNeely a little bit like low at the other end had a crack at it couldnt handle it itll stay with pit well this is just what we talked about with Hinson does a great job maintaining his pivot foot and dun tried to stay down but couldnt and as soon as dun went up in the air Hinson slipped right by him spot throw in heres Hinson against Dunn Thats a three from the corner and its short you saw that ball come right back to Dy you got to be very careful you block h out on that play roie sliding in Past Austin give up the drive for the pass to beatman mcney for three 60th triple of the year for Isaac mcney who comes in now 60 of 124 Dan from behind the line theres a lot on that resume and its all good from threepoint territory well hes made his first two shs shots Austin tries to answer and does Zack Austin just his 19th three of the year hes only averaged Four Points in the last seven for Jeff Cables team yeah but even though his threepoint percentage isnt very high Wes he came in with the reputation as a guy who could shoot threes heres roie look at the double team coming back for beatman quick look for dun nice wrap from Miner and it got blocked by feder Rico heres low trying to take advantage of the good defensive effort at the pit end to the floor feder Rico an excellent shot blocker and pit an excellent shot blocking team nice job by Virginia to get back and prevent the easy transition R Look Away feder Rico will stuff it home Panthers in front for the first time Virginias going to jump out on that screen Wes and when Miner does that hes really got to work hard quickly to get back need a little bit more pressure on the ball low had a lot of time to find the open man heres McNeely slides in on low twopointer good Isaac MC was looking for the foul hes got seven of Virginias nine on his third field goal w i mean weve talked about Virginias defense but this is a lot of points before the first TV timeout in the Virginia game yeah feels like each teams trying to match one another heres hson that is a long way out its an air ball it barely got to the back of the iron missed everything beakman trying to beat low does Runner with the left hand terrific shot for the senior from Milwaukee Rees Bean he is so hard to contain Wes and that was with his left hand people say he doesnt drive to his left well I would beg to differ twopoint lead for the Cavaliers Carrington tried to get by mcney took the contact before the shot Isaac mcne is going to pick up the foul Ry Steines out from underneath tickets mcney for his first first on Virginia we get a break in the action offensive end no problems mcne a little lean in hes got seven of vir well Tony Bennett comes into the ball game tonight as Virginias coach 107 and 25 at home against the ACC Cavaliers have won 16 straight conference games Dan and they have the longest active home winning streak in the country at 23 this is a great atos sphere and of course the the home court doesnt win any games it takes some pretty good players playing on the home team and Virginia certainly has had that although this team I mean I think this has been a great coaching job by the entire Virginia staff because I think this team is certainly a whole greater than the sum of it Parts kind of bunch you see theyre five ahead of four schools and the ball belongs to the Panthers out of the timeout after the McNeely foul Blake Buchanan has come on the floor he wears zero for Virginia as does tane Murray whos wearing 10 from New Zealand three to shoot its got to go up heres low soft Runner Baseline no good feder Rico rips it away from Buchanan new 20 for Carrington heres Henson and buob Carrington a three good The Freshman from Baltimore with his 41st three of the Year Virginia gave up a lot of offensive rebounds early in the year Wes and that was one of the reasons why they struggled and this is a pit team playing very very well you cant afford to give them extra opportunities Murray of course averages about 13 minutes a game off coach Bennetts bench against the conference heres beatman Baseline done against Henson pivot out with six to shoot pman trying to take Carrington on the drive rightand or no good thats good defense Beakmans trying to get in the lane pit is trying to prevent him from doing Applause that keep in mind Neely just picked up that foul you dont want him to get his second one low long two and beatman will chase it down Dan it feels like a lot of activity at both ends offensively occurring kind of in that foul line area extended now Virginia during this streak West theyve done a great job scoring in the lane area heres Buchanan Cavaliers back in front Blake is from Corine and Idaho three and a half against the theres a perfect example of what were talking about they get the ball into the lane the defense collapses nice pass by dun low thats ishma good leg it knocks down the triple Junior transfer from Rhode Island out of Prince Georges County in Maryland hes averaging 10 and a half against the leag Panthers have already made three Applause threepointers pit comes in averaging almost well a little more than nine a game its number one in the ACC here is dun working hard and had it batted away recovered and cant get the jumper to fall from the Baseline its really good defense by Hinson and I think its a good idea by dun to attack him carington and one on the triple Murray picked up the foul and Bob Carrington in his first trip into the building just pulled up on transition from three and knocked down Wes when you take a tough shot that gives your opponent the opportunity to get out and go and nobody stops him Murray gets caught in some traffic in the lane thats what pin would really like to do so thats another three four in the game now and hes got an opportunity to make it a fourpoint play Carringtons 83 at the line GMO Diaz Graham has checked into the ball game along with Will Jeffers for pit that is seven now for Carrington Virginia has brought Jake Gro Off the Bench he comes in the grad transfer from Oklahoma hes got the ball wearing Applause 34 pakman stays out on the floor hes Virginias leader almost 8 minutes gone this first half and Pittsburghs built a sixpoint lead on Virginia heres pman all the way into the lane and he will score on the bouns tough shot four points for Reese bigman again he goes all the way goes all the away with his left hand West pit did a nice job cutting him off that is a very difficult shot and an important one for Virginia I dont think they can afford to fall far behind fourpoint lead for pit Diaz Graham heres Austin pit doing this with Henson over there on the bench along with low long three Carrington barely got to the rim heres the rebound for bman Cavaliers in transition Groves whos at four straight double figure games bman again on the drive Diaz Graham the rebound legot can really push the basketball up the floor here Dan he can and Virginia does a great job getting back Diaz Graham a three so pit has come in here guo knocks down his 19th three of the year theyre on a 102 run are the Panthers and its just raining threes for the Panthers Applause wests Pits got five threes of their eight made field goals here in the first nine minutes and Applause change Gro tries to answer and does Jake Ross a 51 threepoint shooter knocks down that one so its a fourpoint game and we get a timeout leged finds guo Diaz Graham pit at one end and then heres Jake Groves off the top of the circle for another in the building early Dan wow they brought their shooting stroke West but they also brought their ball movement theyve done a nice job getting the ball around the perimeter getting it inside and outside theyve made five threepointers but 10 of their 15 field goal attempts have been from three and thats because theyve driven Virginia back into the lane and created those open opportunity you see the details on their threepoint shooting and here is Carrington on a d hell slip it to Austin hell launch and its a back rim Miss they crash the glass and out of there comes Dante Harris the junior transfer of course from Georgetown in our nations capital Jeff stays on the floor with Diaz Graham Austin Le and Carrington and there is a foul and its going to be on will jeffris 20yearold Junior from Erie its his first its the first on pit did and Jeffers will come out and Henson promptly returns for Jeff cable obviously particular with this lineup in the game for Virginia mcne is going to get an awful lot of attention and here is mcne you see Carrington trying to play over the top of the Buchanan screen five to shoot Buchanan against Diaz Graham and leg it and Diaz Graham forced the turnover you can is not the guy you want to have it at the end of the shot callock gero hands to Ley step away three is an air ball recovered Harris Virginia trying to run here one short on the transition chance wont T Harris hell go all the way through but miss the reverse 40 points in 10 12 minutes Dan thats a lot for Virginia in this building its particular theyve given up 22 already Wes and thats a lot for them to give up Carrington on the drive against roie and Dan were going back to Pits ability to drive the ball here thats what pits looking to do Wes theyre looking to drive the ball Drive the defense back and then kick it out they are really good at getting into the lane and then spraying the ball around Jaylen low for Bob Carrington in Jeff Cables Applause lineup and there is carington checking out freshman from Baltimore who leads pit and scoring in all games at 132 Blake Hensons their scoring leader in conference play its 16 a game here is Henson now for low ahead of N9 minutes to go in this first half Panthers holding to the fourpoint lead Henson hell take it against Harris Euro got him in the lane and he scores crowd wanted to travel well Wes the definition of a euro is a travel but its legal Applause now its your favorite part of the game right now is it absolutely love those Euro steps McNeely and a scramble at the midcourt area with Leed hell ball will go to Virginia and heres Blake Henson You Can Count him at home well hson again youre theyre driving the ball intoe you can see in my background everybody in the crowd is given the traveling signal and Henson was looking for the n one well Henson is a very optimistic basketball player oh yeah and whats the term you used at Cameron exuberant yes thats it yeah six to shoot for Virginia grow fires again Diaz Graham tapped it away and heres Jaylen low and pit with a sixpoint lead after a quick Offensive start by Virginia Pits defense has tightened up the Cavaliers struggling to find a good shot and theres a turnover Maybe by pit yes open floor its done to the basket a defensive spark for Tony Benn Club this the sophomore his first bucket that is a great play by Harris who created that whole mess and then how about that last step by dun to the basket 8 minutes to go first half fourpoint lead for pit Le it got off the Diaz Graham screen Bennett wanted a moving screen called on Diaz Graham here is low left hand floater too strong mitt Ney into the front Court heres Applause Groves Harris off the screen Harris is a guy looking to drive the ball to create opportunities as well Wes mnia step back at the top and its no good the foul on Leed will get Isaac mcney three free throws when we continue tonight from Charlottesville terrific defensive play out here in the midcourt area gets Ryan dun on the board at John Paul Jones Arena fourpoint lead and you see pits 24 points these are the most points allowed in the first half by Virginia at home home in their six conference games so far this year and Pits got 24 with 7 and 1 half to go I think it speaks to how well pit has played defensively again theyve been able to get in the lane theyve been able to get move the ball 12 of their 19 field goal attempts have been from threepoint range well keep an eye on that Im sure Tony Bennetts well aware Isaac mcne at the line hes 89 first of three is good we told you leads the country in threepoint field goal percentage hes first in the ACC at 51 in conference play talented free throw shooter well West still though hes shooting 51 from out there but you just mentioned hes almost 90 from the free throw line so when you foul him shooting the three you take him from a 50 shooter to a 90 shooter y so hes got 10 and Virginia to within one heres Henson around done stopped by Groves pretty well played defensively by Virginia there t to shoot and Carrington back on the floor with the ball Henson step in three back rim feder Rico tried to keep it alive done there for Virginia and a foul will be called on Austin I believe so Zack Austin the 67 junor transfer from Winston Salem North Carolina his first thats the third on Jeff Cs team boy what a great job by done to go up and get that ball yeah Cavaliers trying to take the lead out front grov crowd here at jpj was ready for Jake to cut that loose well he didnt really look like he was ready to shoot it when he caught it and as well as hes been shooting it you got to be ready all the time Harris finding his way into traffic kicks it for beatman on the Drive Virginia leads the reason he is who he is is that play right there but thats the reason Virginia is who they are too West no Panic at the end of the shot clock they still get a real good shot Seven in a row by the Cavaliers and a turnover by pit here is dun through traffic ooh speeds beatman it got blocked by feder Rico I think Ryan dun got caught between maybe going for a dunk and feeding Reese bman well I think he was going to try to challenge feder Rico and change his mind at the last time and slipped a little bit feder Rico can really run and really block shots and the Virginia Defense has really picked it up dun now gets it to mcne but oh my Isaac MCN from call Pepper missed everything he launched that from up Highway 29 Dan he sure did now he has that kind of range but on that particular occasion Virginia really had an advantage Groves inside against legged roves was trying to post up but the Cavaliers couldnt find it still onepoint lead for Virginia heres Leed and pit and you saw its been three minutes since pit scor yep heres low trying to answer and does a three for the Freshman jayen low as first points of the night averaging nearly 12 against the league push pit back in front thats now six threes out of the Panthers 10 field goals Applause MCN theyit doing a pretty good job defensively Dan here in this first they really are playing well defensively theyre preventing Virginia from getting into the lane except this guy can go anywhere he wants bman left it short and its rebounded by feder Rico but thats a great job by Henson to cut him off Henson is not a guy noted for his defensive prowess but he played really good defense right there under five to go in this first half heres low couldnt get through heres Henson against Gro with t to shoot hell step back for three got it Blake Henson now with nine thats his first triple of the night and so Wes they went in a scoring drought of more than three minutes but now theyve knocked down a couple of threes and the Panthers in front now six nothing run in the last minute for Coach Cel team and the defense has been able to keep Virginia on the perimeter inside dun strong to the raset Ryan Dunn second field goal thats a good cut and a good pass and dun really jumped quickly on that shot he I think he surprised feder Rico still a threepoint lead for the Panthers gambled defeat man Carrington and leged stepped out of bounds caught in the Deep Corner thatll get us to a timeout and even four minutes to play in this first half pit on the road huddled around Jeff cable who by the way turned 49 yesterday with his team traveling here to Charlottesville we told you its always nice when the script Works isnt it we told you about Blake Henson and Isaac mcne at the top Henson has nine in this first half including a three mcne has knocked down two twos a three and three free throws Dan well of course Wes we wouldnt tell you about it if the script didnt work we would just ignore it but yes these two guys have been important factors and Wes the interesting thing about that as you just mentioned with Henson hes got those nine points but he only has one threepoint basket out of the seven that the Panthers have in the first half and pit has done a nice job of creating offense by driving the ball man well thats what pit does they are very strong in the back court they dont really have a back to the basket guy inside heres bman against Carrington now mcney for three over leg and Carrington the rebound of the Miss by the sophomore from Poco West Virginia low tried to run Ro into a screen he played over the top nicely thats hard to get by Reese beakman without some help of with a screen jayen low on a reroute against RO with the left hand fell off the iron feder Rico tried to keep it alive for controls good block out by grov I mean he actually had to fight him to keep him away from the ball Groves on the attack now will leave it for bakman pit doing a really good job pressuring Virginias threepoint Shooters y inside three to go seven to shoot heres dun B away two is good boy six for Ryan dun in this first half Dan last four games he only averaged three and 12 points on six of 11 field goal shooting now hes not a threepoint shooter Wes but he needs to do that drive the ball to the basket get those close and midrange shots Cavaliers to within one Henson leg thought about it on roie drives Baseline shoves it to feder Rico he traveled y see that wasnt a Euro so theyll call that feder Rico knew what he wanted to do with it but in the process he wanted to see if he couldnt get Gro to commit and pit ends with a turnover theyre not looking for a lot of offense feder Rico hes in there to rebound to play defense to run on the break in traffic theres Gro second field goal for Jake gross first twopointer row for Virginia now pushes them in front and weve seen streaks in this game Wes each team runs at the other one final two minutes of the first half from Charlottes Le for Henson dun defends him with t to shoot hson will fire its partially blocked Dunn got a hand up there play by Ryan Dunn hes a tremendous Defender grows for the lead couldnt extended and thats a quick shot in the Virginia offense but he was wide open look at that feder Rico missed the bounce pass right to low and the three no good and Jaylen low goes to get his own re rebound and picks up a Cavalier foul along the way boy thats a mistake by ro West you have to block out the shooter this is thats the second time in the game weve seen the ball come off and basically come right back to the shooter the first time Ryan Dunn blocked out that time Ro didnt yep foul is on Groves oh no Ryan Dunn its his first it is four on Virginia in this first half and you see Ro hes just behind the play and dun didnt mean to do that he just ran into him onepoint lead for the Cavaliers Carrington trying to get something going here Bob with seven to shoot cant get around mcne uses a Diaz Graham screen and then he threw it to Tony Bennett well you know hinsons a good threepoint shooter Tony Bennett was a great threepoint shooter Jeff cable not happy that Tony Bennett almost caught the pass Tony Bennett Show just some quickness getting out of the way little more dis pointed Isaiah Wilkins on the Virginia bench didnt make a play not to mention Jason wiford over there whos also Applause capable inside heres Gro the catch that a tough pass yeah inside of a minute to go t to shoot for the Cavaliers here bman picked up on the dribble and Hanson deflected it or it would have been a Virginia turnover five on the shot clock and you see 522 to go in this first half at Charlottesville thats a bad break for pit and that really helps Virginia now to get to have a set play to try to score in the last 5 Seconds of the shot call see they try and get it to pman it is done and he thought about driving Diaz gram hson after Carrington knocked it away kaps its a good idea but great defense by Carrington time out so onepoint lead for Virginia Jeff cable a timeout Music in well dont forget ACC Network coming up on Saturday we got a triple header for you Dan and I will be in Chapel Hill for North Carolina Virginia Tech second meeting of the year then Miami at Boston College presented by food line the pit Panthers will host Louisville second meeting of the Year between those two at 630 all here on acc Network Jeff Cables team trying to win not just their fifth Road game pitch trying to beat Virginia in Charlottesville for just the second time tonights the 25th meeting between the two Virginias won eight of the last nine last year pit won a threepoint game at the Peterson Event Center here is low with a half minute to go in this first frame and the Panthers trailing a point low on the drive against bman Diaz Graham for the lead and its good guo from in the corner got six Wesson again the defense collapses Groves got a little too far off that time I think in that situation you have to rely on Reese pman to keep hold up his end of the bargain nine lead changes in this first half and heres a turn to Le and hes fouled by bman trying to get down the floor before the final two seconds go off the clock I think theyre going to review that West theyre going to call that a flagrant foul so the foul is on beakman its going to be his first its the fifth on Virginia pman turns the ball over and just wraps his arms around him thats by definition Wes they used to call that an intentional foul and this is where the flagrant foul came in hes not making a play on the ball hes just wrapping his arms around Applause him so Tony Bennett with some instruction here while BR o Connell it is going to be a flagrant one on Reese bman and Dans going to visit with Brian oconnell here so itll be a flagrant on beakman two shots for ishma leet I thinks going to shoot the free throws on the flagrant at 82 hes the ninth best free throw shooter in the ACC and this is interesting because Virginia has the ball with a chance to get the last shot and instead theyre going to give up two free throws and then Pits going to still have two seconds to get the last shot first of the two for Le is good four in this first half for the young man from Prince Georges County Maryland and of course West this isnt technical foul its a flagrant foul so on a flagrant foul the guy who is fouled is the one who shoots right and in pits case that probably would have been the guy anyway right five for low or five for Leed in this first half and the lead is four for pit and a chance for more as you noted well did you get enough time to catch it dribble and shoot it heres Carrington with two launches for three missed everything halftime here in Charlottesville so Pittsburgh came out shot it beautifully Dan to start the ball game weve had nine lead changes in the first 20 minutes well really good first half by pit both offensively and defensively and when you make eight threes in a half youre in pretty good shape 3531 Pittsburgh leads number 21 Virginia here at the half heres West with that short preparation I think its its more visible on the offensive end than the defensive end yes Virginias given up 35 points and thats more than usual but its hard to limit your opponent when they make eight threes heres Hinson at the top to start the half and it rolls in that is 12 now for Hinson and that is his second three of the ball game and the lead balloons to its biggest of the night of seven and Virginia has really struggled to score West out front Ro to answer and done first point to the night for the sophomore transfer from Milwaukee thats a big basket Virginia is a team they average almost 193o attempts per game they only had six in the first half so the Panthers did a really nice job limiting their threepoint opportunities feder Rico hands to low cuts it right back inside feder Rico had it roll off the rim and Ryan dun collects well he barely got himself back in bounds he did very close we might have to have another look to see if he actually made it here is beatman curling around off the window and in Cavaliers a little bit more aggressive in terms of the early phase of the offense it looks like in two possessions much better Movement by the Cavaliers on the offensive end five in a row cuts the pit lead to two Carrington heres feder Rico hes not going to hurt you from the free throw line Carrington will though got all the way down fed feder Rico and a foul will be called I believe here on miner and it is on Jordan Miner itll be his first its first another look here Ryan Dunn now watch him off the in Applause line o but he had he was he had that one foot dont have both feet in Bound he had that one foot in Bound okay this in the NFL two on Su one on Saturday its easy way to remember that Carrington tend to shoot Henson against Dunn is Carrington back for Hinson over Miner off the back rim pulled away by beatman the key there for Virginia was they were able to keep Carrington out of the lane two minutes in Tony Bennetts got Blake Buchanan at the table heres Ro feeding to Miner and a scooping score how about that Virginias tied it on the second field goal to the Night by The gr transfer from Mart right if you can get it inside west then I think thats a good move on Virginias part particularly when a guy as powerful as Miner can go up against feder Rico and feder Rico is fouled on on his attempt to deliver the basketball second on miner second on Virginia and Blake Buchanan was coming for or Jordan anyway so Jordan Miner will take a seat and hes going to sit between Ron Sanchez and Isaiah Wilkins on that Virginia bench for a little bit of a white board session it looks like with Isaiah feder Rico against Buchanan and Buchanan knocked it away heres D with the pit turnover crosses over for the lead and a foul and its going to be on feder Rico feder Rico picked up that foul but he actually did a pretty good job Wes not here he turns the ball over again feder Rico is not a danger out there but look at feder Rico move his feet and stay between Dunn and the basket and force a tough shot although he did pick up the foul so heres Don at the line not a particularly strong free throw shooter at 58 and the first one is short dont forget Thursday another womens basketball double header for you on acc Network and the ESPN app and of course NC State is at Notre Dame terrific match up there Neil iy and Westmore and then the night cap is in blackburg Kenny Brooks in Virginia Tech at number 12 in the country welcome Duke at 800 its all on acc Network and all on the ESPN app done missed them both and Virginia is not a great free throw shooting team West last in the conference and in a tight game you might come back to biking Carrington heres Henson trying to get around d now low right back for a wide open hson three two strong slapped out and Jeff capable will play it off the bounce Zach Austin I think is the guy that was contesting it for pit itll belong to the Cavaliers thats a break for Virginia right there both Dunn and beakman stayed with low and that left Hinson all alone and that is not a very good plan and they got away Applause Music with roie and here is beatman trying to take Carrington off of Buchanan screen nice job by Henson to play off done out beyond the threepoint AR and now beatman lobbing catch Ganan terrific playmaking by the Cavaliers freshman from Idahos got four and pit wols a timeout so three and 1 half in weve got our 10th lead change forgas on a nine nothing run and the Cavaliers who fell behind on an early Henson three take the lead on an alley to Buchanan Buchanon in one minute here in the second half Dan Wy comes in the game makes a defensive play and then he does a nice job rolling to the basket hes ready for the ball and a great pass by beakman but this has been one of the keys to this Cavalier eight game winning streak theyre bringing guys off the bench who make contributions maybe in 10 minutes maybe in two minutes but thats very important when you can bring guys in who can contribute well long way from Northwestern Idaho isnt it my goodness twopoint lead for Virginia heres Henson working against mcne double team coming with Buchanan split it and lays it up an in five and the half 14 tonight for Blake Henson Wes we said it before when Henson gets in that position he is shooting the ball hes not passing very poor double team by Virginia that time mcney against low the Canon stays on the floor by the way in the timeout where it looked like he was just coming for a coaching session with Miner here is beatman and one on the bounce 10 for beatman Virginia breaks the 40 all tie on the foul free throws when we continue from Charlottesville oh ree Beakmans going to be involved here tonight folks the allstar break Dan and Ki Clarks here tonight at jpj of course the Pryor of one of the greatest plays in NCAA tournament history a national champion the accs alltime leader and assist right he would he was here for a long time so people are used to seeing him and they welcome him back yes they do now playing with the the Bucks gleague team re and here is Rees bman of Tony Bennetts current iteration of the Cavaliers trying to complete a threepoint play and does with the free throw and bman West in this game has 11 points six rebounds and five assists and hes got 13 double figure games in ACC play only the game at Louisville the night he failed to reach that and he had nine points in that game Cavaliers by three heres feder Rico in the corner Leed jump shooting for the tie and its good ishma Leed now with thats his second three of the game and Ro had to drop all the way down in there and he stopped feder Rico but that left leg It Wide Open and pit continues to be hot from the threepoint Applause line heres mcney dun now roie back for Dunn nice play by the Cavaliers you can play off Dunn if hes out beyond the threepoint line but Dunn did a really nice job stepping in on the the pass you got to guard him when hes in the middle of the lane tell you what were seeing some really good coaching tonight too in terms of plays and working against the other team and what their Tendencies are saw that in consecutive plays by the way heres Henson on the drive hell push it up and in Blake Henson now seven and the half 16 in the ball game W hes really made some plays taking the ball to the basket yeah hes not just a threepoint shooter he shoots a lot of Threes tied it 45 heres mcney and mcne is having a hard time getting open leg it right with him tend to shoot and we get a Brian oconnell whistle and is it on feder Rico I think it is nope Bob Carrington his second third on pit Dan we saw Jeff cable today walk his team through forcing Virginia to make decisions defensively and we saw it here there this is what were talking about Ros got a drop down inside to prevent an easy basket and so they kick it out to a threepoint shooter but thats excellent execution offensively by Applause pit bakman all the way through hell score easily thats way too easy for Jeff Ts liking Im sure well Wes again the scouting report on bigman is make him go left but hes gone left a number of times tonight and been very productive Cavaliers have hit their first seven shots of the half here almost a turnover going to the basket and one for Jaylen low Tony Bennett wanted a carry didnt get Applause it and the basket will count for low and hell get a free Applause throw and Reese bman just ped picked up his third well bigman got that foul West because he slapped his hand Applause down and Im not sure he really made contact but thats almost an automatic for an official when that hand slaps down like that and now the Cavaliers this is going to be a key stretch of the game bman has been their key Guide tonight and here is low for the free throw and left it on the front rim five for jayen low tonight tied at 47 again Dan the Cavaliers have made up that fourpoint half timee deficit but even though theyve made all their shots in the second half they cant get any separation theres mcne and that rolls in Virginia perfect still from the floor 12 for mcne thats his first points since he was fouled on the threepointer well he again theyve really done a nice job preventing him from Catching the ball and he just did a nice job moving without it Diaz Graham for is M leet working all the way through back for Henson three over the top of D is good and theres not much you can do about that dun was right there but again the defense collapses and they kick it out to Henson 19 for Henson on his third three back in front go the Applause Panthers Harris cant get all the way through against Carrington now tane Murray whos also got Groves out there on the floor heres Harris for three and thats Virginias first Miss of the second half leot and the Panthers stopping and shooting at a two for leot and its pulled away by Virginia wellon Harris has only made two threes all year hes now 0 for nine in ACC play so Pits very comfortable with him shooting the ball from out there here is Groves all the way in left it on the front rim knocked out of bounds last Touch by dun says Ry Applause Stein this a situation with Groves I mean thats a shot that he would normally make and as well as he has been shooting the ball hes very frustrated he missed that one done clearly knocked it out of bounds but again pit doing a nice job pressuring the ball without fouling in there Carrington against McNeely oh Diaz Graham all the way to the basket wide open and guo and now has eight in the ball game well Wes I didnt think he was going to turn around and look at the basket to see how wide open he was threepoint lead for the Panthers Murray for McNeely leg it right there won that last play was a product of pitch threepoint shooter no look for Murray what a pass by mcne first bucket for tane Murray what a great cut by Murray again with bakman out of the game this is a key stretch for Virginia onepoint lead for pit Carrington foul on again they skip it for the Leander low good for three so Wes the last time they dont collapse on Graham and he gets it too that time they do collapse on Graham and he kicks it out for a three the lead is four for pit under 11 to go in Charlottesville the Panthers are executing a very wellconceived game plan yep Murray on the drive Harris back from Murrays three Carrington recovers it and this is a situation if youre Virginia you dont want to get frustrated on the offensive end but youre having a tough time scoring so you have to dig in defensively heres Buchanan trying to help on Carrington thats a a mismatch though isnt it Dan yes it is heres Carrington now Buchanan going to play it straight up left side Leed feeling it and a foul going to be called as Diaz Graham got thrown down in The Fray and its going to be on Gro so Jake gross from Spokane draws his first four on Virginia tell you what now the playmaking by pit at the offensive end has State the Panthers to a fourpoint lead team has come in here tonight Dan theyre operating from behind the line 12 threes in the ball game thats the most Allowed by Virginia team this year they had allowed 11 to Notre Dame and 11 to Virginia Tech and you see their numbers and in particular Dan 45 of their field goal attempts are threes W obviously we said theyre a threepoint shooting team but they create there they havent created very many threes in transition but they create their threes by forcing the defense to collapse either with the dribble or the pass and then kicking it out theyve got five guys tonight who have made at least two threepoint baskets so it hasnt just all been Blake Hinson hes got three Panthers hit 12 in the ball game at Louisville and there Hinson has four is a Pinson three again out of the timeout Blake Henson now is starting to do Blake Henson things hes got 22 won I think were at a danger point in this game for Virginia they started the second half so hot and yet they still have fallen behind here is Leed off the turnover Cavaliers are trying to catch another guy sliding back door Diaz Graham stepped right in front Carrington for Diaz Graham against Buchanan well youre a team built on defense and so now you got to get some stops Carrington underneath look at the ball movement heres legot going back Baseline against Buchanan rolled off the side iron good job by Buchanan just goes straight up for productive minutes for Buchanan Dan absolutely now Virginias got to put they started the half very hot theyve cooled off here recently beatman rewinds on the dribble and were going to get a hand check on pit and the other thing that the Panthers have done really well here in the second half West they are playing off Ryan Dunn when he goes out beyond the threepoint line Carringtons third its the fourth on pit and here is Zack Austin checking in to replace Bob Carrington well Carrington goes out but with Leed in the game along with low the Panthers are pretty deep at that guard spot sevenpoint lead for pit heres Murray Ro had a three to start the proceedings for Virginia early in this half boy Ro missed done on a mismatch inside now Murray working against Henson all the way in and tame Murray fouled on the drive and its going to beond the senior from Deltona Florida Blake Henson fifth on pit and thats going to send tane Murray from the north island of New Zealand where hes just 10 of 16 at the free throw line to the strip for a pair here and the first from Murray is no good dont forget ACC softballs underway the Shriners childrens Clearwater Invitational is on acc Network action starts on Thursday with a pair of games games you see action continuing on Friday Saturday and Sunday involving ACC schools Carolina and Georgia Tech the two member schools over the weekend on just a terrific event that opens each softball campaign out in clear waterer one of two from Murray its a sixpoint Pittsburgh Advantage here Diaz Graham now legged against roie leg it for low T to shoot here goes Jaylen low against maybe the best on ball defender in the league Diaz Graham a three wont go kept alive and Austin tried to track it down couldnt save it before it bounced on the line in the far Corner W Diaz Graham missed that but he had a wide open opportunity very late close out by Buchanan but again drawing the defense in and then kicking it out for the three yep sixpoint Advantage for pit Applause beatman circling Applause around 12 to shoot roie for Buchanan Fall Away bounced away low the recovery and the other thing that the Panthers have done really well West is rebound the ball defensively pit is a good defensive rebounding team and theyve certainly shown that tonight there theres low and hes fouled by Buchanan so Blake Buchanan draws his first five on the half on Virginia Pittsburgh up six the under eight in Music Charlottesville sixpoint lead for the Panthers under eight to go and Jeff capable who turned 49 years of age yesterday had an open date over the weekend so what do you do on your open date well Jeff cable went home to South View High School in fville North Carolina to have his jersey number retired Dan there you go an amazing accomplishment a guy who is uh who has done just a marvelous job in building back pit basketball boy sure has they were in woeful condition when he took over low all the way through the runner good jayen low with another big bucket seven of his 10 in the second half its his seventh double figure Dan in the last eight games and and when he gets in the lane with that little floater West thats almost automatic bman on the drive leg it there and one coming for Reese Batman but thats a big basket West but you know its its weird to say this about Virginia but if youre going to Rally in the game you cant just trade baskets you got to get some stops in Virginia the last couple possessions has had problems getting stops leg at the foul it was his second it is six on Virginia or rather pit so bakman will go to the line here where he hit a free throw a moment ago and misses that opportunity at the threepoint trip well now Virginias five of nine from the threepoint line from the free throw line West they only have eight threepoint attempts pit wanted to run them off the threepoint line and theyve done that Diaz Graham thought about it now hell take it down the lane cant score it leg at the rebound and a foul on Virginia dun is shaken up Leed took a tumble and Clarence Armstrongs got a whistle and its on Ryan Dunn the guy who was on the floor holding his head draws his second and the six on the Cavaliers look like they called a trip Dunn comes over does a nice job he got that one and he falls down and yeah he kicked his leg out and got thats pretty talented to get a foul when youre laying on the ground first of two for Le no good dont forget triple header of ACC basketball coming up on Saturday well start in Chapel Hill tar Hills and hes for a second time Miami at Boston College at Four Louisville at pit 630 all on acc Network Le it and the crowd does not get the bacon well theyre interested in the bacon but theyre also interested in trying their team winning this game so they could have used another Miss sevenpoint Lead for pit seven to go here at Charlottesville crosscourt pass this is roie long two and the rebound for Hinson you didnt like the shot I did not but what I liked was the defense by leged he went out there and ran roie off the threepoint line and thats what pit was trying to do heaz Graham thought about the Hedge grow beat on the double now low trying to get into traffic slips it to Carrington hell skip it this is Henson step away three and the corner is good Blake Henson that is four threes in the half five in the game the lead is 10 with 628 to play and Hensons Road Show in this league continues Dan well and its not like he doesnt have pressure a great fake well Pittsburgh tonight trying to get their seventh win in the league it would be their second win in Charlottesville if its been 50 years since pit beat Virginia they did it at University Hall January 2nd 1974 in front of 803 Billy Knight had 34 points and 16 rebounds Gus Gerard LED Virginia with 25 and Dan boner had two points three rebounds four assists in the panther Victory wow I had four assists you had four assists and I checked the turnovers it wasnt as bad as you thought what well I remember pit coming in and laying One on US Leed commence his third seven on pit Dan with 618 to play so heres a one and one for Reese beakman and the front end rolls in 10 in the game now for Applause beakman you know what else is on the line tonight that right there 23 straight wins it John Paul Jones Arena pakman hits them both its an eightpoint game well West Virginias going to have some work to do here they started out this second half very hot but they have cooled off Carrington against grov whos coming to the ball game but their biggest problem has been on this end they cant get a stop Carrington tried to take Gro to the basket ball got knocked away Brian oconnell says no foul turned over by pit The Freshman wanted a foul didnt get it West there was a lot of contact there but I thought Carrington initiated all of it under six to go heres pman trying to drive Applause again grows for three nope Diaz Graham tried to keep it alive and leg finally pulled it away against Ryan dun Le it at 63 is pits leading rebounder and that was a very strong rebound right there Henson for Carrington left side here is jayen low this freshman plays with a lot of poise Dan especially on the road the ACC heres low hell take grow into traffic Fall Away got it jayen low now has nine in the half a dozen in the ball game and its a 10point lead again ahead of 5 minutes and he just continues to make big shots West bman with Carrington heres McNeely tried to go back to Dun turned over here is Leed hes got to beat two guys to the basket he does it Henson however cleans up the Miss Wes I thought that was a situation where the pass was going to the right spot but Dunn just stood there he had to step into that pass and I think he had an easy basket larous lead of the night now for the Panthers of a dozen Hensons got 27 in the ball game W and Virginia just is all out of sorts on offense right at the moment Carrington will walk it to the midcourt area get it to Jaylen Music low won this game was tied at 47 here is low again on the drive tried to slip it away got deflected out of bounds last Touch by Virginia with nine to Applause Music shoot W without making threepoint shots its going to be hard for Virginia to come back in this game and the Panthers have done a really good job defending the three not just defending it but eliminating it the Cavaliers have only attempted nine threes on the evening Henson another three missed everything that time and roie will box out leg it and it will belong to Virginia here just ahead of four minutes to go pit is six of 11 from behind the threepoint line in the second half Dan and they were like eight for 19 in the first half so yep heres mcney thats a nice job by low to be right there when he catches the ball so he has no chance to shoot the three mcne on the drive against Henson now for RO over Carrington two strong Henson the rebound and again this Virginia struggles to score Wes and so when you need a lot of points in a short period of time guys start to press you see pit gets the offense going with this High weave and now heres Carrington settling in three pointer away and the long rebound will be collected by ishma lean and Jeff Cel tell him just back it out they got a new 20 be about 3 minutes to go when this possession ends heres Carrington all the way in with the left hand and scores Bob Carringtons now got nine and Pitts got a 14point lead with less than three to play West mcney has done a pretty good job most of the night keeping Carrington in front of him but not that time how about these freshman guards making plays down the stretch y Le it the transfer for mod Islands been huge jayen low and Carrington as of late especially on the road in hostile environments he likes hostile environments Wes and you saw him score on the inside and hes gotten hot from the threepoint line in the second half and when he gets HED look out if youre the opposition and its really been a problem for the Panthers or for Virginia tonight heres the 40 factor for pit when the Panthers get two guys to 40 or more in a conference game look what happens they had 41 of Hinson and Austin 41 of hson and low at Duke Leed and Carrington 46 at Virginia tonight Henson and low are a point off with 254 to go Dan well you figured theyre going to get some chances as the game goes on and Virginia desperately in need of a basket here mcney misses on the three leg at the rebound but it was a highly contested three low has done a really nice job on the defensive end as well yep Jaylen low in his first appearance at the John Paul Jones Arena as freshman from Missouri City Texas is just a Fearless player it feels like in this kind of resurgence of the Panthers heres low caught in a double team got to get rid of it fires to Diaz Graham heres ishma Leed hell beat tane Murray to the basket cant score as the shot clock goes off and Murray sticks around to grab the board now the cers have to push it Wes sure do Murray Groves quickly heres mcne over Diaz Graham for three thats great ball movement 15 for Isaac mcney 11point game inside of two minutes and when Virginia has success West generally they can force turnovers and score points off turnovers but they havent had much luck there tonight here is low ski in for Leed out of the corner for three bounces out Diaz Graham tried to save it did to Le and a timeout call by pit with leit on all fours Gathering the basketball but Diaz Graham was trying to tip it and I thought it was going out of bounds how leg it can control it I do not know so pit gets into the Huddle here on the 32 timeout you see Jeff cable huddle with his group they end up with a new 20 out of it by the way and just 143 to go Dan does Virginia have to extend this game on Miss shots now I mean youre down 11 obviously you want to get offensive stops but if you dont do you have to force Pit to go the free throw and Panthers fairly talented free throw at the strip tonight theyre four of six thats not a broad sample of work though well they Virginia has kept them off the free throw line but youre not usually getting all the way to the basket when youre shooting so many threes so its been a very interesting thing but the answer to your question Wes is yes at this point in the ball game down by 11 points it it doesnt really help you if it takes 20 seconds before you get a stop youve got to get the ball back so I think you got to start sending the Panthers to the Applause line so the Baseline out of bounds its a spot throw in for Bob Carrington and the Panthers really like to run Hinson to the corner on this although they keep him out at the top of the key now look at low caught in a double team bounces to Carrington McNeely finds him defensively with 10 to shoot carington going to try and take the Cavaliers off the dribble had it slapped away four to shoot heres leot hell work back Baseline hanging to no good and Virginia out of there with it then leg it reached in knocked it away and a shot clock violation is going to be called by Clarence Armstrong against Pittsburgh yeah thats the right Applause Music call you know Virginia came out of there with it but the ball never hit the rim and now theyre I think theyre going to have to put some time back on the clock West so Jeff capable meanwhile instructions to Jaylen loow just settle down and communicate see that that they reset the shot clock to 30 but the ball never hit the rim and its a loose ball so theyve got to go back to the shot Applause attempt so BR o Connell feels pretty good hes ready to break up both huddles here heres the look now Dy your point did the ball hit the rim here cuz that would precipitate a reset it did not as you indicated ball never hit the rim and so they reset it to 30 because they thought Virginia had the ball but nobody had the ball it was rolling down the court so they put one second back on the clock and you give credit where credit is due here good piece of officiating by this crew of Clarence Armstrong Bri oon Ramy Applause Stein 120 to go its 11point pit lead trying to snap the nations longest home win streak Virginias won 23 in a row nely a three it spins out Diaz Graham the rebound and theres the foul by dun with 71 seconds to go third on dun seven on Virginia so the parade of free throw shooters will start for pit and an 11point lead here and again Wes all at game long pit has limited Virginias opportunities from Beyond the threepoint Arc and with this kind of a lead this late in the game pit only has to to defend the threepoint Arc front end of the one and one is no good Diaz Graham kept it alive and Henson slapped it into the back court low will run it down and that does nothing but help hit right there you get what you wanted weson you cant get the rebound and that is now in this game that is now nine offensive rebounds for the pit Panthers T Murray second that is eight now on Virginia excuse me that is 11 offensive rebounds Lego to go to the line dont forget Thursday night double header of ACC womens basketball 1000 well get you nothing but net Kelsey rigs in the group review preview of The Weekend ahead and all the highlights and Analysis nothing but net on acc Network and we got a terrific double header for you coming up on Thursday night starts at six and earlier in the season when Virginia was struggling one of the things that they struggled with was giving up offensive rebounds and again pit has 11 of those today and theyve scored 11 Second Chance points and so that has been a factor in addition to their threepoint shooting 72 to 59 beatman drives Diaz Graham to the basket and scores so Reese Beakmans basket and a quick foul on Isaac mcney that is nine on Virginia and if youre the Panthers at this point West when Virginia has the ball youre trying not to commit any fouls youre trying not to allow them to score real easily but if they run six or seven seconds off the clock and get a two youre not worried about that leg at the front end of the one and one is good Dan weve had a chance to see Jeff cable team win in Durham Then followed up with a win in Atlanta they won last Wednesday in Raleigh against NC State and now theyre getting ready to put their fifth AC DC road Wi on the board here Wesson its its not like you know you win at Duke and you win at Virginia heres pakman of three leg at the rebound 40 seconds left to go and Virginias just backing off yep sure are 7461 this crowd here at John Paul Jones Arena is going to head for the exits and the ascent of the pit Panthers continues what a performance by pit yep I mean they came in here not only are they going to break a 23 game winning streak but Virginia at eight straight wins was the hottest team in the ACC yeah they had won 16 straight conference games at home and theres a foul on Diaz Graham after Gro recovered the Miss and for 49yearold Jeff cable this might be the best birthday present well very well might be Wes but his team came in here very well prepared they knew what they wanted to do they executed a very good game plan foul on leget will be his fourth or Diaz Graham was the ticket Im sorry his first and grow hit the free throw won remember Virginia came out in the second half and made their first seven shots but despite that fact Jeff cable guys the score was tied at 47 and then Virginia went cold and pit kept up with the threepoint barrage well this will do it Pits going to beat Virginia in Charlottesville for just the second time in their basketball history it had been 50 years since the Panthers had beaten the Cavaliers at Old U Hall but tonight here at John Paul Jones Arena they snap Virginias 23 game win streak at home and they do it tonight convincingly 74 63 W of
