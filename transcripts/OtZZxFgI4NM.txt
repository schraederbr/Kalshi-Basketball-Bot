manipulate the game at times hes perfect for Pat Kelce hes also started 134 games in college basketball hes played 134 too thats knocked out of bouns off a tip it will belong to Louisville the winner of this game to the ACC tournament semis and Louisville will begin the game Without Rain Smith thats a big loss R Smith suffered a left ankle injury against California last week is their third leading score 13 and a half a game and their best threepoint shooter and he is still dayto day but out tonight so that means Noah Waterman moves into the starting five Terrence Edwards Jr an all ACC pick feeds James Scott whose layup is too strong and the first possession for the Stanford Cardinal who rolled out the same five as yesterday jayen Blakes a Duke transfer one of the most improved players in any power conference oiah sers and Ryan agarwall the guards The Freshman Donovan young and Maxim Rayo heres Renos first touch 23 and8 in the win over Cal last night and Reno airballs a shot with James Scott in his face heres Noah Waterman looking like R Smith his first touch and he cans it open three really good start for lvo and ultimately defensively it starts with Chucky heper hes so good on the basketball digging down on Reno just making you uncomfortable takes a pass and lean away just with active hands 20 win season for the Stanford Cardinal in their first year in the ACC picked 17th out of 18 teams here they are the seven seed in the quarters Blakes misses a turnaround and its grabbed by James Scott heurn Waterman Scott Terrence Edwards the alc player and Javon Hadley who could have been a fabulous starting five for Louisville which is a very very thin team due to injuries but theyve been working through that all year Edwards step back three is into the hands of Applause Blakes sellers thought about a pullup into rno instead working on Waterman bumped and throws up a wild one and the ball emerges in the hands of Scott R knows first two shots have not even hit the rim Corner three Hadley missed it Waterman tries to track it down and he does saves it to Edwards and now Waterman back out top throws it into the hands of awaiting sellers a USC transfer spins it out Renos on the offensive glass Blakes and it is an ugly start Stanford is 0 for Four Louisville one for four well it started with some tough shots from Reno and hes got to set the tone and be patient early he bir sets up Waterman again hes got the the first two threes its just great offensive action all set up by Chucky heurn and hes not reading his offensive player right hes reading the roll but hes looking at who takes the roll guy away if the backside guy drops down hes throwing that skip to the open Waterman in the corner no a breath J A 27 threepoint shooter and there is Reno whos been yapping about getting fouled the last couple of trips inside to Hadley he is smothered by The Freshman Young 68 freshman at of Pasco Washington with a rejection just have to remember how hard Reno had to work yesterday that was one heck of a contest between Rivals albeit rivals in a different conference I guess they could still be conference Rivals just a different conference but still as fearsome Rivals as ever sellers back ribs it tip to scottt Louisville Cardinals winners of nine straight theyre 19 and one in the last 20 one of the hottest teams in the nation Edwards left it short for Reno you almost get the sense though that that Louisville earlier this season was pretty good but we didnt know how good they were and they needed to develop a feel and a confidence that they are as good as theyre playing right now and theyre really good at taking the ball away Scott runs the break he has it stripped took away by Agarwal Jaylen Blakes got a hand in there one of the ACC leaders in steals theres a big difference between we hope we can be good and we know we are sure they were also picked well below where they finished they were picked ninth in the lead hard to know where L was going to finish with an entire new team and Reno on a little slip in from Blakes has the first FL yeah a good job by Blakes by playing off that screen and kind of get the defender on his back and just freezing sometimes the more patience you have in the paint the more things open up Chucky heurn 16 points six assists per game First Team all accer lobs it up for Scott its taken by Young thats the third Louisville turnover theres agrawal in all kinds of trouble Blakes was the outlet sellers ready for a go ahead three tell you anytime you get the ball in that block youve got to welcome the extra Defender and look out to the open man the one extra pass is going to get you an open look and theres an offensive foul Scott stuck his rear end has been one of the best stories maybe in all of college sports this year tonight theog forh returned 01 of its scoring and they went from the worst two years at program history to one of the best 25 and six 18 wins in the ACC this is a program used to competing for and winning final fours and national titles and in one year under Pat Kelce they look to be right back there well I like the message too cuz I think to some degree when you become a high level Blue Blood program people look at as an opportunity to come get theirs and move on to someplace else I think the guys that are here view this as a responsibility to bring this thing back and thats why revival Revival makes sense coaches do have all sorts of cute stuff hereo sure theres a real tie of the community that frankly you dont get in every College B stop not for sure in these transfer portal days heer a deep three at the end of the clock is off the front of the rim the backboard and eventually into the hands of chisara played a great game Off the Bench along with Benny giler who hit an NBA range Late tiebreaking Three if youre Stanford you have to know when Renos off the floor youve got to be really good defensively now that move offensively that youll take that too but when R Renos off the floor youve got to be solid defensively that was the red shirt freshman Aiden camman who had not scored in 44 minutes over the last three games I feel so badly when I act shocked when somebody makes like a great play I mean this this is almost as if he he didnt have the time to even think about not doing this he just did it instinctually we had a great conversation with Kyle Smith before the game today who said look people thought I was crazy but I thought for years Stanford was the best job in the country and hes so thrilled to be here Columbia San Francisco Washington State he wanted all of those schools and hes winning already at Stanford next time Ill let you get a question in you will nope first time for everything heurn lost it heres agarwall its a N9 nothing Stanford surge Cardinal will have to win this tournament to make it to the NCAA AAR was out of bounds its got to happen at least once a game yep I think the ball movements been good though a lot of east to west if you get that defense to flatten at times you got to get a move in East to West Chase it a little bit again the best offense is really about creating a Chase its not about about scoring running a play to score its about running action to create scoring opportunities L about 4 and A2 minutes without a bucket right now trailing 9 six 7 minutes and change gone by in this quarterfinal heres a bubacar trayor Off the Bench and thats the sixth Lille turnover Applause already Terrence Edwards has to get involved and there have been times where hes had a midrange opportunity but hes continued to take it all the way into the teeth of the defense where there really wasnt anything there hes got to be a scorer hes only taken two shots he hasnt hit either so far geler into the defensive player of the year in the league heurn now its oara and heper knocks it away with one to shoot I think they got it I think they got it wrong I Justin pfield confirming that the call is Stan ball and one to shoot thought it was Bars leg but our officials by the way Justin bfield B Smith and Lee Cassell for game three into cman got a hoist and its a shot clock violation shot how about the high and tight on Lee Cassel the the uh Superman of officials by the way the Superman of officials he is hes hes fit Justin porterfields got some fabulous hair as well has not scored since the 1722 Mark they got Edwards on the floor with heord and the Freshman Kai roots in there for the first time Edwards driving into the paint Edwards too strong rebound sellers Edwards is going to have midrange jump shots if he just is patient enough to see it thats going to be a legal screen and its the second foul on camon so its a team R know out of Paris 71 senior 1500 career points here at Stanford where do you think not to send him off a college yet because we cant wait to see him more today and Y if there were more sord G where do you think his game will continue to grow professional look hes got the potential to be an NBA Pro he can space the floor hes got a good feel for it hes got to learn how to play with physicality and hes got to learn how to defend and at the next level for a guy like him to be able to defend it also means you got to know how to hide yourself at times because the NBA does a great job of exposing matchups that they like so hes got a ways to go but regardless this is a guy whos going to make a lot of money playing basketball Renos got four Stanfords nine tonight Louisville just snapped a 5 minute 54 second score scoring drought one freee throw by Chucky heer an ugly Offensive start and it gets uglier Stanford and aara turn it over you see what ball pressure does though I mean just you know active hands yell talk communicate as a defense I always tell you communication is actually really disruptive for an offense youre trying to operate and read the defense and the defense is communicating really well it makes you at least stop and think good ball pressure good communication really hard to attack that on as an offense and if anybodys ever attended a Louisville shoot around or practice you know communication is key Pat Kelsey said a couple of weeks ago when I was at one of them we want our managers to be the loudest managers in the country they are yelling they are disruptive theyre chanting all practice the team feeds off that insane energy heer into the paint Tracked Down by raino Stanfords did a really good job of just being presid on the the defensive glass not chasing too much you give up a shot so what contest its more about getting that rebound yeah they really struggled doing that against pal yesterday raino flips it off the front of the Applause rim 9 and a half minutes gone by its 97 and its now 99 that is the James Scott specialty his 72nd dunk of the Year well look you can have a roll guy but ultimately to have that guy and to get a lot out of him you have to have somebody to throw the lob and Chucky heer just masterful in terms of holding the defense and throw it up knocked away from Jaylen Thompson who recovers red shirt sophore didnt play yesterday hes a 14 per game scorer think if youre Louisville you continue to seek out that ball screen and see how theyre going to defend against Chucky hurn he makes good decisions out of it Edwards on the lob another throw down only one hand required for Scott this time so its all about putting Maxim Reno in a ball screen thats what you just asked me the question about what do he like at the next level well thats going to be the concern right there Reno steps out and misses a three its rebounded and kicked inside to Thompson whos then out of bounds really its all about holding your Defender right holding both Defenders right is playing flat there he is hes showing Chucky heper holds him enough and Terrence Edwards does the same they can really expose R know in these ball screen situations if Kyle Smith going to continue to keep him flat really not take anything away with a hard hedge that thats probably going to wear him out too much on the defensive end but youve got to fight over and get back most dunks in the acccs thirdd in the country by the way he suffered a facial fracture last month which is why hes wearing the Hannibal lecor mask Edwards backs his Defender down to give Louisville the Applause lead couple lobs will wake you up heurn extends out on the Blakes best defender as voted by the ACC media members and coaches in the league now Blakes is guarded by Scott and Blakes floats it over him wow what a finish good defense all around I think if Will you could still clap that one up peer behind the back and he misses a three off of waterman at Stanford ball I think Scotts tired he just put his hand up he needs a he needs a break I cant imagine playing with oh my gosh right mask by the way that was 3D printed by the engineering department at Louisville yeah how about it were told there was an attempt access like that it doesnt seem to be getting anywhere to uh the nickname The Silence of the slams because of the annibal Lector mask I dont know why that hasnt caught on its its a great did you make that up no thats what Dana Brown sports information director told us r No 3 is grabbed by Young St has been good on the offensive glass of late 13313 after 12 minutes Rayo tough night for Applause him heres Edwards the third Team all conference pick I just think the good defense has made right now just just kind of force everything oh look out oh Edwards just Okie doed oh fou get raino that made me a little queasy in the legs on that one Carolina but Duke came back in the game behind KH kiple and Kaman malawat and they showed you the balance they have without flag and by the way without Malik Brown who reinjured his left shoulder so that will be must C TV as it always is between Duke and Carolina tomorrow night Edwards and the shot clock desperation he for a Louisville lead you know what everybodys healthy its all about yeah look ACC winning an ACC tournament champions the most important thing were not looking ahead but when you have injuries you got to start to look ahead and think about the real potential the national potential of this Duke team and make sure youre as healthy as as possible for that run how can they be without flag this weekend I mean I dont think anyone feels that badly for Duke given the just Bevy of options theyve got thrown away by The Freshman Roots here sellers finish good good little Pace on this game and I wouldnt say that this pace this up and down this fluidity really favors Stanford but theyve been fine with it partially because I think its been so hard to get good stuff on the the half court offensive end Edward steps back got another hes dangerous when he finds him he really is and thats who he was at JMU he was tough he he would just take tough shots that was almost the responsibility he had was be a tough shot maker and hes had to get comfortable in his new role here and also learn how to win at a higher level Edwards has Louisvilles last eight fourpoint lead 14 minutes gone by in this third quarterfinal theres an elevation by sers really smooth athlete hes got seven 13 Point per game score second most the Cardinal roster heer with all kinds of space he hasnt hit from the field yet that Balls going Stanfords way Applause number hes just dangerous once he finds it theres theres a certain Rhythm that scorers find and you know he got one he got the nice little lob so you make a play that that kind of helps you create a certain Rhythm then you take a shot down the stretch in the shot clock and it goes in look out you have to know as a Defender when a guy like that gets going you just have to take it out of his hands because he becomes more and more dangerous once he sees it fall 21 a game since February 1 shooting 46 from three in that span yep out bounds heer stepped down the line thats the second time thats happened to Stanford so theyve turned it over a bunch as well Chucky heer can be so physical on defense because of his positioning there A lot of times where it looks like he may foul somebody but he does it with the body and then when you watch it back you realize he actually beat the offensive players to that spot turnovers are 77 right now two teams that usually take care of the ball well Stanford on Pace to set a School record for fewest turnovers a game Waterman fighting tooth the nail inside hes got eight really set up by Chucky hurn keeping the dribble alive he goes Baseline continues to dribble all the way through the more he continues with that dribble someones got to pick him up and stop him thats Chucky fourth assist into camman theyve been without Reno for a little bit here and cman throw it off the foot of Noah Waterman lets look at our Philips 66 Big 12 Mens Basketball Championship braacket the game of the day in college basketball was BYU Iowa State probably the best crowd of the day as well BYU Houston what a clash of styles that will be tomorrow in Kansas City Texas Tech Baylors over on ESPN right now and then Arizona and Kansas yeah what style wins out right cuz there are times where I watch Houston Im like they could they could score with people just dont think you want to get into a scoring contest with BYU right now sers Reno back on the floor and Reno gets it to go its the first time weve seen him on balance taking a shot and then Hadley gets down the floor got to the cup and he fights to get his own Miss back but its going to be Stanford ball off of Javon Hadley like Reno hasnt been on balance in the post and that was just a quick decisive move good screen you hold the screen just long enough youre going to get a little more of an ISO look just good balance sit down right shoulder left hook part of it is Kevin you got to find the you got to you got to find a way to be decisive yet patient hard to do against this Lal defense isnt it it is theres Reno swing it to sers his threepointer give Stanford the lead right back and if Reno is not a threepoint shooter sers doesnt get that shot why cuz Reno getting that pick and pop you have to take him away Edwards into geler Edwards finishes with a foul back and forth we go in his turning the ball over at UCLA dribbling it off his knee in the face with a Stanford tree not passing it out of bounds but dribbling it off your knee something like having a 48 GPA dressed as a tree make fun of you yep 2322 the Louisville lead not for long theres Ray no first three of the game I like how they got him involved lifted the entire defense you had to retreat back towards the paint and he can space you to 25 Waterman air mails it just the second off offensive rebound of the game for Louisville why did they get that offensive rebound Kevin it was a terrible shot yes heer one leer and he ties it his first field goal Chucky heper doesnt have to seek out scoring opportunities to score he could just manage the game and they come his way I keeping him down on the Block defensively I love when he just dictates the defense up top Music ker rebound Javon Hadley heer had a monster game three games to go 37 against pit six straight threes at one point in the first half and he travels Applause here Maxim REO you youve got to utilize him as much as possible you got to put him in everything you do we get lost Ryo can take you to 25 hes going to shoot it Chucky heer this are just good oneonone skills got to consider that a high percentage shot rille bench by the way was Furious that there wasnt a foul there yeah I dont know I there was a travel Applause but heres raino in the post lefthanded scores it again again deliberate but he was patient on the seal he was patient by getting his position in the post but then was deliberate on the catch Stanford six for its last seven Waterman and Reno theres a foul thats a critical one its Reno second was a tired foul too and why is he tired well look at the Battle look at the Battle down low I mean how hard hes working and then when he gets it why is he deliberate well you dont want to welcome a double if you have the advantage and anytime Maxim Reno gets the ball on the Block I dont care who hes being covered by hes got an advantage hes a good offensive player we talked to Kyle Smith before the game and you asked him how creative he wanted to be getting REO into different actions something they put a lot of thought into to vary up where he touches the ball and I think you got to look at every every level every layer where its you know threepoint line at a pick and pop situation read what the defense does figure out what youre going to get out of that maybe a pick and roll hold the seal then you got a pick and short roll where you can play a little more face up he is vers like that and its not just about getting those actions or getting to those options to get him a score its get to those actions and options to read how the defense is defending all those different actions hes going to stay in the game with two fouls final two minutes of the half well at least for the offensive possession right Stanford does have the timeout and Reno will draw a foul here its only the second of the half against Louisville by the way coming up at halftime theres is our EC Network crew Taylor tanom Luke hanock hi Luke Carlos Boer hi Carlos hi back of Taylors head college basketball live scoreboard not just for the ACC theyll check on what else is going on around the nation three days from selection Sunday somehow Spilled Out to Sellers and he misses a three Waterman whos had a very busy first half got it lets see who on lville is pay attention to the fact that Raos got two Hepper hes fouled on the way up knocked Away by Donovan young and Chucky will get two free throws what do you do if youre Kyle Smith here do you roll the dice play him on the offensive ENT or try to avoid getting that third I mean look Stanfords Stanfords played really well we had a really bad low there for a few minutes where Waterman was the only one that even scored a A basket with the two threes to start the game is since picked up the key is having Maxim Reno as many minutes as you need him in the Music second heurn had a nice game on senior night against Stanford ended with him kissing the Louisville logo on his way off the court one year not many guys have made as much of an impact in one year as Chucky heer has at Louisville hes really rediscovered a lot of Joy playing basketball and he had a great career it was johon but this has been a new level for him theres a three for agarwall and the red shirt sophomore Ryan agerwal just scored his first points of the tournament I that whole action was awesome right from the top of the key the back cut the extra pass along the Baseline that was big time now the timeout allows you to get raino off the floor Louisville takes it well see if Stanford takes advantage Cardinals got the lead Cardinal had the Louisville timeout help Stanford in that respect they bring on C who does have two Edwards drives into him slithers around him and scores it so now Stanford could call a timeout and get R back in the game and thats exactly what Kyle Smith will do or just big deal for everybody yeah its different kind of a big deal youve been to the tournament you called games you played in the tournament its just a its what you dream of if youre at that lower level its all you want to do if youre Northwestern you know the history of the school great fight wow its aara got a great fight great look was agarwall on the drive and Stanford reclaims the lead Edwards dying moments of the first half tayori passes away from Reno and Hadley misses the three wow well how about this just 5 days ago St hope or not thats up to how you play on the floor and Louisville thats amazing first time trailing an ACC opponent at halftime this season 18 and two they didnt trail with a half and either of the losses theyre down six now its been a really nice night for osiah sellers the USC transfer as the Bakers does it shooting 43 from the threepoint line it also allows them to get their defense set urn spins it out to Edwards leads away with a dozen for Louisville Noah Waterman had nine and heres Chucky hes got five and hes got four assists maybe another yes indeed theyve started both halves with a waterman three just fallen asleep on on the Baseline backside area as a defense good Baseline runner for Waterman he comes over gets wide open still if Im if Im Louisville Im putting Maxim REO in as many ball screens as possible making him defend heres sers off the roll from Reno hes in the post against Edwards and now hes back against Scott as s dribbled right into him Reno is f and score six all right maybe thats why you do it I dont really know if thats whats intended usually when you have the matchup you dont bring the ball right there so they can switch but Reno ends up getting it back again youre so concerned with his ability to shoot it and Scott did whatever he could do to keep raino from getting the shot up look at this sell that slow PP F its so slow you cant believe anybody Falls for it until youre in front of him and you see him go for that pump F its so believable and an early exit thats the third foul on Scott who reached in from behind so remember Louisvilles playing Without Rain Smith hes still dayto day with a left ankle injury now Scott is on the bench early in the half theres rain Smith whos third in the country in three pointers per game do you feel the life for Stamford though absolutely I mean even on that foul you feel it Blakes from behind well there there are different kinds of fouls right there are aggressive fouls theres committed fouls like he just committed to defending were good with that coming up after this game its Clemson theyll be the final team to take the floor here in Charlotte its chefin now thats a look he here for the wrestling tournament looks at Anu to follow E2 a rejection Finds Its way into the hands of abubacar trayor and those are the just the second second chance points second second chance basket should say four points in the game for Louisville I cant keep up with you youll figure it out second Ill be me youll catch up Ray no another hesitant pump fake and the ball finds it way to cam in a happy accident for two also appreciate you dishing that back you the lead is six for the seven seed Stanford in its first ACC tournament Edwards rolling in Waterman in and out and a foul is going to keep it right here whos this on its a big call yeah well see after the replay here think REO just gets it knocked out of his hands thats just kind of how the game goes is that going to be three on three wasnt sure Gos 42 or 52 and its raino so 1738 in the game he leaves with three fouls on a foul like that it Darwell better be obvious cuz thats impactful Edwards like a foul too W yeah well could have been Cs third as well well you just watched the best player on the flooor go out on something that probably didnt need to be called so chisam Makara Off the Bench early what a find that is sellers couldnt get it trayor Hadley Edwards thought about it Edwards drives it Edwards scores it hes got 14 yeah thats I thought he traveled out top we let a lot of that go but he is just tough he he has been a tough scorer tough shot maker his entire career Lou of a life here in the building in Charlotte heres akara with a hard drive into Waterman he draws the foul you said the whistles were were going to pick up we didnt have a ton of them in the first half but I think the game also levels up where once both teams understand how the games going to be played they figure out where to attack and when to attack and I got to give Stanford all the credit in the world theyve been aggressive particularly on the offensive end without giving up too much in transition in the other direction Stanford is an exceptional free throw shooting team 79 14th in the country the only major glaring weakness offensively is they dont get to the line much they have a very very low free throw rate 277th in the country how often they get to the line and these are just the second and third free throws of the game for them both hit by AAR they have a lot of guys that can play drive and kick in the sense that they can break down and and get to that secondary Defender but they dont have a ton of finishers at the rib Waterman low handle of the ball and he is fouled stford fou number defense is wrap it up both sides and I dont mind that theres a couple whistles here because you dont want to let it get to the point where youre now in the 10 12 minute Mark and its almost out of control with handsy physicality there the second on Jaylen Blakes Pat Kelsey the ACC Coach of the Year Kyle Smith who was last seasons Pack 12 Coach of the Year two of the best program Builders we have in the game right now Edward step back again no Rayo on the floor no Scott on the floor two bigs with three fouls oara heres a three for Ryan agarwall and it bounces into the bottom of the cup raino unleashes a mighty Roar on the Stanford bench and the Seven seed has its largest lead Applause Edwards throws it away heres sers on the break oh he missed the slam and theres a whistle and a foul to what was called a third foul on Reno yeah this is what they called on the rebound this is the third foul for arguably the best player on the floor I just that cant happen twoot was that French Im not a good lip reader in any language so Ill have to rely on somebody else oh I think thats what he said thats exactly it the French is impeccable anyway without raino Stanfords up by 11 oiah sers has 15 theyve gotten good minutes from agrawal from oara Blakes has four assist Cs given him a couple of buckets the depth of Stanford theres a little more than Louisville has especially without Smith heurn no on a three and agrawals got the defensive rebound Agra wal has been really good and its started with good play down the stretch in the first half where he hits a three then he makes the play the drive and dish to get an open three hes been good on the glass just made it three a couple possessions ago remember Louisville has won nine in a row and 19 of 20 step back Blakes got it its a long two and Stanford now outscored its entire game total from the Louisville game on Saturday that was 6848 Louisville into Scott and he couldnt finish it theyre also just growing this lead and stealing minutes with Reno on the bench get another one sellers that is a tough tough drive by the winner of Clemson SMU the next a wild wild Thursday here at the ACC tournament and Louisville is down 15 and 18 and two year in the league Terren Edwards Jr will drive it and a c in and finish through the foul and Louisville far from done theyre crowd made a little extra noise during that timeout the bench is animated well see if Edwards can start to carry it Ive been most impressed with Stanfords toughness I mean thats ultimately what they had to match was not just physicality always say when you match physicality he end up fouling you got to match toughness Stanford has been an aggressor and now theyre forcing Louisville to to actually become the aggressor again thats not its not an easy thing to do when youre down and youre trying to find the game and now Maxim Rao comes back so he sat for 322 and during the time he was on the bench 114 Stanford theyve been led by oiah sers with 17 agar walls played a really nice allaround game and he is fouled by Kenai Applause Roots P Kels team the only loss in the last 20 games home to Georgia Tech February the 1st they have pretty much bulldozed everybody else in their path the first loss was home to Duke a game they LED for about 30 minutes to open conference play you had that game that was way before anybody knew how good Louisville was but mean look at these records Duke Louisville Clemson if you take out the games against each other yeah they went 52 and2 in the league only the two losses to Georgia Tech so this would be a shocking result well I also think the narrative has kind of hurt Clemson and Louisville in terms of well the accs down well that doesnt mean thats why theyre playing well no theyre good teams r oh takes Scott to the basket missed it here comes Hadley keep an eye on the physicality how tough this games going to get here as we head towards the 10minute stretch Edwards oh boy oh boy oh boy its a basket but more significantly its the fourth foul on raino this is where I go back to look this ones on right now you have to understand youve got three fouls and youre more important then even two points you cant lean you cant put your hands on anybody but its just a reminder I mean its probably Edwards probably got away with one there its a reminder though that that chiefy he got for his third that took him off the court for a while and then he comes back and picks up his fourth which is entirely on him now dont get me wrong they did pretty well when redo was off the floor and they were plus seven in that span and theyre going to have to do well again Edwards two bad freepro misses and the lead is still 11 heres chisam Makara trying to get around Noah Waterman oh wow where did that come from a blind Bank by the Harvard transfer oara actually heard it hit the backboard was a violent Bank lead back to 13 13 to go heurn speeding into the lane heper for three he finally got one to go everything was good there for Stanford there was a good scramble but just one breakdown in communication they lost sight of Chucky heper who ended up get the open three in the quarter knocked by Scott back into Cs hands sellers open look another osiah sellers bomb hes got 20 on four threes Edwards meanwhile with a smooth crossover and score this this game is really picking up both sides and Stanford continues to hold a lead but you just feel as if Louisvilles starting to assert themselves a little bit more its a shame this games going to get immedia timeout soon it has picked up and the Cardinals fans have picked up their energy level two thrown out to agarwall at midc court he has to shoot oh and a shock clock violation will send us to immediate timeout Stanford by 11 Lille trying to fight back well coach given the experience you have and all the time that you and this team has had together do do you almost have a a greater sense yeah I think we do feel that way as coaches obviously youre pouring everything you can into your players to help them be successful both on and off the court and obviously Ive been with guys like Chase six years and Ian shefflin four years and bunch of my WalkOns for four years and then when you bring in a new guy or two you know the Jaden Zachary miles Fosters and Victor loins of the world you really know those guys are here for a oneyear uh trip and you want to give everything you can to help those guys be uh the best they can be and have a great experience Brad thanks for joining us and well see you in a little bit okay thanks coach Brad brell Clemson and SM coming up we got a ninepoint game here James Scott had the last bucket Maxim Reno First Team all ACC players on the bench with four fouls for Stanford heres Agarwal pushed out to the mid Court stripe trying to take Javon Hadley and he left it short Hadleys got it up the floor to heurn Cardinals have the starting five back out there no reain Smith because of to the ankle injury tonight Edwards lost it and Edwards tried to tie it up from behind and he Dar well and Louisville being good is good for college basketball certainly good for the ACC Blue Bloods have to be blue never made it even to the semis in the ACC tournament heer cut off by Blakes who just reentered Edwards lost it heern there got hoist it oh a quar nearly banked in but its recovered by Scott who draws a floor foul Im telling you the the tougher misses are really hard for the defense to rebound you know as a defense now thats late clock situation where youre scrambling but as a defense when that thing comes off as an air ball favors the offense comes off hard off the glass somehow favors all youre youre there youre in position actually Scott just absolutely he got away with one yeah wow and that would have been his I mean when the best player in Maxim REO is on the bench because of some know nonsense call thats crazy heurn big one big you you dodge one there right you have a poor possession you heave one up you get the offensive rebound on by shoving somebody you get it back and Chucky heurn hits a three to make it a sixpoint deficit seven in a row for Louisville Aiden camon Jaylen Blakes and theres Scott dancing around Hadley for the rebound Hadley oh he had Edwards on the wing but he has himself in the paint timeouts fors best player is back in there with a fourpoint lead so heres what you got to be careful with the game has picked up a lot terms of physicality since Reno went out hes got to be patient and he just got to make hes got to be careful with that Blakes Pals going to go against Louisville Im telling you what if Maxim REO had picked up an illegal screen foul for his fifth seconds in 75 ft from the basket yeah Pao Alto might have just shut down for the night but hes still out there and the foul is on liable yeah I mean this is this is close I mean is a little Le thats just not one you want to mess with you just have to understand how important you are stand there like a pencil but no reason to get wide and go leaning left and right now at the same time its not obvious and its probably a good bit of officiating to not take him out for that but boy you put yourself in a dangerous position you just dont put yourself in that situation you know youre too important again the game is lifted too since he went out it is really picked up both in intensity and physicality so hes got to be patient in adjusting back into this game without foul Reno misses both free throws hes jogging down the floor hes got to be really careful he attacked him cuz heurn smart yes Edwards will do it too he wants to blaks got low to disrupt the dribble give it back to Edwards give it back to Edwards Hes got the match up heer instead hes got the match up too what do I know Kevin Sometimes the best offense give it to Chucky get the heck out of the way well the whole defense got lifted righto was out on Edwards so theres really no one there to to protect the basket see right nos up you bring a ball screen no ones on the back side and thats ultimately what CH Chucky heurn is reading he hes not reading saying oh can I get to the basket no hes reading the defense Stanford had a 15point lead that was about 5 and a half minutes ago W this place woke up too 12 straight points for the Louisville Cardinals winner to the semifinals hes all over Blakes here right no trying to set another screen staring down the Ferocious Scott rainbow three a skyscraper a raino rainbow and its a twopossession lead again and now Scott finishes over him because theres really not much that raino can do yeah I I keep going back to that ball screen stuff against rno put him in a ball screen situation and see how much he commits to the ball and see if you can get the ball over the top to a guy like Scott aara driving into a couple of Cardinals and theres the foul Chucky up from points to Bert Smith gives him a thumbs up he says yeah Ill take that one its Chucky second would you say a rainbow it was more like a moonball shot from a skyscraper I mean this things rid and he does he kind of has that yic release where its back that was in slow motion by the way thats Moon ball this game got really good man and intense too sellers Fade Music Away Louisvilles first double digit deficit in the last 20 games they can erase it here heer rolling heurn big Chucky heer such a smart play right you attack Rao he doesnt really commit or half half commits you throw the lob Over the Top Again puty Rao in a situation where hes got to be careful not to foul no silence on these slams Louisville has turned a 15point deficit ACC three teams firmly in the field Stanford needs to win the ACC tournament to get in SMU needs to at least make the final maybe win it all and then North Carolina twisting in the wind Joel lardy says theyre just inside the field as of today but if they beat Duke tomorrow theyll probably put aside all doubts cosis got really good production from Ryan agal today and you you needed that good length got eight points five rebounds three assists he hes just contributed mble down by two heres heer he scored or assisted 10 of the last 12 points and he misses a three which is tipped out to Edwards Edwards backing down sellers Zara comes to double wheres the open man hes not going to find him hes going to get fouled and get to the line for a one and one and thats where youve got to be disciplined if youre Stanford is wild of telling Stanford students to be disciplined but youve got to understand youve got him in a bad spot he picked up his dribble theres no reason to hack just get high and wide get your hands up its a little too aggressive and you bail Edwards out Edwards a 79 free throw shooter itss his first in four try do you see his shoes shoes are wild its like that its like our uh champ weak ball that I want slide into my backpack on the way out look at those things bedazzled kicks something Applause else 50e senior won an NCAA Tournament game in James Madison a year ago in fact JMU upset Chucky hepp and Wisconsin in a 125 game before they lost to Duke and maybe just maybe Terrence Edwards Jr can get another shot at Duke on Saturday we got a long way to go before then giler and three oh in and Applause out Edwards with a game high 22 again r no still out there with four fouls he hasnt been attacked much thats about to change Waterman and Scott out foxes and out foxes Ray no for the rebound got him in to switch with he here he slies it through to Applause Edwards thats just a hot mess of man oh man five to shoot it Chucky three no rebound Waterman Edwards will reset it I think now youve got a tired stand for defense youve got to attack Max see Reno at some point he tried to reach in there and thats not going to be on Reno but it is a Stanford foul Edwards going to the line for two time for our experts at work its brought to you by principal well the expert at work is Chucky heer the most impactful transfer in all of college basketball Im going to go with that for at least this game he started to really manipulate and manage this game late it picked up in terms of intensity yes Maxim Rao went out with that three and then four fouls but heers just been masterful with his ability to get a defender on his back and then make defense either commit and throw the lob or dont commit and he finishes is the first team all ACC pick third in the league in assists first in steals 11th in scoring hes owned the second half and Louisville has taken its first lead of this second half what was the biggest lead for Stanford 13 15 15 which is the largest deficit Louisville has faced against an ACC opponent all year there we go Im sure you said that I just I wasnt listening sorry what good job by the way we do see this kind of thing happen sometimes the team that hasnt played in the conference tournament takes a little while to get going the team thats got a game under his belt start stretch they also played just what a week ago and it was a pretty much a blow out where Stanford only put up 48 points so what does Stanford have left in the leg five and a half to play with Reno sers has to Applause clear Reno comes up to look for the screen he gets it back six to shoot raino tough one rebound oara found sellers somehow who drives who kicks agarwall had a great look heer push es it to trayor and he Applause travels we go back to that last possession though when you have Maxim Reno you have to clear and give him space you have to force the defender to leave you if youre sellers just shift everything over right walk towards the top of the key push everybody else over because if someone helps off his sellers hes going to get an open look theres just no room to work here why are you bringing your man basically a double into the corner and youve got nothing going youve got to create space especially if youre a good shooter you could be a great decoy Giller with aara Agarwal sillers and raino aara trying to go oneonone geler a quick one from the corner a Stanford lead wow the quick release he caught that thing high and got it off very quickly shot it with great confidence a seconde scholarship man who played his first year as a Stanford walk on and he just committed a foul but Benny geler has hit goahead threes late in the game backto back nights well giler had just taken a few possessions ago a pretty good look and it was in and out and theres something about that as a shooter right what do I call it clappable Miss right where its up you got it in good Rhythm it goes in and out you feel good about that Miss and you seek out the next one with a little bit more confidence had some lowend D1 offers but can you blame him he wanted to go to Stanford and Edwards misses the first of two got a scholarship with the previous staff Jared has a head coach 42 points a game last year 61 this year the best thing about him maybe he never turns it over hes turned it over 18 times in 30 games and hes a pesky Defender as well but boy that is a quick release its good quick release shoots it with confidence this has been a great game it its had some dull spots but man this is picked up its really been for the most part a great tournament and we havent even gotten to the end of the quarterfinal round and we got Duke Carolina tomorrow winner of this game gets Clemson or SMU Renos off the floor for a spell right now with four to play and Blakes is off the floor as well its giler he leaves it Applause Music short Hadley driving it great defensive play by camon itll be Louisville ball it is trip to a conference tney semi in 11 years louville be its first trip to a conference T semi in 11 years those were different leagues neither has made it to the ACC final for and Louisvilles now a step closer Chucky heurn putting on a second half show has the Cardinals in front Chucky hurn coming off that ball screen really tight forced Maxine REO to stay on him and then he dropped back and ended up give it up at open three Blakes and Reno return for Stanford maybe theyre two best players and Reno will drive it floats it short boy it looked like he pulled up wanting to avoid his fifth foul sure did heurn Hadley Chucky heern magician a Stanford timeout with a Louis the lead of five Chucky heer we said he has really started to manipulate and manage this game late now started with some toughness and physicality on the defensive end but on the offensive end hes really started to manage this game by putting these guys in bad situations right you come off tight Maxim Reno has to make a decision on who to go with he drops back off heer got an open three and then in transition when your teammates trust you to find you if youre open your job is to get to the open spot Hadley did just that Chucky heurn delivered at all time and we got a fivepoint lead for a Louis bille team that took a little while to wake up but look out hey remember three years ago Chucky heer Big 10 on the line Bank three to win the Big 10 for Wisconsin and you mentioned this off the top its not only Chucky heers 134th college game is his 134th College start that thats wild man I mean thats like Cal Ripken Jr stuff is it not well he did miss a game this year with the grun injuries its not quite Cal ring oh my gosh got to protect the Iron Man hard to please oh there it is R nos done you just cant do that and that may be regrettably for maxim Rayo the final moment of a brilliant college career he has fouled out of this game look he had one of these earlier that we thought was a little risky and yeah I mean that that ones obvious thats a lunge and lean now I get it too I understand why youre concerned agar Walls got the ball and hes being asked to manage pressure full qut so you want to help alleviate that pressure but it shouldnt be Maxine Ray Ros setting that screen if youre a Lille fan or lets be honest a cal fan you love it if youre a neutral you hate that that happened and it was the right call but that could be the end of ryos college career into Waterman hes blocked by cman but Scott is there its a 288 Louisville super run and rol can do nothing about Applause it sers inside agarwall missed it Watermans got it I mean how about just the level of intensity you want to talk about leveling up this Louisville team did just that offensive end yes leveled up defensive end physicality theyve done it all what you call it a super run a super run yeah two field goals for Stanford in the last 10 minutes 20 seconds heer theres a foul heurn doing that these ball screen situations you just got to watch how many times hes able to get his defender on his back when they play that flat meaning the the big Defender is just flattening back staying back he comes off that screen and just keeps his defender on his back and is just picking the defense apart fourth foul against jayen blaks Chucky hipper misses it Kyle Smith trying to keep Spirits High here this is a team that has had Spirits very high all year they were great on their home floor 16 and two they were picked to finish not seventh in this league but 17th ahead of only Boston College and if not for the big three in the league Kyle Smith would get a lot more credit for the coaching job he did but Stanford season is really in the balance now could go to the NIT certainly but their NCAA tournament hopes are a minute 35 away from going up and and they needed that one from agarwall he cuts it to five agarwals had a really good game but youre just starting to see the defensive pressure from Louisville the the physicality the toughness took him a little while to wake up which look they just got here this is the first game of the tournament for Louisville EP bir setting a deliberate Tempo step back three in and out Agarwal Stanford down two possessions into the final minute do they have some Cardinal magic thats going to help as sers draws a foul which will turn into a one and one only the First on Edwards its still tight youre going to have to find somebody who can pick up full court got to watch Matt cross yes and Ian shefin I mean the battle of the lettuce the battle of the toughness the battle of the the refrigerator repair men its all there but they might be irreplaceable in terms of value on their teams sellers a 90 shooter makes this a one possession game Stanford has the last five maybe there is some kind of magic for the Cardinal left to bring but they have to get a Applause up heres heer and its intercepted by oara driving it into Waterman step through CH of oara he had that dagger threepoint play at the end of the game yesterday and he may well do it again with a chance to tie Johnny first off great job getting all those facial expressions man were all feeling it down here I I think thats ultimately what this is right now this has gotten really intense now we got a tie ball game partner this is wild Max Reno on the bench five fouls Chucky heurn with the turnover this is wild Applause wow wow with the finish and then to cap it off making the free throw to tie this season and can you join those great Cardinals teams in the past that hung Banners at Freedom Hall and at the Young Center yeah and if Im Stanford Im really careful about going over the top with flatball screen coverage cuz Chucky heers just going to manipulate this thing get it wherever he wants if the ball screens out high no reason to go over the top and Chase the play against a guy who really understands how to manipulate the ball screen and here is the best point guard in the ACC he does not have rain Smith theyre going to take it out of his hands theyre going to try to flash with a double heurn Edwards Stanford without Reno hes fouled out all he can do is stand and watch Chucky heer First Team all accer out for Edwards five to shoot five in the game Edwards no foul missed it rebound o he bir no he h H it no he hit it
