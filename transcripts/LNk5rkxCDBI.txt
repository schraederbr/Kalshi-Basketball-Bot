for Damon stmy here in Atlanta first year with the jackets sixth year at the Collegiate level hes got 73 wins and his team is two and two after a loss last Wednesday night at Cincinnati Mississippi State in Black Deshawn Davis controls the rock for Coach Jans Club Trey Ford on the drive mantoman defense yep here is Davis splitting the traffic and kicks it outside that is DJ jeffri shot clock to 10 on the opening possession with Cameron Matthews five to shoot here is Fort on the drive and into traffic cant finish it knocked around and recovered kaasi Reeves Jr Georgia Tech got a fresh lineup out there Nathan George a freshman from torado will play the lead tonight Ebenezer danana the NC State transfer also on the floor for the first time and by and Dongo starts for a second straight ball game for Coach stmy heres the runner by George and thats why George is in the starting lineup West they need somebody who can attack this Mississippi State Defense does a great job does the 63 Freshman from Toronto and here is a look at that lineup for Coach Jans Davis Fort Jeff Matthews Jimmy Bells a guy to keep an eye on hes been terrific in the early going for the Bulldogs without tlu Smith until at least mid January heres George Alive and the dunk on the back end by indongo wa what great vision by George won and Dongo did a great job running the court four nothing transition Chance by Georgia Tech something out of the half court set Jeff foul on against Reeves Mississippi state is not a great threepoint shooting team so theyre going to be trying to get the ball to the basket heres Fort scooping it up off the glass Bell doing what hes done early and then had it blocked by danana but danana doesnt give you much on offense but he tries to block everything out there George a pull up and a foul will be ticketed to indongo over the back for his first and the First on Georgia Tech but Bs already helped him here but Georgia Tech one of the things they need to do is run the court and score in transition and and Dongo certainly does that and George does a great job finding the big guye and making a great pass STM says weve seen some good weve seen some bad were just trying to get better dayto day and focus on the little things attention to detail is a big by product of what he wants his Pro program to be ahead for Reeves spots for three High arcing three front rim Miss and last Touch by indongo Georgia Tech is not a great threepoint shooting team either they come in at 29 Mississippi State at 31 so youll see each of these teams not really trying to get out on screens and jump out on them theyll be playing off forcing the guys to shoot threes so heres Davis bringing in front court and Josh Hub quickly Off the Bench for the Bulldogs their leading score true freshman from Madison Mississippi whos off to a terrific start three ball Jeff misses everything Matthews in traffic scores on the stick back Cameron Matthews averages nine for Mississippi State heres a look at hubard now talk about a young man doesnt realize hes at the higher level of college basketball top 100 player in the ESPN ranking a year ago anybody that scores almost 4400 points in the high school you know they can put it in the basket and that guy can put it in the basket Miles Kelly from the perimeter his sixth three of the year he had 20 plus in each of the first two games but averaging just 11 A2 in the last two for Coach stms team who leads by five here in the first 3 minutes or so West in the last four games Kelly has been one for 14 from three Jeff a triple DJ Jeff 83 of the year and now all of a sudden both these teams have woken up from behind the line here in the last sequence well I think that each team is going to make the other team prove they can make it from out there George a back rim Miss and the rebound pulled away Jeff hes a transfer from Olive Branch but went to school at Memphis before coming to Starkville and a nice move through traffic for DJ Jeff hes got five in a row and were tied at seven Dan jeffri is an extremely talented player Wes even though more than 60 of his field goal attempts are from three and he shoots better from three than two he can still drive the ball to the basket Kelly off the high screen and Dongo rolls and a foul will be called on the Bulldogs well Mississippi State trail by five but they picked up five in a row DJ Jeffrey averaging just five a game well hes got five already and were tied at seven in Atlanta number 21 Mississippi State 7 Georgia Tech 7 Dan there are six other games on The Ledger tonight pick out your favorite here of the early starts well I think my favorite has to be Miami at Kentucky thats thats interesting why would you select that one well theyre I I think theyre two teams each of those teams is capable of winning a national championship and for that kind of a game this early in the season and thats really exciting for college basketball fans foul was on Jeff by the way and so that puts Miles Kelly at the line 64 free throw shooter by the way I can confirm that LSU was greeted by snow today on their visit to Syracuse in central New York well tigers tigers coming up from the Bayou and they walked right into a central New York snow one of two for Kelly these challenges have all always been really interesed of course long time in this part of the year was the ACC Big 10 for over 20 years some of you may remember the old threeyear sequence of the ACC Big East Bo that ACC Big East challenge 89 90 and 91 wasnt it oh my goodness KY Sturman on the floor Debo Coleman as well for Coach stms team two to shoot on the drive heres Hub kick into the corner and theres a shot clock violation on Mississippi State so you got a little bit of bench action here Josh H on the drive second turnover on Mississippi State Damon stym team kind of locking down there theyre doing a great job defensively theyre pressure and defensively and even though Mississippi state has been able to beat Georgia Tech on the perimeter theres good help defense they cant convert and Dongo couple of dribbles out front heres Kelly now this is stur of it steady veteran playmaker here and the godson of Damon SAR hell launch from in front and hit Kyle Sturman third three of the year been in double figures twice in the last three games Georgia T back to a 4point Advantage Mississippi States hit all three of their last shots from the floor heres Jeff quickly they move it Matthews and now DJ Jeff a three thatll snap the streak and Dongo the rebound and here is Sturman off the indongo screen now Debo Coleman feels like hes been here a long time doesnt it Coleman is comes in averaging a dozen of game shooting at Team High 58 from the floor very good threepoint shooter and Dongo a long two and Kelly went for the save and hes going to draw the foul hell be awarded free throws Deshawn Davis picks up his first itll be the second on on Mississippi State well Miles Kelly just comes flying to the basket nobody blocks him out and Wes heres an interesting thing about Miles Kelly that will be they will credit him with an offensive rebound for that thats 12 offensive rebounds hes had so far this year last year he had a grand total of 10 change in administration and change in attitude right now you go run and get it that gives you another chance to shoot it and we know Miles Kelly likes to shoot it yes he does substitutions waiting at the table Shaquille Moore going to check in guy chol wearing 34 and we also get our first look at Shawn Jones Jr in the lineup for Mississippi State there is chel who played his prep ball at greenforest Christian here in the Atlanta area originally from the South Sudan Kelly got them both largest lead of the first half for Georgia Tech at six and the best thing that Georgia Tech has done so far West other than play really solidly on the defensive end of the course they havent turned the ball over yep theres a pullup Jumper in the lane theres Josh hubber going to work he is only 5 10 west but he really gets up on that jump shot y terrific looking young player for these Bulldogs taon Claude there setting the screen for Sturman back for Claude deflected out of there and here come the Bulldogs with the giveaway by Georgia Tech Shaquille Moore to the rack tapped around Collide inside heres Mo on The Gather Matthews thought about it and now hell get it to Jones right back on the perimeter Matthews launches and Kelly pulls it away for the jackets Matthews hadnt made it three all year hes now 0 for 11 so I think Georgia Tech is comfortable if hes going to shoot it from out there almost seven minutes gone in this first half on the drive Kelly through the contact no whistle and then a bumping foul on Claude will be ticketed his first itll be the second on Georgia Tech effort foul by taon clar yeah Georgia Tech has had some success driving into the lane you can see good job by Mississippi State thwarting that attempt and getting the rebound but you dont want to get carried away West and take bad shots when you drive in there they havent turned it over but a lot of times if you take bad shots then thats just like a turnover so sturdivan is on the floor ibraim aako freshman from Guinea has also come on the floor as as Carter Martin wearing number four for Georgia Tech heres Sako the rebound one and done are the Bulldogs theres Murphy I said Carter Martin Carter Murphy who is an Air Force Academy transfer a walkon grad transfer by the way Dan Carter Murphy hes not a grad transfer because he decided he didnt want to stay at the Academy anymore hes a grad transfer because he graduated mhm and he he did well enough academically at the Academy that he could go to graduate school and so now the Air Force doesnt get him in graduate school and they dont pay for graduate school so he had to get in Georgia Tech and he had to apply for academic scholarships so he is on an academic scholarship here at Georgia Tech and he is in the Air Force yep Moore six to shoot the bounce pass and chol a foul called I believe on Claude and if so thatll be his second I had a chance to talk to Murphy today because thats interesting my son Carrie did the same thing only he of course he didnt play basketball but he came to Georgia Tech from the Naval Academy there they would not have called that a foul had there not been a turnover contact has to create an advantage to be a foul fresh shot clock fourpoint lead for Georgia Tech Hub trying to dial one in Jones the backside rebound and traffic knocked away and were going to get a foul on St Music thatll be his first four on Georgia attack W this has not been a pretty game offensively but we didnt expect it to be but these guys are really going at it yep more quick off the screen hubber and Murphy will pull away the rebound here is Sturman and Georgia Tech into the front Court Murphy couple of Music dribbles you dont want to be dribbling too much against this defense unless youre driving it to the basket you want to get this defense to move the balls got to go side to side Sturman a little Runner off the iron and Dongo battle for it slapped out of there heres hover of Mississippi State on the Run Bulldogs looking for an advantage the young rookie scooped it up and draws the foul Fearless move by hubard through traffic get it up on the window hell willll shoot free throws when we continue from Atlanta GE attack an early fourpoint lead in the ACC SEC Music Applause Challenge and Damon star huddling with Georgia Tech his fifth game as the jackets head coach and Dan I enjoyed our visit with him today because its a fascinating story of a guy who comes back to the college ranks after being pretty successful in his tenure at Pacific and uh I think its going to be very interesting to watch him build this program but its not going to be an overnight deal no it is not and he talked about hes looking for toughness hes looking for attention to detail and obviously all thats fine except he needs talent to do it and he he got himself a pretty good start they had one of the most highly ranked transfer classes come in free throw by hubard is good looking at the fifth best free throw shooter in the SEC here in Josh hubard this guys shooting numbers across the board are outstanding yep hes fourth and threepoint shooting 13th in field goal percentage here free throws and hes top 10 in scoring and heres a little pressure on indongo Murphy gets it for George hell break the timeline with one to spare now what you have to do when a team presses you like that you got to make them pay for it you cant just work the ball to get it across half court you got to work it to score and this is the Jan calling card the tight manto man here in the half courton and Dongo almost dunked another one off of George la B L though what a transition chance and look at HUB find SE and score six for hubt what a terrific move by the rookie tied at 13 George spots spins off the rebound for Jimmy Bell first time weve called the senior from Baton rouges Music name averaging nearly a double double hes the leading rebounder in the SEC at 9 and a half he is such a force a physical presence on the inside here is Bell kicks for Shak Moore Shaquille little soft Runner and in Dongo the Music rebound you see eaner danana with Bay and Dongo on the floor here for Georgia Tech and Murphy a three oh boy Carter Murphy his second field goal of the Year both of them are threes well thats thats his specialty is shooting to three played 14 minutes last wns United Cincinnati knocked down a triple P Georgia Tech in front three were halfway home in the first 20 gives him some good size at the guard against a relatively small Mississippi State guard lineup at the moment Jones the runner and its danana who finally collects Music it Nathan George tried to wrap it arounded danana turned it over Jeff and the Bulldogs on the run but danana didnt help him Wes he didnt really Follow the Ball hubber a long three that got slapped Applause around you know he can shoot the three but I think he can be a little closer Baseline and Dongo heres Coleman a high arching three Debo Colemans 10th triple of the Year first tonight thats a big basket for Georgia Tech and Coleman is a guy who doesnt need a lot of time or room you got to find him he did not score in 13 minutes against West Millers Bearcats last week but hes on the board tonight in the first half back to a sixpoint lead for the jackets on a six nothing run and Moore will break that with his first points well Murphy gives you a little size but Moores quicker and he made the Georgia Tech pay for that defensive assignment that time hovert out to defend George Nathan all the way and theyll score the basket and the Music foul foul is going to be on HUB now this H last time George decided to pass the ball this time he decides to drive it to the basket and I think thats what hes got to do you risk that blocked shot sub for the second for George field goalwise and now a chance at a threepoint trip and the goal tend on Bell for slapping it off the glass right on the W the referees can review a call Goal tending call this year and they can review it if theres any doubt in their minds and normally in this situation this is what the new rule is in this situation they could review it to see how many shots he gets awarded because if its not goal tending he gets two shots but in this situ they do not have to review it got if theyre sure and they were sure then they dont review it so they get dont get the threepoint play because he misses the free throw here is Fort Mississippi State hes only hit two of their last 10 from the floor theyve been taking tough shots and now a foul off the ball and I think by and Dongo has picked up his second so taon Claude and indongo have two weeks for Georgia Tech and this gives you an example Georgia Tech is going to struggle with this Mississippi State size today so Claude comes back in hes got the two fouls and I think the ability to play inongo and danana together has been a big key here for Georgia Tech in the first half in their interior defense 16 foul on the jackets just three on Mississippi State Jeff all the way to the basket now reverses against Claude and inside last Touch by the Bulldog says Tony Henderson thatll bring us to a timeout tick under eight to play first half Damon stmy team with a sixpoint lead in the ACCC challenge night one presented by Continental Music Tire well under eight to go in this first half and you know Chris Jans was talking to us about trailing early today and w games kind of go hes already got wins against Northwestern and Washington State and boy what a terrific first year he had huh well it was I mean it was we talked about the fact that they they really couldnt shoot the ball and nonetheless their defense got him 21 wins and got him into the NCA tournament and of course hes had a very good coaching career as you can see that winning percentage but he was really funny today talking to us saying that he was so excited last year that hed been at mid Major level for so long where he had to win Conference tournament to get into the nend safe tournament and here his team got to go to the N safe tournament theyre 8 and 10 in their leag yep cuz he had been in those one one and done leagues right and they played in the first four had a terrific game against pit as you remember in date to start the tournament that was an unbelievable game that was a great game yep heres George ahead for Coleman whats Georgia Tech done well here in this first half to the main thing is they havent turned it over yeah good point and theyve done a pretty good job with their shot selection there goes Coleman skip out front Kelly left open three away thats just a great job penetrating in and against the Mississippi State Defense that simply doesnt allow that very much nine for Miles Kelly and a ninepoint lead the largest to the night for Georgia Tech here in this first half Davis off the Bell screen George got beat on the dribble and Bell t Taps home the follow first points for 610 senior transfer Jimmy Bell Jr the drive to the basket will create open opportunities here is George oh left alone there and scored I think Nathan George was surprised how open he was yes he was but again if youre going to drive the ball of the basket dont drive it to pass you have to be thinking shoot Nathan George has got six lead back to nine Mississippi State just cant get anything going on the offensive end and one of the reasons is they havent been able to create turnovers and get easy baskets theyve had to face the set Georgia Tech defense just about every time and the jackets defense has been up to the task so Applause far Davis skips it into the corner Jeffs three to shoot heres Trey Fort working on Kelly and its a shot clock violation thats the second of this first half on the Bulldogs little bit of hesitation on the part of the Bulldogs West to shoot the ball from the outside Fort has the reputation as a very good threepoint shooter but he has shot the three poorly so far this year and he looks like he lacks confidence shooting the three got to let it go D stmy up directing his teams half course set here up nine Zone employed here by Jans team fou line Reeves r the way into the hands of Jeffy thats good reaction by the Georgia Tech offense there to recognize that and get an excellent shot Matthews and off the ball were going to get a foul on kaasi Reeves jrou Florida transfer from Mak Georgia his first seventh on Georgia to well hes 6 s but he only weighs 202 lbs and he is overmatched inside against Jimmy Bell who they listed 610 280 yep Jimmy Bell Jun Jimmy Bell is a 71 free throw shooter coming off a double double against Nicholls last Friday in Stark one of the other things Georgia Tech has done very well so far west this evening is they have really kept Bell from being a factor in the game agree Timmy Bell started his collegiate career at St Louis then went junior college and then West Virginia and then post Bob Huggins the Mountaineer roster turned over pretty quick to a lot of different destinations and he was a part of that its Coleman a three and slapped out by Reeves George gives the jackets a new 20 now Coleman missed that shot but thats a good shot you they press you you got to make him pay for it foul line heres Reed George on the dribble back for kaasi Music reev five to shoot deep three front rim Miss and Bell the rebound here go the Bulldogs they waste no time with hubard Applause Davis on the run too strong Bell the rebound and a foul will be called here Tony Henderson on the perimeter I think on Reeves no Debo Coleman junor from Memphis his first thats eight on the jackets here in the first half D this is a situation where Claude tries to block the ball but hes got no chance and he goes to the opposite side of the basket and leaves Bell wide open underneath he has no chance you could block that shot you got to get back and block out Bell and he didnt and as a result Bell goes back to the free throw line theyre going to get Bell Two Shots Applause here and the first one is good you get a big guy who can shoot 70 from the free throw line thats a thats a bonus well at Mississippi state will play about two months in change without tolu Smith then and youre talking about an allconference caliber type big for Chris Jans Club youre talking about a guy whos good enough to be the SEC player of the year if hes plays the whole year but hes got a foot injury and theyre being very careful with him they dont expect him back until mid January yep they did get kesan Murphy back in the lineup last Friday for the first time this year here is Claude oh look at the Cris ball movement for Georges drive and now Claude teas a three thats an air ball missed everything and last Touch by the jackets taon Claude was one of five when he cut that loose coming inight hes a 20 free throw shooter you know George needs to shoot it Kelly needs to shoot it Coleman needs to shoot it and if Claud gets it you got to drive the ball to the basket as an old high school coach I know used to say if you cant shoot it from out there get closer under five to play sevenpoint lead for Georgia Tech leaner by hubard and heres ree with the deflection and now Kelly in the open floor to the basket and the foul on the Bulldogs and its going to be on DeShawn Davis he becomes the first Mississippi State player with two with 448 to play Kelly takes the ball into a crowd here but this is the kind of aggressiveness that they have to have from Miles Kelly in that situation hes got to attack the basket hes got a couple free throws here hes got nine in this first half and the free throw good mississipp double figures for Kelly Davis out Shaquille Moore reports back for Coach Jans team Miles Kelly thought about the draft thought about all that returned on Deadline day to be a part of Damon Styers first Squad in Atlanta after a year ago averaging nearly 50 against the ACC and had 20 games in the league of 20 or more or six games in the league of 20 or more last year Dan ninepoint leads been the largest for Georgia Tech in this first half heres Bell Claude standing there remember hes playing with two fouls and Bell scores easily if you give him that much time hes just going to overpower claw yep six for Bell here is working on Bell tough assignment there back out front Kelly with 15 to shoot Bells got really good feet and Claude is going to have a hard time getting around him sos Nathan George Kelly with seven to shoot and a foul will be called on Jones Shawn Jones 65 sophomore from Houston his first and that is five on Mississippi State 21st ranked bulldogs and Georgia techet night one producer tonight night one of AC CC SEC challenge presented by Continental Tire in midtown Atlanta in the first meeting since 1974 between Georgia Tech and Mississippi State last time they played Georgia Tech won 6461 in Starkville brother Dwayne Morrison was coaching the jackets with big Jim Wood and tonights timeout for trivia for you boner who coached Mississippi state three balls spun out for kaas Rees Bulldogs finished 9 and 17 that year with Jerry Jenkins averaging 22 a game well I guess Bob Boyd but you told me I was wrong no youre too early for Bob Boyd Jones right side three ball away from Shack Moore rims off and Coleman took a shot in the mouth and touched it last double to trouble for Debo Coleman Kermit Davis was the coach at Mississippi State in 1974 yes sir theres Debo Coleman touched it last oh by the way Jimmy Bell caught him in the chops three ball Jones got it Shawn Jones fifth three of the year his first points tonight for the Bulldogs I too was surprised and looked it up twice to make sure okay lead is four Kelly out front hell fire front rim Miss Bell the rebound big for three minutes here for both schools absolutely and Georgia Tech has missed a couple of open threes but again they are not a great threepoint shooting team theyve missed their last four heres a turnover though George on the attack tries to get free Reeves got to get rid of it and scooped up danana right hand fourth field goal of the year for eaner danana West Im not sure he passed that ball to danana the ball got knocked out of his hands and danana just happened to be in the right place lets see if they mark it for an assist sixpoint lead Jones another three boy Nathan George has played nice in his first start tonight D Bo you sure has done a nice job handling the offense handling the ball that got deflected by Jones itll stay at Georgia Tex the floor and the thing that has impressed me the most about Jones is hes done a great job with the tempo of the game he has pushed at the proper time he has held back at the proper time number 12 Here Comes kesan Murphy for the first time wearing jersey number 12 for the Bulldogs made his debut last Friday played 10 minutes had six points the only Reserve out of Chris Jans bench to return for this second season of his work at Mississippi State sixpoint game heres George into traffic little fallway Nathan George got nine in this first half or eight in this first half on his fourth field goal well hes made threes hes driven the ball to the basket hes been able to shoot pullups and I think he just ask to come out of the game lead back to eight you always ask to come out of the game when youre on defense West heres hubard down the lane with the right hand what a tough shot eight for Josh hubard on his third field goal again this guy scored more than 4000 points in high school so I guarantee you he can make tough shots yep dont let and now with 95 seconds to go in this first half stmy kind of slowing things down here with 15 to shoot danana with a high screen skip it to Debo Coleman for three rimmed out bulldogs and more trying to push it front Court not going to get a better shot than that yep Jones and heres Shaquille Moore started his career at NC State blocked that time by Reeves run down by Kelly Reeves is 6 feet s Wes and he moves pretty well we saw him getting bounced around by Jimmy Bell but he can handle Shaquille more inside theres Reeds on Q kaasi Reeves the Florida transfer with his first points eightpoint lead again Fall Away by hubber too strong Reeves the rebound hes trying to do everything now and he cant do that 11 second differential Dan this is a big defensive possession I think for Mississippi State Kelly against Murphy Kelly trying to find a screen Hill long three will be good how about 14 for Miles Kelly in the first half and thats his third three Murphys worried about Kelly driving p and we can hear the Mississippi State coaches yelling hand hands up hands up and Murphy never does get his hands up and thats a guard really loves to see that big guy with his hands down whos afraid that hes going to drive by him hes not going to attack you and remember Kelly came into this game shooting one for 14 from Beyond The Arc in the previous three games largest lead of the night for Georgia Tech is 11 and the Bulldogs will have the ball for the final play of the half if they choose here Music Georgia Tech who came into the ball game shooting 40 dead last in the ACC is 50 from the floor and 6 threes Dan which is one off their game average after the Kelly make there West Im not so sure that Georgia Tech can play much better at this point in the season than they have played tonight theyve been very good on the defensive end theyve rebounded the ball very well they only have three turnovers they have not allowed Mississippi State to get get out and run and theyve been able to penetrate a very tough Mississippi State Defense and get some baskets on the inside 3726 11 seconds to go and Moore operates the offense into traffic threw it away heres Sturdivant with three two hell take it on Hover put it up Applause score Kyle sturdivan and Georgia Tech score at the horn to make it a third he was able to hit that little pullup jumper but the main thing is he did he only had one turnover he didnt give the ball away here is George working against Deshawn Davis we start half two original starters out there for both teams heres Kelly launching again to start the half and a three rebounded by Davis now this also you got to be careful here you live and die a little bit with this in Mississippi state will lock you back down Dan theyre that talented at at the defensive end they are very good at the defensive end they got to figure out something on the offensive end they got to get Bell more involved in this he only took three shots in the first half Davis a front rim Miss and danana will commit the foul Ebenezer danana the transfer from NC State draws his first first on Georgia teeker the second half and Jimmy Bal Jr is a guy who can affect the games in a lot of ways and if theyre not going to throw it to him then he can battle on the inside and go get it himself yep Davis will put it play on the Baseline new 20 for him and Jeff oh no Matthews went the wrong way and thatll cost the Bulldogs their fifth turnover one of the things we saw Mississippi State do early in the game was they pressured a little bit full court and they havent done that reason it looks like theyre going to try to set some half court pressure you got to do something on the defensive end to change the tempo of this game if youre the Bulldogs heres George the freshman from Toronto who played his high school ball in Arizona and Dongo kick out kaasi Reeves Jr a back rim Miss of a three jackets have missed both of their threes here in the second half and were still at that 13point difference with a minute Music gone Jeff threw it away in the corner thats a great defensive play by nongo Kelly into the corner heres Reeves now Miles Kelly who works against Trey Fort switched off now George with 16 to shoot thats Matthews out front pressuring the young freshman George lob inside that got deflected Away by Jeff but right to Kelly Kelly 16 for Kelly is fourth field goal first twopointer of the night largest lead out of the corner a three away and good for Trey Ford or no y Trey Ford Ford comes in as a 33 threepoint shooter hasnt shot the three well in the last couple games in West we said in the first half that he looked like he was afraid to shoot it no fear that time yep trim down to 12 at 4129 after the triple out of the corner reroute on the screen heres George on the drive left it on the rim Bella Pull It Away Here Comes Mississippi State with jeffri into the corner how about another one from for nope too strong Davis will try and hit Deshawn Daviss first point so Fort and Davis who were scoreless in the first half have knocked down triples here to start the second half for the Bulldogs W Im telling you what when that ball starts going in the basket it energizes the team and they start playing harder defensively its really important that Georgia Tech get a basket pretty soon to blunt this run Kelly into the corner here is danana tend to shoot for George and an offensive foul on eer danana thatll be his second two on the jackets here to start the frame you got to get stopped as hes going to make this pass then he just goes right into him yeah so danana now with two indongo with two Claude with two all bigs for Damon Music star Davis good defense by George here is Bell little ball screen Jeff will fire nope back rim danana tried to help George with a screen but Fort played it nicely heres Reeves and forts going to commit the foul there Trey Fort Junior from Jackson averaging almost eight and four in the first six games Chris Jans a little frustrated with that call Wes but you know Mississippi state is trying to be physical and if the officials let too much of that physicality go then thats a really huge Advantage for the defense so a new 20 for George attack only got the twopoint basket by Kelly here in the first three minutes and change and a turnover and there goes Jeff and he lost it Wes that is really the first time that Mississippi state has been able to SEC secure one of those live ball turnovers and they had a great opportunity to score but they just couldnt hang on to the ball yep thats why its gone for the Bulldogs tonight seven turnovers now for the Bulldogs into the right corner Coleman launches too strong missed everything Kelly runs it down no reset of the shot clock it didnt hit anything and almost turned over there and now thrown into the back court where and Dongo comes up with it now heres Reeves on the drive went for the dunk lost it on the way up this is the third crack for Kelly got it what a sequence but thats back breaking if youre Mississippi State lead back to 12 four minutes gone dead ball will bring us to a timeout and theres going to be a foul on Miles Kelly made a play for the steel ends up betting is first but the Jackets got three cracks at it Dan well the ball bounced it so seemingly touched everybodys hand and then Kelly finally buries it wow 12point lead for Georgia Music attack what an unbelievable speech he gave at the SPs the night he received the Jim Valvano award 4432 Miles Kelly and Georgia Tech about the time you think its gotten a little loose they find a way to get a bounce here and a bounce there Damon stms got to be very pleased with this team tonight got to be very happy and West the balls the games a lot easier when the balls going in the basket and Georgia Tech has had to go in the basket with pretty good frequency tonight Fort Davis Jeff on the floor along with Matthews and Bell so the original starters out there here for Coach Jans and we get a whistle and a foul and thatll be another one on Kelly thats two in a row Miles Kelly and its four on Georgia Tech in the second half and thats two on Kelly here early in the second half so Baseline for Fort I think Butler has excuse me Bell has to handle the ball on the inside out of the corner there is Fort and the rebound ripped away by taon claw CLA really got up in the air for that one yep leads the jackets and rebounds at almost seven a game comes off the bench Tonight George thought about the three skip out Kelly how about Coleman three got it thats great ball movement six for Deo Coleman Georgia Techs got their most threes in the game since opening night when they hit 13 15point leads are largest of the night and when Georgia Tech scores they get a chance to go down and set their defense and that makes it harder for the Mississippi State offense Davis heres Jeff Wheeling around Matthews with eight to shoot tried to take Reeves in draws the charge does kaasi Reeves first on Matthews the senior from Olive Branch and the second on the Bulldogs its just a great job moving his feet now its very hard for a defensive player as a secondary Defender to take a charge but kaasi Reeves was the primary Defender he was guarding Matthews and he just moved his feet and got in great position nine turnovers now on Mississippi State Dan and hubard is coming the ball game off coach Jans bench here with just under 15 minutes to play Coleman another three thats short and the rebound pulled away by Jones Shawn Jones got some minutes off that bench in that first half too about 11 of them heres Hub trying to ignite the Bulldogs offensively and Kelly the rebound and will be whistled for a foul will Mississippi State and its Jimmy Bells first West Mississippi state has attempted seven field goals in this half every single one of them of three and they are not a great threepoint shooting team theyre theyre not last in the country anymore theyre 248th this year but still thats not great they have to get the ball inside and they dont necessarily have to throw it to Bell but theyve got to beat this Georgia Tech defense on the perimeter and get some basket get some chances closer to the goal start of it working against hubard Claude trying to take Bell down here is stur it right back for Claude took the contact and Bell commits another one itll be his second four now on Mississippi State Georgia Tech has moved the ball very well West they havent been dominating it with the dribble theyve dribbled some of course but theyve passed it very well and when you move the ball like that you move the defensive rounds and that creates open opportunities Bell has to come and help they flip the ball to Claude and he gets fouled first one for Claude is no good hes now nine of 17 at the line taon is well traveled started his college career at Morehead and then was injured only played in 39 games there and then went to Western Carolina last year was third Team all Southern Conference had 11 double doubles by the way hit the back in there for his first point hes a big strong Applause player 16point lead about 6 minutes gone second half opening night of the ACC SEC challenge presented by Continental Music TI Matthews heres Jones now Shaquille Moore long three Jones out front in the front rim Miss and stur him at the rebound yes the ball hardly broke the plane of the threepoint line Claude trying to set the screen heres stur it Kelly lost the handle on it and left it short Applause Music jeffri see what kind of shot here the Bulldogs work for two threes early Fort and Davis both had triples its basically nobody in the post there goes more Baseline hes bumped and fouled by Claude thatll be his third now what you do when you play that five out kind of thing you create some space for guys to drive but I think the ball needs to go from side to side before you drive it they got the foul there but its really hard to get good offense if youre just playing on one side of the Court HT will put it in play on the Baseline quick throw more fouled on the way up and I think it was andanga third on by andanga from Muro in the western Sagal Wesson keep in mind were still early in this second half and a guy is valuable as inongo Georgia Tech can ill afford to lose him 16 foul Two Shots coming here and so the next foul will be the bonus well heres the other thing they shoot Mississippi state that is 735 at the free throw line remember in the first half they only attempted five free throws there were only 12 total from both schools Mos got his third point and Ibrahim masako freshman from Guinea at 66 checks in second free throw for Shaquille Moore gives him four here comes the pressure yep Sturman and Kelly both in the ball game to handle the ball for Damon Styers team admire trying to find the crease heres Music Reeves lead is 14 with played seven minutes of half two at Mish Pavilion tonight in midtown Atlanta on the drive Sturman spots up and hits St Kyle Sturman got a steady hand when hes got the rock doesnt he yeah he sure does and what youre seeing West is Mississippi State when they the way theyre playing defense against the screen theyre sort of dropping off theyre not jumping out so the guard if the guard can get by that screen they can get the jump shot three ball for Hub hes now to double figures with 11 at 29 in their win against Northwestern thats his six straight double figure game once the only field goals theyve made in this half have been threes yep and the two free throws from Moore Fort Davis and hover with threes Mo with a couple of free throws thats their 11 and the lead is where it was at the break stur him and a step back thats tough shot yep long rebound heres Shaquille Moore Bulldogs Jones stepped out on the screen and Matthews had it poked Away by Ibrahim aako Georgia Tech doing a great job getting back on defense 10 turnovers on Georgia or Mississippi State now Coleman and a whistle and Bulldog foul coming its going to be on DJ Jeff five on Chris Jans team 13point lead for Georgia Tech here in the second half jackets attacking from the perimeter and going to the basket and forcing turnovers to build this 13point Music Advantage how about tonight already 38 all Micah Shrewsberry on the road in Columbia tonight against South Carolina right Miami and Kentucky as you predicted I thought Missouri pit would be terrific thats been good well they theyre all good Wes yeah they are I mean that Miami Kentucky game I think thats going to go right down to the wire yep and Missouri Missouri is a team that hasnt really played up to their potential so far but they can put some points on the board that is a tough matchup for pit not a surprise here in Atlanta so far just better than 8 minutes gone second half hubard defending sturdivan tend to shoot for the jacket its Kelly had it poked away and a hustle play there Davis but couldnt save it wa thats the way its gone from Mississippi State tonight started in a little floater you make a good play and then then you just cant hang on to the Ball nine now for the fifth year senior from Norcross Georgia lead back to 15 Davis and one yeah nope hell get two shots the foul will be on Kyle Sturman I think they ruled that before the shot so itll be a oneonone yep seventh foul on the jackets with 1113 and heres the thing you were talking about earlier about foul in terms of sending a very good free throw shooting team to the strike theyve really struggled to score from the field so maybe they can score from the free throw line but Wes were almost 9 minutes into this half and Mississippi State has yet to attempt a twopoint field goal yep there you go how about that and again this is not a Mississippi State team that is a great threepoint shootter shoo team come in it just better than 30 and the one and one no good off the hand of Deshawn Davis who misses for just the third time this year in 13 shots at the line that was first attempt of the night Georgia Tech playing a relatively small lineup right now y Sako with Sturman Coleman Reeds and here is the Freshman George in his first Collegiate start tonight lost the H on slapped it away and loose ball out of there with the turnover heres Jeff hell cross over and Score first twopoint goal in transition for DJ Jeff first transition basket of any kind tonight for Mississippi State heres Sturman breaks the Music timeline and now Sako what a standing right at the moment for the yellow jackets George theres Sturman quickly in the corner Coleman with 7 shoot Works Baseline got caught in traffic and a foul will be called on the Bulldogs and it will be on Cameron Matthews hes got to be careful he doesnt want to get a technical foul that is six now on Mississippi State this is a situation where theres not a lot of contact there but Matthews moves into Debo Coleman and when he moves into Debo Coleman Coleman falls down so thats contact that creates an advantage and by rule thats a foul its tough call though Mississippi State trying to turn up the defensive pressure you see Matthews at 67 and 230 just towering over Sturman whos going to put it in play on the Baseline big minutes for Ibrahim aaka who plays about 18 a game for Coach stamar heres George and did he throw thr it away Davis touched it last itll stay with Georgia Tech was seven to shoot Bulldogs came within a whisper that time of taking it the other way in transition and for Chris Jan hes got to be a little frustrated his team has really turned up the defensive Tempo but they still havent been able to converted Georgia Tech I think is backed off a little bit here almost like theyre trying to protect the lead and thats not what Damon sires telling him to do five to shoot Kelly away spun out on the three rebound for Reeves his stick back rimmed off and now Coleman gives him another chance how about that Georgia Tech just faster to the loose Balls Davis trying to size up Kelly with help from Jeff he almost held that ball for five seconds heres George with two to shoot hell launch it got blocked out of bounds thats a shot clock violation and the Bulldogs get their defensive pressure set there well defense is their calling card and Georgia Tech has reacted very well here throughout this game the last couple of possessions though the Mississippi State Defense starting to take control yep nine and a half to go its a 13point yellow jacket Music lead Matthews for Davis Jeff thought about the three off the green foul on Matthews thatll be his third thats seven on the Bulldogs with 916 to play and Chris Jans is telling Matthews he sets the screen and he he moves into to the defensive player but what Chris Jans is telling him is hey you got that call on you because youve been chirping at the referees so Matthews will come out being the seconde coach of the Bulldogs with a quick visit and just like what you were talking about Dan Matthews frustrated at the no calls and then the calls that were made hubard defending George a lob and that almost got deflected in George had the rebound underneath he got knocked down here at the Bulldogs four on three hovered in traffic and blocked by indongo boy indongo what a great job running the court Davis tried to knock down to three heres Jeff right back at him and hell kick it for Jones who replaced Matthews a moment ago Bell calling for it gets it against indongo double team help from George almost turned over Davis in traffic skip for Jeffs two to shoot three ball no good Tapped Out in Dongo and here is Coleman skip for Reeves kaasi to the basket blocked by Jeffrey score of the goal a flurry at both ends well it really was a flurry and and Dongo was in the middle of the whole thing he does a great job and then kaasi Reeves just goes out and runs and that ball is above the basket it hit the backboard and you cant touch it if its above the basket after it hits the backboard lead back to 15 for Georgia Tech and again I did not see the referee signal that they were going to review that at the timeout and they dont have to review it its not a require review if theyre sure they dont have to review and heres Ibrahim aako back to replace Debo Coleman for Damon stmy Music Applause team Fort spot up two and the rebound for Sako with bell bell just does not seem to be involved in the game hes trying to but when youre a big guy inside and you never touch the ball its really really hard Kelly to make to be a factor all the way down around Bell couldnt finish and nice job by jeffri Bulldogs again trying to get the floor they race it in the front Court no Advantage man Id give it to this guy right here three at the front got it Josh Hubbert 14 tonight The Freshman well hes a guy we said he can put points on the board and thats what thats what Mississippi State needs right at the moment theyve got to get some stops obviously heres Kelly leaning with a right hand and Dongo got it back third try no good after a mtap so its a 12point game heres a three from Jones and the rebound of the Miss by Kelly that would have cut the lead to under 10 now we go under seven to play Damon stmy team tried to Fashion an upset here tonight Dan well theyve set themselves up in position to do so now they just got to finish the job good Heavens yep and Dongo with a poor choice Damon star claps his hands as if to say bye we got better looks than that Timeout on the floor 12point lead for Georgia Tech Chan and the Bulldogs with the ball next Music its bow time and you just have to keep going Georgia Tech has not shot the ball well in the second half theyre only two for 10 so the Mississippi State Defense has improved greatly so its just you just got to keep grinding Wes last time it was under 10 was 3426 late in our first half a three would do it here Matthews on the bounce pass Bell the catch thats blocked out of there by and Dongo boy and Dongo has really played well tonight I thought thats exactly where Mississippi State needed to go only got one basket to his credit hes got six rebounds here is Reeves Baseline the scoop and the foul with 615 to Applause play GE Tech has not been afraid to attack the basket and that was attacking the basket after a couple of passes you move the defense around you create an opening for your offensive player kaase Reeves will go to the line on Jimmy Bells third foul and that is eight now on Mississippi State but two shots here for the Florida transfer from Mon and Reeves has five in the game a year ago well in his Florida Career Dan I shouldnt say a year ago played three games in his gator career against Mississippi State averaged 11 points hit almost half his threes and shot 48 did Music kaasi Reeves Jr hits them both here six for him tonight lead to 14 Matthews with hovert out front Matthews all the way with the left hand bell got challenged couldnt control it and finally Kellys got the rebound that was great defense by Sako heres Kelly backs out against Matthews trying to play a little bit more slowly now yep 10 to shoot Kelly now with seven to shoot heres George hell double clutch at three and the long long rebound run into the corner and save to Reeves on a terrific hustle play by danana that was a terrific defensive set by Mississippi State but your defense doesnt end until you get the ball and they were not able to recover it eight to shoot for George again heres Kelly and that got knocked out with one on the shot clock so go get your one second inbound play here 5 10 to go one on the shot Applause clock and kaasi re is going to go right over there in front of my buddy Bill McGee to put it in play lobs it to the basket and stolen out of the air by Bell who had it lost it and then recovered Sako for the dunk if thats not the night in a capsule for the Bulldogs that is totally the night in a capsule for the Bulldogs 16point game under five to go robbert a three and the rebound pulled away by Ibrahim asako Chris Jans and hes really frustrated y tough night I think he felt like that should have been a shot clock violation Music Reeves working against Moore into traffic and left it short they battle inside and Bell or no beg of Parton Jeff came out of there with it here is DJ jeffri and one at the bulldog in terrific drive by Jeff gives him nine and the foul is going to be on George itll be his first eight on Georgia Tech here comes indongo and Debo Coleman back in the ball game well George is trying to play defense and danana just knocks him down down he knocks him into the offensive player Jeff and DJ jeffri whos played 25 or more in every game 25 minutes or more in every game this year thats the line here in the final 416 and completes the threepoint trip and some changes here now for the Bulldogs theyre going to try to press bell is out of the game theyve gone with a faster lineup yep theres a double team back to Jones quickly to Reeves and here is Kelly jackets do not have stur of it on the floor and they turn it over heres the turnover Matthews are going to leave it for a three ball from Davis thats two strong tapped around and Dongo had a shot at it last touched by DJ Jeff or Matthews beg your Parton time out 358 to play 13point lead for Georgia Tech when we continue from Atlanta in the ACC SEC challenge presented by cell Applause Music Ty his third win in five games as the jacket head coach and dare I say his biggest one I dont think theres any question about that Wes if they can get this and theyve got to hang on for the next 3 minutes and 58 seconds but if they can get this this may be you know every coach has one win in his coaching tenure that okay after that we know what were doing and this very well could be that win yep kaasi Rees to put it in play gets it to the Freshman George who started the ball game tonight indongo ahead for colan youre going to have to handle pressure youre going to have to make free throws and you cant totally take your foot off the gas here you want to run some time off the clock but you have to continue to attack and a lot on this young freshman making his first college start tonight Dan Nathan George well he had scored in the second half but hes been very effective handling the ball that ball got knocked away in a turnover last Touch by Coleman in the jacket so and again Wes theyve theyve put taken their foot off the gas a little bit and you want to run some time off the clock but you dont want to get out of the Rhythm that youve been in 12 turnovers tonight on Georgia Tech 325 to go hubard can shoot you right back in at if youre Mississippi State heres a three and its good Josh hubs got 17 thats his third three all here in the second half and a timeout taken by Damon stmy 10point game 315 to go in Atlanta we might be going to the wire here on the opening night back after Music this welcome to a budget won 21 games a year ago but they went four and six on the road last year and they went three and six on the road against Southeastern Conference teams and Dan turnovers a story low number first half big number second half for both schools turnover of course its nine and nine in the second half but that has helped Mississippi State theyve generated some turnovers andve gotten their offense moving just a little bit but more important when theyve generated the turnovers theyve sort of slowed down the Georgia Tech offense and Georgia Tech theyve got a 10point lead and to protect that lead I think they have to continue to attack thrown by Kelly Coleman there to Pi it up though and now throw back into the front court and here is George 10point game hadnt been single digits since late in the first half and the jackets have led all night George working against Matthews trying to beat him to the basket a little follow away too strong tap down heres Davis in the Bulldog hover has been hot from the perimeter Davis to the basket foul thatll be on Nathan George itll be his second and that is nine on George attack but two free throws here for Deshawn Davis Wes that wasnt a turnover but it was a very very difficult shot and when you take tough shots and you miss them that allows your opponent to get out and go Chris Jans team trying to cut it to single digits for the first time since late in the first half and they do on the free throw by Davis with this lineup in the game for Georgia Tech I think Kelly and Coleman and Reeves are the guys who have to be take Reeves taking it to the basket Kelly and Coleman shooting jump shots here comes more pressure thats five all in the second half for Davis Reeves has got to put it in play and Lee Cassel has a foul on Jones itll be nine now on the Bulldog so one and one still a one and one yep and I believe its Ibrahim asako who will be at the free throw line here no Miles Kelly I beg your pardon whos five of six has 19 tonight to go with a career high tying nine Music rebounds free throw good by Kelly West in four and a half games or almost five games now this year Kelly has made 35 free throws last year in the entire season 31 games he made 57 so he talked earlier about the fact that hes gotten a lot more offensive rebounds this year but hes been to the free throw line a lot more this year so hes really expanded his game yep and when he came back from the draft deadline and dipping into the find out what that would be like one of the things Damon STM talked about was his ability to expand his game create more of his game puts the lead back at 10 h Hubbert a long three in the logo rattles out the rebound for Kelly and hes got his first career double double points and rebounds tonight start of it in the back court Loops for Coleman in the four Court Debo for Reeves against Hubbert kaasi for stur of it now and he and George play together Dan as we come up on two minutes and here is Sturman took the contact put it up and got the rebound hell d it back out Kelly goes to the basket got the third try left that short three cracks under two to play its a 10point game hubber Matthews heres Davis thought about the three steps into traffic push the two up it got knocked out George has it thats a great job two on one lob Reeves finally collects up strong and it rolled out mat the rebound Davis for Jones is three nope stament The Rebound with 125 to play enough a lot of energy being expended here West for not a lot of result and a backourt foul called on Cameron Matthews itll be his fourth all here in the second half 10th foul on Mississippi State with 79 seconds to play and our Continental Tire player of the game brought to you by Continental Tires the smart choice in tires is ston Mountain Georges Miles Kelly with his first double double ever tonight his three threepoint makes in the first half really helped get Georgia Tech going west so here is Kelly at the line to add to his total shooting two after the 10th foul and that bouns away just his second Miss tonight here is Trey Fort reporting for Jones in coach Jans lineup second one good W Im not sure you have time to do this two at a time if youre Mississippi State so so one of the reasons fors in the game theyre looking for a three yep theyve gotten very small here is a three and that spins out Kelly had it lost it Matthews back up with it hell draw the foul and it is on Kelly and thats his third and that is 10 on Georgia Tech now with 107 to play so Cameron Matthews will go to the line for his first trip tonight hes 79 on the year 11 14 he plays tonight Matthews does in his 105th college game he is a hard worker oh my goodness every successful team has to have a guy like Matthews dont they absolutely yep I mean youre talking about nine points seven rebounds two and 1 half steals coming in led the team and three assists so now Ford comes out of the game as they go with defense yeah Jones yep and the second one no good KY the Applause rebound stur it fouled so Shawn Jones picks up the foul Mississippi St is over the Lim Sturman doesnt go to the line much but hes pretty good free throw shooter yep Damon star are going to call his group around while Kyle Sturman Kyle Music St Kyle Sturman by the way 117th college game tonight remember he started his career at Southern California he is the godson of ironically Georgia Tech head coach Damon stym Damon and Kyles late father Gary very close friends and the second one good 6 and a half 11 in the game Sturman had 10 double figure games a year ago in ACC play and hes averaging eight and a half coming into tonight through four Davis and one fouled by sterl so Deshawn Davis with 509 left a nice crafty move to get the n one here Dan well defensively if the guy is driving by you like this you just get out of the way and Sturman was trying to get out of the way you dont want to give him the opportunity for the oldfashioned threepoint play and the free throw good by Davis and more pressure coming here from Mississippi State its a 10point game and Georgia Tech hasnt done enough to put this on Ice yet res got to get it in bounds he will bang the time out Damon star will have one to go here with 509 left attention to detail a byproduct of what this guy wants to do with this program he doesnt mind the time out here cuz I think he likes teaching game too Dan I I really do we talked to him this afternoon and I think he really enjoys this and one of the things he stressed was hes an attention to detail guy and Wes the interesting thing about it is we were talking to him and he was talking about being an attention to detail guy and I dont think he even realized he was doing it but while he was talking to us he was picking up the practice jerseys and folding them and I mean he was folding them perfectly and setting them down and so he really does want his team to pay attention to the details I thought the other analogy he used today was he was wearing a hoodie that had a sand castle on it and he said its why I wear this sand castle hoodie because weve got to build a sand castle every day he said but you know what the deal with the sand castle is every day you build one it washes away but you have to remember how you built it and I thought that was so insightful for what this team has got to become for him not just this year but as he rebuilds kind of this basketball Fortune here in Midtown theres a backourt foul and its on Davis itll be his third its going to put Nathan George at the line for his second free throw attempt of the year he missed a chance at a threepoint try earlier in the ball game and for a guy that had the basketball career Damon stms had I mean I just Im really encouraged to hear kind of the things he said today about coming here and and why he want to take on this Georgia Tech Challenge Nathan George this is only his second game of the year MH his saw his first action against Cincinnati yeah so hes got to be a little bit gassed I would think w yeah well George did not get here until the fall he you know some of these guys show up in the summer right George has got double figures in his second in his second game in his first start man how about that Davis on the attack put it on the rim knocked around they battle Davis will get it back score it no timeout asked for by Chris Jans at the Mississippi State bench 36 seconds to go and its a 10point lead for Georgia attack inbounds to Sturman ahead for George and Matthews is going to be called for the foul and thats going to be I believe his Fifth and Cameron Matthews is going to foul out with two points with 306 left to go and here comes for number 11 to replace Matthews George at the line Applause shooting and here is George for a couple first one rattles out stays 10 Im really impressed with his performance Wes I think that you know he struggled a little bit in the second half but he was one of the big keys in the first half hes got 11 now in the ball game heres Davis trying to draw the foul did on Reeves see it just its very difficult to do youre trying to play tough defense but at this point in the game you do not want to commit a foul thats it and Georgia Tech has a relatively small lineup in the game because theyre trying to get out and defend the three but interestingly enough recently Mississippi State hadnt been taking the threes theyve been driving the ball to the basket and on fouls and the free throw for Deshawn Davis is good started his college career at Oregon state from the Bronx in New Applause York 10point game second one good so three possessions it is with 24 seconds left kaasi Reeves to put it in play gets it in Bound in the corner stur ofan is fouled by jeffri theres a good play by stur made a tough catch and then turns and starts up the floor yep the last thing you want to do is stand there and let yourself get trapped theyre not necessarily just going to foul you so you got to get moving and force them to fou you first one by Sturman good and one of the fun things about playing a challenge like this Wes is youve got really good teams and you just dont never know how its going to turn out Mississippi State comes ins the 21st ranked team in the country y Georgia Tech comes in after having lost two in a row Georgia Techs going to come out of here with the win Fort couldnt finish 10 seconds to go taken away by Coleman stepped out of bounds or get timeout no he stepped out of bounds stepped out of bounds Jamie lucky right there with a whistle on you call a timeout when youre in the air flying out of bounds but you cant call a timeout when standing out of bounds thats yeah that is against the rules yeah you cannot do that 10point lead for Georgia Tech 93 to play and Fort will get the dunk for his second field goal but Damon stmy with 6 seconds left heres upset number one in the ACC the SEC challenge presented by Continental TI Georgia Tech hands Mississippi State their first loss of the Year Damon stmy team who lost by
