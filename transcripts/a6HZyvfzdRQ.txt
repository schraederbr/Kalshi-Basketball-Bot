Makai Ashton Lankford who is dressed went through warmups went through a full shoot around today and Earl Grant said is likely to see some time if all went well during that process today and that is important as he has missed the last two kind of coinciding with the leaf Bay coming back and getting healthy so it has been a while since this team has been at full capacity well see how the Eagles do today trying to snap a fourgame skid first chance pickers staff off the assist from Jaden Zachary yeah really nice pass by Zachary Bickerstaff could have a huge opportunity in this game again Stonehill even though theyre not going to be outtighted so to speak their bigs are all mobile bigs theyre all really sort of mobile power forwards so Bickerstaff can dominate around the basket Isaiah Burnett has played extremely well over the last few weeks for Stonehill transfer from Navy who is in his fifth year as a grad student played with Stonehill the last couple of years so hes not a new transfer into the program camp but at the division one level this year hes been very strong so far shot not there rebounded Thatchers Stone a junior who came in from William and Mary Stonehill team with six newcomers this year a bunch of them transfers Applause making the leap to division one Athletics officially this past July joining the NEC coming out of the Northeast 10th there is a league Bay jumper goes in and out charge thank you you see most recently coming off the loss on Saturday in Newark New Jersey against Villanova there is Sims no but a wide open rebound for Max zagarowski the grad student whos played at a couple of different spots started his career at Lynn University then was at Franklin Pierce Applause really good threepoint shooter for the Stonehill team they made 13 threes in their loss on Wednesday night against Ryder a league Bay got it back from Zachary facing a double team and nowhere to go well defended by Cole Perkins Applause Music Sims working against the league Bay Sims trying to find Space Falls away and was short see a couple times now Sims has tried to establish himself in the post lowering that shoulder but not able to move Elite Bay or bickerstyle Music Applause Ace in Madsen who knocked down three threepointers against Villanova the BC loss on Saturday heres Zachary edcoin its a big one and Gene Zachary who has struggled behind the arc just two of 12 over his last two games Earl Grant said hes taken a lot on his shoulders with some of the injuries having to play on the ball more having to guard the other teams best offense to player and knocks down a big threepointer got a half second to really set himself and square up that shot couldnt finish at The Rim against Madsen lob for elite Bay from Langford Music good recognition by Langford spotted Elite Bay who had raced up the floor gotten himself in good position right under the rim and a nice simple pass for the Finish adds in nearly got a steal but it ends up zagarowski Applause Music Sims free throw line thats a little strong foreign Music start for Boston College Stone Hill all of a sudden just one of their last seven from the floor after getting off to a good start and this is turned over to the Skyhawks out front is Stone and missed but Sims has the rebound good job by Sims not giving up on the play there Stone trying to make an impact and flush it down but pretty well defended by Zachary Sims there to clean it up in the end so far Stonehill who has not been a great offensive rebounding team this year has three of them Madison triple is a bit strong and a long rebound comes down to Isaiah Burnett Ray ball zagarowski is good there is no doubt that Stonehill is going to rely on the three we talked about even in game they lost against Ryder on Wednesday they made 13 of them all Grant said big conversation with his team going into this game we have to live with some of them certainly have to guard and defend it but dont get over anxious with it just play it out Music Applause bounce off Bickerstaff good start from three land from Gene Zachary for BC but its Stonehill picture there the Stonehill grad of 2006 now in his 10th season at the Helm of the Skyhawks he is the only Canadian boring head coach of the division one program right now its kind of amazing to think about considering all the Canadian players weve had to play I was gonna say very hard to believe given all the unbelievable Talent thats come out from north of the Border Stonehill team as we said they shoot the ball extremely well that has carried over this was a successful division two program in the ne10 when 15 and 12 last year losing in the any 10 quarterfinals to Pace Josh Mack in the game for the first time for Stonehill owski gave it up there is muser whos in there for the first time and he missed the freshman and here is Makai Ashton Langford who is out there out of the First Media timeout and after missing the last two games due to injury its just a huge lift and it allows Zachary to play off the ball at times and that shows why hes valuable in that spot well two threes for Zachary and both coming off the same exact play excellent Hustle by Pena there for the steal but both coming off a down screen where Zachary is able to step behind set himself and knock down a three and yeah whos in there now but blocked it as well Ashton Langford pull up two is a bit strong and then a foul on the rebound will go against McLaughlin this ones a carbon copy of the first threepointer he hit right good screen Zachary shows like hes going around and just a simple little half step back to lose the defender it creates just enough of a window where hes able to set his feet square up and sight the rim talk to Earl Grant this morning and chewed around and he said you know this is the Jaden Zachary who is basically our fourth scoring option maybe early in the season but all of a sudden because the injuries is now kind of the first scoring option when makais not out there I mean thats quite a load to put on him so he is adjusting to that and the threepoint shot has maybe suffered a little bit because of it but looked good so far today good defense there by Demar Langford on that drive by Christopher melons yeah its not the minutes load right Zachary is essentially playing the same amount of minutes as he did last year its just what hes being asked to do in that time frame is a lot more Music foreign Sims tried to drive to the basket Zachary helping out there doing what he does best on the defensive end I think that was only our second or third whistle of cocaine flown through here in the early going from Conti Forum value jinxed us I mean its best hopefully its not too much Zachary three ball is in and out Music thank you Applause Music skip pass for Sims waited on my blocked in butt strap s Applause go up and down Heels come off the floor get away with that one and hes gonna know it too but he saw McLaughlin flying at him and understandable why you would double clutch there meanwhile even the mystery by Zachary as you said in and out but same setup right yeah the screen high on the ball and hes able to just use that little quick half step to create the space from Stone Hill youre gonna have to start figuring out how to defend that a little better Zachary who is a 48 threepoint shooter last year just nine of 34 this year coming in but two already early Corner three that one hit the backboard first for Burnett and out of bounds going to Boston College Ill tell you what Stone Hill has been really competitive on the glass early on I think thats a carryover from what happened in their last game against Ryder they got crushed on the boards in the second half out rebounded by 2311 margins so Chris Krauss drilling that message to him to his team and they have come to fight on the glass here early on theyve been out rebounded by an average of seven and a half per game this year and thats probably the spot where you would look at a D2 to D1 transition its maybe the size of some of the bigs is really being the most difficult step theres McLaughlin inside affected at The Rim well I think a lot of people would look at it that way that its the size its not so much the size height of the players its its how theyre utilized I mean youve seen zagarowski hes six foot eight but hes not playing in the post hes playing around the arc all turned over it which goes back the other way when we come back weve gone two minutes and 23 seconds without a point still 109 DC this is the stretch that weve been talking about since the victory over Rhode Island Eagles have dropped four in a row three of those away from Conti Forum Villanova neutral sight game on Saturday in Newark New Jersey Applause the last game before a mini break going into finals here at Boston College the Eagles will not play again until next Wednesday the 21st into ACC play against the 24th ranked Virginia Tech Hokies cheers Stone got in Music front and has a friendly role I feel like thats going to be important for Boston College right for a team thats really struggling offensively you just saw for the last few games you know really a tough slog its even crack 60 points some of those times get easy buckets get out transition and run big block by McLaughlin coming in and read it well stonehills gone four and a half minutes without a point here put the Eagles up by three Chaz Kelly out there for the first time for Boston College Ashton Lankford thought about it Music Cali with Ted off the window Applause really nice touch by The Freshman there going to the off the end of the weak side Applause theres Sims inside doubled and triple team came and Madsen ends up committing the foul foreign go back to the block just great timing recognize that brunette was going to have to go up on that side of the rim two guys already in his face so he doesnt see McLaughlin coming over to challenge the shot its been terrific at that tremendous game against Nebraska just love the energy brings Off the Bench hes in foul trouble against Villanova so that kind of knocks down some of the numbers on this stretch but in the five games prior to Villanova was averaging 12 and a half points a game its up to 13th from the ACC in blocks this year and its kind of a rarity in college athletics right now but took a true Redshirt season last year and Earl grants talked about how being able to develop and practice every day against James karnick and Quinton post really helped his development and has allowed him to take this leap as quickly as he has Ashton Langford a little off the mark from three Applause Music Applause the way those free throws from Sims ended the scoring run but its still over five minutes without a field goal for Stonehill Sims and the three ball has not been there eagles have done a nice job defending the perimeter for the most part just three threepoint attempts until now and a fourth was well strong Kelly on the Run sin transition and step back all in and out Music hes actually the team jacking up more threes early on mentioned how sees a little bit better when theyre closer maybe 15 threepoint attempts per game rather than the higher number which theyve had over the last few games and he said you know some of thats a function of Makai not being there so the offense changes a little bit and for Stonehill today you see the shooting numbers theyre just two of their last 12 without a field goal in six minutes of game time but I think most importantly only four attempts from three yeah Eagles have done a great job closing down especially on these high ball screens that was nearly a travel plate on and the three ball was well off and user knew it as soon as he let it go it ends up out of bounds some of what were talking about with the threepoint numbers for Boston College and as weve said Earl Grant has made a mention of the fact that his team a little bit better when the numbers are a little bit lower this is over the last two seasons combined you see when attempting 15 threes or fewer see the record is much better than otherwise well on Pace right now for 15 or more already seven through this first half but again you think back to the seven shots well youre certainly not going to quibble with the three that Zacharys put up hes hit two of them that transition three by Madsen thats a pretty good look for him youre okay with him taking that shot so I wouldnt quibble with most of the attempts I think youd have to its a situation where you have to go back and assess as a coach you know is this a good threepoint shot or is this threepoint shot that we can get any time and dont necessarily need it at that stage of where we are in the shot clock or its Val against Boston College on Prince Elite Bay before the inbounds skip pass for zagarowski to recycle the offense still a threepoint lead for Boston College theres Josh Beck whos good ends the stretch of six and a half minutes without a field goal for Stonehill and they have tied the game thanks to the threepointer and you wonder if the defense they played during that stretch allowing them to hang tight at three might give them a little lift Zachary on the drive no look for bickers staff who cant get it to go Music both teams have certainly not lit it up offensively so far Zips contested at The Rim by bickerstown and you can see hes thinking about it anytime he catches the ball underneath he knows theres a shot blocker or two coming to get him pick her staff out for Kelly at an opening for a moment tried to get it inside to Elite Bay and Stonehill did a nice job collecting but it is out of bounds and well stay with Boston College when we come back finally finds the big one from three and we are full sweet here Boston College thats why the Eagles are going a mini break before playing next Wednesday against Virginia Tech were in a moment right now in this game where there are some things defensively that perhaps both coaches or these with but been able to take advantage of it because of some core offensive moments over the last little bit of time and that is down to Stonehill uh we are right now it can find three for 20 from the floor uh between these two teams over the last 20 attempts yeah youd like to chalk it up to great defense on both ends but realistically theres some makeable baskets in that stretch that both teams have missed Langford stripped from behind nearly Josh Mackville commits a foul in the process this part is the good defense now Langford Jr getting his hands in there and then forcing the foul back the other way Music you Earl Grant has talked so many times in his two years here at the helm of Boston College how click here what it looks like hes talked about the Mantra of pretty not pretty and uh hes told us before the game he said you know its still not even about the wins its about doing the right things and uh he really believes if they do that the winds will take care of themselves one is off the mark from Ashton Lankford theres no doubt the Eagles are in a bit of a tough four losses in a row in a row the last game going into ACC play is Shamir Johnson the fifth year from Waterbury Connecticut has his first two and gives Stonehill the lead again its a long stretch so it doesnt necessarily feel this way but it is the 70 run for Stonehill over the last three and a half minutes Langford Falling Away Big Shot Put it to par to get on the board for the first time yeah and thats obviously one of the guys youd like to see get it going for Boston College you mentioned the mini break coming up before really the teeth of ACC play gets underway so this is a game where youd like to see the Eagles start to try to you know establish some good habits and start to build some confidence in some of their key guys ahead of conference action Zachary nearly had the steal but was called for the foul in the process it would be Stonehill possession once again some of the impact of the the players who have been out at times this year weve talked about Langford weve talked about Makai Ashton Lankford and then you had a league Bay who was out and came back in a brief time against Duke but really came back against New Hampshire and then as I was talking about Donald hand out for this season being injured in the Detroit Mercy game 16 apiece zagarowski is Off the Mark and this is out ahead to CJ Pena and he is fouled on the way up wondering if there was a travel there at paying you but theyll call good recognition by paying you that ball coming right to Zachary quick leak up the floor and it looks like he did get away with a third step there I mean I think the one thing that is a real positive defensively for Boston College right now is holding Stonehill two of seven for free maybe even notably the seventh more than the two is really sticking to the game plan that Earl Grant put into place tonight yeah theyve really limited the opportunities most of those threepoint attempts have been fairly well contested hes doing a good job communicating theyre seeing a lot of high ball screens theyre doing a good job either switching or double teaming hedging off those screens and then getting back three ball is in and out so another one Off the Mark Isaiah Burnett 32 threepoint shooter oh for two out there tonight its nearly stripped from behind and it is going to stay here Applause Music Zachary and pain youre not on the same page theres Zachary tried to thread the needle through the Boston College will inbound with 18 on the timer question Langford whos played good minutes in this first half so far and four points for Makai and only play nine minutes in the game against Duke so its really missed most of the last three games though officially missed the last two Burnett nice speed inside the Eagles collapsed on it but it sets up zagarowski with Penn pretty good look from three but its not there that of fastball is picked off by Shamir Johnson zagarowski will find Burnett sets his feet three ball is Applause snuckering here is Pena on the drive hey yeah floater and thats the one that goes I think that thing touched the Raptors before it came down its a rainbow and a half it is a sixnothing run for the Eagles and the kai Ashton Langford comes up with the steal and the layin and a timeout taken by Stonehill Applause well a mini 10nothing run for Boston College who all of a sudden is setting the offensive world on fire theyve made four shots in a row 2416 back in a bit Applause 2416 lead for Boston College and the Eagles best stretch of the game here of late yeah how about this nice touch on the floater from CJ Pena and then this is really where BC could have a tip pack defense to offense great vision by Makai Ashton Langford spotting where that ball is going to go sneaks around the corner picks zakarowskis pocket and takes care of it going the distance Applause this is where I want a game like this for Boston College and you kind of take over this game it feels like theres a moment here of potential momentum run to kind of put this game Out Of Reach at the end of the first half but can you do it played well defensively so far is there a run to be had its 10 at the moment for BC and that is McLaughlin who got a piece and then pulled it out to the ocado nearly going over towards some of the Boston College administrators who have already been knocked over once this week me a step back and a three and good seven for CJ Pena its 13 in a row for BC I had a feeling this could be a big game for him hes been a huge spark plug Off the Bench all season long and with his ability to stretch the floor just hustles makes plays on both ends hes having a solid first half Burnetts floater was off I mean for a team that shoots as well as Stonehill does it is just kind of shocking to see them shooting of all this poorly Zachary with a nice step back but you give credit to Boston College shes played really well defensively and as Earl Grant told us before the game we need to contest every three even if theyre gonna make some and the Eagles to their credit have that was a pretty good look and it did not go its a 15nothing run its an 18 nothing run and another timeout by Stonehill CJ Pena up to 10 points almost all of them are on this run 18 in a row for Beast its a 3216 lead for Boston College thanks to an 18nothing run where the Eagles have knocked down seven shots in a row compared to oh of six for Stonehill over the last three and a half minutes a little bit of malaise offensively to start this one off but CJ Banyan Makai Ashton Langford helping to light the torch for the Eagles straight on three good for Thatcher Stone to end the Run so it ends at 18 and that was the shot for Stonehill made after missing six in a row from the floor and that is an offensive foul on a glockton and that is the second foul so second game in a row in foul trouble for Devin McLaughlin Music yeah really tough against Villanova I mean bailing out is one thing belly down in seven minutes is impressive yeah just got into foul trouble early and never really got into a rhythm so its coming up at halftime hoping to speak with both coaches and well get to know the Boston College basketball team a bit off the floor Josh Mack inside it now has five so Stonehill has a couple points in a row here back with five straight 11 point lead Mason madsons back out there for BC with two fouls launching a three ball at Josh Mack finds a way to rebound I mean the one positive for Stonehill I think is theyve been really competitive on the glass today Corner three no from Nellis but another offensive board and a second one and the put back good and now Earl Grant calls for time that was the first breakdown in a while defensively after some good sequences for Boston College sir Earl Grant will chat it over and so after 18 points in a row for Boston College seven straight points for Stonehill tell me about that timeout for old Grant whats he using that for Rebound rebound the ball two straight offensive rebounds for Stonehill on the other side and not much of a contest on the offensive putback either Zachary good luck a very impressive first half for Jake Zachary who is now Boston Colleges leading scorer with 11 including three of four from behind the arc and that is a much needed sight for BC well answered by Shamir Judson much needed Cipher Stone Hill as well it had some trouble knocking down threes all of a sudden they hit two straight thats gonna ignite the rest of the team Johnsons been the guy all year better than 50 percent from Deep Off the Bench Zachary in and out in the Stonehill rebound I dont know if this was like a NBA 2K game or something where someone went from like all pro difficulty on offense to like rookie but all of a sudden the offense has come to life both ways after we had some tough moments early its 3526 Boston College with 110 remaining here in the first half and here is Matt against Pena nice back cut but missed at The Rim by Christopher melons possessionals stay here with the Skyhawks a rare situation where Jaden Zachary gets caught sleeping a little bit launching the ball and doesnt see his man cutting rights to the rim pretty well defended off the imbalance by TJ pickers staff not as good as the Eagles could have done there foreign and on the floor trying to save it but stonehills back the other way with possession extra pass Corner three stone no and the Eagles thats about a six second difference between The Possession and the game here at the end of the first half really good contest there by Zachary he was able to sort of fly out of stone without coming anywhere close to landing on him still sort of throwing off his vision on that shot Langford got rid of it Pena three ball at the end of the timer no rebound off of Madison ends up with melis at the buzzer its short from Shamir Johnson Applause a little bit of a run late starts to believe a little bit more I think if you had told Earl Graham youd be getting four of 15 from three for Stone Hill he would have signed up for that for sure out of that first half paymia really the 10 points as we talked about a punch sparking the run it was pretty crucial I think eight of his ten were part of that 18 nothing run for BC heres Sims inside it was really held in check in that first half four points on one of five shooting or Sims who came in as we talked about off the top of the show averaging 17 points a game you will go to the foul line early not your team got the bonus of that first half not a ton of fouls either way a lot of shots off itll be interesting to see because that was a call that Sims wasnt getting early on so now if hes getting that call in the second half creates a whole new dynamic that was the first foul on TJ Bickerstaff or some of the numbers on Sims whos been really good of late and all season long weve talked about the third in the NEC in points per game he was in any 1013 selection last season for Stonehill rare oh for two trip of the line for a guy who shoots at 86 percent Applause good from the stripe each were two of two unlimited chances in the first half here is Burnett nearly taken away by Langford Burnett got a shot up out of it though and then a floater for bicker staff who Waits and is found in as the bucket Applause look at the smile on his face he feels feels like its been waiting for an eternity for one of these to drop for him great recovery defense by Langford Jr after he gives up the turnover on the other end Edson helps compete for the rebound great Outlet past Zachary and then Becker staff good composure on the Finish its a 3826 is the Boston College lead PJ bicker staff up to five points now got off to such a fast start offensively this season at double doubles in each of his first two games Music rebounding numbers who continue to be strong top 10 of the ACC this year for bickerstown to rebound down TJ Bickerstaff hes just trying to muscle leak Bay off the spot for the league Bay such a strong customer in his own right youre not going to move him easily Bay who played nine minutes in that first half for Earl Grant here is DeMar Langford as the Eagles again content to work deep into the timer and all things considered shot the ball pretty well in that first half vickerstaff was affected from behind by a symbols stand up shooting 47 in the first half which at one moment certainly felt hard to believe but then got hot talked about seven for seven from the floor on the 180 run that was well defended Music a league Bay on the drive right hand is found um he could feel him trying to set up zagarowski for the move there and thats maybe a little bit of a generous whistle for a league they looked like zagarowski went straight up and down there I think they wont mind it again this is still you know shown well through this first half of the season but again you always have to remember his Refreshments it was always going to be some adjustment in terms of figuring out what he can and cant do at this level Applause Music and was injured just four minutes into the game against Detroit Mercy and then missed some time came back got in the game against Duke for four minutes before hes come back filling it out limited minutes against New Hampshire and Villanova so far today has three points NBCs lead is 3926 Sims is felt looked like that was a league Bay and all of a sudden a much happier game than what we saw in the first half its coming up holding his face you know they got him on the follow through there interesting one certainly where its taken its twist and turns where for you know what a good good part of 10 12 minutes feels like nobody could throw the ball in the ocean then nobody can miss now you get one where you know all of a sudden it looks like free throws are going to have a huge impact on the second half as we said neither team got into the bonus in the first half so we just had four total free throw attempts and the first half already had five here in the second Applause Langford elbow is a bit strong offensive rebound came down to biggerstaff Finds Its way to elipe who is infected at the rim and then finally pulled by Stonehill was Ethan at muser who found the ball on the court possession back the other way Music Applause Sims realize he had the advantage on Langford for a moment but then finds the Lefty floater good luck from Sims Music 15 points a game last year and hes managed to raise it this year in his first D1 season and then fouls bickerstaffed on the attempt at The Rim thank you his old school post play here from Sims just waits for the rest of his teammates to clear out waits for Madison on the Poke and then this little old school hook shot Ill imagine Jamar Lankford finds himself defending true post players a whole lot Applause of knocks down the free throw TJs is a 55 percent throw shooter this year six points five rebounds for bicker staff tonight Music Applause Music 4129 Boston College Music Applause got switched onto a league Bay cut by him and then finds the cutter floater good from melons is a seasoned high for melis with four points for the sophomore thank you Applause Zachary twisting Applause League Bay for Langford inside against a couple of Defenders and draws the Bell Music a couple times stonehills gotten some easy baskets off Cuts see a couple times here nice job by melas waiting for Mac to get underneath draw the extra man slashes to the rim its easy dish Music Langford short from the foul line I mean this has been a totally different half virtually entirely at the fell line if both teams definitely appear more committed to attacking the rim I think we saw both sides settle for a lot of threepoint shots in the first half which if youre stonedale you say well this is part of our game so its okay as long as theyre good looks Austin College ended up making more and certainly committed to getting Sims going for his Stonehill eight points break apart nine points for Andrew Sims well you heard what Chris Cross said coming out of halftime right is he wanted his team to sort of just have that belief Factor more Zachary on the layup for Boston College he has 13 and that includes Sims who you saw was kind of shortarming some of those shots inside afraid of the shot blockers in the first half well now hes saying well Im going strong whether you like it or not foul me or Im getting the bucket a bucket no Langford sends it out Madison surpass Zachary on the drive but the floater was infected Applause Music expensive sequence by Stonehill theyre late after the eagles look to be a pass ahead on the sequence still an 11 point game Mac for Sims again going against a league bit so Im a Glock to Langford got a piece of that and then it bounced off Mack it finds Lankford Eagles will get a possession its Metson whos short from three Applause feels like hes trying to find his shot thought he had it going against Villanova knocked down a couple Breeze against the Wildcats in the loss but still trying to find his rhythm from the outside that first couple looks look good but still old for foyer from behind the arc tonight Music remember we were talking about the Eagles threepoint attempts they really seemed like they were going to be elevated again early theyve not had as many hero played five for 13 in the game Stone Hill four of 16 11 point lead for Boston College a league Bay had it stripped Lankford was there balls still loose played it out and Shamir Johnson came away with it here is Sims just put his head down Zim certainly has come alive here in the second half he will go to the line to try to get the double figures Eagles hold an eye to an 11 point lead over the main dog of his Stone Hill Attack so far in his second half yeah you can see hes really you know started to believe in himself more in the low post especially here in the second half hes drawn a couple fouls some nice slow post moves opening up to that left hand score in a variety of ways we talked about his ability to knock down the outside shot but he has really looked to attack the basket hes finding some more Effectiveness here in the second half Music see the difference in the numbers and of course we just hit the First Media window of this second half Sims will come out now after knocking in a couple of free throws so he is into double figures 11 points and it brings Stonehill back within nine Ashton Langford back into the game for Boston College played 10 minutes so far for Earl Grant coming back from injury Zachary Rises and off the mark Applause saw a couple of mini runs Stonehill 70 at one point and stream Eagles 18 to nothing significant run in that first half chappier to start the second is there a run to be had either way in your quarter boys have the touch oh boy CJ Pena the Gratitude coming in from division two Trevecca Nazarene originally played two years at Taylor University in the NAIA Music its remarkable to go back and sort of chart his career history and how quick his Ascension has been really capable score at times of this starting lineup if times Off the Bench the BC has needed in big spots that jumper was good from Johnson to give him seven so we fluctuated between an 11 and nine point Boston College lead coming up on 12 minutes remaining here in the game Madsen got stuck inside and it Cycles around to Zachary Jaden on the drop Jake is blocked and it is Stonehill Mall walked off of him adding insult to injury there excellent block by Pena showing he can get it done on both ends of the floor he felt like this was going to be a good matchup for him just in terms of hes a mobile big for the most part hes going to be playing against mobile Biggs he saw the success he had at the division two level last year so you felt like this this would be an opponent he might be able to sort of sink his teeth into a little bit hes at exactly that type of impact coming off the bench shoot up Music nice little fake but then Ashton Lankford read it well after Thatchers Stone got around Zachary and knocked it out of bounds six to shoot when we come back 4637 BC contributed major points when Boston College has needed them this evening not just tonight but really all season long being has come up big in several spots and really feels like hes taking advantage of the opportunity with quick post down at the early part of the Season you know you dont know what Penas role would have been without that injury but hes gotten an opportunity hes making the most of it remember only six to shoot off of that sequence but the quick trigger seemed a bit early but it ended up cycling around at an offensive rebound and then Isaiah Burnett on this drive couldnt get the dunk down but did get fouled nice fine by Bergen Burnett with Acres of open space it looks like Kelly really just tried to play Matador there and get out of the way of the unrushing bowl but I just grazed him enough called for the foul foreign Boston College has four players with two fouls right now Zachary alife McLaughlin and Madison Bergen with two fouls on the Stonehill side two misses at the line by Burnett even there surprising for Stonehill best freethrow shooting team in the NEC just 510 and most of thats been in the second half where theyve struggled and Sims a lot of that missed his first three so you know not a guy you expect to miss three straight at any point really during the season almost segarowski three ball good time clean look eight for zagarowski yeah one of the few times painting got caught sleeping on the defensive end late to get out magorowski makes a pay it is 4840 Stonehill as close as theyve been in the second half Pena falls off Applause he has not gotten many unfriendly bounces so far this year attempt from Stone and then Makai is fouled Applause C Pena caught not knowing whether hes switching with Kelly there so hes a step late zagarowski able to settle and knock down the three bench loving it but then the kayashed in Langford again getting himself in the passing Lane just love his vision in transition you know so calm with the ball able to assess what the defense is trying to take away and get himself to the freethrow line or get a teammate in open look Music Applause Music one of two for Makai Applause seven points in 13 minutes three rebounds coming back from injury today for Makai Ashton Lankford Music 4940 lead BC Burnett are there by Langford got it down Music Applause Music Andrew Sims with 13 again feels like they like that match up theyre trying to Target its us with Sims against tavar Langford a couple times now hes just giving him the body bump and langfords giving up a little bit of ground in the process Applause the kai Ashton Langford was trying to get it to my blocked in that time its a bit of a tough angle on that entry pass three balls shorts from Johnson I think you would have seen a BC timeout had that one gone down Music Applause Stone Hill has continued to stay close that is a foul for a reach in against Johnson frequently see the work inside Just Hits him with the body once twice gets them to shift back a little bit empty spin move opens up the easy finish locked in inside I dont know how Austin Langford finds that angle on the pass terrific wrap around backhand pass Glock is just able to sky above everybody Music Applause Music back to a nine point game Burnett best move in a while he had been held in check with just two points thats a good adjustment by Stonehill right BC doesnt switch so this time its Langford scene on Burnett and Burnett Just Hits him with the same move that Sims just did unblocked in good find Percy J Pena Applause sixth time in double figures for CJ pamia this year and he is too short uh the division one career high Music Applause grade ball denial by Zachary DC possession how good is that fine by McLaughlin to see the double team and slip it to Pena I see what Earl Grahams been doing with that front court right hes basically playing them in pair shifts so he starts with the league Bay and bicker staff then he brings in McLaughlin and Pena and I think right now at least tonight the combination about Lockton and pink is giving him a lot more on both ends here is Pena against Sims double team came somebodys open Zachary three ball is strong Music cycle the offense well but Zachary just a bit strong on the corner three Sims thought about the answer instead of the draw and working with the left hands see now hes got confidence in his game so hes able to go up against anybody Applause Music and it looked like there was a whistle before the inbound langfords been teed up by Ted Valentine Applause it looked like he blew the whistle Applause had some words after the fact I think hes done he got the ball in before the whistle came so either way we will step aside 7 31 remaining here in the second half and after the technical foul Stonehill will have a free throw coming up 5346 is the Boston College lead Applause Music Applause Music so 5346 and here is the technical that was eventually caused not caught there that was just a stop at your play he was trying to stop and then uh obviously ruling that perhaps the guy was saying something under his breath whatever it was Ted Valentine calling the technical foul so uh two shots and the ball for Stonehill and really in an important moment right here with 7 31 remaining in the second half 5346 so one of two at the line Applause making pardon Two Shots it remains Boston College possession foreign but you wonder if Ashton Langford will be back at some point may depend on how this next little stage goes if BC is able to sort of bounce back build a little more cushion a Glock to new tried to at the lane but you gotta catch it first thatll be Stone Hill ball felt like the balls getting stuck a little bit on the offensive end for BC right now hes not able to distribute it cleanly either to the post or sometimes out along the perimeter and Stonehill doing a good job crowding the space Applause back Cycles around segarowski orto shoot Sims launching and strong feels like a moment either way right here a little bit of a shift defensively that time they had Zachary in on Sims which you would think would be a mismatch in favor of Sims said often time Zachary has drawn the other teams best offensive weapon well thats definitely been Sims in the second half Applause to shoot Pena for three likes and look with zagarowski getting a hand in his face Eagles have not scored in two and a half minutes Applause back again lost the handle on the drive Zachary out front behind the back look Pena who is fouled Applause Music spanu caused that steal with a little poke knocked it off backs me the team user again trying to get out of the way its the second time a guy trying to sort of pull out of the way of a guy driving to the rim has gotten called for that block certainly you do not feel uh envious of those players Im Im not trying to bump him not trying to make contact Im literally giving him the space calling for a foul and that kind of half though we saw it very early on established in the first few minutes with you know a lot of those whistles attacking the rim grant called over Zachary and Langford and Madison there ahead of the free throw which is off the line Applause Music Applause Dania ends the scoring drought one of two at the line he is one shy of his BCI leading the eagles with 15 points simis has 15 on the other side to match for Stonehill Burnett sends it zakorowski and the Skyhawks have caught it to a Four Points game again plenty of time to set in fire Langford thinking about the rebound crash in the rim doesnt get out in time zagarowski doing what he does best Applause Zachary seven to shoot Jaden got inside big take by Zachary whos up to 15 theyre really good patience there he saw the double team come beamed pulling him back out that gave him the space to go back to a oneonone matchup and he did a great job elevating caught back flatfooted that gave the space to bank it in Airborne to catch that pass Strip by BC as fuser lost the handle Applause Music Applause Stonehill five of their last seven from the floor Langford five to shoot working at SIMS lost his splitting but somehow kept the pass alive Zachary floater is off four minutes to go here in Chestnut Hill and Stone Hill hanging tough Applause Music it has been a game of runs in Stone Hill on one at the moment Sims inside back to four quick turn again he just sort of lulls you to sleep by leaning on you and then just some terrific footwork inside to split that double team everybody Applause Zachary inside blocked but a foul Applause so BC will go to line up by four but its in eight three Stonehill run in this game and you see the work hes done in the second half of the Skyhawks well its been a massive turnaround for the Stonehill in this second half shooting better than 50 percent from the floor and Sims is a big part of the reason why you you heard again Chris Krauss talk about the coming out of halftime soon we have to believe you know we just have to believe we can play and Sims I think was really sort of the focal point of that you saw in the first half he was sort of shying away from going into the contact second half he has not been shy at all he is initiating the contact on a lot of these BC Defenders thats whats giving them the space to make some of those layups Factory one of two at the line he is tied to season high with 16 points interesting to see Earl Grant roll out his smallest lineup of the day here for what is essentially now crunch time for the Eagles McLaughlin really the only big on the floor and Makai Ashton Langford back in there and that is out of bounds and going back to BC oh and instantly Makai Ashton Langford makes his impact felt on the defensive end how many times does it feel like hes just sort of halted a run whether its getting his hands on a pass hitting in a passing Lane a deflection hes forced a number of turnovers tonight foreign Music fluctuated early in the half between 11 and 9 points dont know hanging in Langford hanging in the air and couldnt finish at The Rim really good luck on the cut by McLaughlin pops out for tomorrow Langford Applause Music Applause Alice a trapped had to Dish it off with 13 to shoot good help from Madison there Music be careful here of your Boston College if were going to double down and help out on Sims you got to know if youre coming off a shooter or not Applause turned over and then a held ball possession will stay here with Stonehill good job by McLaughlin theyre recognizing the lob and just out jumping Sims to go get it good hustle play vibernate to tie him up and steal The Possession back Music Burnett on the truck its Away by Zachary and it will stay here with seven to shoot for Stonehill he was sure he knocked that ball off for that out of bounds not inside of two minutes so no reveal foreign Applause for recognizing the way this game is going right now you know if youre putting your head down and going to the rim more often than not youre getting the benefit of the call that time played the shot clock he knows hes got to get something up so he does just that Music free throws have been a struggle in this second half Applause BC just 8 of 13 and Stonehill most notably I mean this is a Stonehill team Applause the NEC and came in if they were allowed to statistically count theyre new to division one so their stats dont count in the statistics in the same way which is an oddity of the transition D1 this would be the sixth best freethrow shooting team in the country theyre five of 12 in the second half and still by the way down four still very much in this game yeah dont get me started on the the whole transition rule process thats a Manifesto you dont want to hear ass was ahead of McLaughlin its taken away down to 90 seconds left and the lead is four Burnett Applause as it Cycles around for Stony Hill and here is six this is a mismatch got Madsen McLaughlin trying to help it does allow Matson to switch off and then gets the turnover well they rushed it they tried to find the open man as Manson was trying to find his assignment they wanted zagarowski open in the corner oh McLaughlin was too close with his reach able to swipe that pass out of midair Earl Grant will call for time Eagles well try to draw something up 103 to go BC up by four second half its a 5753 lead for Boston College over Stone Hill and I think the most amazing thing about this is not even so much that were here and Stone Hill is in this game but how theyre in this game without really a great threepoint shooting game yeah this this scheme has not at all gone according to script even though we thought it could be a close game this script for this being a close game is not at all how you would have thought it would have gone Zachary on the drive got all the way to the the 10 oh boy he had the look but couldnt finish and Langford got hit is behind the play and its turned over thats into the bucket is blocked by it will count oh my so much happened in that sequence Zachary had a great take missed Stonehill had the opportunity but then threw it away Zachary with a tip there leads Madsen onto the run out back yeah it looks like he just gets it after its on the glass they have gone over to the Monitor and will review the goaltending if it stands it would be a six point lead for Boston College with 379 to go and how about that for a way to get your first bucket right what a sequence down the stretch boy thats really really close and again this is one of those situations where you have to find indisputable evidence to overturn the call I dont know if theres anything you know its interesting weve had one or two sequences that last one that we just saw and then one a little earlier as well where it felt like there was a real moment for Stonehill to take a Stranglehold on some level of a comeback just got sped up a little bit well exactly the last two possessions you know trying to rush a pass into the backcourt either looking for a quick shot or or trying to get BC you know this match defensively of Old Times rushing the pass either a deflection in a steal or a Straight Out steal those are sort of the learning curves right you know for for a team in transition you know those are the things that maybe you get away with last year that youre not going to get away with this year so this is very close to get on a gold 10 and important to note as you said that the call on the floor was goaltending and a good basket 379 to go almost call on the floor will stand as called so the basket counts and one more look yeah again its one of those when you watch it on replay you just think it its so difficult to discern one way or another and just whatever the first call was gonna be thats what was going to be the call weve talked about it a few times another moment where Stonehill has gone three minutes without a field goal weve had these runs today where both teams have just not been able to find baskets from the floor Zachary nearly got a steal it ended up opening up since 53 what a shot I got caught reaching Sims who has now looked for that outside shot all day finally gets one when he needs it most and now the pressure is on for BC at the free throw line this is the one thing that can happen when you go for the steal sometimes man just ended up working out perfectly for Sims whos up to 20 points in the game his fifth time with 20 points in his first division one season pretty amazing stuff so Madson at the line as you said just had his first two points on the goaltend and makes a big free throw to keep it a two possession game on a day where free throw shooting has been a little bit ugly for both teams I dont think theres any other guy youd rather have at the line of your Earl Grant made two late in a key spot against New Hampshire before the Wildcats ended up tying the game from three the game that Bostic college would have oh certainly going to have a lot of lots of experience in close games to the Eagles as they go into ACC play Maybe wishing some of those had gone more in their Direction but you know the pressure amps up a notch now after this this week off basically to get ready right now you just are doing anything you can to escape this 227 seconds find a win go into this break and if youre Stonehill first division one season what a massive lift this could be but work to do down by five 227 ago found 13 a moment ago dont necessarily need one now but it is getting later on Burnett take it away by victory shot clock off Eagles get fouled with 73 to go and that might just about do it boy that has been the man found his offensive game early but his defense has been solid all year long you show him that ball even a millimeter of it and his hands are super quick he will pick your pocket Zachary with his third steal of the game the blocked and makes one and this is really the even with 73 to go make it three and say goodnight sees it Sims late no good and Boston College survives Applause Music Applause 6356 the final and the Eagles will take a six and six record Into the Heart of the ACC season in eight days well I think survival
