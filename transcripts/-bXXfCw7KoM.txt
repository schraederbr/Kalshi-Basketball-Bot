Florida state is a tough place to kind of start off your first ACC season but you know what lville is ready to play theyre going to shoot a lot of Threes Florida State doesnt allow you to make a lot of them so its going to be an interesting game coming in whos going to impose their will upon this game it is early in the conference schedule but both of these teams looking for their first ACC win the cards in the traveling black Kentucky heurn the transfer from Wisconsin spent three years in that program and there the leading score for Louisville this season that is knocked out of bounds by Davis and it will stay with the Cardinals theres that defensive pressure by Florida State top 20 in the country and turnovers forced Louisville has to be aware of make sure they make good passes and come to the ball John mentioned the cards shooting threepointers they attempt 32 threes per game on average that is the most in the ACC and sixth most in the country with the shot clock at 10 Edwards kicks it out heurn shot clock winding down B Bowen defending little step back never hit the rim and its a shock clock violation fla States defense we talked about it a little bit thats just what they do they defend they have length they have sides the second tallest team in the country besides Duke that is what they want to do they theyre getting back to those ways when we talked to Coach Hamilton yesterday thats what they Pride themselves in so theyre coming off a win Tuesday on this floor against winr out of the Big South 8264 Pat Kelce was a coach at winthrip in Rock Hill South Carolina and spent the last few years at the College of Charleston the first points belong to the nolles and Davis for three not known as a shooter more a driver and the defender shooting 27 for the year knocked that one down 10th made three of the the season for dayquan Davis The Freshman from Baltimore Maryland Louisville has to start making passes more in the interior theyre starting their offense out too high that makes it tough to score heurn against B Bowen well defended and the rebound from bu Bowen Applause were in t Tallahassee Florida for game two of CW Courtside Saturday some of you saw SMU with its Victory against Boston College in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts in our first game of the day on Courtside Saturday Tom warmy along with North Carolina great John Hensen with courtside at the Tucker Center and a turnover for Louisville dayquon Davis has the only points of our game so far hes got a threepointer water man has a three for the bill Waterman sixyear guy he shot the ball really well last year not as well this year youd imagine thats going to turn around this is a good start for louisv who were going to see a lot of those threes go up today yeah shooting just 24 from Beyond The Arc for Noah Waterman the Grand St student move on the inside bounces out Scott grabs it good d by Scott hes going to have his hands full today with youan thats a good start by him chesting up making him shoot a tough shot Yan the junior college player of the year last season an AllAmerican in addition to this Florida State lineup Hadley had nowhere to go shot clock goes inside of 10 for Chucky heurn another down to two John they finally get it away and Edwards scores cant get discouraged by that it was a good defensive possession Edwards is what we call a tough shot Taker and a tough shot maker certainly did almost 14 points per game for Edwards this season for the grad student from Atlanta Georgia and a transfer from James Madison back the other way trir Watkins leading score on his team he does it all for them he is their leader on the court and off the court Hadley Glides to the rim for two for Louisville that was a concern for Coach Hamilton last last night in practice the transition offense I dont know if hes too happy about that one right there jir Watkins just over 19 points per game that his third best in the ACC B bone with the kick out Jackson Edwards brings it Applause up loss last Saturday at Kentucky for Louisville Scott in tight quarters Chucky headb bur penetrating drawn in the defense going to his man right in the middle right at the Circle beautiful offensive set offensive R offense ran by by Louis the cards heurn best on the team John almost five assists per game B bow and misfires tipped around to heurn Edwards wide open and he makes no mistake ripping the ropes for louo we figured Louisville will get back on track with the threepoint shooting their percentage has been a little lower as we said earlier Florida States got to get back theyve got to talk cuz Louisville will get it going and you do not want to see them let them see the ball get going in Cardinals in the midst of a 122 run and have made their last five shot attempts Watkins steps back rattles Applause out he burn lost it up ahead B bow and the tough catch got it knocked away for a moment re gathers and misses tough tough finish the transition hes got to take his time down a little bit he had time hes a lot taller than than Chucky hurn down there trying to block his shot Hadley has a bit of a mismatch B Bowen comes over for the rejection a foul was called so well take a time out to visiting Cardinals with a 125 lead on CW Courtside Saturday January by the way Hadley was born the following year so hanky with the Heisman Hadley and the cards with the lead 125 and Hadley will be going to the free throw line that last foul was on Chandler Jackson and you see how Hadley has stepped it up recently John he has man hes kind of their goto guy he molds to the game hes a slasher they like to put him in a lot of actions around the elbow going to the rim played 36 games last year for Colorado experience vet which M has a lot of those 71 from the free throw line spent two years in the Colorado program for the grant students 66215 from St Paul Minnesota and cron Durham Hall High School for first year head coach Pat Kelce after winning backtoback titles for the College of Charleston in the coastal Athletic Association the last two years Applause dang is into the ball game for Florida State wheres number seven this is Watkins trying to back his way in over heurn couldnt get it over the front rim and its knocked out of bounds and that will be Louisville basketball its a nice strong move by jir Watkins but even better defense by heurn whos given up a few inches he is a true twoway player Ive never seen a team prepare for a person offensively and defensively is what they did uh for State last night little foul there as heern was bringing it up youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands cards only had three conference wins a season ago one of those was at home against Florida Applause State managed to score 101 points in that game 10192 in early February last season he burn shot clock winding down once again another good defensive possession by Florida State trying to work it to the rim and a strong Drive rain Smith the College of Charleston transfer Florida States theyre theyre playing defense about 85 to 90 of the clock and they kind of relax at the end man its been hurting them that could be deflating if youre Florida State Smith averages double digits for the Cardinals and free throws coming up for the n and yan yan just a skilled physical patient big thats kind of the whole eternity you need as a big man he is one of a kind Joo player of the year last year hes going to have a good year in this ACC Anum eBay picked up the foul for Applause Louisville Leonard Hamilton 23rd season 430 wins most in school history here in Tallahassee Yan also a player who has improved his numbers flota State picking up the pressure a little bit they said theyre going to guard headb bur 94 feet they have held true to that try to tie them out a little bit Louisville is lacks depth with their injuries well see if that affects them as the game goes on purn launching fight for the loose ball is knocked out of bounds one dribble and a shot I dont one one nobody else touch the ball in that possession I dont know if thats the key to success for a Florida State te who thrives defensively so it IL seols basketball coach Kelce an assistant at Xavier an assistant at Wake Forest as well played at Xavier 4 49yearold from Cincinnati Ohio College of Charleston last year 9 years prior at winr in Rock Hill South Carolina he took that program to the NCAA tournament twice danging the Miss batted out of bounds D shot it well yesterday in practice hes is their best threepoint shooter almost 70 of his shots come from three times so they need him to get going they dont have many shoes on his team hes one of them coach Hamiltons team hasnt made a field goal in the last four minutes hes got some advice for Justin Thomas who will take a seat on that no bench is that a good way to put it John thats thats a good way to put it I I like how you put that some instruction he already 7even minutes gone by in our first half thats deflected out of bounds Yan got a piece of it to his own bench it will stay with Louisville Florida States going to switch one through five the key to beating switches is moving the ball or attacking and breaking down a defense when you get a mismatch if they do not do that it will be a long day for Applause them theres your attack right there didnt make the shot but thats how you have to play Florida State team we know Louisvilles going to keep shooting threes they will go in eventually if we get the right shot so now two of four on threepointers for Louisville one of four for Florida State Florida States got to get they got to get the ball in the hands of of Watkins hes coming out now theyve got to get the ball in the hand of you now he hes the guy that can score for them theyre all of six and their last six field goals they need to get a shot inside and a good shot at again Watkins going to the bench as the leading scorer this season for the NOS over 19 points per game and he had 23 points a game high in the win against Winthrop and that was on Tuesday Davis looking for another three and hes got it Davis spilling it today one of the Freshman that came in from L Hilton that he actually trusts man he he likes him hes hes a football player hes a tough kid fits right in with this Florida State team he made only 9 threes All Season

from Beyond The Arc Davis has a couple of made threes he had gone 0 for four from Beyond The Arc in the win against win on Tuesday Leonard Hamilton with two freshman on the court I know that concerned him but he needs his young guys to get valueable experience soft bounce and the buckets AJ Swinton played sparing the last couple games but hes a guy that Florida States going to need to step up off the bench to be successful this year the Miss from heurn Chandler Jackson pulls it in up to Davis its kind of older shoulder catch like football sure hes used to that crossover Jackson floats goes out of bounds that is off of Louisville Hadley in the vicinity looking forward to next year footballwise for this Florida State program for sure they had a rough year being from Florida in Florida they die hard they they they go hard for their their football team so Im sure theyll be fine focus on basketball now and Leonard Hamiltons team N9 and3 on the season they are 5 one on their homecourt so far this year as well the new transfer rule is like free agency you could just load back up sure Florida state will be fine a lot of different faces especially from last years matchup between the two teams only two guys out of 22 right that were here last year for this game turn around foul and baskets maluk for the NOS freshman then dont havt talked about him usually having Veterans for his freshman to look up to and mod of their games after unfortunately he has 10 new guys so everyones learning each other and hes had to make an adjustment on how he coaches so aier Malo The Freshman from Baldwin Pennsylvania with that threepoint play Above his season average of 28 points per game bonus offense seeing action in his 12th game this year she can see Leonard Hamilton is trying to get a lot of his guys in maybe wear this Lal team down who does they dont have much depth theyre only playing seven or eight guys especially with their Pace its going to be tough to sustain that throughout the ACC season Florida state is on a 100 run the shot clock is at five Hadley in space and a soft bounce here at Tucker Center good seal by Hadley good pass by hebburn nice basketball play from those two guys simple and effective Javon Hadley averages just below 10 points per game Davis attacks it spins out Waterman grabbed it Louisville has lost four of its last five games they won five of their first six this year and they have turned it over and back to Florida Applause state that is just just got to take your time Flor States Le sometimes bothers bothers teams that was an unforced turnover by the Wy vet HB bur I will say that coach Kelce challenging his program this year they play one of the toughest schedules in all of the nation four losses the teams currently in the top 20 got a Bolen well down the line tough competition just coming from Kentucky thats one of that is the loudest Arena Ive ever played in so they played well considering the circumstances at RUP heres what it looks like for Leonard Hamilton n and3 record that loss in conference that was on December 7th at NC State in fact theyll have a two we break after this game they dont play again till they play Syracuse on January 4th they work it into the corner and heurn and this time he connects double team down low swing swinging for the three another just good simple basketball play to get a good shot looks like coach heltons coming in with the hockey Subs five in five out yep that loss against NC State was in overtime Florida state had won 14 straight games in overtime prior to that loss to the wolf pack and Kevin Keats in traffic Jackson misses easy board Applause heurn too far dang has it on the Miss from rain Smith R Smith might have could to pass that back to the guy that gave it to him he was wide open for the three he gets him up though hes making the most threes in the ACC from per game 35 made threes this season for rain Smith making over a little over three a game on the inside big fell good looking move maluk spin with the jump hook I love it that was my favorite move as a player oh hes got to get out there Waterman misses that last jump hook looked a little bit like John Hen back in the day wearing Carolina blue twotime Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC John Henson All Conference selection coach Hamilton is getting a lot of contribution from The Freshman today I know he loves to see that that is why hes playing those guys even if theyre playing in sparing maluk with the spin right hook beautiful touch recognizing the size advantage using the soft touch took his time down there as well thats the biggest thing as a big man taking your time down low realizing the matchup and getting to what you want to do quality minutes for maluk inside of8 minutes to go in our first half Tom wormy John Henson are outstanding CW court side Saturday production crew R Smith three right on time hes going to take more of those hes their best shooter theyve got to get out there maybe maybe lean a little more when theyre down low cuz hes got hes a guy that you want to drive you dont want him to shoot three he got to run him off the line John he has made 330 career threepointers for rain Smith after that one off the backboard and in and falling down Yuan another just patient move by Yu hes hes a low down there Louisville has to keep fighting time taking his time

as well the tip up and in buan on the offensive glass we dont talk about his offensive rebounding hes one of the top offensive rebounders in the AC Waterman from the corner got to get back as I said ear that was an emphasis for Florida State last night so far theyre not doing the best job of that Im sure coach Hamilton will talk about that at halftime so Waterman at about his average for the season just over six points per game hes got a couple of Threes now after that last one stay tuned for the halftime show presented by Subaru will recap the SMU Victory against Boston College first half highlights and stats from the first 20 minutes of this game its all coming up Subaru its what makes Subaru Subaru thats the halftime show moments away Waterman had the last foul for Louisville Watkins is at least 5T behind the line and it doesnt matter he hasnt got going offensively but he has had some good shots at The Rim he took what the defense gave him knocked it down hes got to get going if Florida State wants to turned a tide in this game so far down five late in the first half about 27 feet away on that last three trying to go back door up along the Baseline and it rolled out

to get you on transition they want to shoot threes they shooting 40 on five of 13 50 from the field overall its a stat that if Florida State when Florida State holds their team under 70 points they win when their team score over 70 they lose simple formula so well see if they can tighten up a little bit on the defensive end Louisville with the basketball Florida state has made five of its last seven shots and the lead is five inside of four minutes to go in our first first Applause half Hadley on the dribble trying to back down Davis has the size Advantage Smith Ducks into the pain got a couple of defenders in the air and rattled it in Rain Smith thats a nice shot for R Smith not usually his game but they ran him off the line he took his time on that foul you know that that was pretty good defense I dont think they had to foul him there was a 610 guy and a 69 guy just go straight up completes the threepoint play B Bowen picked up the foul rign Smith has only missed two free throws All Season hes now 15 of 17 from the stripe on the year for the senior from Australia came with Coach Kelsey from the College of Charleston Watkins on the spin bounces out lot of effort nothing to show for it tough tough he SP a few bunnies today he cant get discouraged also shows the confidence that they have in EP bur guard him down low one onone even though late Watkins now two of six from the floor and Five Points comes up with the board for the seals down low B Bowen got fouled nice hell go to the free throw line nice pass by Watkins to B running the court Chu second foul on heurn to send b b to the free throw line Watkins tested the wat he came back and uh hes got a pro feel to his game and I I like watching him play very calm cool and collected but also puts pressure on the defense at all times first free throws of the game for B Bowen 75 on the season Applause so he bur with a breather for Louisville I dont think itll be long I want Im interested to see how Louisville looks without him on the court they tend to struggle sometimes not right there though nice block you and gather and gave it to Watkins caught him up top yous a really good athlete man hes underrated as athlete as well you dont really see it until youre out there on the court and Im watching him hes good he and Hadley really going at it trying to establish position aggressive play from both sides Yan and Hadley now Ron Gro with a brief conference with the players Trey stons Ron Grover AJ s in charge of the action this afternoon nice little physic I hope we dont go to the monitor on that it was

winner NXT bringing the heat every Tuesday on the CW this Tuesday no different catch all the action on WWE NXT Tuesdays 87 Central right here on the CW I dont know if you can see the home on TV folks but Watkins is kind of relieved to finally get to the rim hes been getting banged around down there all day so Watkins to the line for the first time John he has attempted 118 now 119 free throws on the season and hes made 88 75 thats part of his game he gets to the line a lot I want to say against Tain I want to say he shot 17 or 18 free throws he made 19 okay and took 23 exactly so against the Green Wave I stopped counting after a little bit I guess his Improvement through the years in the 191 is third best in the ACC taking a little bit of time to get going this afternoon cuts into the lead for Louisville 3532 140 and rolling to go in our first half Florida state has won seven of the last eight meetings louisv will won at home against the nlls last year they drop it off inside B bow

other guys to contribute and and it starts with eBay hopefully he can give some good minutes and and give those guys a rest Florida state is working on a modest two game winning streak this this is who get the ball to Yan fires that one across Miss from dang good pass by Yan an underrated passer hes got to realize Ls coming late on the Trap so hes got to make a couple moves draw the defense in and give D maybe a little more time to shoot that three had block Watkins was there John well the State starting to tighten up defensively just 45 seconds to go in our first halfs going to have to come on this Watkins right into a roadblock holding his ground there Anum eBay Applause nice spin eBay with the block giving him some good minutes off the bench hasnt played much but sure coach Pat Kelsey has to be happy with what hes Florida State calling a timeout in trailing 3632 46 shooting in the first half for Coach Kels team they are five of 14 on threepoint attempts they will Hoist the three they are not shy about that they average nine M threes per game and 32 attempts per game again thats first to the ACC they are right on Pace think was more important two Florida States three to seven from three I think thats why the game is close pretty even on re rebounds offensively and defensively Florida state has four blocks assist 8 to five thats been a difference John how about this

three and how about the job theyve done on heurn John just three points so far in the first half for a guy who averages over 15 per game in practice yesterday I heard his name more than I heard any other name this is the guy that they said theyre going to pick him up 94 ft and theyre going to force him to win the game and also Tire him out you see Florida state has had multiple Defenders on him every time and it looks like its getting to him Coach Kelsey has tried to give him a little bit of a break hes played what 17 18 minutes his first half um hes got to get ready for a big half theyre going to need all 20 I think from him yeah as one made shot was a threepointer looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation seey news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find news Nation as your screen go to new newsnation nowcom the news here in Tallahassee we got a tight game John 3632 taken a leave it timeout by coach Kelce draw up a nice out of balance play dont know if thats what he wanted fumbled ahead Watkins trying to beat everybody to the rim double fisted punch from Watkins off the turnover Scott launches so the Watkins Jam right at the end of the half sends us to the locker room with Louisville up by two outside Saturday so glad that youre with us many of you saw SMU go to Chestnut Hill and get a victory against Boston College SMU has now won six games in a row Im Florida State I I want to get Watkins and uans involved in an action get them going those are their two best offensive players it looks like that is what theyre going to do Yan had seven points in the first half Watkins and Davis both had eight to lead the way for Florida State Yan trying to back it on in shot clock inside of 10 sends it back out to Davis who lines it up Edwards easy rebound good pass by Yuan out looks like theyre coming on the catch kind of stunting at him Waterman blasting to the rim they got knocked to the floor and we go to the free throw line a nice drive by one of his teammates are telling him he should have dumped it I dont know if hes bouncy enough for that but make threepointers but that one he had intentions on the rim nice strong take by him start the first half get to the line see the ball go in thats going to B well for him as a shooter out there on the threepoint line the other thing is that b Bowen just picked up his third personal foul early on here in the second half to put water into the free throw line Leonards got about 12 over there so hopefully hell be able to fill an admiral if he does have to come out I dont think hes worried about it hes not taking out the game the career for Waterman much traveled Detroit Mercy BYU and now in a Louisville uniform he is the first player ever this is not surprising to wear number 93 hes a hes got a uh hes got like an NBA journeyman type career in college man ever in the history of Louisville basketball well have to check in whether hes the first 93 ever right but certainly the first 93 for Louisville that pass goes out of bounds into the front row you know Florida state did a good job of not having any unforced turnovers in the first half thats something theyve kind of struggled with a little bit as of late and again Florida State put some stifling defense on this Louisville team at the end of the first half they went three and a half minutes without scoring at the end of the first half led by as many has 11 early on in the first half for the cards in heurn credit to Davis man The Freshman putting pressure on hebburn Edwards came up short kicked out of bounds and two the NS Dane left Terence Edwards open in the corner lost sight of his man got lucky on that one that was a nice open shot for him which he doesnt see a lot just one of four on threes for Edwards had 23 points in the loss against Kentucky you in driving and scoring I like the aggression on that just taking it to the rim opposing his will on The Game Malik Yan at one and Edwards at the other and he puts some spin on it nice little English off the glass off the spin on transition this what he does hes leading the team and scoring looks like hes a little hurt a little bit over there but hopefully hes okay Yan crosses it over off the glass and somehow it bounced out nice cross just didnt finish Waterman let the defender Go On by open for three and its money we saw those free throws kind of going in that get you as a shooter gets you going and that threepointer looked good Louis will will jump on you if you let him and they just showed us what theyre capable of when they get going Florida State wants a timeout Waterman knocking down the three ball and it is now a sixpoint lead for Louisville all the makes are threepointers for Waterman who had a double double in the loss at Kentucky last Saturday season high in rebound bounds with 12 second double double he also had one against Oklahoma and hes pumping up the three ball today John you know his percentage was down this year but he shot almost 40 last year at BYU in the absence of injuries G is one of the guys that Louisville needs to step up for them to make it through this AC Gauntlet now that they have what 18t something like that I dont know youre right you are correct Waterman playing in his 121st Collegiate game Davis got to get the ball to you in down low there you go saved in the corner by Edwards after the Miss by y tough tough close finishes before the state arent going in they usually do that should turn around they just have to keep attacking Jackson guarding heurn switch to Yuan Jackson tied up peppin for a second Watkins on Edwards tried to thread a pass inside and it got deflected Yan saves it falling out of bounds Watkins thought about three Jackson will commit to the three and make it nice shot by Jackson we havent talked about him but you know hes down 15 lbs and and he set himself up for a bigger role this year at FSU as a starter that one spins off ahead Davis has it two on two sitch tries to does do it himself went out of bounds its going to be Louisville basketball its Davis trying to take it to the Applause rim so that three by Chandler Jackson is first points of the game now one of four from the floor thas well Justin Thomas returns to the lineup I havent seen much from Joseph Thomas as weve seen in the previous games another guy that he didnt play last year at UTSA he was injured so coach Hamilton is trying to balance that with also getting him minutes so hell be able to help his team down the stretch yeah hes also played at Wisconsin Milwaukee and Navaro Junior College in Texas as Davis when flying out of bounds heern against Thomas Falling Away does not get the bounce Yan carals the board Lis B Chucky head burn today from the Florida state guards hes having a tough time down there Yan against Waterman skilled physical and patient that is the three keys I had for him written down thats what you want as a big man thats what you want to have you were coaching a big man and he gets the double digits with 11 heurn has the answer at the other end FAL then going to the line Chucky hebr is starting to get more aggressive as you can see the game is starting to come down the stretch right here with the cross nice body getting into him Tough by Thomas hes in the right position body was a little turned refs going to call a fouling that every time this is part of your Sky Rizzy keys to the second half get Chucky heurn going and hes at the line for the old school threepoint play all ACC defensive and

teams Florida State staying in it purn cut off fly Smith at some point you got to understand regarding the best shooter thats just lack of awareness on knowing your personnel with rain Smith John he and Waterman have both made four threes a piece 12 of 24 Im no math whiz thats 50 from long distance we talked about a key of the half is limiting the threepointers fora state has done a really bad job of that and Louisville is start to fil it you do not want to be the team that playing them thats playing them when they figure out figure it out and start hitting threes they last five buckets

court side Saturday SMU with a win at Boston College to get the day rolling see if un can stay with his man its tough for a big man some times to stay with the shooter cuz you want to go inside so much great defense by Watkins Davis oh no he lost him yeah Davis came over with the help and Smith hits another hes got five M threes as I said before it is tough for a big man to keep track of a shooter CU you want to go inside so bad Im about to spoke that into his this time Im sorry for State fans now five made threes is pretty good his career high for made threes in the game is 10 for rain Smith thats kicked ahead and will be Louisville basketball Applause youve got to put a youve got to put a red dot on him you cannot let him keep shooting he is on fire today hes killing for state

11point lead for Louisville right here Florida State 10 with a 10 run in the first half but its rain Smith all day every day Shooters are going to shoot he was hes a top five shooter in ACC at the moment in percentage and makes he became the first player ever in the ca with two plus games of nine plus threepointers made I mean Florida State I dont know if he was on a scouting report as a top priority but now they have to get someone to stick on him they cannot leave him he is absolutely torching in for the second half theyre 8 for 11 youre not going to win any games letting te shoot eight for 11 and a half from the three Smiths 20 points coming off the bench leads all scores in our game he is one of three players for the cards to get the double digits and Smith has now played over 22 minutes coming off of Pat Kels bench might be the Anthony Edwards shoes you know hes got an uptick in threes this here Edwards maybe hes got a little bit of synergy coming through those whatever hes doing its working and its a 10point lead for he is just standing Beyond The Arc as Edwards drives the lane and gets fouled that was a communication error by Dan on the switch got to talk through it so Holt picked up the foul for Florida State on a driving Edwards second on Holt 13 points so far for Edwards youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands tremendous game between Louisville and Florida State they will play one more time this season in late February thatll be in Louisville Kentucky last season a win for the cards at home in the only meeting between the program good to see Hol back he looked like he limped off earlier with a with an injury good player cards led by two at halftime Watkins such a good player man hes keeping them minute in this second half hes got 14 points three or four from three if you get threes from Watkins man its going to be a long day foul is called foul number five vers six Davis with the foul thats now 16 fouls on Florida State good drive by Edwards taking advantage of the small that is how you beat the switch you got to take advantage draw the defender on the mismatch and either make a play or score the ball teams have combined to make 23 pointers 13 for Louisville seven made threes for Florida State including three from jir Watkins from Beyond The Arc he burn against two Defenders out to Edwards for three knocked around to Davis ninepoint lead Louisville Watkins and heurn taged him on the way by Js better than me I would have I might have heat checked that but that just shows that his experience pump faking to get a foul on headb bur thatll be four team fouls on Louisville here in the second half again Florida state has six 17 points for Music Watkins good fight by Scott trying to get the backside seal thinking about adding to that total again way behind the line and it does not matter I said that I would have done the heat check he he did do a little bit of a heat check Lille may have to switch up the coverage on that man he he looks like hes in it today F called against Florida State I dont know about that one Tom it looked good from our angle Unfortunately they dont have the challenge button like the NBA but that might be a challengeable play got to see the replay on that no foul thats not a foul wow tough call tough tough call officials right on top of it Edwards at the line for Louisville I started leaving the officials alone when I played when I had to ref my uh a teams game one day and saw how hard it was so its tough in real time man I I I respect and appreciate those guys one more for Edwards fouled on the threepoint shot B bow and in dang is out in the Florida state Music lineup Edwards quietly with 17 points after scoring 23 in R last game 11 of 15 for Louisville as a team from the free throw line Edwards now four of five on free throw attempts inside of six minutes in regulation Yan on the Block operating at scoring calculating the angle and going to the free throw line great move by you and nice patient move going to the middle then going away from the double team that was a high level finish right there N1 line the James Scott picked up the foul Watkins and Y are going to be the two guys that they have to touch the ball every possession to get this Florida State team back on track and have a chance to win this game so Florida state is now eight of 11 from the free throw line after the Miss by Applause Yan foul called on Davis and thats going to be the bonus situation for Louisville maybe not the uh best foul being aggressive and physical when uh the bonus is in toe freshman mistake but hell learn youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by healthcaregov new law lower prices enroll Applause Music today three for three from the strike for Smith look like he could have shot those with his eyes closed hes filling it today 16 of 19 correction 17 of 19 hes only missed two free throws All Season you in behind the backline of defense and couldnt make it good pass by Watkins just tough Miss hes got to finish those heers in a really good job of getting inside and attacking and kicking the ball out breaking down the defense nine points for heurn threepointer oh hes got it got a little something to say to you and his whale coming down the court four players now for the cards double digits and another made three that is 14 made threes that tier season High which they set last week in the loss at Kentucky B Bowen spinning and jamming Beautiful Finish beautiful F by you as well Florida States going have to start playing through hes feeling it a little bit got lville on the Hills NOS have made six of their last seven Applause shots B Bowen came over to help defensively against Hadley Watkins also defending as the ball went out of bounds and it will be Cardinal basketball with four fouls got to be more careful those blocks urn on the handoff with the shot clock going down to five urn lot of dribbling side steps the defender knocked around ball bow to the floor to grab it hell ball situation the arrow will favor Louisville so youll put 20 back on the shot clock with 409 to go in regulation Florida States going to have to start stringing together some stops as right now a couple more points for the Louisville Cardinals this game could get out of reach line coach Kels team took a twopoint lead into the locker room they have led the entire second half Florida State close to within three during this second half ninepoint lead in possession of the basketball for Hadley and the cards good defense by The Freshman down there Edwards found Smith somehow oh hits another three for the lefthander hey that looked good off his hand uh sometimes theres nothing you can do I thought that was good defense six of nine on threepointers for rain Smith and 15 made threes is a new season high for Louisville they attempted 39 threes in the loss at Kentucky theyve attempted 29 today and theyve got it back as Watkins stumbled down Waterman lost concentration Watkins wide open J Watkins from Music T there is a Timeout on the floor it is a 10point game with 3 minutes and change to go on CW Courtside Saturday WI e for e youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit PR impressivecom R Smith hand down man down Shooters are going to shoot they let him see the ball go in early and if you are a shooter which I wasnt much of but I did any few threes in my day it feels good after you hit a couple and thats what hes been doing Florida state has actually played well offensively for the last three possessions but you cannot win it beat a team because threes are worth more than two Time season high for rain Smith with his 25 points he is six of nine from threepoint distance novos 10 of 15 in the second half three we said that would be the key Florida State I dont know if it was on the board back in the locker room but uh its tough to beat a team when theyre shooting 66 from three and especially team that shoots them at a high volume so we mentioned that Leonard Hamilton has 27 career ACC wins Pat Kelce trying to get his first and and leading by 10 with 312 to go such a contrast man uh of coaching four players and double digits for Applause Louisville trying to get a little length on Chucky hurn B Bowen its kind of bit effective today he hasnt been as effective as usually is but hes got eight assists and three turnovers so hes done it in other ways urn and Edwards are two of those players in double digits Edwards will fire away late in the clock Davis had it for Louisville uh for the seminal rather and it was Hadley over the top and out of Music bounds Florida State right now I dont know if theyve drawn up probably C for Watkins and Yan they have to get a shot and they have to score quite frankly in this possession to keep it within Striking Distance jir Watkins leads the way with 22 points fourth straight game of 20 or more Davis scissor k foul and he was the closest Defender foul he team thats the fourth on heurn now if youre Louisville the clock is also your friend you have to make sure that you run that clock down and get a good shot on every possession and you should come out with the win first free throw of the game for Davis is this how about the lineup next Saturday CW Sports Saturday noon Eastern Eastern Kentucky Louisville Bucknell Syracuse and then Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Miami of Ohio and Colorado state that is my birthday so Ill be kicked up with some nachos watching the CW sounds good Ill be at the dome for Bucknell and Syracuse nice Ill be tuned in we appreciate that John all the viewership and folks back in Louisville hoping they can hang on on here although Florida State trying to say something about it late in the second half with 231 to go and a ninepoint lead for the Cardinals we had a drill when I played its called stop score stop Florida State needs to get a stop they need to score and get another stop to keep this game within Striking Applause Distance heurn has it Applause just four of 11 in total for heurn but three of those threepointers heurn down the lane elevates and scores pass Jackson slow to get up heurn beautiful way to handle the pressure by Chucky headb bur and finish over size and length and state that was big giving up two but should get three with Watkins at the free throw line that keeps them with the Striking Distance lets try this again Tom stop they need to score and get another stop so Waterman just picked up his fourth personal to put Watkins at the free throw line hes got 24 points can make it 25 its just his fourth free throw which is way below what he normally does getting to the free throw line connects threepoint Applause play pressure in the back court broken skillfully Edwards Waterman Up and Under and good just the benefit of having 11 guys have played an NCAA tournament last year just a very calm way to break the press and score a layup 15 points now for Waterman Yan from Davis timeout time out so the lead now is eight with 134 to go NOS have made four of their last four shots to make it the eightpoint game what a stank theyre going to have to get a stop right here and uh hopefully score some points and maybe some things have to go wrong on Louisville end for them to come back keep the pressure college football and basketball action well have the CW Courtside Saturday double header prior to and around the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl thatll be a fun day on CW Sports smith with it Jackson fouled him probably not the guy you want on line but at some point you got to try to lengthen the game being down 10 with a minute and a half left or down eight Im sorry and Smith is three of three from the free throw line and again hes only missed twice all year announcers Jinx not for that well see but the shootings been great in the second half Florida State 65 5 threes and the 10 threes from Louisville and Smith and hes responsible in the game for six made threepointers line 15 main threes total season high for Coach Kelseys Team B Bowen is out for Florida State R Smith seems to be adjusting to the ACC well from the Applause CAA so now the clock certainly an enemy of the nolles on their home floor Louisville can hang on thatll be two wins in a row in the series Davis for three they need it they dont get it Edwards grabs the ball gets away from Yuan runs into Jackson Hadley youan recovered defensively one minute remaining one minut such a smart play by Hadley whos had so much experience on the college level you got hurn whos played all these games Edwards Jor they wont make many mistakes towards the end of the game passing out for that foul for hurn to go to the line Wast a little bit time on the clock something small but things could go wrong if he would have got a shot block and for stay they to three its a big win for Louisville if they hang on in the final 589 they lost four of their last five games including the loss at rival Kentucky last Saturday they had the week off to think about the nolles and the game plan that they prepared and it appears to be Mak some threepointers has worked quite well know when uh we were talking about game uh pregame keys to the game I almost said make some threes you know Ls been struggling a little bit but today they did not and uh eventually will turn around for them they are a good shooting Team all the guys that play for them John youre so right coming into the game just 28 is a team from three but today 15 of 29 52 from Beyond The Arc for the Cardinals they going to be some teams this year with their threepoint shooting and against one of the best defensive teams when it comes to guarding the threepointer and thats sharp contrast to little but with Florida State into the game execution Jerry ding has not play didnt play last year Florida States got 10 new guys and things like that happen when you dont have that continuity and that experience that Louisville has for the end of the game so next Saturday Louisville will host Eastern Kentucky we told you that is on the CW part of our CW Courtside Saturday double header two weeks away home home game for Florida State and thatll be against Syracuse on this quarter so overall just a just a nice well played game by Louisville dont forget for the Louisville Cardinals yes theyll celebrate this win for the mens basketball program tomorrow the women the volleyball team 300 KFC Yum Center their home arena theyre playing for a national championship against Penn State I have a feeling coach gy might be in attendance for that one hey you got to support other sports Im sure the basketball team will be there that is a big deal Championship on your home floor so Edwards with a robust stat line 19 points seven boards eight assists for Terrence Edwards Jr Watkins airs out of Applause three and the effort by Florida state is not going to be enough today on their home floor at one point in the second half they made it a threepoint game louisv will turned him aside John with 15 made threes in the game six from rain Smith nille scores 90 points on one of the better defenses in the entire country um actually show you some of the Firepower that they can bring when they are operating with all cylinders and man what if they had all their players be a sight to Music see so theyll accept the shot clock violation with 27 to go and Coach Kelce anticipating his first win as a head coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference overall it will be win number 268 and he will remember win 268 as number one in ACC play against Florida State they are adjusting the clock nolles put it in play and that will do it toughest one is the first one 90 to 7 6 27 points
