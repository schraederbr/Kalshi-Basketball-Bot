keep it going on the road tigers in the road Orange Virginia in the home white our officials this afternoon Adam Flor Ted Valentine and Jerry keer we are underway marches here college basketball buckle up and it all begins on a loaded Saturday from Charlottesville Virginia Clemson starts with the Applause basketball big the Virginia Defense they got to contain the dribble now Victor lockin gets into the paint and thats where Virginias been most fragile take a look at the Cavaliers starting five its amazing theyve been playing their best basketball when they turn it in to a shootout not a defensive grindfest like were accustomed to and thats where Clemson has to lock in defensively as you can see they having great feed in Blake Buchan home having trouble there keeping the ball you got to contain dribble great pass these two unselfish teams the ball moves well both teams getting the ball in the paint got to guard your man oneonone the hunter Brothers in the back court Dylan Hunter finishes that one at The Rim thats been the issue with Virginia is guarding the basketball and you got to do your job guarding it but there thats its got to be more resistance it cant just drive by you and get a ball you basket layup there got to be more resistance at The Rim Saunders lines up the three but cant cant connect now this has been a special season for Clemson 15 ACC wins the most in program history seven of them coming on the road thats the first offensive possession where they come up empty and this is where Blake meanon and the big men can help offset Victor lockin and Ian shein just beat him down the floor try to out hustle him in TR offensive transition I chin 22nd birthday today his first basket off the window and in for two its a great match up he and Saunders who wins that match up today can really shift the way this game is being played the shefin season High 24 points in the win on Wednesday night against Notre Dame hes coming into Applause form heres McNeely he also had a season High midweek passes off Saunders into a double team draws the foul theres Clemson head coach Brad Brownell most wins in program history you know when Leonard Hamilton retires Brownell is going to be the longest tenure coach in the ACC you were giving him I did jokes prame I did he needs to grow a beard or something man let the gray show at this point hes the old man of the league now and if Pat Kelce didnt exist at Louisville hed beat your ACC coach of the Year absolutely Pat Kels done a heck of a job its hard to deny that but Brad brell is as good as he gets and its amazing all the the the talk about whether he was going to be here in years past and look where he is now this Clemson team is loaded its balance its experienced and everyones talking this team is ready for it you know they one game back Duke loses the game theyre right there at the top of this league for the ACC regular season title turnover lock and put it over the head of Jaden Zachary and theres Ron Sanchez interim head coach of Virginia now they weathered the storm in the middle of the season they won four of five before losses to Duke North Carolina and then bounce back on the road Wednesday against wake Force you look at those last eight games and this is a much improved Virginia team well you can see now differently The Way Clemson is guarded theyre switching those pin down screens theyre not going to allow Virginia to come off those pin downs and shoot wide open threes Mig Ney passes in on his first triple but dribble penetration will force rotation this team is playing with so much confidence right now shooting the basketball well they must make threes I think the magic number for them is get around 10 threes they average eight a game last 10 games offensively this team is just exploded moving back to their move blocker offense lock and working against Buchan and good defense from the sophomore mcney wants it he gets Music it dumps it down to Saunders working against Dylan Hunter hand off mcney got it again Isaac mcne buries back to back threes unselfish play by S has the post up Advantage has the size advantage on Dylan Hunter inside decides the come out screen get M nearly for another three lockin going right at Buchanan again and he draws the foul Victor locken at the foul line would we because theyre closer to the right side of the bubble they get the Duke Blue Devils at home they win that game I think they get themselves in you then you get the ACC tournament you know win a game or two there and I think theyre in it everyone else has more work to do wake has a chance to beat Duke beating them in Cameron will go a long ways to getting them in as well so those three teams are fighting I do think only one of them get in as you said could we see an NC State type run not them but somebody like them or Virginia Tech a few years ago just come out of nowhere and steal a bit you you have to say its always possible because NC State did it I mean theyre talented team theres some good teams in the bottom half of the conference is starting to play good basketball and were looking at one of them and thats Virginia yeah playing their best basketball at the right time of the year dumped down Saunders goes up and hits it this is not the Virginia team that we saw the first half of the season the last 10 games this team has been totally different they know who who they are basketballs moving they finding the right guys theyre playing unselfish this is the only thing thats bothering them right now was that the two spread out in their packline defense got to stay in guard the basketball here if you see the switch great read Saunders attacks inside gets Jaden Zachary on his back shoots the hook his ability to punish that switch its going to be Applause critical they are not allowing the Virginia guards to come off that pin down theyre going to switch that if he starts punishing that switch then maybe theyll be forced to lock and Chase lock it looking through the back door Roadie knocked it out of bounds itll be Clemson ball underneath their own hoop 9 seconds to shoot what happens is when we talked about so much about they call it size their mve blocker offense it allows them to control the pace of the game because you cant pressure them youre just constantly chasing and locking you know locking and trailing on screens or youre switching its got to disrupt the Rhythm Zachary pull up pop Miss fires Clemson has gone more than three minutes without a field goal and Virginias made their last three shots whos in front by five early mcney got it again nothing but the bottom of the net Isaac MCN hes already knocked down three threes he left grab ronell over there just shaking his head theres nothing you can do mcney doesnt trigger the heat check with that last made three he just moved up to fifth all time in Virginia history in made threes passing Shan single ter some really good players on that list but hes a better man than mej cuz theres no way I would have passed that one that was going out that without question Im shoot I made three already in the first five minutes of the game and you turn it down shots that just shows you how connected this group is right now but theres no way Im passing that absolutely no way and Virginia on a 13 to one run against the Clemson team that has won five in a row six straight ACC Road wins theyve been super consistent in January and February playing their first game in Mar march with big aspirations trying to win an ACC Championship trying to go as far they can and March Madness an elite eight appearance a year ago theyre getting tested on the Applause road mcney battling with Zachary for the loose ball and Zachary called for a reach in Jes Zachary is taking a challenge they ideally Clemson wants him guarding Isaac mcney to chase him off that screen hes as good a twoway guard as youll find really good on ball Defender want to avoid picking up early fouls because if he gets in foul trouble then you got to to take him off put him on a less aggressive offensive player Day Day Ames his foot on the line turnover now McNeils picked up right where he left off Wednesday night in the win against Wake Forest to season High 27 and today hes hit all three threes that hes attempted how does Clemson find an offensive Rhythm a scoring drown of two and a half minutes here well theyre trying to force the ball inside to take advantage of their physical presence inside just run your offense now but they got to get stops hide breeder that rings out no good up ahead too much on it looking for the Freshman Jacob Applause Kofi thats something that weve seen we talked about that whether its Kofi whether its beanan theyre trying to rim run fast to force a switch to get a match up this this Virginia team is this is where theyre a little bit different than the past weve made comparisons offensively to going back to Tony Bennett and move a blocker offense they will push and score in the first eight seconds of transition cson five minutes without a basket theyve missed their F last four shots whos going to ignite this offense Chase Hunter hes been doing that all season long he has without question hes a first team all ACC guard I mean thats just you need a bucket you go to Applause him but this is the end of the floor theyve got to calm down and get stop stops ases that rolls off the rim no Applause Music good heres Victor Lockett working against the freshman locking in attack mode through contact off the window and in for two great job by Victor Lock and he can score inside but when he also can space you at the threepoint line and put the ball in the deck hes an added weapon to this Clemson team I mean threepoint shooter drives it passes it really skilled big man Zachary all over roie he Retreats shot clock down to 10 Sharma gets free cant hit it battle for the board andll stay Virginias way the depth at the guard spot L by Chase Hunter is just unique and its I think this team is poised for a deep tournament run and I dont think anybodys really talking about him enough a lob out of the timeout well defended Falls to McNeely he leaves it short Applause theres no Panic with this team to theyre going to continue to execute their offense going to force McNeilly to have to continue to shoot the basketball at a high level Hunter so crafty Chase Hunter high off the window and in and hes a dude hes a Applause closer and thats 1700 points for Chase Hunter what a career he has had at clebson eighth player to do it in Tigers history he also a dad he told me that it changed his life I got to ask him is Dylan being a good uncle helping babysit at times as Andrew roie Cashes in with the floater now the leadership the chase Hunter brings the experience from that postseason run a year ago when you ask Brad Brown now what makes this team special he says were old were experienced and it has shown up as the season has gone later and lateer right now on a five game winning streak theyve been terrific on the road you said it theyre just so difficult to beat you have to earn it a team that has only lost five times this season three of them have been in overtime Buchanon rocks the rim and Virginia back up by four and when we talk about being bound its just multiple ways in how they do it even in how they attack you this is a sevenfooter at the middle of the floor initiating their offense and he isnt just a post player hes a skilled guy the guards you can see Lane opens up for these guys that dribbling attack a good defense by DayDay aims to force the Dylan Hunter Miss Clemson had made four in a row before that Miss Applause heres mcney he has the hot hand fires missed it that time and a foul on the rebound Buchanan with Victor lockin will stay Cavaliers ball gives us time to remind you NBA Saturday Prime Time on ABC later tonight Warriors and Sixers NBA Countdown begins at 8 Eastern with tip off at 830 a Midway through this first half Virginia has controlled the tempo against number 13 Clemson a fourpoint lead for the Cavaliers Ali we have lift off Elijah Saunders a great job with the Baseline out of bounds there back screen no communication and Saunders with the LOB dunp heres Jaden Zachary in attack mode working against Road he muscles it to the rim for two were spacing on a perimeter with so many guys their big shoot threes when their guards get inside they can play inverted where allowing their guards to attack they can post their guards shefflin and Victor locking ability to stretch the defense pulls your bigs away from the rim 14 of cson 17 have come in the paint batted around locking controls it so the tigers with a clear game plan and thats to go inside theyve been most effective they go right back inside shefin uncontested layup well that the high low action is a big part of this Clemson offense got to defend that that duck in you know its coming do a great job of feeding the post with bounce passes Applause trying to get it to Murray tapped away three on two for the Tigers and Saunders commits the foul youre starting to see the Clemson defense speed up Virginia a little Applause bit just ducks in there sers goes and Music gambles and the chef is a low inside cant get around him got to do your work early guarding him you know I had sheflin he is a unicorn in todays college basketball four years what school the development you go from 11 minutes per game as a freshman to 33 minutes per game as a senior and hes a dominant player and he cant jump over a phone book its just its amazing to watch him play hes just a physical guy hes a high IQ guy hes a great player I mean everyone wants to he a sheing on their team and doesnt rely on his athleticism and and its just fun to watch some just completely control games lockin draws the foul hell be at the line when we come back weve got a good battle in the ACC back and forth we go here in Charlotte theyre going to need to run the table and win the ACC Championship if they want to play in a postseason now Randolph childr who was 30 years ago you provided one of the most iconic moments in that ACC tournament could have just said I just app I gave memories you didnt have to say the years 30 years like really thats a big milestone it has been 30 it has been how about that how many times are we going to see that between now and the end of the ACC tournament well weve got a good one here at the ACC to help kickoff March tied at 21 between Clemson and Virginia the Tigers shooting 60 from the floor theyve made six of their last seven and Virginia has cooled off theyve just made three of their last 10 now dting Ames is in a game now and hes someone that create his shot off the bounce so if things break down he can create for himself and others shot clock down to three ases heaves a triple and hits it on Q we talked about it thats why hes in the game he didnt start tonight I mean today because of T Murray being a senior on senior day but he stabilized that point guard position when he became available Clon goes right back inside the immediate answer the Tigers have 20 points in the paint theyre okay with playing that style that that type of game grind you out game as well theyre going to continue to play inside out Clemson has only attempted one three they havent hit any and Virginia has knocked down four of them pull up pop ases off the mark offensive rebound keeps it Virginias way Virginia has four offensive rebounds here in the first half and theyre trolling MC glass this is a team that struggled on the year and in conference play rebounding the basketball but not so far today mcney Hunter all over him crosscourt pass finds Murray has to heave it at the end of the shot clock and another offensive rebound thats five in this first half for the Cavaliers ases coues in on the second chance opportunity great job kick getting after the offensive glass keeping the ball alive best time to get a three as you know is off offensive rebounds time out Clemson jpj rocket break you down off the bounce shooting 38 Virginias played better as of late big reason why Day Day a last six games averaging 16 points per game hes a Difference Maker for hes part of this streak of why theyre beginning to play such good basketball definitely been an X Factor guarding Chase Hunter here Lock It lines up the three cant connect Murray chases down the rebound and this reminds you of how Virginias playing because theyre controlling the tempo they pick and choose when they want to run theyll have their moments in their spots and they make you guard on the other end Dell Jones The Freshman into the game for Clemson Tigers go right back inside Victor locking up and in for two theyre having a tough time protecting the basket its not just here today its been probably the only issue with the Virginia lineup so much the inexperience shows in the front Court Applause heres Isaac mcney tried to squeeze it into Murray lockin rips it Applause away Zachary with a full head of steam this is why I say it theyll play inverted theyll play theyll post their guards comes up empty though a chance to tie it at 27 goes Applause begging offensive foul called against Anthony Robinson off the ball our final ESPN big Monday double header of the season and its a big one especially for the Demon Deacons on the bubble in Cameron Indoor to take on Cooper flag and Duke and then Kansas against Houston you get to see two the top four teams in college basketball Monday both teams looking for Revenge deaks losing it at home to the Blue Devils early in the year and Music Kansas and Houston rematch going high level basketball to be played on big Monday is always Jones that rolls off the rim no good tapped around itll stay Clemsons Applause way now there was a clear game plan for Clemson going into this one and that was attack inside 20 of the Tigers 25 points scored in the paint theyve only attempted two threes missed them both its not much of a sh Rim protection for J has to do a good job like that keeping the basketball in front kick out Wiggins he missfires Music Clemson just cant get anything going if theyre getting one shot Virginias controlling the game not just by making shots but theyre winning on a glass which is something they hadnt done a good job of all year long McNeely tough take draws the foul and hell be at the line when we come back Virginia battling here at Applause Music home thanks guys weve got a good one here in Charlottesville Virginia leading by two Isaac mcne stepping to the free throw line you know weve said it a few times but Virginia has played a lot better in these last eight games but they have struggled against ranked teams we saw they werent able to compete with Duke so this has been the most impressive performance of the season going against number 13 Clemson whos been outstanding on the year they have theyre giving up twos but theyre making threes Clemson hasnt made a threepoint shot theyre only gotten two attempts and Virginia on the other hand is five of 10 from behind the threepoint line and they have fouls to give with Kofi inside and with Robinson andanan theyre allowing these guys to play oneonone inside and staying home to the shooters forcing the Clemson to beat them chap Lin finds hiy breeder goes right into mcne good defense there by Isaac mcney theyre trying to stay between a ball and a basket force you to take a contestant shot theyll live with that they dont want to give you everything they dont want to give you threes they dont want to give you layups and keep you off the free point threepoint free throw line they dont want to foul Clemson just one make on their last seven theyve missed five in a row shock like down to five roie teas it up a rim rocker Anthony Robinson on a rack attack look out everyone this is a team you do not want to play they dont care who theyre playing right now theyre comfortable theyre confident Chaplin musling his way in draws the foul and youre right we were in Wiston Salem Wednesday night a statement win against Wake Forest so they have picked up where they left off here against rank Clemson RO with the drive and the lay Robinson punches it home on Ian shefin lucky thats not an and one but theyre just playing at a level theyre playing confident again theyre giving up twos and it seems to be a similar formula because the same thing with wake Force theyre giving up the twos that are high percentage in the paint the deakes were only made two threes in the last game and right now theyre keeping Clemson to that same Pace behind the threepoint line Chaplin knocks them both down that ends a 2 and 12 minute scoring draft for the Tigers who are still in Striking Distance here their defense has kept them in Applause it I mean Clemson isnt going anywhere theyre very good defensive team as well points allow this is the second and third ranked defensive teams in the ACC theyre not going to let you run away and they know theyre fighting through the screens thats a second offensive foul called on the screen they doing a great job of trying to stay close chasing Defenders off the screen setting physical screens in a move blocker offense is a big part of what Cavaliers want to do so Robinson comes out for Applause Buchanan got to be still allowing the defender a chance to get Applause through Dylan Hunter passes up the three goes inside now Chase Hunter with it two minutes left in the half step back nothing but air Chaplan bats it back but Virginia has it again another CH another defensive rebound theyre missing shots the Virginias defense doing a great job of limiting Clemson to one shot and Kofi foul that rolled around the rim but did not drop and the Freshman has two coming at the line the second against Ian Chaplin in this first half Music Jia G is doing a great job when you trail that Baseline Runner and pin down theyre going to curl right into that ACC if youre big steps up theyll drop it off if he doesnt theyre going to take that midrange jump shot and got to mix up your coverage and how you guard it do you cut the screen force him to bump to the Cel do you lock a trail you cant do the same thing every Music time Kofi thises a from both at the line and Clemson has missed their last six shots how do they find something offensively before halftime youre getting shots you know this game is we were talking a lot about how well Virginias playing Clemson is getting high quality shots you just cant get impatient and force and take bad shots this is a fourpoint game shot clock down to eight Zachary in attack mode missed it but it went off the Freshman Kofi so itll stay Clemson basketball Applause Applause K surprisingly missed those two free throws hes an 80 free throw shooter shot clock 43 on it the Tigers have to work quickly here into lockin fires the three missed it that is eight straight misses for Clemson theyve gone four minutes without a made field goal Clemson talk about being disruptive from the timing of Virginia offense I think Virginias doing a great job of doing that to to Clemson that time in the Baseline out of bound play getting physical with the guard not allowing him to set the screen Ro cant connect so despite Clemson missing eight in a row Virginia unable to separate and thats an offensive foul Blake Buchanan took the charge Victor lockin surprised to see this with the level of experience from Clemsons team theyre theyre theyre trying to force the tempo everybodys trying to make a play to create an opportunity to score you got to make a play for your teammates let the ball find the open man right now not enough movement in the Clemson Applause offense Buchanon finds the back door roie Ted Valentine saying wave off the basket foul on the floor its one of those moments you dont want the officials to Blow the Whistle Back Door cut Dylan Hunters beat grab the Jersey a ro its the right call its definitely not an a one no the foul came first so it set of the layup counting Andrew Ro will have a one and one Applause here Ro makes the front end great talking to Sanchez ear in locker room hes just has his pulse on this team understands everything hes gone through and and they weathered that storm and theyre playing their best basketball they are as the calendar turns to March a fivepoint lead against 13th rign Clemson the Tigers have missed eight in a row trying to find a spark offensively right before the Applause break Chase Hunter when you need a bucket he usually delivers roie Swip it away it stays Clemson ball 48 to work with on the shot clock great rotation at Health there Chase hun quite a bit of contact expecting a foul there Teddy Valentine says Applause no high breeder comes in yeah the substitution here allows them to call their play and execute change Music Applause play Brad Brownell sent in hide breeder to change the play they get it into hi High breeder working against mcney through contact no call Virginia with time here 3 seconds left in the half roie didnt get it off in time but the Cavaliers head into the locker room with a fivepoint lead against 13 Brank clebson because they are playing the last 10 games or so theyve been playing really good offense its flipped early in the year their defense their offenses was been theyve been struggling now they flipped that theyre playing better on the offensive end defensively theyve been playing really well they struggled and now they figured it out again and they start with the basketball Saunders triggers a three he cant connect and for Clemson 27 is the fourth lowest point total of the first half this season so didnt make a three for the first time this year as poorly as Brad brownells team played offensively in that first half youre only down five youre right in this thing theres no Panic theres no reason to be concerned youre only down five the balls got to move you cant four shots execute your offense with ball ball movement and body movement and anytime you can get this guy the ball its a good thing and thats Chase Hunter shot clock down to four trying to find sheflin instead Hunter a deep contested three cant knock it down chefin chases it down keeps it alive for Clemson great Applause hustle Zachary he cant connect Clemsons missed 12 in a row going back to the end of the first half they got to get something to drop but nothings early and theyre getting late to the shot clock Chase Hunter shot was late in the shot clock locking Buchanan front rims it they got to push Tempo and run theyre working for everything nothing is easy whos going to lift the lid for Clemson lockin goes inside that rolls off the rim they remarkably the Tigers have been so consistent this season and yet theyve hit a big scoring drought here theyve got 13 straight misses going back to the into the first half finishing possessions has been great to see for Virginia Isaac MC his four3 of the afternoon and its a big one to ignite this second half cant help off of him one mistake you helped off MCN the second mistake was that strong side corner you never help off strong side corner anyway tried to go right back inside the lockin couldnt connect just a bad angle by Chase there trying to enter the post help on a drive there and didnt Hunter just falls asleep when you cannot do that against mcney knocking down his four3 he didnt have any trouble waking up out of bed shooting today did he now hes in a good Rhythm right now for Virginia this is as well as the Cavaliers have played all season and theyre doing it on a big stage against 13th rank Clemson Ro inside muscles that one in and its the large G just lead of the game for Virginia 10 Zachary off the window and in for two Clemson needed that bucket their first make since the 510 Mark at the end of the first half wow just outstanding defense all game long at that time they had a breakdown good defense stolen away Hunter pull up pop no good battle for the board won by hi breeder right back inside sheflin spins his way in tough take Ian sheflin starting to cook on the inside he leads Clemson with 10 points and a chance to make it a threepoint play again the offensive rebound hybrid to dribbles out shein takes advantage knows he has roie on him inside initi contacts takes contact finishes off the glass Cashes in on the and one and Clemson back within five and theyre amping up their defensive pressure here cut the lead in half in just two possessions well you said it in the first half when Clemsons playing their best theyre stringing together stops on the defensive end and that leads to positivity on offense thats this is the strength of this team its on the defensive end of the floor were talking about how well Virginias playing they only have 37 points Clemsons defense has been solid roie contested take good Bucket from Andrew roie the junor going inside again shefflin hammers it home we talked about that match up between he and Saunders I think we have our answer he and shein is come out in this second half and hes lifting the Tigers Saunders trying to answer turnaround hands off for RO Roy Fades away no Applause good Clon continue to run your offense with Pace in a good Rhythm right now Dell Jones The Freshman scooped to the hoop and Clemsons made it a onep possession game Here Come the Applause Tigers now theyre get solid defense they starting to get stopped and theyre pushing temple on the other end last three

the Applause rebound clenon Tigers fall down by 10 immediately ramps up their defensive in intensity get themselves right back in this game now with a chance to take the Applause lead chlin hes had the hot hand cleans up his own spill and fires Clemson in front an eight nothing Tigers run to take the lead Clemsons now extending their defense and shin with the middle ball screen gets it on a short row just plays bully ball inside putting the Tigers on on his back time out Virginia Clemson has their first lead since it was 6 to four and theyre riding and Clemson making the elite eight a year ago this team veteran Laden poised for another deep postseason run and they have proven it in this second half a 132 run to grab the lead how does Virginia respond coming out of the timeout McNeely draws the Applause foul and we stepis can half for the Tigers cuz it was Virginia that had controlled the tempo and was in the driver seat for that entire first half Clemsons defense have picked up and has allowed them to get out in transition now theyre scoring without having to play against a set Cavalier Applause defense McNeely 10 seconds to shoot gets it back goes to work against shefflin Robinson trying to rip it away lock in control rolls Applause it Virginia has fallen into a 3minute scoring drought here its allowed Clemson to capitalize 132 Run for the Tigers over the last four minutes they got the Freshman front line for the Cavaliers inside driving the ball in the paint theyre concerned about locking and shefin theyre not helping on the drive and Veteran like Jaden Zachary takes the advantage of it the Tigers continue to dominate in the paint 34 of their 42 points scored in the paint today mcney leaves it off Robinson wasnt ready for it itll save Virginias basketball 7 Seconds to shoot underneath their own hoop Applause here Brad Brownell yelling at his guys to get in a stance he knows that this game is to be one its got to be one on the defensive end of the floor shot clock down to three mcne nothing he could do with it and youre right Clemsons defense is dialed in in this second half I have a general idea what was set in the locker room and we cant repeat it but what was said has motivated these Clemson tight they have elevated their defense and starting to look like the 13th ranked team in the country Victor lockin in attack mode Kofi good block kofis got to do a better job of pushing that b SC out not allowing him to catch it so deep does a great job of recovering here and blocking that shot hes got to force that flash and force locking catch a little further away Kofi takes a seat after the block you know Clemson on a sustained run right now 152 run over the last 5 Music minutes Del Jones has provided a spark Off the Bench heres the Freshman again kick to the corner Zachary buries it Jaden Zachary for three great play by the freshman ripping Drive rejector screen drives Baseline sprays it to the corner for a teammate

road three my best nickname of them all has to be the Locking Nest monster right you kidding me doesnt get any better to that Hunter cant bury the corner three lets see if Virginia can punch back out of the timeout Saunders lines up a three got it backto back threes and Virginias back within two John Paul Jones Arena has come alive Dell Jones trying to quiet the crowd comes up empty they have the advantage inside with Saunders if they decide to post him theyre going to come his side out of the floor and post up shot shot clock down to six floated to Saunders couldnt control it and thats a turnover yeah they had him early early in the shot clock and missed him the RO just walks into one and Saunders comes right back with a three of his own we talked about the magic number for UVA they have to make at least 10 threes theyre eight of 15 here just a few off the pace you can see theyre only he basket away from tying this game up and its a big part of their offense in the season is a big part of their offense here today Chase Hunter the floater Falls Clemson back up by Applause four Hunters been a little quiet for his standards averages near 17 points per game over only six this afternoon well this is a balanced attack team theyre not going to just run their offense through him theyll run plays for him but he does a great job of not forcing things which is why his percentage is so high Robinson took flight and was Applause fouled lock in second Applause shot the Virginia their bench saying that should have been a shooting foul instead it was originally called on the floor Ted Valentine is Jerry heer talking it Applause over and they are changing it to a shooting foul so Ron Sanchez is talking with the officials worked out yeah you had to call that a shooting fouls a lot hes trying to catch and finish fin Applause that Robinson the red sh freshman from Peach Tree City Georgia hes been a big boost to this front Court very young front Court you got a sophomore and two freshman for Virginia yeah you got 15 fouls to deal with the bigs the opposing team and Robinson struggles from the free throw line of all their bigs one possession game Clemson is controlled this second half though Zachary tough take and it rolls in Jaden Zachary cannot allow him to get to that right hand driving to the basket 40 points in the paint out of cleons 51 that has been the game plan since tip off roie up and in the floater Falls for in Drew roie got to mix up your coverage you cant continue to chase behind that screen if you do can never get back in front of the ball theyre

the weak side no one theres to help one rebound shy of a double double Murray Fades away that rattles in and out no good thats a good defensive possession there again by the Tigers forcing to contest it too Dell Jones hes been aggressive in the second half kicks it out shefin tried to show off the range there another offensive rebound Clemsons been much better on on the glass in this second half out rebounding Virginia 14 to4 johy Wiggins is a guy that if he can get going if he can find a way to get going he would just add something to this Clemson Tiger team Applause hes not as aggressive as you like for him to like see him back door open for Isaac mcney hes got 16 to lead the who two possession game Jones Rea gathers goes up and Clemson back up by eight Jones is really aggressive just putting his head down just getting to the rim trying to make a play that time got to the rim just wont get it easier too than that Danny AES is the guy I think has got to get going here hes the one guy that can create his shot off the bounce against these Clemson back court shot clock down to four Kofi has to hurry contested jumper no good sheflin has the rebound Now 23 career games with a double double and hes moved to Seventh Place all time it kson rebounding history Applause Zachary working on Tane Murray spins his way free and hell get two at the line tomorrow morning college game day crew its Southbend Indiana 1100 am eastern EV then at ESPN double header number three Notre Dame taking on Louisville at noon at South Carolina hosting Kentucky a terrific afternoon of womens hoops starting with college game day at 1100 am now Ian shefin has stolen the show here on the road in Virginia double double 19 points 11 rebounds on his birthday turning 22 today after he scored a season High 24 points on Wednesday hes playing his best basketball of the Season at the right time well this Clemson Tiger team in Jenner was playing well and hes starting to pick it up and an embarrassment of riches from Brad braon ELD and we talked about it in the open their balance of their team its they dont have to rely on one guy that carryed his team everyone has a job to do just do your job let the basketball find you on the offensive end willll exploit the coverage and no one does that better than this Clemson Tiger Applause team ninepoint lead for Clemson thats their largest lead of the afternoon 440 to play the Tigers just hit another gear in this second half can Virginia find a punch back down the stretch kofy flies to the rim and misses the layup Kofi was a little late on his roll there miscalculated how far he was he had an easy dunk had he taken just one dribble to cut harder down nine Clemsons trying to take control of this game you need a basket like that right back to sh hes fouled Virginia has no answer for sheflin in this second half they dont hes just overpowered them inside Kofi Robinson Buchanan neither of the three has been able to handle this Chef in the paint in todays modern game at college basketball theres just not many Ian cheffins who is going to go four years one school no transferring just sticking to the program developing getting better every year Brad Brownell has done such a good job with sheflin thats a credit to Brad Brownell and his staff to be able to keep him its not like he snuck up with anybody we knew what he was this year playing his way into some All Conference considerations as well but how many coaches we go around the ACC talk about how important player retention is and Clemson got that right ases pull up pop cant stick it and a foul on the rebound I sheflin fired up his Tigers team up 11 350 left times three of those losses have come in overtime just feels like even if theyre not playing their best like we saw in the first half they can find that second gear and punch back difficult to put away theyre never going to be out of a game because they their offense does not affect their defense theyre going to continue to defend they can switch that time they tried to run a clear out play to clear out the side so theres no help to help on Lin but Lins ability when hes on the floor to protect at The Rim that guards pressure you on the perimeter you can see now theyre extending their defense they just have balance in at every level they dont rely on one person to carry him they can play any style if its Up Tempo if its a controlled Pace like it is now mcne denied great defense by Zachary they Clemson 3 minutes away from their 16th ACC win of the Season that would extend their most conference wins at a single season in program history be their eighth Road win theyll be eight one they pull this out incredible when you think about it thats again its been a forone conclusion weve talked about Duke weve got a wedgie temporarily jump ball possession arrow with Clemson youre right everyones talking about duke duke duke duke if the Blue Devils lose one of their last three games and Clemson wins out Brad brell will have a tie of the ACC regular season and dont get us started on where that goes if Duke loses one Louisville TI then it depends on who Duke loses to gets the number one seed in the ACC tournament so I dont think anyone knows that the conference office does not want that to happen theyll be up late crunching numbers but Brad Brown now what a season I agree I think when you look at all the statistics and theres a lot of them for Clemson its their road record particularly in conference this would be their seventh straight ACC Road which would be the most ever in program history and this is all the makings of a team that can make a Deep Run not only during champ week at the ACC tournament but get to a final four and theyre a team that no ones talking about you know no ones talking about oh we definitely are and rightfully so but I mean nationally talking about this team making a deep run with the experience coming off a year ago they did lose a lot with PJ Hall but theyre versatile now and are they better than they were a year ago is this team better than that Elite 18 I wont say that theyre better I think theyre better defensively for sure which is why they always have a chance playing against anybody I think they have everything rolling the only thing they have to unlock is to get Chanty Wiggins going turn his motor on leave it on I think he elevates them even more they have dominated the paint 46 points in the paint which is a season high and for as well as Virginia played the second or the first half it has been all Clemson in this second half they go into the paint again to make it 48 points of the paint and what a response from Clemson after that triple overtime lost to Georgia teack difficult stretch of games and theyre about to make it six straight wins in this second half effort as ases knocks one down and Virginia takes a timeout they were down five at halftime and outscoring the who 37 to 20 in this second half its just been defense turning into offense getting them easy baskets and they run great stuff on the offensive problem is you dont want to play them if theyre a lower seed if youre a higher seed with the expectations of beating this team this team is just well balanced turnover but mcney cant cash in on the three roie commits a frustration foul mcney got a great look he did would have cut it to single digits they really died in on mcney got hot early knock down those three quick threes since then he hasnt been able to get many open Applause Music looks Wiggins is on the floor now Applause love to see him get himself going stay aggressive and continue to be a factor hes knocks it down could be too little too late for Virginia here still down 11 clebson forced to take a time out good pressure by Virginia see Clemson now spreading the Applause floor into lockin whos fouled thats just another little thing there J it how many teams can bring their Center Up full court to help with the Press break and put them at the free throw line to make free throws to close out of game now this will feel good for Clemson as they close in on this win against Virginia the Cavaliers had won 15 of the last 16 meetings you the first half it looked like Virginia was in control a fivepoint halftime lead but in this second half cson hit a new gear Ames lays it up and in cuts it to nine only a minute to go though lockin Hees it deep finds Dylan Hunter and hes fouled and now Clemson shooting two in the double bonus the guards of Clemson guys you dont want to foul if youre going to foul its got to be Dylan Hunter Chase Hunter and and Zack attack shooting well over 80 Dylan Hunter is shooting 58 right now and most of his is because he doesnt shoot a lot of Applause attempts hes not a guy I think youre going to seek out to shoot seek out the foul to put him at the line hes just starting to play a lot more late in the year into the starting lineup now he didnt start early play an exceptional defense for Brad brownells Tigers aim step back three goes begging Dylan Hunter carals the rebound and is fouled again a Clipson 48 seconds away from their seventh straight ACC Road win the most in program history 16 overall ACC wins also a single season program record and depending what happens elsewhere maybe Clemson cracks in to the top 10 on Monday yeah we got to get through the weekend and this is a this is a good win against a really good Virginia team thats playing better than their record I throw that record Music Applause out Clemson Tigers have come in and earned this this Victory if they can hold on for 48 seconds which it looks like they will this one was hanging in the balance for about 30 minutes with the last 10 minutes Clemson able to separate and thats what makes a good team great is when youre not playing your best in the first 20 minutes you just find a way to get into a rhythm and close this game out particularly on the road and wining on the road is always hard and youre playing against a team thats also playing their best basketball of the Season forces you to grind out a win and theyve done a great job of doing so here today MC leaves it for Saunders misses the layup go the kson going to dribble this out 13point lead a remarkable second half outscoring the whoos 42 24 its a great win here by the Clemson Tigers come in not your best stuff didnt have your fast ball but a lot of that was Applause UVA M mcney commits the foul there I dont know why Clon was wasnt even looking at the basket I dont know what that was about I dont know if theyre trying to get someone in the game to play yeah trying to get one of their veter their Senior Walk On In the game get them in a scoring book this is Bryce Walker its senior day and Walker checks in for T Murray who was also celebrated those were the two seniors on the roster for Virginia great moment for Walker to be able to play in the game and g t Mary who stuck out stuck out through everything here its transition been a leader for this group and you got to let Walker take one here right yeah yeah go score buddy into the box score on senior day but make no mistake about it Clemson a second half surge makes it seven straight ACC Road wins for the Tigers Clemson Tiger 12 of their last 13 games this team is deep this team is balanced theyre playing their best basketball and theyre making
