continue the momentum well I think the difference is the first time these two teams matched up as you see Quentin post and Jesse Edwards embraced that half court were gonna get into their story a little later Quentin post came back for really it was his first time back for Boston College Boston College a different team with their seven footer in the lineup no question about that as the Eagles in their throwback gold jerseys the orange as youd expect in the orange and we are underway our officials are Bill Covington Ray Steins and Jerry heater shoot amidst one of the more impressive freshmen in the country has the basketball the three rims out by Chris Bell as Ashton Lankford tracks it down you look at the Syracuse five and Mintz has had a terrific year for them hes hard to find a freshman uh thats uh playing better he has really been outstanding for Syracuse scoring the ball and making some really good decisions from that point guard position do you see Quinton Post in the corner are too hard and the rebound by Prince a league Bay and thats when hed like to have back hes scored on each offensive putback against Clemson a huge part of their success on Tuesday heres Jesse Edwards our spotlighted matchup with post Edwards wheeling and dealing in the post and the lefthanded shot nice touch and I think the key in that defensive matchup right there Boston College decided to stay home no help came and that time Edwards wins out again Im going to say one of the most improved players offensively in college really you know about his defense but offensively hes taken a huge step a three by Makai Ashton Lankford whos played very well the last week hes averaging 13 points not known for his threepoint shooting at 28 percent thats huge right there for Boston College but they go right back Syracuse and theyre saying look thats a matchup we like if Boston College is not going to double were going to go right back down low to Jesse Edwards Applause a league Bay not a McLaughlin whos in the lineup for an injured Demar Langford missing his second straight game heres McLaughlin with good touch from the elbow Devin McLaughlin 23 games his second start is averaging six points and four rebounds hes active off the glass and hes gotten better each and every game and its key though uh how they attack the Zone I think thats a crucial Gerard with a three he loves to play BC Joe Gerard averaging 18 points per game his last five outings against the Eagles including 24 on New Years Eve at the Dome I had a chance to speak with uh assistant coach red Autry about Joseph Gerards last outing where he was held to Seven Points he said look it was similar to what we just saw there uh they liked some of the looks that he had it wasnt like they were bad books uh or he was really getting bottled up he just missed some shots I passed by mints that one got away from him but early you can see the strategy John uh theyre going right at Quentin post nice post entry pass nice little jump Hook by Jesse Edwards early on hes got it going offensively for Syracuse Edwards a double double average 13 points and 10 rebounds also has 26 steals and one of the best shot blocking artists in the country heres post to the rack but too strong off the glass good idea though yeah it isnt good uh that time Syracuse stayed home with their wings and let post operate uh again oneonone with Edwards Edwards crafty pass track down by mids who gets fouled and he hits the shot he had one for Judah Mintz a miraculous shot bow is on post his first well that is a difficult uh shot against one of the better defenders in the ACC Makai Aston Langford and again Im gonna repeat my statement uh he is one of the better freshmen not just on the ACC but in college basketball Jude immense his ability to do that right there make those difficult twos but really its been impressive you know how tough it is to make the transition for the high school ranks one of the best conferences in the country heres Jada Zach Zachary strong rebound by Elite Bay and he puts it in hes industrious he is not built like a freshman they are so high on this young man uh Prince alique Bay and thats another big time offensive rebound and putback Gerard from 23 yes sir Joe Gerard he can hit from anywhere and what wont get credit uh for that is the screened by Jesse Edwards again A lot of times Shooters get open uh but thats all set up by a beautiful screen great pass by Ashton Langford to post who is parked on the Block and theres an N1 situation for BC foul on Syracuse is Chris Bell will take our first time out when we started our business were paying like an Army first time Malcolm Joe Gerard give him airspace its problematic and its a beautifully designed play right there to screen by Jesse Edwards frees them up now the Dilemma that Boston College has is if Quentin post comes out and hedges then Jesse Edwards could slip and dive down low to the post again a beautifully executed and welldesigned play to free up Gerard for a clean book from Beyond The Ark went and post at the line and he rattles it home hes only missed one foul shot thats returning from his foot injury and now TJ Bickerstaff replaces the seven footer from the Netherlands what type of look does this give BC with picker staff in the game well he gives him another good rebounder and again obviously post size uh thats a problem defending uh Jesse Edwards I would suspect theyre going to go right back down low uh to Jesse Edwards with post on the bench good defense on the weak shot by Devin McLaughlin and right here again theyre trying to get him rolling on that situation again uh you dont mind it because youre trying to get on the ball but Id almost just try to get him isolated but down low on the Block Edwards thought about it instead rolled towards the Baseline Prince oligmay has it for Ashton Langford the bounce is picked off by Gerard magnificent defense and the lob for Edwards he leads Syracuse with 34 dunks no surprise yeah thats a beautiful find by Joseph Gerard uh turnovers thats something Earl Grant talked about but we have to be below 12 turnovers in this game he was concerned about Syracuse he said look they do a good job off of turnovers in transitions McLaughlin high percentage shot they did a good job finding him ball movements working in BCs favor were seeing high level offense really both teams executing at a high level getting some high percentage shots early on in this game Eagles shooting 50 percent Gerard on Zachary and here comes mince but Ashton Langford in the air and he hits it its crafty thats the word I was thinking of I mean thats a freshman going up against a fifth year guy and Makai Aston Langford and uh really he took them to school thats a big time move by The Freshman Jude immense Pence is hitting 44 percent of his shots had a big game against BC on New Years Eve Zachary or Elite Bay the three by The Freshman too strong and Edwards Corrals it Applause Syracuse equally hot for the four 60 percent the drive and an offensive foul says the veteran official raised stallions on Judith well the that time uh the veteran got the better of the Freshman but uh on the previous play right here a little head fake step through he made that look easy thats a really difficult shot though uh this is going to be a battle were going to watch throughout this game a Makai Aspen Langford one of the better Defenders uh on ball defenders in the ACC against a really talented freshman in judaments Asian Madsen in the BC lineup 45 and goal transfer from Cincinnati he has the ball now mcglockton Eagles patient against the 23 Zone and a foul on the orange Sherry heater was on this one calling it on Chris Bell searches always travels well many fans in attendance second on Bill as the Syracuse Scouting Report been Rocky for them at times this year but you know what Malcolm theyre getting there Jim Beam set after the Virginia loss it was their best game of the year yeah and it gets a team that uh I think again wouldnt be surprised to see them uh in the final four in a lead eight thats a really good Virginia team so again uh obviously nobody wants to lose but certainly I dont think anybodys going to frown upon a loss against a really good top 10 Virginia team rebound by bicker staff after the Miss by Matson just by mcglockton Baseline they got jammed up though in the zone and heres Mintz they swarm you in the post dont they drive for three and here come the Eagles a Break by Boston College they have time though a nice little screen uh for Gerard uh in transition this is something Syracuse will do theyll run a little bit different of a secondary break where theyre just trying to get Gerard on these quick hitters off these little pin Downs Gerard low dribbles stolen by Zachary here he comes before that though an offensive foul thats on Bickerstaff well John he was trying to clear a path uh for Jade and Zachary really probably not necessary because you had a twoonone and right here hes trying to clear a path yeah he got in the way right there and and cleared out due to mentz good call by the officials tough break though Boston College they had a turnover looked like they had a advantage on the other end a discussion with Judah Mintz what do you think that was about well I think obviously get him a little bit of a break uh uh first and then the turnovers really wasnt his fault that was on a Gerard but I think thats just more about him getting the rest substitutions for the orange Justin Taylor simir turns back up point guard Gerard got his man in the air it was Ashton Lankford and the foul is on Makai Ashton rank for his first and Betty Williams in the Syracuse lineup and he was a man under the spotlight the other night he did not play in Virginia it was a personal decision for him he needed a day to work some things out his last seven games struggled a bit but you know freshman thats very talented he is and I I think look Jim diaham has talked about this I heard him talking about it look anytime uh any player whether its a freshman upperclassman loses their starting position um they need to take a little time and sometimes adjust to that but again he said it uh everybody agrees with it they need him he is just too talented and if theyre going to go on any type of run theyre going to need him being productive for Syracuse instrumental Malcolm in the Syracuse win their first meeting he had 16 and 10 give them a really nice burst Matson the three he Nails it Applause 28 threequarters anytime you play against the Syracuse zones youre going to have to knock down some perimeter jumpers uh they only made four than their first time against Syracuse Applause John Puck Edwards that is a tough shot to stop a Pro Caliber shot I tell you what uh he has just continued to get better Alan Griffin a red archery Jerry Mack the assistant coaches to go along with the Hall of Famer Jim behind deserve a lot of credit he has just continued to get better year after year Frankford finds host to Chaz Kelly freshman and Torrance for the rebound Syracuse had numbers but theyll hold the front Court see five assists on six field goals Edwards bouncing the steal by Matson here come the Eagles thats it will take the three and Gerard Corrals the rebound was that too quick probably so you had the advantage uh if you have a three on two probably want to try to get the ball to the rim on the other side I think Jesse Edwards being a little bit too uh overpassive uh hes isolated on the wing and trying to work himself down low against Clinton post hes trying to make a pass you probably almost rather have him shoot that one in particular guy that shoot close to 60 percent Gerard off to a real rough start against PC one for five shooting all of them threepoint attempts Kelly vickerstaff Matson balls moving crisply post and he gets the hometown roll post has five he averages 16 to lead the Eagles the college doing a nice job attacking the Syracuse Zone but theyre getting some isos at the foul line Williams way off Ashton Langford has it not with the orange were looking for Applause post out of a double but its stolen by Torrance four turnovers for BC foul against BC and that brings us to another median timeout Jesse Edwards leads all scorers with eight points hes doing a good job on this slob in The Yards lead by one this week is your chance to try it basically grew up together playing basketball um we played we both are from Amsterdam we both played at the same Club weve been friends for so long I remember like we always used to stay out longer after practice play 101 and we kind of grew together too we were both very like late bloomers uh kind of grew in the yeah grew later than uh some of the other guys so um very comparable and hes one of my yeah one of my better friends one of my uh certainly one of my best friends in the basketball World um so yeah great guy I always uh love playing against her for sure that was quick post on acc pm on acc Network and great relationship with Jesse Edwards growing up together in Amsterdam and what a youth team they had Ill tell you what a lot of size on that one Id like to see those other guys that were taller than them early but right now these two have a nice little individual battle going on and certainly both of them so key for what their teams want to do offensively and defensively and Mission Madison do you see a lift off the bench with Five Points yeah a nice little head pick that time hes known for his shooter doesnt settle for the jumper 12 right up into his pullup jumper Edwards against Quinton post Applause is to steal by Kelly and Torrance gets it back Runner Edwards down low and he puts it back in thats what they expect from the 71 Jesse Edwards who has 10 right now he is really uh enforcing his will in to paint a big time offensive rebound and put back and again hes a guy offensively has gotten better but thats this great upper body strength by Jesse Williams Edwards excuse me Jesse Edwards Jayden Zachary eyes the three and Edwards has the board Syracuse has led for seven and a half minutes blob Off the Bench and a block as they stymie Malik Brown good block by Prince Alita Elite Bay and brown is averaging 10 points in his last two games yeah and theyre going to need more of that Boston College of the transition defense make or Miss oh thats a rebound track for a moment by Zachary thats a foul on BC its going to be on Jaden Zachary so Jesse Edwards a rebound and then a put back not too shabby Malcolm but Jesse Edwards uh enforcing his will on the offensive Glass Syracuse a three key matchup we talked about it in the open uh containing Jesse Edwards Hes got it going that time with the left Boston College choosing not to double or dig out of the post Syracuse doing a nice job of finding him and then right here this has been problematic for many teams when you match up against Syracuse he does a good job attacking the offensive glass 70 offensive rebounds this year would be hardpressed to match up against any guys around the ACC hes going to be at the top of the list as one of the more difficult matchups presents so many challenges post falls down and raise tions calls a offensive foul oh those guys go way back right here oh yeah thats pretty good d uh By Post holds his ground Edwards puts down the shoulder and that time draws the foul offensive charge Jim behind not happy with that call at all is called for the Flop Call fish Styles doesnt want to hear it Zachary forced the pass and another turnover Syracuse swarming around the elbows in the zone Benny Williams its had a few moments on the bench the runner Baseline batted away to a league Bay here comes a twoonone with Jaden Zachary for elite and the flush man that was super dude you cant run uh offense in transition off the turnover any better unselfish played by Zachary and then a league base showing off the Hops in transition cant run it better than that Vince trying to shake Ashton Lake for Here Comes Zachary Torrance Nifty dribbling in the post forever has looked out hes rolling too easily on the Block and bit thats all set up uh that is a beautiful postentry pass by Torrance alls Jesse Edwards had to do was catch it he gave him the target drop step and then throw it in thats a beautiful post entry pass by Torrance two Playmakers in the backcourt for the orange fence and Torrance Applause the Zachary and a league Bay combining yeah this right here though great transition offense of Jaden Zachary unselfish and an elite Bank showing off the Hops uh in transition off the steal and both these teams are right now doing a good job being active in the passing Lanes Applause Syracuse hot from the field high percentage shots 50 percent BC 41 percent guy Ashton Lankford transferred from Providence or glockton Ashton Lankford Applause good Hustle by McLaughlin but he cant track it down heres our Tuesday college basketball doubleheader on acc network of the ESPN app Blake Henson and Pittsburgh hosts Louisville at seven Eastern and its off to Charlottesville Smith jarkel Joyner and NC State taking on number six Virginia Virginias shocked earlier today life in the ACC and this guy right here Jude immense Im gonna go back to my conversation I have with red Autry before this game he said look a hard to find a freshman playing better than Jude immense because of the system they play in and what hes asked to do Manning that point guard position hard to argue he has really been phenomenal for Syracuse theres Gerard with midsong transition what a block by Prince a league Bay my goodness and almost a steal by Brown Here Comes Quentin post Applause playing a twoman game with Jaden Zachary outstanding defense by The Freshman alibabe from Minneapolis Zachary hits the three so defense turns into offense thats a nice find by Quentin post we talked about his scoring in the tip oh thats also something he brings to this offense hes an excellent passer out of the high post or low post three for the Orange is Belle but glockton over the top and his hard work and perseverance pays off its a foul so Im Malik Brown all right here we got freshman on freshman crime Prince a league baseball to judamence of the Freshman for Syracuse and then on the other end Quentin post showing off the passing ability uh to Jaden Zachary and uh we shot ourselves a really good game Applause that one might show up on support center the lob to Prince the league Bay Edwards too strong a league base got the rebound you know about momentum Malcolm and what you get when you have the energy on both ends of the floor well I think right now uh Syracuse theyre getting some good looks theyre obviously right now I think the biggest issue theyre having uh Boston College getting some quality looks from Beyond The Arc Ashton Lake from the McLaughlin good catch former tight end in high school Lockton gets blocked This Time by Edwards Zachary no beat the shot clock but McLaughlin tracks it down Applause and a foul on BC that leads us to a break and Prince Philippe brings the house down at Chestnut Hill Sports Center a prince a league Bay coming at you beautiful law pass we got a tie game in Chestnut Hill in uh Elite athlete showing off the Hops on the other and defensively breaking up would look like a easy deuce and back to the alleyoop play a beautiful set piece by Boston College you take a look at this freshmans numbers you go back to the last game of verse Clemson 30 solid minutes I think the big number in this yes the 10 points are nice but seven rebounds hes turned into one of the better rebounding forwards of Fort Boston College and then this ACC its been huge and a big reason why theyve had some success in their last couple outings yeah he called his seven rebounds against the Tigers Tuesday with seven already Applause best of the BC Squad only has nine and a foul on the Eagles thats on Devin McLaughlin his second with Jesse Edwards at the line one and one and well John thats a smart play I like what Syracuse is doing Quentin post on the bench Boston College at a clear size disadvantage they could have easily tried to jack up a three they recognize their big Jesse Edwards has an advantage lets get him into post and weve seen some pretty nice passing uh into the post by Syracuse to Jesse Edwards and the rebound for TJ Bickerstaff saw those numbers by Edwards an impressive first half Applause working on Applause gaining his 10th DoubleDouble of the season and watch how Boston College is attacking the Syracuse Zone theyre rotating the three guys up at the top in and out of the foul line area they either step out catch a pass or set a screen Lee Bay tried to beat the shot clock with a heave thats a turnover the six for the Eagles heres Thursday nights womens basketball doubleheader Olivia miles leads the Number Nine Irish against Pittsburgh at six Eastern then Diamond Johnson in number 15 NC State take on Jules Speer and Wake Forest should be another terrific night of womens Hoops on acc Network and the app they come the eagles with numbers a league Bay back to Zachary skipping in Zachary vickerstaff Ashton Langford rejected by Mr Block Party Jesse Edwards he averages three blocks per game to lead the conference and were seeing great defense on both ends right here Makai Aston Langford great recovery I like it even better keep possession for your team and then Jesse Edwards the leader in blocks in the ACC hes just got great length and timing breaking up a deuce by Boston College second block of the night for Edwards Applause deep three Ashton Lake how about that ranch well youre gonna have to hit some threes against this Syracuse Zone I think the key thing is is the quality of looks Gerard gets planted and thats gonna be three free throws for Joe Gerard Applause second foul on Jaden Zachary this one right here Loco three four Makai Aston Langford but back on the other end John speaking with other coaches that uh Scout Syracuse Joseph Gerard will put you to sleep meaning youll think hes just standing there somebody would come set a pin down and hell run off that and if youre not there on the catch uh he is one of the better threepoint Shooters uh in college basketball and you look at his uh historic numbers uh 275 made threes thats a guy you better be there on the catch and a difficult task for BC whenever hes either in Chester Hill or against the Dome or at the Dome against the Eagles as Zachary goes to the bench it just cant seem to cover well I think the big thing is uh he probably struggles against guys with a little bit more length a guy thats maybe six five six seven uh smaller guards because they get caught up on the screen so he does a good job running off those pin downs and then freeing himself up for some open looks Gerard has eight Edwards has 13 another deep three Ashton Lankford rattles out and out of bounds off of Quinton post coming up at halftime Chelsea Riggs will be joined by Joel Berry Carlos Boozer and Luke Hancock at our ACC Network Studio plenty of topics at this time of year in college hopes to cover what a busy day and some upsets to cover for the crew at halftime Gerard is a slip and a put back is good thats Malik Brown off the glass Applause first two of the night for Brown Applause game has been tied five times thicker staff in the middle of the zone Boston College trying to use ball fakes to move the hands and then get the ball right there to that foul line area Applause Edwards with a foul his second Applause thats a good idea well I think this right here again you look at this past thats how you want to attack the zone and uh certainly thats a big break for Boston College picking up a foul on Jesse Edwards now lets see how they attack and see if you get Quentin post involved with Jesse Edwards on the bench yeah munir Hema replaces Edwards keema 25 blocks under a minute to play in the half thats the Langford out of control post the three and he Nails it ties the game at 32 and thats what makes him a difficult matchup we talked about his last four games averaging 21 points per game uh he is a seventh footer that can beat you down low uh in the paint and then also step out and knock down threes 38 from three thats his 11th of the season that repertoire is expanding for post offensive Arsenal Gerard the fade away over running the rebound was Bickerstaff kept Alive by the orange three by Justin Taylor hes got it hes a freshman from Charlottesville and was a high school teammate of Tony Bennetts son waning stages of the first half but leave me to ask to Langford he always won and its still good Syracuse with the threepoint halftime lead after the tiller threeparter they LED for 14 minutes and 21 seconds in the first half Applause and the accs standings as the studio crew took you around the league Clemson 103 and a second straight loss in pitting UVA and NC State its such a competitive conference yeah at the top half of that leaving the middle half really but not much separating these teams so every game counts moving month to college basketball quick post is called for a travel he got a little bit jumbled up there in the post yeah and thats really a credit Jesse Edwards again you have to be aware of his shot blocking uh one of the best shot blockers in college Gerard to Edwards and we have contact and Edward just comes up a bit lame as Devin McLaughlin was defending on the Block and theyre running Syracuse a lot of actions that get Jesse Edwards diving to the post and yeah that time of Bachman looks like he was late uh getting over and again a really welldesigned play Boston College uh theyre sending guys because uh theyre confident of Gerard coming off that bend down as soon as Edward screens hes diving right down low to the post third foul against McLaughlin he leaves just 21 seconds into the second half but glockton replaced Tamar Langford in the starting lineup last two games Lankford out with a knee injury suffered against Virginia Applause Syracuse LED throughout the first half and what do you think the message was from Jim beyon I think a big thing is a limit of the breakdowns on the back end of their zone right now uh Boston College are getting a ball to that high post and theyve been having some breakdowns on the back end Applause Kai Ashley for 25 not what theyre looking for that one was a little deep uh you can get that really pretty much anytime youd like to be a little bit more patient get a higher percentage shot stolen by Jaden Zachary one of the top steel artists in the ACC down the lane and he converts soccer is tenacious on the defensive end yeah hes got great body control one of the stronger guards in the ACC built really strong and thats a really difficult tool through contact first point scored off a orange turnover by The Eagles Syracuse has copped it up six times Edwards usually hits that one and TJ Bickerstaff with the rebound liquor stop in the game for Devin McLaughlin whos out with three fouls Applause Eagles havent beaten the orange since 2018 nine straight wins in the series for Syracuse a three by Quentin post and a throwaway by TJ Bickerstaff Here Comes Joe Gerard Three Corner no good by Chris Bell and the orange regain possession Applause all right here lets see post and theyre saying that went off of Quentin post questionable Maybe Gerard nice through the defense he has 10 points the second player in double figures Edwards has 15 John thats a nice little step through by Gerard again theyre running out at him on the threepoint line and a dunk by quitting post what a pass by Ashton and thats twice now in this game Boston College has been able to find the back half underneath of that Zone on the Baseline with the direct pass from the wing swarming defense Justin Taylor off the orange bits Dicker staff triggers a fast break to Jaden Zachary DC has put up 223 pointers theyve made five the orange have taken 10 threes and theyve made two Zachary with a threes got it they were deliberate and he got the open look Ill go back to that first game number uh Boston College only four threes in that game uh Syracuse almost daring them to shoot the three ball theyre going to have to knock some of those down and continue their shooting from the perimeter seventh time Malco the game has been tied PCs only LED for one minute 51 seconds post spinning against Edwards and hes got it he gives the Eagles the lead its a seven to nothing run and Jim beyon takes a timeout theyre rocking the baby and the fans its a sellout County four but quit post spilling it but when you knock down threes it opens up the middle Clinton postler with a nice little reverse Boston College up two are your head ECC Network basketball is presented by Subway Subways up in their game with the AllStar Subway series menu just ordered by name or number Music right here Boston College youre going to have to knock down some threes in particular some contested ones against this Syracuse zone right here post with the pass and then that opens up the middle excellent offense by Boston College all set up though by them knocking down some perimeter jumpers entering the night BC 27 for 71 on threes their last four games 38 back door nicely done as Torrance lays it in well Jesse Edwards has really played a a really good allaround game for Syracuse box uh we talked about his offensive numbers uh thats a nice pass though Boston College fell asleep on the back door cut thats a pinpoint pass by Jesse Edwards have led to a wide open layup good time out by Jim behind certainly worked with that play for Edwards and then they got a bucket to post for three comes Edwards and now Gerard in the front Court Applause on the Baseline Brown who had a quiet first half Taylor three hes going to be a heck of a player in Syracuse they are really high on this young freshman a great body does not look like a freshman a great build and his ability to stretch the D excellent footwork and elevation on his jumper he has two of their three threepointers post swarmed and the active orange defense as always in the 23 Zone Syracuse with a threepoint lead in Chestnut Hill youve spent some time overseas together we had actually a really good time speaking before the game catching up on some old memories our high school coach in Detroit yeah the lead eight team you had in 199394 put back attempt by TJ Bickerstaff after the post Miss Syracuse has led for more than 17 minutes BCs LED for 207 and a block by Ashton Langford a candidate for an ACC all defensive Squad and they broke up a beautiful play it was an excellent pass by Torrance uh to Joseph Gerard on the back door it looked like he was going to get a wide open two but thats a great recovery by Makai Aspen Langford and a jump ball tie up by Zachary hes 62 against the 71 Edwards thank you Applause theyre right here again nice uh really just ready play the vibe Jaden Zachary again he knows guarding Joseph Gerard you have to be locked in on him Applause Edwards Maneuvers and hits boy that is his shot he loves posting up seven to nothing orange run why not feed him right yeah textbook and again they continue to look for him Boston College again theyre going to have to make a decision uh do we go double or at least dig to give Quentin toe some help when they throw the ball down low to Jesse Edwards picker staff no open look and Justin tell of the board Torrance Brown passed it up Taylor takes the three and he makes the three Justin Taylor Energizer off the arch Bets with nine on three threes timeout PC so Syracuse and the fans coming down from Central New York with an eightpoint lead and well take largest lead of the game for the orange Malcolm and theyre passing the ball well yeah extra passes I think Joseph Gerard that last play of that led to a wide open three uh for Justin Taylor but really its something that the coaching staff has talked to him about look he draws so much attention he could have easily tried to Jack this up right here extra pass unselfish play uh by Joseph Gerard thats beautiful basketball in transition and Coach Jim behind a must be pleased with how his team has responded to Boston College if they can get this type of production from Justin Taylor Off the Bench thats going to be a pleasant development and four assists on five field goals this half yeah really again the willingness uh for them to all make the extra pass and then when Boston College stays home theyve done a nice job continuing to go down low to Jesse Edwards on the other side Boston College again theyve had some good looks they had a wide open foul line jumper they just missed that one I think the problematic area for them has been containing Jesse Edwards uh end this game hes got 17 points and six boards the Eagles extremely reliant on the three ball and thats not necessarily a good thing for them Earl Grant doesnt want more than 15 but against the Zone youre pretty much forced to do it this will be the 25th three attempt and they hit their seventh of the game so hell take that but overall he wants better production yeah I think though that again youll live with that if youre Earl Grant we talked about a Clinton post uh really hes one of their better threepoint shooters for Boston College although hes a seven footer that looks like a two guard coming off a screen right there post averaging 21 points a game his last four he has 15 Edwards he always has an answer yeah theyre going to have to double now again theyve stayed home and theyve gone to Jesse Edwards Syracuse and hes made Boston College pay theyre going to have to give Clint post some help but down low on the post whether its going to double or at least dig down and make it look like youre gonna go double Edwards has 19 to lead all scorers made eight of 11 shots Zachary navigates and he hits and its an end one Bill Covington calls the foul on Malik Brown Jim behind wanted to travel on this play right here a little rough screen by Clint post and then Up and Under yeah I think thats pretty good footwork uh by Jade and Zachary and then on the other end right here of the footwork by Jesse Edwards of the Improvement that he has made year over year of course Syracuse probably some of the best that Ive seen Bill Covington just told us Zachary got hit in the face they changed it to Jesse Edwards thats his third s out there with three fouls Gerard gets doubled and heres a foul on the Eagles Zachary tonight at 8 30 East Ern that crew will break down the day of the ACC with highlights and Analysis of all the mens games and look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Zachary has to leave with three fouls Chaz Kelly a freshman replaces him the Eagles do not have Donald hand expected him to be their backup point guard hes out for the year with a torn ACL play just two games a freshman Gerard a fall away and its a twopointer its a Syracuse hot shooting continues yeah he is tough I mean he gets it going again thats not pretty thats not bad defense uh by Makai ask and Langford thats a guy thats one of the top scorers in the ACC just really getting into his shot and hes been problematic for Boston College throughout his career Gerard has 12 hes three for 10 for the field Chaz Kelly show Marksman Music freshmans gaining more confidence and thats pretty tough too Off the Bench forget about being cold he hits a deep three and thats a big one to cut to deficit to three Gerard to take cut off on the Baseline post has it its only Kellys A3 of the season thought about it again after Lankford takes it and he makes it the Eagles have tied it up theyve got a few counter punches in the back Gerard against Ashton Lankford towards on his countrymen wow what a move hes got the whole bag today I mean uh theyre isolating them giving them free reign at the free throw line hes working his way down that time little shoulder fake and then back uh to the finish with the left hand he has been impressive all night Kelly and Ashton Langford playing a twoman game now to post eyes to three rebound of League Bay blocked by Edwards his third block of the game hes matched his season average leads the ACC in that department and the key thing with that he kept the ball in play a lot of times guys would have tried to punch that end of stance realizing time and possession thats a big time block by Jesse Edwards Taylor hes been a spark Malik Brown to Gerard and heres Ashton Lankford Joe Gerard one for six from three lob and its happening by a league Bay good pass by chess Kelly and thats again Boston College has found the weak spot uh in the zone theyve been able to get behind the zone and throw over it Makai Ashton Langford has three of the nine BC threepointers and this was from a long distance his dad is enjoying it all hes a presence at BC the Eagles tied up Music since I was little I wanted to be a party Jesse Edwards has four rebounds away from his tenth DoubleDouble this season hes such a good offensive player very impressed right here a little reverse pivot a shoulder fake uh left Quentin post but then a Clinton post answers with his threepoint shooting ability its really been a fun matchup of these two bigs contrasting Styles Jesse Edwards has done a lot of work and damage down low in the block on the other end post showing off the threepoint shooting touch we knew from the start that was part of our story line from the jump Jesse Edwards against Quinton post Taylor to Torrance whos giving them a nice boost off the bench Vince has the ball hes been quiet in the second half gets fouled by Prince a league Bay first on the Freshman from Minneapolis who played high school ball with Chet holmgruden and Jalen Suggs and Judah mentz does a great job getting Defenders up in the air nice use of the head fake he really sells that well and thats a three or four times Ive counted in this game where hes been able to get Boston College Defenders off their feet but he is so crafty and Shifty as a freshman this has been solid for the most part seven points two turnovers in 18 minutes why does that happen well I think the biggest thing is is hes been patient again their matchup advantage has been Jesse Edwards and thats something the coaching staff has talked to their team about look lets go to our game plan if we have an advantage lets play to that they have done that and its worked out thus far pretty well before Syracuse going to Jesse Edwards Syracuse has outscored BC 2321 in the second half Eagles riding an 115 run heres Kelly oh hes Nifty and hes crafty Chaz Kelly Five Points Off the Bench its our ninth lead change Applause Eagles coming up the upset win over 20th ranked Clemson Tuesday night now Boston College sends the double team at Jesse Edwards Applause cards to Taylor with under five to shoot good defense taken away by Ashton Lankford he had six steals Tuesday goes Coast to Coast largest lead of the game for Boston College of the heart and soul of this Boston College team is Makai Aspen Langford thats a big time steal and finished off and a timeout Syracuse Applause and theres still a crowd of over 8 000 has a lot to celebrate can they hang on in the final eight 24 John the adjustment Boston College has made uh Jesse Edwards now theyre going to double uh he has been dominant in this game theyre getting the ball out of his hands the rotation has been good and then the end result they were able to come up with a turnover but to the adjustment you can see anytime the ball goes into the post they are doubling hard and giving help to the post players and the flush by Jesse Edwards just with Jim Bay I have ordered after the timeout its a nice counter hes a Hall of Fame coach for a reason thats a beautiful set play out of the timeout had Jesse Edwards out at the high post looked like he was going to pop out and then they run a beautiful play to get him alive Applause and a 5050 ball with Taylor and Ashton Lankford possession towards BC and John this is a beautiful set play and because Joseph Gerard is setting the screen Makai Aston Langford cannot help in that situation because hes afraid of Gerard stepping out thats a beautifully designed play and it would end result because of the pinpoint passing a monster dunk for Jesse Edwards beautiful time out and execution coming out of that time out by Syracuse Applause eagle shooting 45 percent of course pass by post he paid for it for the turnover just when you think theyre open not necessarily in the zone yeah and a Syracuse again adjusted Boston College has hurt them on the Baseline finding that area they adjust and come up with the Steal eighth Eagles turnover Edwards its immense the left hand and a bump thats a foul on quit the Post his second Applause John this is great Patience by Jesse Edwards he knows the doubles coming he waits until the last minute and then Jude immense heads up play dive down low to the Post and during the break Grant Williams Celtics forward throwing some shirts into the sellout crowd theres parking staff at PCs done a really nice job this year bringing Celtics two games Pritchard was here the other night throwing some hot dogs into the crowd and both of them showing off their arms Grant Williams what a great career he had at Rocky Top yeah its showing off some arm strength there as well too it looks like he got that one up into the upper deck behind the game but right here pretty good game and this guy at the line judaments although he hasnt had a monster game in terms of scoring again Ive been impressed with his court awareness and some of the reads hes made again making the right decisions to go to your match up that favors you a league Bay and he ran into that Syracuse wall that happens a lot the 23 Zone Gerard thought about it theres mince freshman Taylor has been huge for them in three threes mids double team what a pass to Edwards oh Syracuse revitalized after that timeout thats 25 points for the big Jesse Edwards and Im gonna go back to my comment about Jude immense thats the maturity that he has shown in growth during the season uh maybe earlier he would have tried to Jack that shot up beautiful pass to Jesse Edwards Applause so Syracuse on the lead now for 23 minutes in 30 seconds going back and forth its tied 27 all in the second half Edwards playing like a first team all ACC Center and it goes out of bounds back to the Judah mitz play and Petty play for the guard yeah and again earlier in the season he might have tried to Jack this shot up sees uh that he draws two Defenders almost three thats a beautiful little dump off Pass Key number four assists yes everybody knows he could score Ive been impressed though with his play making uh in this game thats good observation Malcolm hes been a steadying influence despite only 10 points Jason Madsen nice first half hes been quiet in the second half a league Bay almost stepped out of bounds McLaughlin a league Bay the board but got punched out of his hand here comes mince hes one on three and a hold for Gerard again its a little thing uh but Jude immense uh you can see him maturing again early in the season or one on three he might have tried to Jack that one up understanding threepoint lead pull the ball back out and run some clock excellent Court awareness by the freshman back door pass to Malik Brown Bill Covington calls a foul Applause this right here again all Judah meant a beautiful pick and roll offense nice little unselfish bounce pass that led to a scoring play Jerry McNamara red Autry I had a chance to talk with those guys before the game and they said both uh whats the biggest difference with him that right there his ability to understand time and possession of the game rattles home for brown and Vinces clearly only a freshman in name only hes gotten a lot of maturity throughout this year as a headliner for Jim Boeheim a fivepoint lead for the orange fourth foul on Devin McLaughlin of BC yeah again a really excellent offense by Syracuse Boston College last couple possessions theyve had some pretty good looks one a corner three just unable to convert but theyre getting some high percentage looks key thing is cannot turn it over though against this Syracuse Zone eight to nothing orange run their largest lead was eight and another turnover you just called it and again the ball fakes of Syracuse much more active into passing lanes and just cant do it against this team theyre gonna milk clock and then go back down low to this guy right here force you to double Edwards is at the better post throughout and a foul thats on post his third our next allaccess the ACC life is a very special one careers Monday night youll take an emotional Journey with ACC student athletes and administrators from all 15 ACC institutions who travel to Montgomery and Selma Alabama to experience and learn more about the Civil Rights Movement highlighted by a march across the Edmond Pettis Bridge Dallas Tufts host at seven Eastern on acc Network and the ESPN app well John uh oh again we talked about as we look at some good passing by Boston College but another thing that Jesse Edwards has done obviously not a popular thing to talk about but how well he sets screens for Joseph Gerard hes freedom up oh like that last play right there for some really uh open looks coming off pin Downs Austin College switching to a Zone Applause and the Baseline Jumper by mids do you like to change it by the Eagles well it didnt work so if youre a gym if youre uh Earl Grant obviously youre trying to change something up to slow this juice uh offense down again great patience and adjudiments showing off his midrange game and that is deflected by a few and a turnover again for BC its piling up and June admits hes having some fun in the last three minutes Gerard Vince Baseline connectivity a chance to try intercept offensive Energizer he has really been impressive uh hes showing off a lot of moves in the post right here a great footwork finished with the left but Boston College really uh has had to double uh theyve set some plays for him Syracuse out of timeouts or just in the regular flow of their offense hes caught lobs I think the biggest thing though is the points off of turnovers Boston College right now are giving up way too many points off the turnovers Boston Colleges last nine possessions theyve been one of five and four turnovers theyre really trying to close this game out at home uh really tough to do when youre turning the ball over its magnified the 14 points off the BC turnovers by the orange they Feast on that a Hallmark of Jim boeheims Hall of Fame tenure theres a reason why theyve used the 23 zone for more than 45 years Vince the lob and Ed Edwards is the beneficiary thats a veteran pass to a veteran dunker well Ill tell you right now judaments Im going to say it again uh I know he can score everybody in the ACC in college basketball understands he can score but the passing that he has shown in this game in the reads he has made to set Edwards up that one right there again but thats pinpoint passing us Edwards had to do is catch go up and down a league Bay with a three rebound for post to Zachary hes got the three so James Zachary counter punches for the Eagles that was the largest lead of the game for the orange at nine take us through these next two minutes and 25 seconds what do both teams have to do well defensively Boston College is going to have to get a stop right now they go back into looks like a one two two Zone 32 Zone uh call it what you want but its a Zone theyre gonna have to rebound out of it and then obviously uh be conscious of threepoint shooting in particular Gerard and Taylor hence with one second left and thats an air ball thats shot clock violation and a turnover for Syracuse sloppy possession thats rare in the second half of them it really has and on the other side jaded Zachary really has been solid uh for uh Boston College and Earl Grant 14 points three a six from the threepoint line Syracuse is going to have to find him not give him any quality looks from Beyond The Arc and an offensive foul says Jerry heater on TJ Bickerstaff what happened well Earl Grant not arguing so you know he knows its a pretty good call he just moved again yeah hes moving I mean its a moving screen right its right in front of the referee thats an easy call for him to make tough break for Boston College look theyre trying to screen the guards thats a great job though by Jude events fighting over that screen but if youre its that situation A TJ Bickerstaff you cant pick up a foul in that situation a minute under two minutes to go third foul on Bickerstaff hes out of the lineup Syracuse killing clock Brown to Gerard and theres a foul on Jayden Zachary he looked at the official and thought he might have gotten away with it but Ray Steins calls the foul and Jim behind was ready to erupt if he did not play it was a delayed whistle yeah again now if Jaden Zacharys going straight up and Joseph Gerard goes into him then thats another thing but because hes closing out and hes flying in to Joseph Gerard thats an easy call to make Mount behind may have erupted yeah that one again thats right in front of the ref it was delayed uh but again the right call and certainly if youre Boston College you do not want to put this guy on the free throw line he has been almost automatic Gerard 51 not a 61 on free throw attempts this year fourth foul on Zachary Applause post has it deflected by Brown well the key thing right now with uh Boston College offense Syracuse a very active uh with their passes theyre trying to get deflections you got to move their hands and eyes with ball fakes post to the rack no thats the rebound and foul so he missed the shot but he came back and the orange foulomb thank you Taylors First so in the last 75 seconds Malcolm its a tough task to come back by eight yeah but still again plenty time uh its going to those start obviously you got to make the free throws and then defensively uh the fouls uh you know again obviously the Miss free throw hurts but defensively uh youre gonna have to try to put something together if youre Earl Grant try to force some turnovers against Syracuse because theyre going to try to run clock right now the key thing though is is a plank D without fouling only three attempts at the line for BC Syracuse has been the line 18 times rattles home for post Applause he has 18 and a foul in the backcourt on Zachary that will be it for James Zacharys fouled out Applause and in that situation right there again Im not sure if thats what Earl Grant wanted to do put mints on the line typically you try to get a trap in the backcourt try to get a steal or Ill try to get another trap over half court see if you can get a steal then hed look the foul but they chose to foul and in that situation not sure if he wanted Jaden Zachary to foul in that situation half admire what Syracuse has done Mark when theyve dealt with some adversity theres no question about that they had some issues this week it was The Cloud of the Benny Williams decision Jimmy you know there was some contested issues with behind this week due to his post game press conference and fans were clearly upset and theyve come back today to beat a pesky or eventually maybe beat a pesky BC team is theres a three by Kelly off the line and out of the bucket but its a good punch by them to come back steal by Matson a three and hes got it dont go anywhere its a sixpoint lead for the orange Applause and right in front of us good hands Huck still got it Im just trying to save you from getting hit in the head because you werent moving your reflexes uh but right here again its game far from over a sixpoint game 483 seconds not sure what the referees are taking a look at I might be a clock Syracuse is out of timeouts two two timeouts are ready for be zero Grant with Jerry heater what do you think uh or Grant I think is contesting possession now again I think the refs are going to go take a look at it and see Applause they are looking at it heres the first one a nice steal Matson heads up Play Wide Open three knocks it down Applause good defense by Madison then he hits the three and back again to punch it away Syracuse ball after the video review Applause 483 remaining in regulation Syracuse has made five of their last six shots Applause right here again a Matson heads up wow again now its you can argue look it was a foul but there wasnt one called looks like Matson did not touch the ball in that situation colleague Brown Applause to Gerard and a foula Makai Ashton Lankford so that kills nine seconds second on Ashton Langford Gerard at the line seven for seven from the line tonight and John this is why these in the game situations defensively so important probably if youre a grant you want to trap or try to get the ball out of this guys hand Joseph Gerard put it in somebody elses hands uh because Gerard again one of the better freethrow Shooters thats what the career numbers will tell you weve made 11 straight free throws put a star next to that stack Kelly to a league Bay to Langford down the lane Edwards got a piece of it heres Madison with a three no Gerard lets it go out of bounds good decision orange basketball up by eight Applause season High threepoint attempts for BC 34 it had 28 attempts against Wake Forest January 14th theyve made 11 of those foreign Applause Malcolm you know coming into every game against Syracuse what does every team say take the open shot make the open shot well I think its more if theyre open looks and uh to the numbers in this game look Jesse Edwards had a monster game 27 points he was efficient 12 with 15 from the floor but this guy at the line I think really uh the unsung hero in this game not a monster game in terms of a 20 plus Point performance but he had 14 points six of eight from the free throw line excuse me six and nine now but I think the big number five assists but he really made some nice reads uh in this game played it really a good four game for Syracuse and their dominance against BC solidified theyve won 10 straight against the Eagles it was a grinder though both teams had their moments Syracuse a plus six Edge in the second half they outscored him Malcolm in the second half 4236 and they also Trail by three with 812 left well one of the uh most uh improved players and a big time shot blocker I had it going offensively for Syracuse efficient 1215 from the
