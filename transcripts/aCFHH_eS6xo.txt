today because hes also from Vermont so thats a key loss for the seminal on both ends of the floor yeah Bo Bowen hes been shooting the ball almost 54 I think the last four games from the threepoint land so it just limits Florida State as far as offensive option goes and theyll miss him tonight Yan is flustered in the post by Chad venning whos been a presence for BC on both ends Deion Brown Roger McFarland Josh Beetle Don and Chad Benny make up their starting lineup beetle with a penetration to Brown and a good start for the transfer from UNBC and pick up right where he left off 20 points versus North Carolina hes a guy that really needs to be aggressive for this Boston College team Chandler Jackson dayquon Davis jir Watkins Jerry Deng and Malik Yuan D making his second start as he starts for bu Bowen its a Florida State working inside out and a team that likes to move the ball a lot on the offensive end of the floor for them to have optimal offensive production 225 passes but how about this bc3 yeah you see right here Joshua Beetle just getting into the lane creating some for Deon Brown in the corner knocking it down when you get an open opportunity you have to be able to take advantage of it Deon Brown good job knocking it down Beetle and brown combining the 34 point points against the tar Hills that was a devastating loss for BC well get into that in a little bit Chad venning the running hook shot the sa benture transfer is hard to handle isnt it hes been doing great I mean 17 points over his last three games almost 60 from the field John hes just a guy when he gets it in the post he uses his strong body to be able to create space to get opportunities at The Rim Watkins with the runner off the line for the seals Florida State average 77 points per game they shoot it at a 46 clip Donald Han for three and Chandler Jackson the Applause rebound Watkins transfer from Virginia Comm well Balls punched out of bounds by Dion brown with 22 to shoot but VC looks like they have a good offensive flow in the first two minutes of the game well I think both teams offensively they want to be able to get ball movement they want to create angles on the drive and just offer open opportunities to shoot the basketball but you see already for Florida State Ying out of the game only one for four last game two points hes a guy who has to be assertive yes to be aggressive especially being 611 just using that big body trying to create opportunities yeah they frustrated the fact that he only had four shots against Virginia Tech waiting seconds of the shot clock Watkins and the board for hand Donald and has been one of the top performers in the ACC our Spotlight performer in the open with that big game against North Carolina with 26 darting drive by McFarland Here Comes Watkins hell go downhill on you quickly and a foul on BC thats on Dion Brown and another substitution is Yan checks back in for Leonard Hamilton Watkins 10 plus 19 of 21 thats like Eric devendorf efficiency yeah the thing is with Florida State you dont want to have to get in those ISO situations every single time the last few possessions just ended up in tough shots for Florida State they got to move the ball side to side get the defense moving and try to create those driving lanes for their guards I mentioned earlier the optimal game for Leonard Hamilton he wants 225 passes throughout the game how does that happen well its just Ball moving obvious L Florida state is a team that creates offense from their defense but when they do get in the half court they have to be able to move the ball move the defense side to side that will create driving Lanes now you can get into the paint and that creates drive and kick opportunities seems easy enough Donald Han for three and Watkins up high Davis was an impressive guard dang is Off the Mark Yan in the post stand hes got the first two of the night for the seminal well it was a a big resistance from venning right there but even right there Malik Yun when he gets the ball get a wide base use your strong body and go up aggressively at the basket venning just gave him an opportunity where he wasnt playing hard defense right there Brown bounces the ball away for a turnover youc with 12 turnovers per game right here y just really no resistance at all from vening just kind of just let him go right up to the rim and when you play defense like that I guess its going to be a little bit easier to score offensive players dream absolutely yeah if youre not going to play defense Im going to go right up and score beetle fall for the BC foul hes first second on the team as theyll inbounds Watkins to trigger Eagles manto man this is Dave Juan Davis out of Baltimore play for overtime Elite one of the best programs in the Country Three and a foul says official CLA auy Tom Roger McFarland transfer from Southeast Louisiana first McFarland see good drive and kick by Davis and Ds the guy that can really shoot the ball and you hope hes okay cuz this Florida States already losing B bow and be tough to lose another guy dang another outside shooter guy who could space the floor for Florida state looks like hes all right though John theres Taylor B Bowen looking Music on heres your stat of the day or kind of a name fact of the day compliments of Chuck Walsh from Florida state bbing grew up at Jericho Vermont the same town as Wilson a Bentley whos credited with taking the first picture of a Laughter snowflake we you know being uh in Syracuse we have a lot of snowflakes you can win a few uh bets on that one yeah absolutely tell me who Wilson a Bentley is that was my first time ever hearing that name just to be honest so I would have lost that bet well you we like to tell you something you dont know consider it done with dang at the line with three shots after the foul our states have their moments where you think all right figuring it out thats evident by four wins in the ACC which is a rugged conference this year grant that it is down but still as you know broadcasting games throughout the year every game you go into an opposing gym its tough to win well you look at the ACC standings and everyones clumped right there you see those those three teams at the top Duke Clemson Louisville theyre separating theel but everybody else is kind of right there and let hand with team theyre usually long and athletic you know create offense with their defense but they have to be able to move the basketball create opportunities for their scores in the half court skip pass by hand to Brown shook his Defender and hes got another two Dion Brown is a smooth shooter but his confidence is waning in the early stages of the year what a pass and the dunk to you and thats outstanding job by dayquon Davis and John going back to Deion Brown if Im Brown Im just playing basketball I cant worry about my confidence I have to go out there and play if I make it if I miss it get back on defense continue to play and a turnover turnover on BC we will head to our first timeout lock to the 10 its February 1st welcome to winner yeah were not escaping any snowflakes in Syracuse theres 2T of snow on the ground so this is light right here in Boston this is a vacation for you ex seals with another substitution Christian Neu on the floor wearing 11 in Black Jamir Watkins their point guard hounded by Dion Brown Ain Davis you in the weak side rebound transferred from Old Miss and an offensive foul says Jeff pawn pawn part of the officiating crew of Eric Lewis and Clare Aubrey on Watkins is first second on the team with Roger McFarland bound Watkins is ultra aggressive and that sometimes provides issues well you see on that last possession it was Zero passes just off the pick and roll defense already set he drives in there he has bodies everywhere its hard to be able to score like that now this guy right here hes been scoring the basketball at a high rate we know Donald Han Jr is going to be able to score the basketball but its crucial for Boston College to get guys like brown and Beetle to be aggressive offensively and they match three pointers with Watkins providing the optimal distance and 39 from three one of the most improved players in the ACC that an injury to deal with a torn ACL come back with the Vengeance Beetle the Clemson transfer foran long range yes sir Donald H Jr is a guy who is not shy when the ball comes into his hands one of the best Shooters in the ACC he made five of eight from three against North Carolina last Saturday D2 in the post for Yan Watkins and the board for hand here come the Applause Eagles another three kept Alive by Dion Brown Applause good pass by hand to BR Penning gets it back and barrels down the lane for a foul foul Donald Han doing a good job finding the open spot Corner three bucket he says I got one more for you at the top of the key coming off the down screen knocking it down again donalan Jr one of the best shoot ERS in the ACC yeah those numbers tell a big story for hand thats the second foul on Florida States Malik euan fourth on the team with venning at the line venning shooting just 62 from the free throw line now played a lot of basketball in your career at Syracuse and overseas Chad Vin get 17 points and one rebound against North Carolina last week one rebound for a big guy how does that happen yeah not going to cut it its just at that size you got to be able to create space just with your body and just going after the ball Rebound in the basketball is about effort and when youre 610 270 lbs you should be getting more than one rebound thats all about effort and just being aggressive going after the basketball hes been an excellent addition for old grants Eagles since he got him from St Applause bonovich Justin Thomas in the game for Leonard Hamilton Jaden Hastings called for a foul what happened there well you see John Boston College is honestly doing a good job of just being active defensively Florida States playing side to side now you want to get the side to side movement then when you see the opening you want to be able to attack those gaps and get downhill but Boston College doing a good job just staying in front except right there jir Watkin just being aggressive to the basket hes such a powerful presence Watkins 67 210 lbs but plays downhill just getting downhill on the Baseline and mcfar said hey Im going to get out of the way jir Watkins thats what you have to do when youre 67 25 if you see that opening attack the Gap and just be aggressive at the basket opportunity for two free Applause throws foul was on Roger McFarland his second Applause coming up next at 4 Eastern on acc Network the Commonwealth clash between Virginia Tech and Virginia also SMU host Stanford to cap the night big night of basketball on accn axim Reno one of the top players in college basketball candidate for ACC Player of the Year leading the Stanford Cardinal kned off your orange the other night yeah I appreciate you letting me know that but I mean heck of a player its either between him and Cooper flag with the ACC player of the year two of the top players in the country not only the ACC Eric Lewis former NBA official calls a foul its on Justin Thomas first on Thomas fourth on the nlls as the Eagles will inbound Joshua Beetle on the floor with Fred Payne Deion Brown Donald H and Jaden Hastings AJ switon in the game for Florida State Turn Around by Hastings and here Applause comes maluke and John even right there on that last possession for Hasting use your big body get leverage and then go up strong youre fading away from the rim two feet from the basket Florida State grabs the lead thanks to AJ swintons threepointer averaging 10 minutes per game and two points swins another talented forward and it seems like you got 67 67 68 611 with every single player on Florida State but leard Hamilton always has a talented group and AJ sns another one of those guys second on Jaden HS second tallest team in the nation behind Duke Duke has the slight Edge Elon in Florida State locked in the two spot with Illinois and IND Indiana not far behind the length of Florida State Leonard Hamilton since hes been in Tallahassee has always recruited shop blockers theyre not only athletic and Tall but theyre mobile theyre active they can move and we know letter Hamilton Florida State teams they create offense from their defense getting up in the passing Lanes getting deflections block shots and Steals and those this is another year where Florida States leading the ACC in blocks and Steels wide open underneath was Boston Holtz whose grandmother loved Boston thats why they named him Boston but they named him with a Y I love Boston but were going to make a little change well put the Y in instead of the O as the nolles are riding a seven to nothing run foul on Thomas is second Leonard Hamilton the best coaches in the country year in and year out fourth all time in ACC regular season wins and they Define consistency for so many years but this year has been a challenge so I got to talk to L Hamilton I I did a game down in Florida State when they played Syracuse and just listening to some of his stories and you know his knowledge of the game just to be a fly on the wall and in those conversations you youre just going to learn a whole bunch and Leonard Hamilton fourth win is coaching ACC conference history one of the greatest to do it h good pass for Jackson well Florida State running with some heat at a N9 nothing run well you see the ball movement right there Jackson got into a Sprint into the pass and just attacked the Gap two feet in the paint easy floater at The Rim BR to the Baseline Nifty move by Deion Brown this is what Boston College needs from Deon Brown attack the basket strong body create opportunities for yourself at The Rim if you dont make it you got opportunity at the free throw line HT take around beetle too much contact says Eric Lewis and a foul B Chad Benning second we will go to a timeout you see on your screen staying white thats what theyre looking for and we talked to our guy Chuck before the game he said if they have almost equal number of assists assists and made baskets thats a good sign for Florida State great start to the game for them yeah Chuck Walsh Mr your stats for FSU great sports information director M cpre doing a great job for BC as well Boston old at the line after the foul on Penning BC six and five at home their last home win was their last win overall when they beat Miami on New Years Day that was a comeback win when they Trail by as many as 19 largest home comeback Victory ever in program history but you know many years playing the JMA wirer Dome used to be the carrier him you didnt defend home court you were going to have a long year and and now with the conference standings just how they are John its only 10 games left after this game is 10 games every game means something to every single team one or two losses one or two wins could drop you in five spots in the standing or could put you up five spots in the standing so every single game means something to both teams yeah BC One and8 one spot above Miami whos last in the conference bottom three teams do not make the ACC tournament Donald H for three thats his third three of the game hes got nine Applause points Donalds just been on a leer shooting the ball with extreme confidence when he doesnt have the open look hes attacking the basket he playing at a high level for Boston Applause College Deon Brown at the point looking for Kelly but instead he finds hand eagles with four guards on the floor Henning flx and he coughs it up here comes Chandler Jackson on the break for Neu Clare Aubry calls a foul that was a bunny for NE to still a foul though on Fred Payne first eighth on the team and need to at the line joh is started on the other end if Im venting I got to be able to get low post position use your strong body get lower get by the rim have a better opportunity and then if you miss it if you turn over you have to bust your butt back hes lucky that he missed that opportunity at The Rim chance for an and one Applause right here you just got to get lower position be strong with the ball and then you got to run back see NE to running the floor Rim running and opportunity at The Rim it should have been a and one but an opportunity to go one for two right here at the Applause line threepoint Florida State lead aler Malo back in the lineup replacing Christian Neu in the problematic stretch for the Eagles on the sixgame losing skid points in the paint 42 for the opposition thats numbers magnified yielding 84 points per outing its just has not been pretty really theyve been struggling on both ends until North Carolina they seem to get back on track offensively but defensively when youre showing that many points in the paint it its really about keeping your guy in front of you Applause and Baseline activity Clair Aubrey says Florida State ball but an inability to finish here it was a good defense right there by Davis and just find a a crease in Fred Payne yeah he just has to finish Fred Payne has actually been given good minutes for Boston College just a grit a hustle type of guy but have to finish those opportunities at The Rim coaching sta loves Fred pin hes one of the hardest workers on the team six and a half points per game shooting 44 foul on Chad venning and one thing that Earl Grant told us yesterday when we spoke to him was Donald Han is the most industrious player he has hes in the gym at 630 every morning putting up shots theres a reason why hes become one of the best scorers in the league and I and I tell guys all the time I so I work with younger kids at home uh with basketball development and they ask hey how can I get minutes on the floor well compete at a high level and play as hard as you can and then youre going to give yourself a chance you could be the most talented guy in the court but if youre not competing at a high level and youre selling yourself short only four men in the top 21 points per game in rebounds Yan another one of those playing today hes had some quiet moments though he has to be a double double guy for Florida State to have success at that size with that skill athleticism and be able to move how he does theres no reason you should be shooting four shots a game you should never end a game one for four with two points not as talented as he is and hes still on the bench for lonard Hamilton hes only played five minutes thus far the runner by Kelly Leak out for Florida State Watkins no he can run downhill but can also hit from three eightpoint lead largest of the yeah well you talked about his Improvement as a shooter I know this past summer he spent hours and hours in the gym working on that jump shot and you see the Improvement this season for Florida State take by hand and a foul on the SS but good ball movement too by the nlls good Baseline Drive finding Watkins on the open Corner three hes a guy that prefers to be aggressive to the rim get to the free throw line at a high clip but this year he has an improved jump shot and hes shown you early in this game two shots for Donald hen as Watkins sits with eight points and John at some point if Im Donald Han Jr if you let two three possessions go by where Im not getting a shot up Im talking to my teammates Im telling them I need the ball youre the guy that needs the ball in your hands you have to be aggressive Im not saying force it but you have to be able to get a play attack in the rim and not settling Donald Han Jr he hes the guy for Boston College he has to be able to have the ball in his hands he has 10 of their 20 points at the line put up 17 shots against North Carolina that 26point outing so hes off to another good start but HEC needs more production from other players the complimentary scoring has been in short supply 100 And I say all that but they still need Beetle they need Deon Brown these guys have to be consistent if they want to get wins Davis the take what a move and maluk missed the flush Davis did the hard part splitting the defense just leaving points on the board right there thats an easy finish at the rim and and Davis the board another hop skipping a jump up for grabs 5050 ball Luke takes it good Hustle by the nolles good Hustle but sloppy theres two opportunities for Davis at The Rim Point Blake and miss both of them theres a good shot by jir Watkins his big day continues hes in double figures with 10 BC has missed nine of its last 11 shots they havent scored scored in more than 3 minutes and when all fails give jir Watkins the ball let him attack the basket pay three is that a good idea thats thats a terrible idea if youre Boston College you have to be able to get Ball moving see Watkins right here doing what he does best just attacking the lane and 1000 Point Club in his Florida State Career had a prolific scoring career as well Virginia Commonwealth good acquisition of the portal by Leonard Hamilton and his staff and you and I said during the break BC still searching for an offensive identity what do they have to do to be better well BC it starts with being able to get some ball movement but when you get venny back in the game you want to be able to get him some touches in the post and try to be able to play inside out but get some ball movement create some opportunities where you can find some driving lanes and then hopefully get some drive and kick opportunities Relentless work off the boards by Watkins and hes slapped from behind by Jaden Hastings Brown almost traveled Beetle ran into the defender switon fou fouls on AJ switon is first seventh on the team one and one so handen Brown providing the offense again rest of the team problematic theres Donald Han on the bench as the Eagles TR by eight with 729 to play in the half and John another way to be able to create some offense is do it with defensively by getting block shots getting some steals you saw hting great block and they were able to get out in transition get some early opportunities at The Rim you see Fred pay yeah pay threepointer no again theyre doing the hard part grabbing the loose ball on defense pay trying to trigger the offense off of it but it didnt happen now when you get it you have to be able to make a decision a good decision Chad venning on the BC bench with a toe problem he is eligible to return so thats a a loss for the Eagles John if Im if Im vening Im trying to play through that toe injury yeah venning averaging 13 points four rebounds first on the team with 29 blocks NE to the take her out Hastings but hes blocked good d by Jaden Hastings who has a bright future for the Eagles and this is what Jaden Hastings bring right here just just more mobile more athletic than Benning and hes capable of getting block shots getting Steals and then running the floor after you block the shot or get a steal rim run get an opportunity for yourself at The Rim hes a 54 field goal shooter Jaden Hastings in limited opportunities savaging three and a half points that will come they feel his offense will come joh it will come right now just play your role be aggressive defensively and then be around the rim when you get opportunities go up Joshua Beetle and Jeff Pawn official calls a foul and I think he got NE to 11 and if Im Beetle I just have to be aggressive especially when I have a big guy close out on me in the corner look to get into the lane if you dont have your opportunity draw the defender and make a decision for your Applause teammate BC is a team at 72 this is our next gymnastics meet here on hccn in the ESPN F tomorrow afternoon number eight Cal squares off against number 21 NC State in Raleigh coverage begins at four Eastern one Pacific John especially with this four guard set that BCs play youre going to have opportunities to be able to drive and get into the lane and create opportunities not only for yourself but for your teammates eagles with a modup of full court pressure you like that they have to figure out a way to mix it up how how can they create turnovers and turn that into easy opportunities on the offensive side of the ball just be active defensively use your speed and try to mix it up Deion brown with an athletic foul trying to BL blocked the shot this is impressive yeah just be aggressive at The Rim you see Jackson right there going up strong and aggressive two things are going to happen youre either going to get blocked or youre going to get fouled Chandler Jackson the Junior from Memphis 7 1 12 points per game shooting 79 from the line both teams not shooting well Florida State 30 8 BC 33 Eagles have made four for 10 from distance but theres been droughts for both squats and John going back to your point about BC you dont want to have to play against a a set Florida State Defense in the half court every single time with that length and athleticism they have to be able to find ways to create turnovers defensively and then try to get transition opportunities on the other end BC is not out of field goal Eric in the last 5 minutes and 10 seconds Florida state is Led for more than 7 minutes you see how far Florida States pushing BC out on the perimeter McFarland with his first three of the game being active trying to get into those driving lanes and create the defense to be able to suck in a little bit but you have an opportunity for an open threepoint shot McFarland good job stepping up and just knocking it down they need more offense from him just his 10th three of the season in 37 attempts Davis thought about the jab step skips it Swinton man hes got a smooth shot yeah swin hes just another one of those those talented long athletic not getting much time this season but when he when hes got opportunities to get in the game hes took advantage of it McFarland again good look didnt Applause fall Hastings Tangled to the back court but Davis the drive and McFarland finds Donald Han Fred Payne for three open looks open looks but you have to be able to knock him down and on the other end right here youre just letting guys get by you like that to the pain every single time Blow by Chandler Jackson hits the deck AJ swin in the three moments ago for the nlls Eric AJ swin we talked about his limited time but when your number is called you have to be able to step up and he steps into that three and knocks it down Boston College has to be aware of Shooters out on the floor be there on the shot Chad venning off the toe injury getting set to check in theres Malik Ying on the bench accs feasted with 16 and me more than eight boards per game and those seven double doubles but just only 5 minutes not sure if its an injury or what but just 5 minutes played also had his second foul at the 1406 Mark so thats thats a problem yeah obviously you dont want to get into any more foul trouble but I think what leard Hamilton really needs froming is for him just to be aggressive again you have the size you have the skill you have the mobility just be aggressive at The Rim when youre aggressive when youre being a threat youre just going to create opportunities not only for yourself but for your teammates after the foul on hand one of two at the line for the nlls beetle Hing the point right now you got to see right Benny right now you got to see him Payne tries to knife through the defense foul on dayon Davis his second noul ninth of the team Rus anastasios Rosas part of your all name team its one of those ones you woke up with a nightmare can I say this name correctly yeah and Im going to leave it to you Im Im going go after you say it then Im going to repeat it in my head and hopefully get it right the next time you say it in the mirror three times anastasios rosak rosak Kus there you go I I got it you can call him number nine now number nine in these parts theres only one number nine thats Teddy ball game Ted Williams there you go rosak Applause Kus well done youre coachable beheim was right about you Thomas Luke the Baseline around Chad venning you see right now maluk just using his quickness and his Mobility to go by vening but right now on this end Boston College has to see vening has the advantage they have to get the ball to him hindered by a toe injury Beetle shaking three but a wild shot he gets up slowly tracked down and the lay in by mcfallen so instant energy by Roger McFarland thats good news but still off kilter on the offensive end well the these last few possessions you saw venning had the mismatch two times in a row Beetle had his head down he didnt even see it step back Watkins has been hot and the rebound well John he can get that shot any time you you got to get some ball movement create opportunities driving Lanes to get to the basket thats a shot right there that you can get any single Applause time good defense by Watkins punched away from hand here comes the Applause NOS drive by and Payne pcks it up deep three and wow he led that from downtown Boston well you know what nothing else is going right so give the ball to me and just let me shoot it hes been shooting the ball at a high clip impressive range for Donald H is fourth three of the game threepoint Florida State lead theyve R for the majority but Carolina might not be having their best year you know tonight will still be a heck of a game yeah John first off what is he doing with the RJ Davis Jersey on at a at a Boston College Florida State I I just want to yeah Rand I want to get that one out of out of the way he knew he was going to be on TV if you wore exactly but this is another one of those games dup in North Carolina where we can really throw the records out we were talking about off air its kind of like the Michigan Ohio State game in college football when these two teams get together it just means a little bit more to both teams to both uh programs and Im sure itll be another one tonight just like that its a mustat on ESPN at 630 and Thomas hits the triple for Florida Applause State theyve made five threes and eight attempts Beetle shy you know hes doing good work penetrating in the lane but the shots on fall and you want Beetle to be aggressive if he has an early opportunity semi transition you want to see that but if its in half court you want to get some ball movement two three four passes and then attack off that Beetle has missed three shots he has two points hands been the story but miss that one for three now if youre Donald Han yeah you can shoot the ball the devendorf green light Jackson off angled Banks it in matches their largest lead of the game and just something that Boston College has been struggling with through this six game losing streak giving up almost 84 points a game but almost 50 of those points are in the paint just keeping your def keeping your guy in front of you not letting him get by and then if he does having bodies there to make it tough at The Rim McFarland had his moments High entry pass for venning and just beat the shot Glock ball still Applause loose its off of BC so another good idea but Chad venning could not convert well heres my thing right here you give it to him with five 5 seconds on the shot clock you got to give it to him with some time on the shot clock so he has room to operate and make a decision this this these last three four possessions they havent even been looking at Ven and you got to try to establish some inside out if youre Boston College Chad venning hasnt scored in the last 13 and a half minutes Jackson misses paying the rebound really hasnt even been getting the opportunity BCs guards have to do a better job of getting them to Applause Music Applause basketball right here theyre just staging they look like theyre confused Applause offensively theres a three for Fred pay so despite the stagnation he hits the triple and Neato couldnt handle the pass ball also a swing here in the final 5 Seconds of the half with less than a second remaining well it always helps when the play breaks down and then you hit a shot like that good effort by pay but Off the Mark and half time hits in chestn Hill an up and down first half stay with those 10 points but he did miss the seven threes what are your keys to the second half for both teams if Im Boston College I need to find a way to get venning involved offensively Florida State just continue to move the ball theyve been getting good looks at The Rim they just have to be able to convert Brown the open three transfer from Maryland Baltimore County and the steel on the other end for Deon Brown and thats a good look for Deion Brown you have to be able to take those opportunities when theyre given HEC has Joshua beo Roger McFarland Dion Brown and Donald H on the back court Chad venning up front pocket pass by Brown of venning lost his skill in the post and here comes Florida Applause State John venning had Davis on him when he caught the ball in the paint and decided to pass the ball out you have to be able to go up BC only six first half Point points they averag 32 per game and thats a glaring number well you see Beetle he just has to be able to recognize a little bit earlier when venning is open and right now he has the mismatch on Swit you have to be able to find a way to get him the ball beetle trying to go around Jackson but our first foul the half on Chandler Jackson is first right here you just have to be and vening has to do a better job of sealing and getting into swe and bodies sting body so he could create a good pass for Applause Beetle Le Yuan back on the FL floor for Florida state had two fouls in the first half their second leading scorer at four first half points see him guarding McFarland trying to keep him out of foul trouble not guarding vening if Im Boston College Im letting mcfar getting the ball and attack him here comes Yan the spin move and hes got two thats what theyre looking for right yeah thats just something with that Yu adds he or just has his skill set is be able to dribble the ball from the perimeter put it down and get into a spin move and finish at The Rim but he has to be aggressive you cant be soft if youre 611 venning spin around Watkins for two Boston College has to continue to feed him they got jir Watkins guarding him hes giving up 60 70 lbs you got to give venning the ball down there first points for venning since 1406 remained in the first half Benning has five Eagles shooting 35 Ls 41 Davis down the lane and hes Applause hacked foul on Chad venning is second Yan just using his skill set showing them putting vening in the spin cycle and finishing with the right handed the rim and Boston College has to be able to find vening on the offensive side this half he had the advantage against Watkins and hes able to get it and finish at The Rim venning second in the ACC and field goal percentage of 56 Dayco Davis The Freshman from Baltimore tonight an e at 8 Eastern after a mens basketball triple header the nothing but neth crew breaks down the day and night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game look ahead the best match ups on the schedule for next week weve got you covered all season on acc Network and the ESPN John we were talking to coach Grant on the zoom yesterday and defensively he he was really encouraging his guys to communicate but trust one another you saw in that last possession the heide defense was all over on the other side and Davis just was able to cut down the middle and get an opportunity at the basket you have to be able to communicate and talk and a kickball far a state possession in the shadows of Earl Grant on your screen right over his right shoulder was Dana baros 2000 Point scorer at BC One of the greats to play in Chestnut Hill in a sterling NBA career he could definitely fill it up they could use a day to bearrows about right now thats for sure Chandler Jackson too strong from three but the rebound kept Alive by Yan Watkins doubled by hand and brown works out of it but an offensive foul on jir Watkins thats his second and if youre Florida State when you get a second chance opportunity you got to be able to take advantage of it it was a good call right here just use an arm to wrap around on hand to clear offensive foul Eagles coming off a game where they had 20 assists last Saturday at North Carolina they have six today uh no mistake was probably one of their best offensive performances of the whole season 96 points in the overtime loss they said they wanted to play probably Tuesday or Wednesday they didnt like the week off ear Grant said it was a long week of practice schedule is the schedule but probably if you come off that type of loss Eric you youve been around the block you know that that that needs to get out of your spin cycle early exactly you want to try to get that one out of your head and get on to the next one and get a clean slate but if youre Bost in college offensively get some ball movement and yeah we know McFarland is capable of shooting the three but hes not a guy that you want taking that many threes in the game hes more of a downhill Drive guy and create opportunities for his teammates good pass by you and that was special Sting the beneficiary and when you hings locked in hes one of the most skilled centers not only in the ACC but in the country be able to pass the ball put it on the ground shoot it and then work in the mid post area Brown keeps it alive off the beetle Miss Beetle thought about it Benning gets it back tries the power and hes fouled BC will have a chance at the line but first Yan highlight film pass 17 minutes the ball game tell you what BC has to get in control offensively theyre being careless with the ball theyre juggling the ball we talked about getting Ving the basketball early in the shot clock you have to create some type of inside out and being able to give vening the ball and just let him be aggressive towards the rim is going to create more opportunities for Boston College offensively look at those numbers 1680 points foric dorf one more year you would have had well over 2000 yeah I I you know what I like to shoot the ball done and you did it well you did it well I appreciate you foul on Chad venning is third team second was there ever a point where Jim beheim and his staff said Eric stop shooting never that thats why I love Coach B it was actually times where he said son I need you to shoot the ball and then I I needed No More Words that was it I was going to do it when you told me not to but if youre telling me to all right Im letting that thing go dont tell him twice Y is Florida State its largest lead of the game as venning sits on the bench Leonard Hamilton if he win today will be his 197th ACC Victory its an unbelievable coach Hall of Fame career but for both teams John who whos going to be a guy besides jir Watkins or besides Donald H Jr to step up and make some Applause plays Dion Brown he was one of those guys for BC against North Carolina beetle with the three thats his first three hes only put up two Clemson transfer cuts it to a Sixpoint NOS lead and thats a great execution Deion Brown driving hard to the basket two feet in the paint collapsing the defense get an opportunity for a drive and kick this is the Malik Y and you expect to see throughout the game hes got some confidence now it doesnt have to be anything complicated if Im 611 at that size Im just being aggressive towards the basket youre going to have opportunity to score or youre going to have the opportunity to get to the foul line and he has a handle like a guard punched out of bounds and its Florida State Applause ball just a great job by Dean Brown just attacking y KN he can get by two feet in the paint which creates a drive and kick opportunity and beetles stepping into it knock it down simple basketball Nifty dribbling by dayquon Davis saluting pressure finds Watkins Yan on Jaden Hast industrious off the offensive glass again for youan third times a charm from Florida State Im just continuing to go back to it and thats all you has to do just be aggressive going after the basketball and youre going to create opportunities for yourself McFarland navigates thats what you want to see from him thats more of McFarlands game getting downhill using your strong body getting into the lane creating opportunities at The Rim Davis skips it for Watkins boy the opportunities are plentiful for North car or from Florida State they are taking advantage I tell you what if jir Watkins continues to improve the jump shot hes already an NBA Prospect but if he can shoot the ball at a consistent rate hes just going to shoot up those draft boards even more give himself more of an opportunity at the next level Davis the step back they are on fire thats three of their last three five of the last seven to build their largest lead of the game Brown missed the bunny Jackson double team and Clare Aubrey calls a foul fouls on Jaden Hastings huans aggressive Im Malik you and every time I get the basketball Im being aggressive put my shoulder in his chest just continuing to go up if I miss it go after it again give myself another opportunity and finally Music converts get back home and pop on that so uh tell me the spot again sorry I dont know if were violating any rules yeah were going to keep it between us we got it we got it yes this youll find no shortage of good Italian restaurants in the area well Boston is uh one of the better cities in America our College sha MCD calls it the greatest city in America he also calls Syracuse the Harvard of the north the Harvard of Central New York I think I believe so okay yes he does I said Sean you have that wrong itha is the Harvard of central but you could go with it if you like if youre a new house Applause gra Davis at the Applause line Florida state has built its largest lead because of why oh because theyre able to get out and play at their pace and then Malik Yuan has got involved theyve got him the ball in the post hes looking to be aggressive and attack the hoop and thats what he needs to do hes one of the most skilled bigs in the ACC in the country really just be aggressive towards the rim youre going to be able to create opportunities for yourself but this guy right here Davis is is another guy that letter Hamilton really likes just a tough toughminded guard a young freshman but hes another guy that Florida state has has an option offensively yeah hes a good building block that was a good recruit a Baltimore his hand get flustered in the post but fouled its on Boston hul his first Malik Yuan on the bench but he has been a load for BC to handle in the second half with eight points after a quiet first half with two fouls the Eagles have only scored eight second half points they Trail by five at halftime the last game it was kind of an anomaly for Malik Yuan two points one for four from the field if Im Malik un and Im not in foul trouble I should be getting 15 plus shots a game and thats just me being out there being aggressive calling for the basketball hes too skilled a basketball player to only get four shots in a Applause Applause game Holt tried to split a double team but hands got it Here Comes Florida State Applause Thomas thought about a three but a foul and that will bring us to a timeout Florida State hot second half BC not so much shooting just 25 youre likely going to end up losing yeah and I think a for BC has been replacing Jaden Zachary and heres a steal by Dion Brown and he misses the dunk my Applause goodness wow yeah and that just kind of sums up the Boston College season so far you make a good play on the defensive end and then you miss a wide openen opportunity at the rim and those are the guys Deon Brown Josh VTO that really need to be able to step up for BC offensively and then he end up getting the shot clock violation and thats the type of play thats hard to erase as Deion Brown denies the ball and steals it and what he just miss time his jump you just miss you just missed the dunk you go up two hands make sure its secure and its nothing fancy just get to two Applause points especially at this point John its not like youre up 13 youre down 13 right you need the bucket make the easy play Jackson punched Away by Hastings thats good hands right there by Hastings but every single time Florida state is getting in that paint theyre just putting pressure on the BC bigs to either foul or try to make a play Chaz Kelly with his first bucket hes had limited minutes for Earl Grant penil in as a starting point guard at the beginning of this season but its been a struggle I think hes just trying to rotate guys in and and find out who can contribute its about Kelly and brown and Beetle somebody has to step up and separate themselves time out Florida State we will take a 3 second timeout come right back and get out of that morass of the bottom three teams in the ACC who do not make the ACC tourament in Charlotte yeah we talked about in the beginning of the broadcast those first three teams teams have really separated themselves from everybody but everyone elses two three wins or losses of jumping up five spots are going down five spots so every single game means a lot to these teams Donald H controls for the Eagles hes had a quiet second half he has 16 beond Brown for McFarland pretty good look the rebound by Watkins with its still stagnant theres no ball movement theres no side to side motion you know creating opportunities to drive and BC has to have a little bit more urgency now offensively where conversely Florida state has 10 assists on 18 makes thats percentage that Leonard Hamilton can live with right any team when youre having good ball movement when you have your assists almost the same as your field goal is made youre going to get better opportunities shots at the rim and Boston College hasnt done that and Florida state has fouls on Swit his second fifth on the team McFarland to the bench Fred Payne in the lineup for the Eagles good point though on the inability of BC to establish any offensive consistency Music and the turn around yes and again John its a its a tough shot hes a tough shot maker but you cant sustain with those shots throughout the game you have to get some easy opportunities some easy looks its just hard to play basketball like that having to make tough shot after tough shot yanss made a few tough shots in the second half not that time asting saves it good Hustle by Hastings to Brown and the three and hes got it Donald ham with five straight points and some energy for the Eagles and you just cant say enough about Donald H Jr you talked about him being the first guy in the gym every single day just been having an unbelievable Applause season in BC its not going well but Donald Han JR says put the ball in my hand Im going to make a tough shot and then coming down hand off from pay top of the key knocking it down we talked about him shooting 55 from three over his last five games and hes continuing to be on fire from three Donal Hs father a star at Virginia in the late 90s Watkins at the line after the third foul on Dion Brown and the Miss Watkins at the line with 13 points one of two NS and double figures Yan has 12 little meditation at the line and it pays off Im going back to my point about BC Donald H Jr hes going to keep you in the game hes going to make tough shots hes going to shoot threepointers but to win basketball games you have to find offense from somebody else complimentary scoring for the Eagles has not been prevalent Brown rebound pain good Follow by Fred Payne well even buckets like that John just Hustle bus uh buckets offensive rebounds diving on the floor just create opportunities for your Applause teammates far State led by as many as 15 pivot foot by Davis youan on Hast five to shoot Wheeling over the top and it goes out of Applause bounds and that brings us to a timeout so some energetic moments for PC the err of nil he seems like a new team every single year its just its just hard for teams to Applause navigate follows on on Brown is fourth seventh on the team Leonard Hamilton has some anxious moments one and one for jir Applause Watkins andard Hamilton 10 new players he says you know what we just its a new reality for all of us we have to deal with it they dont like it but its basically what youre dealing with now in college basketball well thats the thing its not just one team dealing with it its its everybody in college basketball dealing with so I tell you one thing John no ones feeling sorry for each other you know you got to figure it out you got to try to mess these guys in one year and see what you could do and a lot of that was prevalent when we saw coaching exes like Tony Bennett Jim Lona and Jay Wright reason why those guys departed maybe just tired yeah probably a little bit of both I think they started to see hey these guys are getting paid more than my assistant coaches its time for me to get out of here yeah not a bad living Fred Payne goes basine hes given BC some quality minutes and thats what ear Grant told us he likes his energy and the fact that he never gives up we talked about in the beginning you dont have to be the most skillful or talented guy its just how hard hard are you going to play how harder you can compete on that basketball court and Fred Paynes one of those guys he just competes at a high high level he has nine points the only averages seven Malik Yuan backing in on Hastings in contact foul on Jaden Hastings the red shirt freshman thats his fourth Hastings had good positions right there just caught with his hand in the cookie jar just playing straight up right there a guy like Malik Y is going to get to his spots you just have to make it tough for him when he gets there two shots for Yan s outscored the NS 21 to 20 in the second Applause half FL stay 72 from the line Chad venning back in for the foul played Applause Hastings Benny has six points and four rebounds hes playing with three Applause fouls hes only changed one time fla state has led for more than 26 minutes John two for BC see right now Malik Yan guard and Deon Brown Im seeing if I can get Deon Brown the ball and an opportunity to attack Malik Yuan thats another way to counter him offensively is attack him on the defensive side p with three to shoot three by Brown Zing weak side and he had position on Davis fouls on Davis John these are the opportunities youre going to have you see Malik you and guarded out on the perimeter theres nobody protecting the rim from Florida State or able to get rebounds like that have opportunities for vending in the post and second chance opportunities third foul on Davis Kelly inbounds and putting on his show but not that time what happened well right idea right there just out of control on the shot theyre not going to give you a foul on that Watkins trying to back in on Kelly and a foul right here yeah first of all Boston College you cant let a guy back you down from the threepoint line all the way into the paint you have to be able to stand your ground and talked about Earl Grant wanting the communication defensively where is the communication for Boston College fourth foul on Chad Benning Kelly his first now they now they shift it over to Kelly calling the foul on him venting remains at Applause three that was the right call and jir Watkins is is a guy who he almost forces you to follow him KH just with his his big body 67 215 hes going to be relentless at trying to get the ball to the basket creates angles with his strong body and almost forced to follow him when hes doing that more meditation at the line Im a fan Im a fan did you do that I do I you know what I try to get a little five to 10 minute meditation every morning just to kind of clear my head and get ready for the day I like it I didnt know that about you layback guy laid guy that Zen likee feeling you know back in the day of the Big E tournament I wouldnt I wouldnt have said Eric demon dorf is a Zen guy now all this came about after that so yeah you wouldnt have known that about me back then but I actually when I went back to school I took a a class at Syracuse a meditation class so that kind of got me getting into it and BC had trouble inbounding the ball so they needed a timeout Chaz Kelly had to take a time out that was a oh you you have to get open right you have to make it easy for Chaz Kelly and give him an opportunity to make a pass but how tough is it to lose a game not getting the ball in bounds all you had to do is in bounds they were going to follow you brown the three left it short inexcusable simply inexcusable they walked away with a heartbreaking loss to North Carolina prohibitive favorite Tar Heels had a chance to knock off a signature victory for Earl Grant and company and they could not close the deal and really the best offensive game they had all season the whole game they really played a good offensive offensive game defensively obviously they could have been better but all you have to do is get the basketball in right the coach can draw it up you have to execute it and you have to be able to get open Chaz Kelly guarded by jir Watkins Kelly from Houston that defensive pressure right there by Watkins got hand no shots says Clare Aubrey foul on the Applause noes and John even if you dont create a turnover if youre jir Watkins now youre just forcing a guy like Kelly to play fast at a speed that he doesnt want to play at now he has to make a decision he had nowhere to go that usually ends up in a tough shot got a Ballout call right there with Han junor get an opportunity at the free throw line but great ball pressure by jir Watkins third foul on Justin Thomas as Watkins heads to the bench Chandler Jackson in the nolles lineup and with 22 to lead all scores hes five of five at the line thats no surprise he leads the ACC at 90 on the season look Donald junr is doing all that he can doing everything I mean hes carrying the Lo for this Boston College team hes waiting for some of his teammates to step up and give him some help how about this no field goals in the last eight and A2 minutes for Florida State and they still lead by six points yeah it just goes to show you that no one else besides Donald H Jr is doing anything for boss of Applause college this is our next gymnastics meet here on accn in the ESPN F tomorrow afternoon number eight Cal going off against number 21 NC State Raleigh coverage begins at 4 Eastern one Pacific Line sh foul on venning is fourth with Jackson at the line that tells a huge story no field goals in eight and a half minutes and you still withstand the lead and the thing is John theyve had some opportunities theyve got some turnovers we talked about the Miss fast break break dunk by Dion Brown theyve had turnovers they turned it back over and gave it to Florida State so just missed opportunities when youre able to create offense from defense you have to be able to capitalize off that they have had 10 free throws since they have a sevenpoint Applause lead one timeout left for BC two for Florida State in the paint venning spinning Yan boxed him out he had expert positioning well if I have a 67 forward on me and Im Ving and Im 610 270 Im not fading away from the basket and when you see the double team come then you got to be able to make a decision to hit the open man y out of bounds remains Florida State ball and that brings us to another media timeout ACC mens basketball is minutes left last s FSU field goal to 1322 Mark since that point theyre 0 for seven theyve been 9 for 12 the line so very uneven but credit to them theyve been able to sty BC offensively and BC just not be able to take advantage of the turnovers that they create and then they come down here and then theyre following and putting to the free throw line but on the other end offensively they have to be bble to see the mismatch from Benning is down there good ball Movement by the Applause seminal Swinton now with 10 Music points and you are incredulous sitting here Courtside with me youre just wondering what the heck BC is doing on offense well and its a number of things right and Im shaking my head One V you outweigh the swin by 80 lbs seal and get your position and hold them there yeah and then Beetle you have to be able to create a passing angle so you can get him the ball earlier rather than late because like you said later swins going to be able to get around use his quickness and athletic ability to take it away but BC just isnt seeing it early enough setting so they do get it to the big guy it doesnt work well youre 610 270 youre playing like 62 180 and you catch the ball have some leverage be big there was no reason to even throw that pass catch it be patient and then see what opens up for Applause you Beetle trying to go behind his back and out of bounds BC ball with three seconds to shoot but Another Empty possession just bad decision making by the guards thats why we go back to Jaden zacker hes actually for Clemson that was a huge loss when they lose him at point guard and off the glass and he beats the shot clock what a day for Donald hand career high 6 three pointers John might as Applause well he might as well get him up and basketball is a simple game do you have the jump shot do you have the pass make it simple BC guards are making it more complicated than it has to be and with 52 points in his last two games 26 today Davis trying to split the D wow that was special dayquon Davis what a handle just tough hard nose Baltimore guard putting his head down getting to the rim not afraid of the contact Fearless at The Rim finishing pain trying to equal it instead its going the other way foul on BC John hes from Baltimore we talked about the citys like Detroit Baltimore hes a hardnosed guy hes not afraid of contact at The Rim he has a heart of a line talked about letter Hamilton loves this guy and just how hes Fearless on both ends of the Court especially at the point guard position at that size you have to play with that Fearless mentality you play with a few Baltimore guys I played with a few Baltimore guys a few Philly guys oh yeah that Baltimore Philly Detroit you have that grit that that fearlessness and a chip on your shoulder you just have to have that especially at that size at any size you have to be able to play like that Chaz Kelly in the eagle lineup with Boston Holt at the line those of you tuning in to see Virginia Tech in Virginia coming up next on accn with West dur and Dan B two misses big ones for H as we approach the twominute Mark BC has to play with some urgency right now offensively either get to the basket get an opportunity at The Rim or get the ball into the hands of Donald H Jr look out brown saves it at half court almost the backourt violation good save by Bing and no Watkins doubled underneath comes up with a huge rebound its almost like besides Donald H When anybody on BC gets the ball they dont know what to do with it DC out rebounded 42 33 Watkins has seven of those for the NES as they kill some clock Applause two seconds to shoot Davis Off the Mark here comes Han Kelly had pain elex to take it himself and he missed the layup my goodness wow high percentage misses by BC a big story of their season but but even when youre attacking the basket its almost like a hesitant attack its not an aggressive attack like go there and to score the B bball right here he its just a little bit of hesitancy right there and a blown left hand layup you got to go aggressive looking the score attack in the basket if you miss it hopefully you get an opportunity at the free to probably factoring in from a mental perspective hes thinking too much about it thinking too much thinking about making a mistake you cant play basketball second yourself this guy right here goodness is not going to second guess himself just give Donald H junr the ball if youre boss of college just a outstanding shooting display by hand ties his career eye with 29 Points and how he made this I have no idea just off balance right there you know what thats one of those shots where youre really feeling yourself and as many times we think Boston College is out the game theyre back in it only down five with 48 seconds left yeah the Eagles have had a flurry of counter punches theyre going to see if his foot was on the line review to see if thats a three or twoo field goal as you just heard clear Aubrey with the description well take a look yeah it looks like he was on the line thats going to end up being a opportunity for a threepoint play play has been overturned its a twopoint field goal coming up next at for Easter on acc Network the Commonwealth class between Virginia Tech and Virginia will join it in progress and also SMU host stamp to cap the night so just a two for hand which means he has 28 one shy of his career high but he will be at the line trying to complete the threepoint play one timeout left for the Eagles two for the noes to build on your point after all this they still have a chance to win Florida State led by as many as 15 well after he knocks down this free throw Boston College has to press up and hopefully you dont have to foul yet but you have to try to create a turnover Han has scored the last AP BC points Jackson runs the Baseline finds Watkins trying to get through pain but a foul much to the shagrin barl grant its on Fred Payne what do you think ER was a good job right there by we got to cut the Baseline off right there but I didnt really see a foul on anyone if anything was looked like a carry questionable with Watkins at the line L States making a living at the line 33 attempts theyve made 24 of them BCs been line 16 times knocking down 13 just goes to show you how aggressive Florida state has been attacking the basket and trying to get to the rim Applause really John they left the door open a couple times get to the line but not make it yeah theyve had the nine misses Watkins with 18 Yan has 14 and Swit has 10 hands 29 for BC but after that just seven each from Brown and McFarland nine from Fred Payne Thom two big makes for jir Watkins Dustin Thomas back in for Florida State hit comes Applause Kelly VC just has to be assertive just try to get to there you go get to the rim be aggressive when you when you get downhill and youre aggressive youre more likely to get fouled than not fourth foul on dayquon Davis Eagles playing with foul s of their own but Kelly at the line one and Applause one foul on the SS Chandler Jackson thirdd two shots for pay DC BC got lucky right there but thats why theyre in the position they are Miss free throws we talking about not being able to get the ball in out of out of bounds these are things that you have to be able to convert and take advantage of well youre your 21st game youre at a point now where your offense should be much more cohesive cohesive and and just understanding what your role is on the team yeah you should have an identity good steal Eagles hustle continues Fred Payne hustle points for Payne whos been terrific and a timeout so the Eagles say hey you know what were not going away to your point Eric theyve just hung around hug around hug around they theyre waiting for that knockout punch as the counter punches continue but pain winning a 5050 and just hustle plays you know competing at a high level Fred Payne is get on the ground a little bit and get dirty dont be afraid to get hit in your chest and Fred Payne doing a great job of just doing the little things BCs only had seven turnovers 11 makers hes one of the best at finishing and creating at The Rim Louisville 9 one on the ACC 165 overall how about Chucky heurn for Pat Kelce what hes doing averaging more than six assists per game but BC with the inbounds and double and fouled fouls on Applause Watkins third on Watkins and at the line trying to establish a career high hes at 29 Points and its funny John when when youre having a good game when youre feeling good you have 29 Points you saw the Florida state guys asking for a travel theyre going to give you some of those calls when youre when youre playing that good and youre being aggressive getting to the rim and got to give credit to Donald Han Jr for continuing to play continuing to be aggressive and hes perfect from the line hes also had has a career high 31 points Donald hand outstanding nine for n at the line one possession game and a foul at half court on Fred Payne is that the right idea if you if you werent able to get the the turnover right away you got a foul and all Florida state has to do John is knock down free throws easier said than done Valiant comeback by BC it hands 31 points to the most by a BC Player this season Malik Yan hitting the first Yan has 15 and nine rebounds really came alive in this second half first half really nothing but just him being aggressive like we talked about makes it makes a big difference for Florida State and on Florida State right here Im getting him all the way back protecting the basket have free throw line pressure right here but you dont want to just let guys Blow by you two big makes for you and a reminder will be joining Virginia Tech of Virginia after our conclusion Che as Kelly for three RMS out Sting the we big side rebound but a steel by venning pays got two Eagles defense turning into offense and a foul unbelievable you see Chaz Kelly a good opportunity right there at a three but just continue to fight continue to play Benning keeping the ball alive Brown to pain and chance for a threepoint play right now pay is just changed this game by bringing high energy right bringing high energy when you come to the game what could I do coach play as hard as you can 14 points for Fred Payne hes been terrific huge part of BCs success second leading score behind hands 31 really all just off energy plays he hit a couple open shots in the first half but just him being active and bringing energy just his feistiness fullt pressure hand on the ball and Yan Applause fouled Austin the Third on hand so youan at the line Florida state has missed nine free throws theyre 28 of 37 you is 6 for six though God I used to love of to be able to get these extra points at the line at the end of the game please give me the ball so you can follow me theres a reason why you scored 1680 points at Syracuse Im running to that ball now we know the secret let it be told exactly by Eric dorf but cant say enough about what BC has done to stay in this game I mean theres many times in this game where they really could have just laid down and gave up but you got to credit the team but credit Fred Payne for really bringing the energy and creating turnovers and opportunities also credit Florida stay at the line their last six attempts in a great job of just coming in and really giving this Boston College team a lot of energy Here Comes Payne and blocked bending the board hes got two our state inbounding look out its stolen by Kelly puts up a three and hes got it Kelly hits a three with 37 seconds left my Music goodness cant say enough about Fred Payne right I mean hes really come in and and give Boston College a different type of energy and it seems like these other guys are really feeding off of it but Fred Payne he has done an unbelievable job of really Shifting the momentum to VC all right how do you defend this last 48 seconds well you just want to keep guys in front do not foul just making a tough Shot Hands Up I mean they got an inbounded full court theyre going to try to get it in and just try to go downhill and get an opportunity at the basket Here Comes Davis trying to go full length to the court out of bounds and that does it the Boston College Eagles have completed the morale his 15point comeback Chaz Kelly Music
