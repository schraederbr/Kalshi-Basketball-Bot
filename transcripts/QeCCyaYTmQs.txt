Glad theyre playing this game right before finals and its a treat for the fans Theyll have some fans here so itll be therell be some local local flavor in the stands and we are ready to get this one underway The Bears control the opening tip and we will see how this first ever meeting between these two Bay Area schools unfolds Pippen Hell get it back and nice feed inside and on the doorstep Unable to get it to go is Dor Here come the Penguins the other way They will look to push tempo averaging over 92 points a game early in their season Maderos Pass on the corner is touched and knocked out of bounds by Bell So Penguins allowed 13 to shoot A lot of ball movement for Dominican A lot of touches Kells going to have to stay with their head on a swivel and play pretty good defense against this team Losing his feet as OOA And here come the Bears off the turnover Bell sloppy pass was trying to get it to Ames Instead the Penguins take it away Its one thing the Bears have done very well this season Theyve not turned it over coach No much better assisted turnover than a year ago Contested three more fall The rebounds easily cheering pulled down by Camden But as you talk about Dominican playing fast Cal has really improved their pace as well They play with a much faster pace trying to get transition baskets every possession And Cal as you saw there its usual starting five and and one opportunity for Pitman to get the scoring going for this one And thats what Justin Pippen does He does it as well as anybody on this team He gets by you plays different speed hell get you up in the air Hell get the foul and the basket Hes really good adept at drawing fouls One one Pippen has just really played so well since transferring into this Calvar program They played at Michigan but hes night and day for what hes done with the Cal Bears Nice action to get the open look for Maderos on the baseline Well Maderos is a senior Theres quite a few seniors in this lineup So theyre veterans Theyre going to come in here and they play with some confidence And by the way coach all five of their starters have average double figures So they theyve got a lot of guys that can score Pass inside for Dort And thats the one thing that Dominican doesnt have They dont have size to match Thats going to be the challenge You mentioned their scoring ability but theyre going to have to laughter really try to match cheering up to Cal Cals a really high powered team as well with size Wilson in the corner Wilson keeps the dribble alive now Best unable to get it to go Comes up with the rebound somehow Throws it up Lot of contact No whistle And the Bears come out of there with the basketball cheering Pippen hurries it up the floor Pippen took a little contact and the refs are letting him play Hes trying to draw a foul The trailing three is no good by Jeffrey Well that give Jeffrey that shot Thats not his strength Hes more of an inside post score Very disciplined This is only his third threepoint attempt of the season Back again inside the door Couple of moves Cant get it to finish though So Cal getting some good looks but not seeing a lot of them drop early This is Dominicans second game this year against a D1 school A corner three is no good by Wilson Here come the Bears And the alleyoop connection will not work But there it put back bucket to get the Bears their first second chance points as Camden Yeah thats going to be the challenge playing first shot defense and then rebounding for Dominican the Penguins They got to do a good job cheering there From the free throw line Sergeant Jeffrey Now thats his range and thats what he should thats where he should be shooting from And uh this is a team that knows their role So Ill be surprised if he takes a lot of threes this game And as I mentioned they played at Sacramento State They actually were the first team ever for the for the Hornets in the Nest to open up their new building Dor just nobody able to put a body on Dort now Its too too big and too strong Thats a nice lead pass up to Jeffrey though So the Penguins get two back quickly Yeah thats not going to please Mark Madson I mean you score a basket inside a layup and give up a transition basket That shouldnt happen Guards got to get back Pin dangerous pass Camden will take a three Too strong Follows his own miss Day eight just cant get it to go The Bears just four of 12 shooting And were going to get a whistle here to take us to the under 16 timeout Dominican hanging in early Its only a threepoint music game here in Berkeley local flavor Theyre right from down the road and so youre right before finals You know I dont think either team wants to travel very far but this is a good game I the Dominicans theyre going to travel and was a shot there I mean its a tight game and and these guys its fun for these teams to play I I really like it That was some nice baseline out of bounds action to get the three for Wilson Good play out of the timeout Really nice execution by Dominican Theyve got veterans on their team Camden gives it up for Elich Now Dorsy Expect both these teams to go very deep in their bench here Dorsy with the shot clock winding down throws up a prayer and Dominican has the ball and a chance to take the lead and theyll play fast And the corner jumper is good Long two and Dominican goes in front for the first time tonight Yeah theyll move the basketball Theyll make it tough on him That was a tough screen Maderos ran into the pullup jumper by Camden Wont fall And here come the Penguins cheering looking to add to the early lead Dangerous pass I dont think OOA realized he was going to be that open And then Wilson just comes in and takes the basketball back goal 10 and count the bucket and Dominican is suddenly in front by four Yeah And I I you know you can see this there Theres the steel little careless pass the dish for the basket Mark Matson going to his bench I think hes not pleased He wants he wants a little bit better ball movement He wants not not to be as impatient Theyre going to be able to get shots from the perimeter when they want I think he wants his squad to do what they did early in this game is work the ball and get some easy inside looks And so he went to his bench immediately and uh you know thats what the bench is a good motivator for David gets a message across but uh he wants to send that to his team and his team will respond Dorsy trying to go into the corner for Piting but knocked out of by Wilson Yeah you cant be in a hurry I mean youre going to have to be a little patient Dominican wants to get the ball off the goal They youre doing them a favor if you take quick early shots Macaus been shooting it so well that they kind of feel like they can get some shots early but think they can also get some shots inside And uh you know theres an example I think they can really do cheering a better job Great read pass to get it to get it ahead for Maduros who wisely waits for reinforcements Dominican a pretty good crowd representing them on hand making the ride across the Richmond Bridge to be here for this one tonight That pass taken away by Campbell and poked away from behind Michael Wilson takes away what was looking to be maybe a dunk opportunity Yeah Cals going to get up and down in transition DJ Campbell coming back from an injury Hasnt played a lot but hes been a big lift for this team Obviously was a big player last year for the for the Bears Cal hasnt scored on four straight possessions hands it off to Campbell into the corner Threepoint try No good Thats a heads up play there by Campbell Yeah I like it Thats a good play by DJ just going up and keeping the ball alive Thats the advantage Cal has Theyre strong on the glass Theyve got size and strength up front so they they theyre going to be hard to keep off the offensive glass Five offensive rebounds tonight so far for Cal Make it six Pitman comes up with the basketball Gets it right back to Campbell Now Pippen goes on the attack Seven offensive rebounds overall and a chance for some second chance points in the line by P Yeah their best offense has been to miss it and go get it So and and you know they they really theyve struggled shooting it from the three but theyve really done a good job getting back to the glass pounding the offensive glass and when theyve been patient theyve gotten it inside So thats Mark Madisons message is coaching staffs message Go inside and get some easier looks Had a chance to talk to coach Terbinsky and met uh one of the top coaches there Uh been around and you know he scouted this team really well Its his scout and he was talking about what Cal will continue to try to do is that they respect Dominican They know they can get up and down the floor but they feel their advantage is up front with their depth and with their size Well and you know when you see matchups like this and coach obviously you know you youve seen it on all sides A team like Dominican you expect them to come out and play well in the early stages of the game because theyre hyped up and theyve got their best players are fresh But as the game wears on the depth is going to become an issue Nice job contesting that three by Ames but it will stay here with Dominican Well theyre scrappy They play fast Thats the way coach Arginal wants to play Justin Argent wants them to play fast with pace ball movement and so Cal you know I think Cal will be okay Uh theyve just got to get out you know and stay in their stance and play How good is that on the baseline out of bounds play Austin Jones comes over and knocks down the long two Thats twice now Uh good execution on under out by Dominican Dominican doing what they need to do Seven of 14 shooting to be in this game right now Campbell put it down low and nearly turned it over Ames with the shot clock down to five Gets to the free throw line Does not get a roll The Bears are just four of 19 shooting Dominican has hit six of their last eight Seven and nine and a chance remain one for not bad looking Maduros and the Penguins right now having a night against the Cal Bears finishing through the hold and the contact and a chance to add to the lead on the other side of the timeout native I got to mention that having been born in Milwaukee but but uh you know very good career But now if youre Cal after this timeout you got to start getting back to what you do uh have been doing best cheering defensively Theyve been dominating last several games when theyve been dominating defensively Theyve been playing better Mados able to finish that off that threepoint play So the lead is seven for the Penguins Shot clock down under 10 for Ames Rejects the high screen from Dor who rolls Ames a little bit too strong And were going to get a loose ball foul here going against Cal You know one of the things that Mark Madson said to me that was interesting coach before the game is he trying to sell his team on the fact that Dominican is a good team And is that a hard thing to do Well you know its its human nature you probably want to let down You think division two but you know so many division two players end up playing division one basketball And so uh you you know you got to understand this Theres some really good players at this level You cant look at what division they are Deep three no good And the rebound is pulled down by Carr Transition three the other way wont go by Dorsy And here come the Penguins again Their gets tied up gives it up and another three for the Penguins and the lead has ballooned to 10 Yeah what again you know your shots not falling Dave Thats not a big deal but you want to get better shots and you want to get to the free throw line You can you can draw some fouls but you want to get your defense going Theyve got to got to stop uh Dominican slow them down in transition get it get uh better stops By the way that was Luke Ortiz just his second game played this season knocking down the three for the Penguins cheering Dorsy a good look the other way does not get a good result And another rebound pulled down by the Penguins Ransom Ransom inside Kick into the corner The three no good Long rebound is pulled down by the Bears cheering Little hesitation move Campbell gets into the paint cant get it to go The lid is on the basket for the Bears who are 4 for 23 shooting Yeah struggling to score but you know you get to come back and play defense Theyre going to get back in this game by playing solid defense Its not going to be about knocking down a bunch of shots off that right wing Now the kick into the corner cheering contested three and Ames may have gotten a piece of that Goes out the front of the FIELD AND THE BLOCK FROM BEHIND BY JOHNSON Thats a good block I mean that was good defense by Cal and you sure thought a shirt too but what hustle by Dominican to get back in play Crossover and a fouls going to get called here on Dayday Ames Lets watch it again I mean theres what you thought was a sure basket Ames came up and he just didnt expect the defense to come back and pursue the ball Now we got some hockey line changes with both teams getting some break again defensively Cals just got to lock in here and and theyve struggled now guarding underneath out of bounds under So theyve got to get this guarded 20 seconds on the clock Coach Kell has had two breakaway opportunities and one time they had the ball poked away and the other time its been blocked So the Penguins they are running the floor here This is in a way their Super Bowl playing this game here tonight and theyre playing like Well theyre scrappy Just a scrappy team Theres no surprise Thats what Cal can do Theyre bigger Thats just good defense right there Youre not going to get over the top to Pippen and hes going to give you something Pippen has it roll off Aims the extra pass and that three much needed by Camden able to knock it down Well thats good patience Dave Thats what theyve been doing and thats what Cals been known for that extra pass And now they get the hands on the basketball Take it away from Best And here they come the other way Bell for Dort Cant get the dunk to go Unselfish play by Bell I thought Bell had a layup but he wanted to go over the top to Nick Bella Cant fault him for being unselfish Ooah cheering has it knocked away by Pippen Bell draws contact and hell go to the line for a pair And thats going to take us to the under eight timeout But the score on your screen is not not a typo The Penguins leading it right now here in Berkeley Thing theyve done is theyve been very pesky defensively Theyre getting their hands on a lot of balls Theyre chasing down layups Theyre chasing down you know plays But its the Dominican Penguins that have eight assists but I mean watch Theres a sure layup and Dominican comes down and makes a play But they got you know eight assists on the game and thats thats making the extra pass Something that Cals really been doing and and and thats you know for Justin Aral thats music what his game plan was coming in Cals only one of 10 from three And and so when youre not shooting it well youre giving the other team a chance to come down and get some scores in transition and get extra possessions Well the thing Justin told me before the game he said You know we run a lot of the same actions as Cal and watching the film So theyre familiar with a lot of things Mark Matson does already They see it in practice all the time Well I think Cal could get to the line more than three times and they will Uh and then theyre not going to go one for 10 Theyre right in the game But uh but they they can get into the applause they can definitely you know get some easier looks And I know that in that last time out Coach Madison directed his team to say Hey guys lets lets really focus in on getting the ball back to big big fella Dort side Lets attack the basket We can beat these guys to the glass and on the glass And they have eight offensive rebounds already A tie up by Piping Forced to fall back to Dominican on the cheering possession arrow And now the turnover was able to come back up with it Bell in traffic and yeah Kells not going to shoot 18 for the little No but again but but Dave thats a thats a medium range jump shot Thats not a three Thats just a pull up in your range and thats what theyre giving you Take what the defense is giving you Chris Bell who by the way was coached at Dell by Justin Arjunal Penguins able to come up with the basketball Sloppy possession but Té Ray able to get the bucket Yeah loose ball pickup by Dominican Theyre theyre getting theyre making hustle plays No question about it Thats what they have to do and theyre doing it Camden for Dor Pippen behind the Dor screen that rattles out Its been that kind of half Pitman just kind of put his head back Couldnt believe that rattled out They had to check that rim at halftime I guess the good news is thats some room The Penguins have to shoot on in the second half Ooah That is a deep three at best leaves it short Camden for Bell Thats too strong Cals going to look back and theyre going to say Boy we had a lot of open looks but theyre taking a lot of threes and they really could get the ball I think deeper to the basket against this smaller Penguin team Wilson from just beyond the free throw line Now the shots not going in for the Penguins either into the corner Bell a rule fake to get his defender in the air and hell have to go to the free throw line to earn him as it falls off the rim Well Chris Bell can get that shot pretty much when he wants because theyre going to be up in him Hes such a good threepoint shooter and hes an excellent foul shooter Look at his numbers But hes going to be able to get by his defender and take that shot Hes really improved that area of his game and thats what hes been knocking down for the Cal Bear is is that medium range jumper curling off screens and spotting up and driving So we asked Ten Arsenal before the game what Chris Bell was like when he was coaching in high school and he said he he had him playing against the varsity when he first walked on campus as a freshman and he was going ahead and knocking down five six threes without even batting an eye Hes an elite shooter and thats what he said about him Hes an elite shooter and he is and hes shooting right around 90 from the lineup which he had under but probably now with those made free throws right back to about 90 Well hes now 34 for 38 coach So whatever the math is on that but Showa cant get the three to go And now the Bears able to get it back to one or possibly tie it on at three Bell will go for the tie cant get it to go and the rebound Ames able to come up with it Looked like the Penguins were going to have it Second chance to for Camden wont go in traffic Well get a whistle and its going to be free throws as the Bears are over the limit You talk to Chris Bells dad right before the game uh obviously local local family played his basketball deal for Justin Argginal and uh you know hes just happy to have him back home and playing at Cal hes been very happy here but hes improved his game uh I I think hes grown since high school and I stand corrected they they did not uh they were not over the limit so just side out Ive called too many womens games this year coach I saw that they sitting on four and went to fivea rattles out Nice crossover to get to the rim No whistle And finally the whistle on the second chance try Well Dave I like that And why do I like that Because youre taking it to the basket Youve got Frank and by driving to the basket even if you miss the shot you got people to clean up offensive rebounds But thats an aggressive move Should have been a foul on the first call Nothing Then Im not sure there was a lot there on the second but I think they they gave him that call It might have been a makeup call Yeah Yeah Quickly a makeup but he got pounded on that first one But officials doing a good job letting him play and I think theyre doing a good job both ways Its you know theres no advantage disadvantage going here But Cal playing a lot of guys trying to get in their rhythm I think coach Madson will settle on the guys that are going to end up playing the hardest and get out there and and put some defensive pressure on this Dominican team Youve got to guard them and theyre not easy to guard Bell takes a seat with his six points which leads the way for the Bears tonight If you ask me what Mark Madson was as a player during his years he was a tremendous defender His teams were good defensively and he he know hes not going to put up with a team that wont defend This team this team has defended and they got to get back to doing what theyve done Dominican on a 2 and 12 minute scoring drought here What was a 10point lead now down to just a single point free throw line jumper is no good And here come the Bears A chance to go back in front Campbell into the corner Threepoint try by Ames is no good Now theyre getting open looks thats for sure Bears are just one of 15 outside the ark Best nearly turns it over to the right wing where the threepoint try by Davis is no good Yeah neither team now lighting it up for three There are combined three of 27 from downtown in this game Kell still looking to retake the lead and finally theyre able to get it Camden on the drive Yeah I like that John Camden move because theyre going to play him hard at the three and he drove it Good move Smart play Ortiz Jeffrey to the top of the key Shot clock dropped down to 10 cheering Nice job coming over by Elish to force an errant shot Poked away by Sergeant Jeffrey And well finally get a whistle Thats going to take us to the timeout Still just a onepoint game but fortunate to know Jimmy B Tell you what coach 1983 that was I I was 13 That was maybe the first time that I ever was sports aware enough to really know what was happening in the NCAA tournament And that was just amazing Classic You know you look at the stats Dave and Cal is only 7 for 35 Theyre shooting 20 Thats not going to happen very often And theyre one out of 15 for three Thats not going to happen very often But what they are doing is theyre pounding the offensive glass at the tune of 10 10 second ch 11 second chance points 10 offensive rebounds and theyve gotten to the foul line here and theyre nine for nine make it 10 for 10 with Justin Pippen So they can live at the free throw line And I know thats been the direction of coach Madson and his staff They lets lets you know were not its not falling tonight guys Lets Lets get some Lets get it the oldfashioned way Yeah And theyre not fouling so theyre not giving the Penguins a chance to counter that Penguins have gone nearly five minutes without scoring And thats a credit to Cal Theyre starting to defend the way they can they can defend Theres another deflection Justin Pippen doing what he does best Extra pass Nothing to show for it though Got to love the unselfishness of the Bears and the active hands Contested three And somehow Midos able to get that to go over Carr Hes a senior and hes a hes a great point guard Uh not afraid to knock down shots Not shooting a great percentage but hes a gamer Carr on the other end he takes some contact on a threepoint try and hell of a chance to go to the line for a trifecta But the reason Maderas is so good hes so good with the ball but hes able to spot up I mean hes hes just a bit you know hes a hes a game player Uh but hes hes pesky and and hes a hes a fiery guy Uh Justin Argal really likes the way he plays Its hes a true point guard He plays with pace and poise Its hard to play really fast with poise but he does it Daros coming into the Penins program after three years at Soma State Well talk about somebody also whos made an impact is TT Carr Another local product out your way and out not far from Dominican He lives right around the corner Yeah Mil Valley is where he grew up Yeah Right around down the street And and you know uh hes really really given some good minutes to Cal Hes hes really come on for Cal when hes put gotten in the game Hes been very dependable Their energy level at Cal is up Plays with a lot of energy and and hes given them a lift Hit two of the threes So that was the first missed free throw tonight for the Bears but the lead is two Good defense by TT Carr Hes really putting pressure on the ball Well the Bears have really turned up the notch defensively coach as you made note of And they come up with another steal Yeah theyve been very active Theyre turning the tables on Dominican It was Dominican that poking up poking the ball loose Great move Unable to get the finish Tough rebound inside Taken down by Ransom Wide open three straight away and Wilson drills it and Dominican is back in front Missed their last shot but you know they were point blank If they can get to the rim theyre not going to miss many of those Theyre going to have to continue to do do what they just did Elich Dorsy trying to get it into the corner Taken away and ABLE TO GET IN FRONT OF DORSY and finishes Maderos Yeah Mark Mansion was calling an immediate timeout and hes wants to stop the action get the last play And Maduro slow to get up I mean how good is this for Madiros He comes up with the extra pass to get the open man for the three and then the steal and the finish Yeah Off the official Good good play and he scores with his left hand I mean theyve just gone back up and regained the lead Thats psychologically important Dave I mean you know theyre going to respond but theyve got 22 seconds to get a little bit of this momentum back They got to get a score or a foul and not shoot it too early because you dont want to give Dominican a chance to come back not turn it over Pippen will get it across the timeline Looks like a zone Switching defenses by Justin There is zone in zone now Carr 5 seconds Drives on the baseline Lost the basketball Last touch by the Penguins Short clock now 26 See if Dominican stays in that zone or goes back man Cal likes to go over the top Here they go Here Theres a play they like to run Thats going to get Dort They like to go over the top to Dort and see if Dominican knows it They like to see if they can get him to the basket Theyre going to try to screen him and see if they get a lob to the rim Well and now were going to get a timeout taken here by Justin Arjunal as he wants to make sure his guys are ready to defend it No thats a smart timeout is to you use it or lose it Heres a look at the defense when a ball was tapped out of bounds by Wilson from behind They could have challenged that one maybe I dont know Might have been off But heres 26 So if youre Dominican you are SOME OF THE GUYS YOU MUST PLAY FROM THE INSIDE OUT Nothing to the rim If they score and take a shot and knock it down were okay You bring up a great point by the way because Justin Aral probably not used to being on TV a lot I dont know what the challenge rules are for they can challenge Hes going to challenge Edmmond but lets see Lets see Now heres a play where they like to go inside to Dort They like to wheel Dort to the basket See if he goes to the rim In any case here we go Tippen inbounds Bell in the corner AND BLOCKED COMING OVER TO BLOCK IT out of bounds It will still be Cal basketball but just 01 remaining The only shot you can get off here Heres a heres a play Look at this block The only shot you can give up is a tip Is a tip So you got to throw it to the rim and they dont do that Well that will close things out Thats momentum uh there for Dominican they not only got the basket on the other end they got the stop So now theyll take the three Scored their opponents by 15 per game in the second half of their games Well I like how theyre going to see if Cal can just you know get on the board early with something inside something easy Open look by by Justin Pippen Uh broken play but uh you know Cals too good a shooting team Theyre theyre not as I said going to shoot 18 The big question is what are they going to do defensively Yeah there they were one of 16 from downtown in that first half now one of one here in this second half cheering And then Pippen able to pick the pocket and take it the distance So five quick points by Pippen Yeah and he just answered the question what what theyre going to do defensively Theyre going to defend And I knew that was going to happen when Gal came out of that locker room Ooah Sergeant Jeffrey takes a little contact but good defense without following by the Bears Well youre going to get your pocket picked there First of all youre going to get a score Screen step back Good help defense by Dominican but you forgot about Justin Dippen And then he goes out and makes a big steal Penguins looking for an answer after a quick five nothing run and the three by Maderos able to put the Penguins right back in very confident team agains going to have to stick with that defensive pressure and make it consistent The two threes in the game by Maduros matches his season high Aims into the corner for Camden and that will drop Well theres the extra pass So these are better looking threes for Cal but still defensively you got to get stops and dont want to trade baskets with Dominican Dominican very high powered team scoring in the 90s on the year WILSON GREAT JOB BY BELL TO come over and come up with the block but theyre going to say last touched by Cal we talked about the extra pass but theres the extra pass a rotation to John Camden and the officials conferred By the way while were looking at the replay coach theyre going to say it is Cal basketball Theres the block Theres a throw Well actually went back off of Oh interesting Went back off of Bell I thought But youre at home Youre at home you get a call And now see if you can build a lead The Bears trailed for nearly 12 of the 20 minutes of the first half What a spin by Ames and hes going to get fouled at the rack You can see how hard it is for anybody to guard DayJS He just gets by you Hes really good oneonone But again Cals going to find ways to score this half They have got to try to slow down Dominican defensively Thats going to be the key to pull away in this game Looking at that replay though they for one thing coach appear if your players going to get a foul or get your moneys worth and and best got about three fouls that time out as You know this this these games sometimes Dave come down to identity and you got to get back to your identity and and who are cheering you and how do you want to play and you dont pay attention to score or even your percentages You just want to play a certain way and thats what Cals trying to do here Jeffrey bullies his way in They dont have a lot of size but Jeffrey certainly is a load when he gets going Ive never seen anybody bang into Dort like that And I mean Dors a big guy and he got way late inside Pippen for three and Pippen knocks it down Cal three of three from downtown in this second half Yeah night and day first half to second half to the Cal Bears Cals too good a shooting team to shoot 18 but they are now also picking up their defense Pippens got 15 in the game cheering and its going to be Cal basketball again Well thats what they need is a steady stops here But you know Justin Pippen has been so steady You go behind a screen big guy doesnt come out and challenge and Justin Pippen just calmly knocks that shot down He can shoot it Tor gives it up for Ames Pippen gets the ball in his hands again Bell able will shed the defender drives in and the blocking call will go against the Penguins Bang bang play and its an and one opportunity for Bell Yeah watch this pass Watch this pass by Bippen The shot fake Watch out Blow by the contact I mean thats just great threepoint play opportunity You can see Chris Bell adding this to his game you know he can shoot it but he really has really worked hard on putting the ball down and trying to finish Hes done a good job this season Bell finishes it off and the Bears push the lead to seven A quick drive to the hoop by Wilson Hell draw the whistle Yeah again Mark Mansons not real happy I mean hes happy his teams come back but he just didnt like the fact that Cal uh gave up on a free throw a transition basket That shouldnt happen And so hes going to make a substitution and talk about it I I you know you you want to pay attention to detail Mark Matson a detail guy His coaching staff spends so much time in practice on on transition defense and these types of things And so you know when you dont see it happen in in the games you know you you really get disappointed But um theyll talk about it on the sideline and and theyll make the corrections Well check out that foul was his second By the way you know we should make mention here coach that Justin Argginal cheering Bay Area guy his dad is a Calawan He used to come to basketball camps in this gym He would come to Cal games with his dad to watch Jason Dr Arginal Dr Arginal and his and his family They were here coming to my camps So you know I Ill tell you this Im Im happy for Justin Hes got this opportunity to bring his team back in there and they performed him Theyve really shown up incompleted His dad is here tonight So its a big moment for him And theres the block but a whistle call is going to go against OO So its a its a full circle moment for them Yeah And its and its a basketball family Its a its a proud family uh that played at Dlesel played for the great great Franko there at Delesal just legendary coach And so they theyre a big part of the the Bay Area and the success uh of the high school teams that played here You played for state championships You coached there both you know players Justin coached there head coach So hes hes been around the block and hes hes paid his dues Said he used to stand outside the locker room and wait for autographs from the Gal players coming out after games He was at Louisiana Tech when I was at Rice and I had to coach against him I didnt like that Come on Justin Youre supposed to be one of my guys here You cant try to beat my teams Penguins trailing by seven after leading at the half by three and they get two back right there on the baseline pull up by OOA Yeah you really got to be impressed with Dominican They just havent gone away Theyre still chipping away You know theyre theyre theyre competing and and you can see why theyre successful Got a foul here on Jeffrey as he was trying to keep Elich Okay Well theres a really good pull up defense So jump shot against the defense So important today Dave that you take what the defense gives you You dont have to you know you dont predetermine what youre going to do You read the defense and how they play is how you determine how you play and what shot you Fourth foul of the half against the Penguins Great job getting a hand on the basketball forcing the turnover Here comes Dominican The three in transition no good But ooaha came up with a rebound and took some contact Loose ball foul here going to go against the Bears Yeah thats just good hustle I mean they they beat Cal down the floor again in transition Shot goes up and they just you know they theyre not able to to get a score but theyre doing a good job Dominican is first foul on Elach Second in the half against the Bears And theres another one on El Le This ones going to result in free throws as Jeffrey gets him in the lane Yeah Sergeant Jeff is a postcore Hes physical He positions uses his body and you can see how hes an effective player for Dominican Theyve got all those quick guards and hes a guy that just is a space eater on the on the block Uh and he can get rebounds scoring double figures getting about six rebounds a game Got to get his free throw percentages up But but hes a you know hes a sack hes a hes a pretty wy player Junior plays bigger than his size at 66 Misses them both but OO comes up with the offensive rebound Second chance opportunity here for the Penguins Wilson gets it away to Muros Nice tie up by Pippen And they finally will call the jump ball The possession arrow does favor Dominican and thats going to take us to the under 16 timeout Penguins trying to hang in Cal with some momentum here early in the second Go cheering Go up Justin Pippet give me that Give me that Im going to get that one Theres my two Picks your pocket And then Cal we talked about in the open the extra pass Theres one Theres two John Hampton too good You get him an open shot And D as you need a basket End of a shot clock Hell take you there and draw fouls Hes done it all year long Leads Cal in shot attempts for a good reason Hes able to get his own And theres a quick basket by thats the third time theyve scored on the out of bounds under Yeah theyve been great on that baseline out of bounds Pippen you saw in the highlights one of his four steals Thats a careerhigh for him The four steals and its just a onepossession gain Elich able to draw some contact on the baseline Theyre going to go to Choa Well you know coach yeah heres the second half numbers You can see what the first half was Way better I mean perfect the second half offensively Now Cal just got to step it up defensively AS handle Well you know you mentioned it Ben Its its its the rim rim on that side Wasnt I wish it was that simple I wish I could believe that and it was true but you know Day Ames just gives Cal such a lift because hes able to take contact He gets by three defenders Hes able to get to the basket Theres not much you can do with him uh because hes so good You almost have to get the ball out of his hands early Great shot by Camden Got a hand on that basketball so Cal could get a second chance And Pippen takes advantage with three Takes advantage Hes abusing the opportunities hes getting I mean thats just thats just really basketball Knocking down shots Call four for four from downtown in the second half And the Penguins answer with the alleyoop Yeah theyre theyre not going to let you celebrate And theyre not going to get down If you you hit a shot on them they come right back again They you know they give up a basket but they get one in transition and alleyoop dunk Ames goes to work Wanted a whistle picked up the dribble Camden Hell get cut off on the baseline Aims right cheering back to Camden Open in the corner First missed three of the second half for the Bears Here come the Penguins Maderos the extra pass Gets it right back And now the Penguins will reset Yeah good patience Theyre probing Thats what a good team does They probe in transition They dont like it they reset Their thought about the three puts it on the deck A lot of contact no whistle there letting him play Good job defending without fouling by the Bears Thought it was a good job No call No contact James gets the screen from El Le then goes into the corner Campbell Campbell breaking some ankles and knocking down a three Well Cals got some guys that can do that J Day Ames Justin Pippen and now Dwan Campbell whos been out most of this preseason They can break it down and score on him Able to get it inside and well get a whistle Theyre going to get Camden underneath Well what what did uh Dominican did is they got down in transition and they went right to the basket over the top for the transition dunk But DJ Campbell just with the cross over here look at that Get him on skates and hes just measures it up Said You got to give me that Im going to knock that one down Im not going to make that move and not score cheering it Free throw no good by Jeffrey Well short Yeah hes struggling from the line And I mean still a 65 free throw shooter but hasnt been close tonight on his attempts Came into the game 13 of 20 on the season 0 for three tonight Yeah not close Hes a little fatigued Hes been playing pretty pretty hard basketball That happens Gets the second to rattle home And you can feel that Cals at a point now coach where they might be able to really finally get some separation Pippen unable to get a finish Dort there for second chance No Cara third chance No And the Penguins come out of there with it Maderos in transition leaves it Shot by Ransom falls off and here comes Calig again Ransom disappointed Didnt didnt get it to go down Penins get a hand on it Last touch by Dominican Thats a hard angle to feed the post right from the top So coach I was looking at the list of famous Dominican alumni and the the most famous alumni of all is somebody that anybody whos on social media probably knows Hannah Stocking Yeah I heard that I heard you talking about that You do your research Dave Vince Former girlfriend of Clay Thompson People in the Bay Area are well aware of that In transition Maduros able to come up with the offensive rebound Wide open for three and he drills it I like the fact that they went into the basket didnt get it and kicked it out for the three Thats Thats good basketball Dominican still in this game Just a fourpoint spread nearly midway through this second half Pippen cheering Bin cut off So hell dump it into the corner and its a good decision as Dorsy drills the triple Well thats a good sign when Dorsy hits that three Hes been struggling but he can shoot it cheering Really struggled this year from three but he can put the ball to the basket Heres Trey looking to answer and he does well You you you know Cal scores and you know what Dominican does They dont worry about it They come right back and answer and and its still a one or two possession game Well as we mentioned Dominicans used to scoring in the second half for their games as well Campbell for Dort Dort able to get the floater to go Yeah good move by the big fella He saw oneonone coverage He said I can score You cant stop me And they he couldnt Quick three the other way Wilson unable to get it to drop Car season opening and draws a foul by Ransom and thats going to take us to the timeout Dominican though came to play tonight against the Cal Bears The home team with the lead but the Penguins music still breathing here at Hos Pavilion Little bit of frustration there too just they they dont want to hear about it Um but I know coach Manson hell say Listen you want to get aggressive Dont get aggressive on the court Dont need to get aggressive with your with actions Uh play physical on the court And and guess what Dave we you know we havent mentioned this but Rita Petritus is out for Cal Hes been out for three four games now and they really miss him And why do I say that Because hes the one guy There he is You put him in a game like this hes a separator Hes a guy you dont want to play against Not any team on Cal schedule enjoys playing against Reus Petritus Hes gritty Hes tough Hes not going to give you an inch Hes going to get loose balls Hes going to do all the dirty work for your team And they miss him I mean uh hes hes done that for his team not only all last year but early this year All right So all four free throws get made The two by Cal as a result of the foul the shooting foul the two by the Penguins as a result of the technical foul and now it will be Penguin basketball So Cal really just kind of negated the two points that they scored by giving two freebies to the Penguins and now Cal with a little bit of pressure on Dominican as they try to bring the ball to floor Well I like it I like that Kells turning up the heat I think they should I like the fullcourt pressure cheering And there you go And you know what Paying off I mean Kells got to play with that aggression Dave Its Its just not about going out and shooting baskets Cows a good shooting team I said that at the end of the first half Theyre going to come back and shoot it in the second half but theyve got to turn up the the level defensively That was just a bad miscommunication on that turnover Ransom thought was going to go to the threepoint line and said he was cutting Yeah you you want to separate yourself in a game Go out and do it defensively A gets the screen from Thor but Jetsy drives in gets his own miss and the second chance points Cal 168 the second chance scoring in this game Yeah Too big too strong A lot of numbers and what kind of whistle on that Well thats a foul but you know Cals at least playing more aggressively now Im okay with that I never minded when my teams picked up some fouls as long as they were playing aggressively Dont get a a foul from lack of moving your feet or being passive be aggressive You know chuck a guy maybe you do foul a guy by playing him tight Im all right with that That was the last foul to give Dominicans already over the limit So were going to have free throws the rest of the way And the threepointer is good by Johnson I I know this much If Im on Dominican schedule Im worried about this team Dave Theyre just showing you some guts and determination They really are Theyre playing hard Theyre going to be a problem in the pack west Absolutely In division two I mean you know that theyre theyre going to be a tough out Ames takes it makes it and he can do that I mean he pretty much when they need a basket they go to DS He delivers Seven in the game now for Ames to Ray And the Bears able to come up with the basketball after an errant pass Sloppy turnover by the Penguins Carr trying to take advantage and hell go to the free throw line So Cal again I think forced the last couple of turnovers One on a pass out of bounds when they denied the wing and that one they were trying to come off a curl cut and Cal played tough defensively But Day Ames you know if you dont get a guy or two two guys on the ball he one guy is not enough Hes too tough I mean he just way too tough Cals been making most of their trips to the free throw line now 2023 in the game Well its interesting Cals got some aggressive guys on the floor and and I I like that move on You when you want to change some things and how the games going put some aggressive guys on the floor And hes got guys in TT Carr and Nolan Dorsy who might be their best defensive player Uh theyre hes trying to send a message but we need to turn it up defensively I like his message Ninepoint lead for the Bears This is the largest of the game OOAH DRIVES ON THE BASELINE HOW ABOUT THE BIG GUY able to just be nimble along that bas and uncharacteristically Cal doesnt get anybody to step in and help him Everybody kind of glued up to their guy But thats a smart play Baseline drive Get there No help Carr picks up the dribble Car going to work No pass underneath Knocked out of bounds Last touch by Dominican Maybe Yeah they wanted a foul Wanted to foul But how about a pass by TT Carr Watch this spin move And right out of this I dont know no look I mean I dont know how he found it Shot clock at seven for Ames Ames able to knife through traffic Take some contact and James Fern and one And Cal with a chance to get the lead to 10 for the first time all night Well you use the word knife Thats a legal way not a crime by the way Hes using the knifing position to get to the rim And thats what he does Dave He does knife between two defenders You You have to close the gap on Day Am Its easier said than done Boy hes so quick to the basket Dallas scored on seven straight possessions to get this lead on the precipice of double digits And indeed it is double digits Well its interesting how when your defense picks up your offense comes around as well Its just its always a cause and effect Do the Penguins have another run left in them Muros trying to get it inside Taken away by the Bears Theres that Bear defense again going to the floor for the basketball as Ames and hell get the timeout to retain possession Smart play Day Ames on the floor Cal hustling climbing back in the lead They lead by 10 Theyre getting it done should be a better year in the ACC By the way how about this You look at the net rankings and Cal not only high in the net rankings but also starting to creep onto the brackettology uh predictions Coach you wonder if maybe they were looking at that too a little bit too earlier in the first half But uh they they can play I mean this is a good Cal team and when theyre playing the way they can play like they have in the second half uh they can put a hurting on you Theyre theyre talented Cal gets another offensive rebound her 17th of the game Carr into the corner for Pippen Shot clock down to four Pippen with the shot clock ready to expire Gets a bucket Hes giving him some big lifts Look at Look at John Camden cheering The steal Ill take that basketball Pippen trying to pay Camden back Unable to get it to to him without being deflected out of bounds But you got to like the effort out of these Bears That takes us to the under eight timeout Well step aside Back to Berkeley in a moment Second half Kale Yep The Bears flexing some muscle here They trailed by three at the half A season low 28 points for the Bears at the half but theyve turned it on here in the second half Ames No But how about the follow right there for Carr Whats that little guy going up there and doing that that type of acrobatic act He can get up let me tell you T Carr uh not a stranger to rim rim rattling Terry is best able to get to the rim and finish cheering Cal finally with a little bit of breathing room Pippen draws the foul 20 points Careerh high for him is 23 How about TT Carr Give me that And big time over the top Hes about 511 And hes playing big I mean hes living large Big time finish by TT Carr Hes very athletic Timed it to wait for it to be out of the cylinder before he flushed it as well That was just great all the way around Yeah hell get mad at me because hes listed at 61 Well get that foul by the way on uh Sergeant Jeffrey was his support So just got to take a seat Now we talked about Cals bench Theyve got a really good bench and TT Carr is big part of that to be able to come off and give his team a lift Fuset out but TT Carr has been really good Ooah loses the basketball in the paint It will stay with Dominican Theres Car on the floor again I mean hes all over the place You see why Mark Matson and his staff like TT Carr He really hustles Look at that He just protected the ball Hes not afraid to go on the floor Little move to get the defender in the air for Best And finally the whistle comes in So Best will go to the free throw line A foul on Elach is his third Well best has been a little bit quiet this game but hes a tremendous player Cals done a good job on him Hes been their leading scoreer Hes a complete player twoway guy Plays both ends of the floor But you know when youre the best player cheering Dave the other team knows about you and hes gotten a lot of attention Targeting a nice hand Is he Is he the best player Yeah I like that Did Did you do that on purpose Hes the best best Yes hes the best best No hes a good player Hes Hes really maybe their best allaround complete player they have And you know Cals just done a good job on it Flat out made it tough for him tonight Yeah Came into the game averaging nearly 15 but hes only up to eight right now Yeah Only taking four shots but Cals limited him Good job of scouting by Cal Mark Madson told me hes like We absolutely did a lot of scouting getting ready for this game Coaching staff definitely taking Dominican seriously cheering despite them being the D2 team And here comes Maduros Hes had a good night Ooah left open straight away for three And the Penguins trying to chisel into this one Theyre not trying They are Theyre getting back in this I mean theres no quit in this Dominican team They play hard Pippen for Elish Gets it right back Whistle here Going to go against Maduros Heres a weapon for if youre Dominican Youve got Achello I mean hes Acho just goes out there and he stretches the floor on you Hes a skilled scoring forward He stretches the floor He makes you have to come out to the threepoint line By the way hes shooting 47 from three Thats no clue And 91 from the line Uh Jorge Aoa just a really good looking senior transfer from USC Upstate Pippen with that free throw coach has matched his careerh high This would be for a new career high Rattles it in And you know what Hes had to step up for his team He did this uh in his last game out Hes doing it again today I mean hes getting better Dave Every outing Hes getting more and more comfortable and more confident OOA dangerous pass and it is another turnover against the Penguins Oo is employing his coach to review And finally Justin Arsenal says All right you know what We havent tried a review tonight Lets go for it No good time to do it You get a you get a free timeout and you also got to trust your players If your players are saying review it they must know something And theyre closer to the action Theres the ball there and there is off of data Ames head or face Was it touching Da Amess face last or was it touching Darius Bests hand last Remember the rule too Dave Its got to be overwhelming evidence So so if you dont have enough to turn it over to turn the call around Theres the ball Theres the Theres the play And its just hard to say Yeah I I dont know if theres enough there to change it Yeah I dont know that it went off Lets see This is a better angle I think Well I could see how Dominican thought it went off Ames I I think this is one of those that whatever the call was on the court is what youre going to end up with Cuz I I I you look at that Youre going to tell me if it was on Amess face last or or best hand last Im going to give it off Ames Youre going to go off Ames Well because Im Im competitive Im an argumentative guy You may be right but I say youre not So youre music saying if the call had been that its Dominican ball youre saying you could go it to to me that is that enough to overturn it if thats what youre saying Yeah I dont think you did or not But it did appear like it did go off of Dayday Ames How many times by the way have you seen a replay music where youre looking to see whether the ball was last touched by somebodys face Yeah thats a good point another look at it but music certainly went off a day a question is like you say did Dominicans player did Darius best get his hands on the ball I dont know that he did I really dont look here we go here we go hand on the ball hand on the ball face on the ball yeah it might be the face last yeah face knows best music great job by our crew by the way by the way if Im right you got to face up to the back I got to face I got to face up that youre the best on this No no I This is all a guess And you know you know fans might say Well what about music the the call It it stops the game We have to wait But you know you want to get the call right And its it its a 10point game and its a huge call because if it goes back to Dominican they get an extra possession They hit a three and its a twopossession music game almost So thats a big call there And the officials taking their time So here they are coming over there and giving us the result ball The challenge is unsuccessful will be Cals ball on the baseline Well you were right and I have to face up to it But no I think that that the rule again is if its not overwhelming evidence It cant be slightly Its got to be all the way And so they didnt see enough to overturn it And but it was a worthwhile challenge Yeah I dont I dont think that gets overturned Whatever the call had been on the floor I think thats what thats official state stayed consistent with how the intent of the rules is designed Now if youre Cal you must take care of the basketball Cannot turn it over Dont want to get bad shots now And you want to take care of the ball with time and time and score on your side Camden from deep drills it By the way how about that for a timeout You come out of a timeout you design a play and your best shooter knocks down the three Big time call by Mark Madson Camdens up to 15 points Hes Hes played well applause I mean John Camden has hit some big shots but Gal every time theyve needed a big basket John Camden has delivered for his team Hes a big time player a veteran guy I mean he he just gets it done It doesnt you know you dont know that hes doing it until hes doing it but he does it Camden with three triples tonight one off of his season high Well hes hes also gotten a block shot a steal Uh hes done some good things for his team tonight and hes hit all his free throws and hes gotten eight rebounds Hes had a pretty good game Dave very solid game John Gamiros cheering for OOA After flirting with a turnover a couple of times the Dominican Dominican Penguins finally do give it up You know we know while were talking about John Camden he also plays like a point forward Its like having another point guard on the floor Hes so smart Hes a very intelligent player Gets his team in the right positions on the floor Veteran Well Cal really has separated themselves coach in the points off turnovers department 256 Chance to add to that here Theyve only turned it over five times themselves Aims the spin move Aims the finish and he gets the flex and he gets the technical You know he he he he got the move He wanted to let his opponent know that youre Im in the weight room And so theres the move Theres the contact And he says There it is two There he is Thats thats a no no And uh you know and Mark Madson saying Hey we dont need to do that But hes telling these guys Hey huddle up and talk to your team You know come on guys Lets lets were doing this with our actions Words arent getting it done but were out playing Dominican Keep playing And its a good lesson for young players cheering Dave You you want to be emotional I some of the best players Ive coached were very emotional and I didnt want to tune tune them down tone them down but when they got over the top you know they there was times when they werent as effective cheering But all technicals arent created equal either The shove the shove Campbell had probably going to irritate Matson more than the flex Yeah but but still that was right in front of the officials Unnecessary And uh you know I I always have an expression I celebrate like youve been there you know and D is too good He doesnt need it He he scored the basket Thats enough and he knows it Picked up the dribble Gives it into the corner Penguins trying to hold on here They get an open three from Ortiz Yeah theyre theyre doing it You keep saying theyre trying Theyre theyre theyre accomplishing it Theyre right where they want to be Theyre another basket They cut it to single digits Cal needs a score here to maintain this lead Get some pressure on Dominican And they go to Camden whos been there all night Cant get that one to go Ball rattles free and taken over by the Penguins Yeah that was down under and out Heres a big shot here If they can score they can cut this thing Wilson into the corner Ooaha contested two and the Bears get a stop Yeah good defense You want to make him a driver and a scorer on the move Hes too good in the set Good defense by Cal Bears have hit five of their last six shots Aims for Bell Bell able to knock it in Yeah thats what hes been doing in his previous games is not settling but just going to the basket pulling up Unstoppable And Bell the fifth pair to get to double figures tonight And a timeout on the floor here taken by Arginal Yeah Chris Bell former Arsenal player at Dais Its going to hurt your former players getting it to you But Chris Bell music can play He knows what to do The Bears up 14 Chararma Smith 17 consecutive home wins against nonconference opponents Thats impressive Coach Chararma Smith Ive known Coach Smith Char a long time Take my daughter to her game and she takes care of us But shes shes really done a great job Shes created a home court advantage Theres John Camden again Yet another steal Big play there That was a big time play now to just kind of settle this thing again out of the timeout Camden right place right time Well the writing on the wall for how this one is going to finish in terms of the win and loss coach But tell you what if youre Dominican you got to feel really good about the way you play tonight Dor one opportunity Yeah throw the score out The score means nothing This is not This has been a closer game than the score here And and Dominican can take something away Justin Arsenal can point to his team and say Look for a good 35 minutes in this game we were playing even with Cal maybe outplaying them certainly in the first half So important if youre Cal you can point to the second half and theyve done it all year long Theyve stepped up in the second half and Cal can play put two halves like that together Watch out for Cal Ray goes to the deck and well get a jump ball Yeah Justin Argentell telling me before the game yeah you know what They dont play on TV a ton Hes got recruits watching this tonight help Any any recruits that watch this tonight probably feeling pretty good about it Yeah you got to admire Justin Aral and his team I mean they came to play were not intimidated uh in a big stage They they performed I mean they they just stepped up and played like seniors and competitors do And Cal as you mentioned coach you know what It wasnt pretty early but you you find out you know you find something to get your team going and when they found that gear they really got it going Camden adding TO IT AND CAMDEN knocks down another triple his fourth of the game Give me John Camden Put him on my teams I mean you got to admire what he can do Hes so steady cheering I mean hes so steady But watch Cal again Their trademark this year has been the extra pass Thats one Thats two And you want to find John Camden on an open floor tonight Run the other direction Hes that steady of a threepoint shooter The four threes for him tonight match a season high Yeah And you know were going to have a chance to talk to him which Im pleased by Uh hes hes something Hes had a good good senior campaign here at Cal applause Fto rattles in for Omari Davis And now wholesale substitutions coming up for Dominican You know theres nothing better Dave when youre playing that to earn the respect of you want to do it for your fans But what Dominics done is theyve earned the respect of Cal The way Cal played in the second half was a testimony to really how hard Dominican played Cal had to step up to play this way because they had to match the intensity of Dominican and they have but thats respecting your opponent second half Oh teams the crossover and then the finish Now hey you the crossover is unstoppable Hes applause and cheering hes got that move Hes got the twirl move Hes got a lot of a lot of uh shake and bake in his game Changes speeds extremely well Well Cal will next action this weekend against Northwestern State Here it is Heres thats just a crossover Step through and get to the rim No answer Yeah Cals going to have some games coming up now and a couple good games in Northwestern State and and and Colombia whos playing really well out of the Ivan League So uh theyre going to have some tests coming up in this finals and you forget that its finals Bears in a run of eight straight at home as they they get the bucket to Crochis Yeah And you know you say well you aint playing a lot of home games but thats smart When you play at Cal and you go to school at Cal you you dont want to be on the road a lot I went through that You you really you dont even have all your players at practice Theyre just studying in finals So its a little different when youre at Cal Threepoint try No good for to Gore Yeah Mark Manson calling a timeout Going to make a nice sub Get some guys in the game It looks like I think Butlers coming in and a familiar face to all of players at Stefan Marberry the second nice young man Both these guys Butlers dad played Dave Butler very outstanding player for Cal And I think I remember Stefon Marberry You covered him You covered him in the NBA Im going to call your accolades out now You called his games Well Stefan Marvari quite a career and no doubt wanting to see his son have a taste of some of that success Has not played a ton for the Bears No hes just a really good kid I mean he comes to practice every day Great attitude I mean you really got to admire players that put their time to walk on to the teams always No hes and hes the first one out of practice Hes always applause encouraging his teammates Uh has a nice thing to say He always comes over and says hello to me I appreciate that Had a chance to spend a little time with his dad one of the home games But Cal Cals going to get this win Dave All right Well how about this coach They put up 28 points in the first half 28 cheering They put up 68 in the second half Yeah And they shot 18 points 18 in the first in the first half and they only shot 65 in the second half So thats a tale of two halves
