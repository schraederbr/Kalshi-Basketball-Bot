carried a lot of road for Portland this year Another of course huge connection between these schools is longtime Stanford player and assistant coach Eric Revano who was a head coach at the University of Portland Did a nice job Took him to tournament And how about that Portland gets going right away with a three from Cameron Williams Portland is a good basketball team who can really shoot the ball Its just a question of whether they can hang physically with Stanford but Stanfords big and strong if they can get basketball Boy I like this kid Yeah Oh Rajosi AJ Rosi had that role around but not through I love his story too Transfer from Claremont Mud Thats how that adjustment I mean he he just is a clever clever player who actually played pro in Australia for a couple years uh coming out cuz they thought he was too small Yeah a little sliding screen there by Aiden Cman and hes called dribble handoff The the guy handling the ball has got to wait for the screen The c turns wide open and he can shoot it He is a good shooter from there No question Yeah that little adjustment by Foxwell I mean thats the kind of stuff you Well hes clever Yeah you dont see as much of that Yeah hes not a power player Hes a clever player Thats a good word Well theres Betty Geler Speaking of clever sneak attack steal and finish You know I was thinking coming to do this game Ted How Betty Geler represents everything that college basketball should be Oh thats deep That was Matush Ransky whos from Slovakia Averaging just under seven a game for Portland Three international players in the starting five for Portland Heres a guy you got to pay attention to If youre Portland youve got to pay attention to Cororey He is the real deal Ted He can split Hes fast Hes quick Gets to the basket Well Mike since we saw that play we got to say that is one of I mean its a play we see executed all the time Intentionally missing a free throw I should say we see it attempted the miss We see it attempted a lot Rarely do you see it pulled off as cleanly as Stanford did Well no question Fast break There was a little bit of luck involved in terms of where the ball bounced Geler runs to the corner He finds it right away He has no time on the clock He recognizes that and he launches and the kind of shot he shot is what he shoots Just like that right there Thats what he does But back to the free throw Okorei intentionally missed that And we see it all the time Guys try to intentionally miss a free throw They clang it they bang it they smash it He had beautiful touch on He just missed it intentionally to the right side of the rim Yeah Well the Kyle Smith told him to shoot it high so it would come up and give his rebounders a chance to get a hand on it And thats exactly what happened Percentagewise thats not going to happen very many times No thats right But then the other part Stanford was prepared as we get late clock here Belaloo has to go you know Oh nope Didnt get it off in time Micah Belaloo there on the last second uh effort for Portland But what Stanford did the other last part of that element was Kyle Smith a diagram He had shooters in each corner So ran to the corner because you cant be in the corner You got to above the free throw line extended and he ran to the corner But that was the diagram was he had shooters running to each corner So what either side they had a shot Yeah Kyle told him to shoot it high so it would come up and give his rebounders a chance to X inside Thats one thing thatll that hell do Hell hell exhaust a possession but when he can do that hes tough cuz hes good in the paint for sure Chispara thats just his sixth made three This is the eighth game of the year for Stanford Oh nice deflection again Thats Rahosi with a little post defense Yep I love Rahosi and I love his story Hes very clever Oo got blocked there but follows it How about that See how he stayed with that Yep So he went to Washington State as a walkon Played for Kyle Smith at Washington State left went to Claremont Ma Mud decided he wanted the education transferred back and hes really really playing well Hes very clever very smart as one would suspect going to Claremont Mud Michael Belaloo there with the three And Im going to amend your statement a little bit He went to Washington State but he didnt play very much for Kyle Smith the next No no Well it played right But Im saying it was smart because when Kyle left he he wanted to go play so he goes to Claremont Mud where he could play Right And get an excellent education Oh good straight up there Refs let him a little bit physical in there Theyll let him play I like it Oxwell got a break there He traveled Yeah But then the running start byky And thatll get us to our first national influence that Mike it feels like were seeing that at that you know socalled midlevel tier of college basketball Were seeing it a lot internationals Well the introduction of NIL a lot of people at that level didnt have money Nice up and under right there I quarry with his first points Well youre going to see a lot of here and youre going to hear a lot about him He is the real deal If he can do that if he can shoot the three consistently he is big time Agra wall in the game Nice back door That was Teemo George setting it up Oscar Guilt in the game for an athlete Ryan Agarwald Okore and Geler continue as the guards for Stanford Theyve got to do that You got to get it out of his pockets Thats it Now late clock Geler pushed out Doesnt matter Foxwell looking to push it Yeah he did He wanted to He wanted to snap a pass there and he couldnt One hand bounce pass which you cant get back What page is that in the Montgomery playbook The one hand running bounce pass I missed that book Its in the back in the appendix Thats what I thought The dos and dont section Thats in the dont section But you you really do have to double O Cororey and get the ball out of his hands Now I see Dent is in the game for Stanford Transfer from Dominguez Hills Dent Smith who also had a really nice game the other day Had three deep threes now They good reversal by Keeler Nice job to get it back to a wideopen shooter Interesting You got the biggest guy on the floor for Stanford shooting the three So two threes made by Okara Stanford fouled here Thatll be on Apara You know talking about that game where they beat St Louis Ryan Agarwal hit a very improbable shot as well He leaned in trying to get the foul They didnt call it and he still made the three which allowed them to have a chance You know the funny thing Im watching Courtland Mike and you watch six and a half minutes of play and you can see that a lot of what they do is going to run through Foxwell Yes Is it And and hes clever but I think Stanfords size and their discipline is going to cause him problems his onehand flip passes and his cleverness may not excel at this level Oscar Hilt also the international flavor of Belgian Opara trying to get it in does and Hiltte scores the add one number three There you go with Teemo George called for the foul there You can see the body bump Not too much but enough He This kid really gets off the ground He is a shot blocker deluxe longarmmed freshman out of Belgium Stanford has its share foreign athletes as well Thats the latest thing And the funny thing so you talk about a long guy shot blocker and then you watch that free throw and you see the form and you see the ball come off his hand and you realize hes a classic Euro big man Shoot it I was just going to say Europeans learn how to play because they have to because thats what they do They spend half the day in their practice on fundamentals That pass and hell take defended it Deflection ends up with Portland now have to shoot it Oh and they get the foul right at the end of the shot clock Yep Got bailed out That was Germaine Battleer Webb Number 11 Foul by Agarwall The mistake so many players do is trying to block shots Its so rare that youre not going to get a foul called unless youre really that long guy that can get up and get the ball after its been released when its in his hand generally going to be contact and it hurts there although player may not be totally aware but that was the last literally second of the shot clock Yes Okori back in for Stanford is averaging just under 34 minutes a game and I would assume thats going to be a low number for him once conference play starts I would think when you get back in the ACC theyre going to need every bit of energy and explosiveness that he has to be successful Their schedule in the ACC is very difficult this year cheering You see how he splits Yes that was so clean and sets up Agarwal perfectly Hes looking like hes looking to distribute a little bit more than he did early on Generally I would have said early on when he split like that he would have tried to get to the basket Here he finds the open man which his teammates are going to appreciate Back on the contested rebound back to Stanford Both teams you saw the number both teams shooting well to start the game Turnovers are have hurt Portland so far Theyre not getting good shooting opportunities each time down the floor which theyre going to need to do at this in this venue Stanfords made five out of seven threes so far And again to the weak side pass Okara sets up Dent Smith Stanford being very unselfish at this juncture trying to find the open man on the kick through rather than force it Thats typical Kyle Smith basketball Oh get out Get away He says I want him Thats got to be something Thats got to be something Thats good banging going on Thats a heavy shoulder use there by Matushki I dont get that What are you supposed to do You have to flop Well that you know thats a great call Mike cuz thats what you dont want to see right Yeah but you have to If the pitch is going to let him bang you back three times youre either going to flop or youre going to find yourself underneath the basket Got to be a solution You got to be able to defend Well Corys shot partially blocked Saved Aggerwall Late clock Oh no rim there So Portland back Foxwell eyes up looking surveying the floor Smart guard play Quick release there cheering You can tell Foxwell played pro ball when you watch Yeah No hes hes pro player in Australia Not intimidated at all For sure Exactly And Dent Smith drains it His second shot First made three You cannot let Den Smith or Geler catch the ball and shoot that set shot from straight and theyll make it every time Six made threes already for Stanford in the first half of the opening half and the Cardinal have the lead by nine music error that Portlands making right now And look at the left column there for a second It was there Stanford has eight more shot attempts Thats the turnover issue Yeah theyre turning Portland over and Portlands got to at least get shots Theyre trying to be too clever Stanfords bigger Theyre physical enough and doing a nice job Theyre well coached as is Portland They got to They got to settle in Were posting up Watch him spin Kick straight out That shot he can make Deep three missing Foul underneath going on Stanford You know its interesting Ted how guys get caught in between Ball goes into the post and the guy defending a perimeter player stands halfway in between Well whats he doing Hes not doing anything Ball kicks straight out and Dent can shoot that He is a really good its a set shot but as a result he can shoot it way deep All Steph Curry whos changed the shooting laughter in college basketball and the range because he shoots a semi set shot Nice back door cut get up Caught the foul in traffic Nice cut Yeah good cut and a foul inside The previous foul the rebound foul was on AJ Rahosi of Stanford And number 20 you love you live with that Ted because Rahosis aggressive Hes going to fight for everything Hes going to force contact I I really like him I like the way he plays Can I say something AJ Rozi hed have played for you Absolutely He I mean I look at him I say thats a Montgomery player Yeah Good entry Wow James ODonnell from Sydney Australia Great position Transfer from USF Hes got look See how he bangs in there Hes going to make hes going to create space I see the AMD driving Now youre not going to notice this but Raosi cleared out and sealed this guy inside He gave him a clear pass So there was no help right there Its the little things like that that make the difference if youre coaching trying to play against that cheering Nice Cameron Williams there cheering Yeah See he can get he can do that whenever he wants Great change of pace Goes left gets fouled Watch this Heres your play Mike Yeah See see how he seals him right there Seven tries to get over and help Cant do it Aroski great seal Its the little things Thats what basketball is supposed to be all about The little subtle things that nobody pays attention to Well and thats what I love because those dont make that play doesnt make highlight shows except the coach Except for the coach Well every time theres a highlight its always the dunk You know that counts two Just like that Seal got him two Hes going to spin Hes going to try to spin Got caught inside Staying in No Oops Cameron Yeah Didnt let go of the ball in time Well you cant you cant leave your feet and then put it laughter down Thats Akar is a beast inside and when he gets a ball inside hes going to exhaust his opportunity but hes so dog strong you know and he rips through and gets but they did a nice job that time Im looking at Kyle Smith and Im thinking I saw you that way a lot plays like that would happen Kyles got a little bit better place to a little bit more room to put his elbow there than I had laughter Oh nice That now thats good Thats a nice looking shot but the midrange game you know its kind of gone the way of the Buffalo Eddie Geler back has the foul line Nope Cam has the block Nope Denied there by Teemo George I like the no call because if space was created by the offensive players the official said Okay well let you play George from Amsterdam the Netherlands not New York cheering Oh no Oh he baked that Wow Tough tough if he leaned in and created that He created the contact Be interesting to see if they it reviewed that whether thatd be a foul or not Probably not worth reviewing Tough call though Yes Bubba gets us to a timeout Stanford up nine James Odon O Oddonnell And of course Foxworth is from Australia as well And heres Matush Ratsky at the line If youre looking at the difference right now in the score Stanford has 21 shots to Portlands only 13 and 6 for 12 for three which is pretty fancy shooting cheering And to tag that international thing Mike not just going out and finding international players yourself but taking for example Ronsky played three years at Dukane Yes The A10 And so you get him out of the transfer portal for the final year from Slovenia And they got two junior college transfer from Trinity Valley where they won the junior college championship last year Good defeat by Portland on this possession thus far Oh Okorei tried to get it back to Heay of Stanford Portland intercepts and then he good hustle point that is and Teemo George They go down Fouls going to be on George of Portland Id like to see that right here Well okay A good call Yeah he took his legs out Exactly I love the hustle I mean I love him going after preventing a basket like that Number 35 As a coach you want to reward hustle but as an official you you have to you have to make the call You have to protect the players on the floor The only difficult part of that play to me has always been when a guy goes low you take somebodys legs out Thats your livelihood Yep Yep For sure cheering Oh Cory got in and then hell for the finish Second side block he would have been better off staying home and rebounding a miss rather than try to go for a block which allowed his guy to come weak side and theyre containing Foxwell doing a nice job and not allowing him to use his cleverness if you will right now its Benny Geler look at Geler trying to stick to him theres that little clever play Mike thats a great word you use to describe him Stford Its going to get ODonnell of Portland to the foul line Really nice little play Spins inside gets the big guy throws it over the top Stanford doing a nice job of rallying to the ball though A little aggressive on that particular situation Stanford Cameron Grant First appearance for Stanford Roi has two fouls Okara of Stanford also with two fouls So two starting forwards right now are sitting Stanford very aggressive defensively Maybe a cause of the foul problems theyre in But Portland having a hard time getting good shots See theres a split right there Man is he good at that Anytime he wants Exactly Hes so good at that Yeah he he if you give him a crack hell split it and hes very good left or right finishing around the basket Well IO Corys been a little bit of a local secret so far and itll be interesting once ACC play starts in the country season Well how he measures up against the country I like his chances Hes not going to be as dominant for sure nor should he be What should you expect that ODonnell with a finish Stanford will open conference play here on the New Years week Theyll have Notre Dame and Louisable here Thats You cannot leave Nagar Wall with his feet set He is a very very good shooter Now hes a little tardy Doesnt move as quick to create shots for himself but if you get him an inside outside look Oh how about that See that Yeah Wow Little bit of spin in the onehanded scoop is used to compensating for his size OH WATCH OUT NOW OH CORY come on now How nice is that That Chante Legs immediately says time out If he can set up his strives with that Wow Watch out Look how deep he is Yeah he splits goes right underneath uses the glass and finishes But look at this Yeah thats deep Going to his left Hes a special player And hes got a 68 wingspan there in Williams of Portland to get that shot over Ted I think that if the Stanford coaching staff told you they knew he was this good theyd be lying to you I dont think they knew that this good Well no As you see the defensive numbers and how Stanford has done so far Number one in defensive rebound percentage which is awfully impressive But Kyle Smith when we were here a couple of weeks ago and I just asked him he said look Oori and Mike you heard me say this He said was one of those guys that whichever team we put him on in practice his team won Yeah And so therefore you say okay Ive got to start the guy Thats my line That was Brevin Knight Yeah exactly I said I had guys some another player thought he should have started I said look every time I put Brevin on a team this team wins I put him with four managers They win So guess whos starting you know the other night not to wear the subject out but of course he had 14 at half That was Hell take creating that turnover In the second half he decided to make others better and he did He he he quit trying to score and he made his teammates better and allowed them to win that game Thats another element of of bad what we always call point guard play that seems to I would say its not totally gone but it seems to have diminished Yes in where point guards score now But do you make others better Good back tap there by Agarwal Its that shot from Ger And there it is He and Aggerwall dent will make those inside outside shots extremely high percentage of the time Youve got Oh boy cheering And Stanford just breaking this open here in the latter portion of the first half Portlands got to regain their poise Theyre a little bit rattled right now Theyve got to run offense get good shots Not going to get it back all at once 10 points for Our in the first half Trying to play bully ball Move And yeah Grant stood up to the bully cheering And Foxwell has to pick it up So a heave coming here from Knuckles Well Williams saves the day for Portland by getting the rebound Then got Heelte of Stanford up in the air The one thing Stanfords not allowing even though theyre fouling a little bit theyre not allowing anything for free Theyre being very very aggressive and its really causing Portland problems Theres the back tap that set up Yeah Stanfords playing really hard That just was a careless dribble Whoops Committed to Harvard But dad said You got to go visit Stanford And Okori ends up here And hes making a mark in just his eighth game out of Brewster Academy in Nshawa New Hampshire But look right here Thats a smart play rather than So many young players think they have to dunk that He protected the ball with his body Gets the basket take the two points get out of dodge Thats just smart efficient basketball And you said is Williams Cameron Williams makes two at the line for Portland That was a what you just described Mike reflects the other description that he was a prep school player an academy guy He was one of those guys that was always playing above his age Yeah Well and hes a smart player And I I guess what would you expect from Stanford But hes a smart play He knows how to play Academic excellence doesnt necessarily equate to court awareness Ded Smith lets fly Wow Jeremy Dent Smith continues Stanford shooting Thats their 10th made three Both those shooters shoot set shots and they go to the left to shoot them because it brings the ball back in the middle Little things like that make a difference Is that what you call the shooting pocket Well yeah because your right shoulders already squared You dont have to get it from side to side applause Jesse Rogers sitting on the baseline back behind there Great friend of the programs Yep screaming Stanford is being very physical and it is paying off for them Theyve got Portland really backed off and out of sorts You have a little hook there as Williams misses the one And look at Geler Nice job to flash in steal that long rebound But you have a little hook there And you know Portland had an impressive win They beat Long Beach State by 20 and shot lights out to do it They shot 70 from two They shot 50 from three and 90 from the line I questioned my son whos on that staff and he said Dad they shot and I said What you think about defending Number one did you text your son for the defensive game plan laughter No That was an old Jud Heathco trick when you got beat bad I did text Mark F and ask him for his game plan against Michigan I havent heard back from him yet Jud used to do that to us all the time You had to know Jud to appreciate that Very subtle little dig Hell makes one But theyve done a really nice job on Foxwell because he kind of is the makes the thing go And thats a nice compliment to Geler Yes Not just the shooting but heres a guy that taken on a defensive assignment And theres a good finish by Cameron Williams Strong finish In all fairness Riley Parker who was the guy that Shante Lian said is the point guard and really is the glue to this team is out And they really are having to move people around positionwise Look again that dent shot Whoa See how deep that was Wow Make him put it on the ground Make him prove he can make it too Well the threepoint shooting in this first half a huge part for Stanford as theyre closing in on 50 Nice feet inside and Williams finishes at one Well done Cameron Williams amidst the international players Heres an American from Cape Gerardo Missouri number You talked about him being part of the junior college national championship team Yeah Trinity Valley Junior College just under 10 A junior shot on the line Shante Ligins described him as an emotional player which is good You need to play with some emotion as long as you keep it under control Nice threepoint play right there and whoa high pass save by Aiden Cman Tough shot there by Geler Really tough Got to get those two guards at least on the move and dont let them stand outside and get set shots Thats nice rebound right there There it is Tough shot but Ger Germaine Valiser Webb gets the put back 77 7second clock difference Try to run it down as best you can Not give Oh Cam will get to the line Just creating contact with that Move your feet Make them shoot over the top of defense Stanford is being very aggressive and definitely getting the edge with their aggressiveness in their physical play Aiden Camman stepping into a starting role this year Hes seven just over seven points a game and four rebounds He too is from Brewster Academy by the way a little pipeline and Stanford has opened up this lead and remember theyve played the latter part of this first half without Chisumoka and AJ Rahosi Kyle Smith protecting both with two fouls Last shot coming here High screen roll Foxwell cant get it to the big man Doesnt get it to his own teammate Oh Corys got to have half court shot Excellent half of basketball from Stanford University Really nice job Portlands got to go regroup And Stanford shot it 57 threepoint shooting and a half since February of 24 against USC They set a school record in that game with 19 threes See if they threaten that here tonight Theyve got to force Stanfords big guys to score without helping and kicking to three Roi loves to step through Just missed it short So Rahosi and Okara back on the floor to start the second half for Stanford Both sat out good chunks of the first half with two fouls Nice There you go Same thing you talked about the righthander sliding left for the shot Yep Yep Keeps his right shoulder in place Portlands got to change what theyre trying to do defensively If theyre going to beat you make them beat you in the paint cuz theyre killing them from three Obviously Michael Belaloo making just the third three of the game for Portland And there is the finish for Stanford Okara How could How can you let a guy that big they screen themselves 14 has to step in and take a charge Although he might be smarter than I think discretion Mike discretion is a better part of valor there And we talked about uh Ibuko Corey of course who had originally committed to Harvard and of course Okara played at Harvard Those are the kind of transfers that fit at Stanford Yeah absolutely and and uh Harvard has done a great job with this basketball program over the years Tommy Amer has had several opport Oh thats got to be a foul Tap by Williams No and the rebound He kept it alive He was not vertical You got to call that Cameron steps in and is fouled I will tell you that youre getting snippets folks around the country who dont know the excellence of Mike Montgomerys coaching career and why officials love him now Well every one of them comes over to say hi to you now They used to come over and say hi to me was on the bench too but it was much more guarded laughter A CM at the line for Stanford Stanford is an excellent shooting team Really Now Im not saying Keman can get shots on his own but you get open Look theyre going to make them Free throws are perfect example of that Nice shot right there Knocked down by Mat Matushky the Kane transfer and Rahosi finishes on the other end Now theyve gone inside now away from the threepoint shot cuz thats obviously what Portlands cut to the ball please Whoa Wow Cammon reacts First look understandably Lets see the second look here You have to call that Yep Took him completely out of his vertical ability to jump Yep Little body bump there Yep You know youre protecting your shooter is basically what youre doing Allowing the shooter the opportunity James ODonnell a sophomore just about a 10point a game start to this year at Portland As Agarwal returns for Stanford I said this once hes Australian and he was a transfer from USF And you in your early years here and one of the first Aussies to come over and play basketball in the States One of my favorite all time Andrew Blahoff One of the f I dont think he was the first was he Australian He was one of the first Uh for me I think he was the first Well definitely for you Yeah Yeah I I dont know Uh but hes just a winner He was Hes one of those guys Hes a mans man Players loved him Great leadership ability Rahosi Oh nice Yeah nice job by Raosi to use the basket Boy hes just taking hes just taking ODonnell to school oneonone inside there Six points for Rajosi Nice Top score in the game right now individual scores Cameron Williams of 14 for Portland just spinning off contact and getting to the basket Wow Hes just going to work inside there Hes having his way Two bigs But I guess thats better than 11 threes huh Well I was just saying after the threepoint shooting pick your poison And the early part of this half is more what we come to see with Stanford Really good post play Payton scored Cant guard inside 101 You cant get to the threepoint shooters Youre in for a long night Oh man But Geler steals one and adds two You know what Benny would have wanted to do in his dreams Jump up and throw that thing down Benny Giler had an ACL that uh tear early in his time here at Stanford because you said he was basically a preferred walkon but that delayed it was the ACL maybe Are you saying that he had nut down he would have jumped up and that down Saying maybe the ACL has limited the dunk Okay But thats guy good defense right theres being forced into really tough shots I remember always like to remember things and Jared Hass who was a coach here for a long time is the guy that gave Betty Giler a shot and its paid off now in the last two years Little extra step there by Okaro So thatll get us to the first timeout of the second half and Stanford hoping to continue this and make this a comfortable Monday night Kyles a really good coach Hes proven at every place hes been He understands what wins basketball games and he has a way about him that kids buy into I mean its not over the top Nice take right there TBO George will get to the line Yeah Well he just Kyle just you watch him practice He doesnt raise his voice He doesnt get real upset He allows his assistants to have a lot of responsibility but he has a good feel for the game He understands what wins games And thats paid off for him every place hes been Well you have one Stanford band member behind the basket on the first free throw was trying to be a personal curtain of distraction The Arizona State There he is Look what hes trying to do by himself laughter That was funny If he could play both those same time that would probably be a bigger distraction The curtain of distraction is an Arizona State tradition has been going on for at least a decade trying to distract opposing free throw shooters in the second half Normally its pretty clever Hell take caught kept that pivot foot anchored Boy look at that man Good ball movement The ball movement deserved to make Agawal has to shoot it Doesnt perhaps doesnt realize the shot clock was running out He had to shoot it See how fast Keeler moved the ball to the corner Just one more pass Didnt even hesitate Didnt even think about taking the shot He moved it to the Thats what your teammates appreciate if people are sharing the ball I was going to say that possession deserve to make Well yeah Stanford very focused in on defense shake outside A little push shot there from Garrett Knuckles junior from Texas Stanford has really committed itself to defense For whatever the reason whether they dont feel threatened or whatever it is they are really defending forcing Portland out of their offense and really not giving Portland good scoring opportunities Garrett Knuckles into the game for Portland Transfer from Trinity Valley Block shot there Well were entering the uh de we are entered into December officially and then you start thinking again about conference play And one tradition Im intrigued by Mike you lived it here a long time as a coach Stanford is a quarter school which always means final exams in December Yes And forever Stanford basketballs had a long break without games in December for the students to take finals They dont really have it this year Theres only uh six days coming up between games for Stanford I was intrigued by that Well the schedules have gotten completely out of whack You know the hard thing too though is back in the day if youre going to play in the NCAA tournament I dont know how many times we ended up taking finals on the road when we were trying to play NCAA basketball games which was really hard Well the ACC doesnt do it The Big 10s doing it Big 10 this weeks playing conference games ACC doesnt do it The Pack tried it You were here I think right when the pack tried it for a while Yeah In December But the problem was again everybody has different finals schedules Yeah I theres theres so many things going on I I can remember and I cant remember who we were playing but we were taking finals and we were playing It was a big game Might have been sweet 16 or something Oh thats the tournament now Youre talking March And the other team they came out and they were very very I dont know critical but mocking our kids because they were studying because the press made a big deal about it of course and our guys just were trying to get the job done But uh kind of irritated our guys and we took care of business WHICH WAS FUN WOW THERES THE HIGHLIGHT PLAY Knuckles set that play up by stripping Okori and then throws the perfect pass Knowing your teammate knowing his skills cuz he went way up Niagara wall in a kind of a set shot there which he can score up And again running the floor Portland and Kyle Smith doesnt like that So you can Yep You can immediately see the coach coming out of Kyle Smith Nice steal right there Sees his teammate Thats a hard play to music complete but he trusts his teammate Go up and get it Throw it down But hes been contained George has only played seven minutes and change Three fouls for him Yeah George is a very physical player and I think hes got caught with his hand a cookie jar a little bit but I I you know I think it points out that an excellent scouting report from the Stanford staff as to what Foxwell wanted to do taking it away and having the kind of athlete thats disciplined enough to understand and do it Well they peeled away Portland did there Gave Oy the shot didnt want to step into that Portland doing a better job of taking away the obvious and then he gamles on the pass You hit it that Thats the Curry shot Yeah you gamble on the set on the pass and it just goes right to a wideopen shot Fourth made three for Jeremy Dent Smith Thats the first of the second half for Stanford Gent Smith from Cal State Dominguez Hills and Raosi took it right in but denied by Balliser Webb Foxwell back Foxwell having a tough time with the physical play that Stanfords putting ON HIM AND D OH Dan Smith five threes And Shante Leens immediately pops up off the Portland bench Youve got to find him and not let him just stand and shoot the ball Goodness gracious music Why gamble on that pass And AYP know your personnel music And Jeremy D Smith puts Stanford up to 25 Biggest lead of the night music I mean Dan Smith now with his best offensive night in his first and only year at Stanford Five threes Well hes getting great looks and I I think Portlands just a little bit out of sorts I think they discombobulated They just dont feel comfortable with anything theyre doing But stay attached to the shooters I would much rather Stanford take me oneonone at the post But the Portlands perimeter players are turning and being midway and theyre just can kicking straight out The scouting report tells you that Dent Smith and Giler can shoot that set shot from way deep Third foul on Aiden Cam and Knuckles got caught and the deflected ball taken away by Stanford 14th Portland turnover And Denn Smith heat check And that was the opposite of what you thought Mike there Hes going to the right to shoot And hes not getting his shoulder back square And I I would take my chances with that But that inside outside pass no way Good Oh how about that Yes sir Yeah George the freshman went big time and the ball comes back to Stanford Eddie Giler back in for Stanford Both shooters in now I mean Hortons just a little bit above its weight class right now You know theyre getting bounced around They cant get a clean shot Theyre getting pushed and held and physical a little bit And Stanford having a very good game Very well prepared and fired up ready to play this game coming off that tournament win And Stanford will have uh another well good name team coming in Their next game will be here on Sunday against UNLV its first year coach Thats out of bounds on the sideline with Denn Smith Josh Ptor now running the UNLV program Stanford in the ACC season though by playing mostly here They will have one actual road game in two weeks Theyll play about 12 miles from here at San Jose State Yeah that their schedules set up to accommodate a very very difficult ACC with a young team Uh its designed to win games and it should be Its smart Its what you should do UNLV of course not the UNLV of old but still formative All right we have a couple of whistles here in the conference and a foul is going to be on Portland Portlands job at this point is is just to try to gain their composure and to learn from this and try to just edge back in Going to win No not going to win But to play better gain your composure learn from physical play What do we have to do How do we execute What do we do Coaches keep coaching them Players keep listening and learning And you get you dont just get devastated by a pretty healthy loss A correction And uh the foul was on AJ Rahosi of Stanford his third Rahosi is going to get his pound of flesh Looking at musling down low with the freshman Teimo George But Mike would you say Stanfords offense so early has proven to be patient Yes know what theyre trying to do Theyre theyre trying to establish in the paint Uh Akara is obviously a very strong aggressive player in the paint Rajosis good Hes very clever in the paint Theyre not exceptionally big but what theyve done is made people pay When you drop a guy in to help at the post theyre kicking out to the shooters Edgar Wall is a very good shooter and weve chronicled the two guards are very good shooters So a smart game plan under control Yeah I just watching it feels like that you dont see them force stuff I think that would be a good description They do not force Theyre not I mean even Okorei who you feel like can get to the basket whenever he wants is not looking to do that Hes looking to distribute to share And obviously if they needed two points at any given time you feel like he could get to the basket in the paint if he needed to Buco Cory has played 23 minutes tonight Hes out right now and Stanford hoping as we kick past the 10minute mark here remaining that they can keep this comfortable Grant was looking to enter to Rahosi Didnt get there So Apara enters himself Its a nice matchup inside with Teemo George versus Aora Thats got to be a foul Wow Thats what Shante Leg thinks Raosi shuffled there as he caught the pass Shante Leg thought the same exact thing you did Mike Well hes yell hes discussing it with the wrong official the wrong side of the floor The officials right in front here Didnt call it You try to protect the shooters as best you can Oh my How about that pass over And thats been the one outside shooter tonight for Portland has been Micah Belaloo Thats his third three Palmdale California Then Smith already at 15 points his most so far in one year at Stanford Saw that pass coming Sets up Geler Count it Third for Betty Geler Transition baskets Turn over to basket Oh nice feed there Thats the second time that Knuckles has set up a teammate Absolutely nice pass Good vision Thats two nice assists for Garrett Knuckles tonight Dance Smith has a very green light right now Well a 22point game I mean I think hes proven he can make that straightaway shot Doesnt mean youre going to make it every time but its a pretty high percentage play Spinning in is Oddonnell Block Rahosi 7 seconds to shoot and Portland will have a timeout here to set up an inbounds play A baseline set All right D Smith has made those five music threes tonight Theres Geler Looks to the crowd The agar wall can shoot the ball like that as well music Maybe Portland doesnt feel like they can match up oneonone inside but right now I think I would take my chances trying to play oneonone inside rather than giving up all the threes Portland needs a quick shot and theyll get a quick foul Williams on a baseline move but not a shooting foul So theyll have 20 seconds to shoot as you see Portlands up December games Theyll conference opener Yes conference open will be Washington State on December 28th Cameron Williams had a nice night Thats 20 for Williams Looking for some bright spots Looking to execute Theres seven minutes Still chance to learn if youre Portland Try to figure out what we can do better Nice take Oh going to count it Goend with a slap of the backboard That still sounds strange to me Conference opener Washington State Yeah Washington State Oregon State playing one more year as an affiliate member of the WCC Then the new Pack 12 with Gonaga as a basketball member Boy Foxwell sure has been quiet hasnt he Ted Oh nice take right there This is shown up Cameron Williams 22 O power going into Williams Draws the foul and one applause and cheering One of the things thats hard to do but you have to do is you cant let a player step through with the ball Ted so he has him going to his to his left You cant let him step through You got to keep him from bringing the ball through You got to get body tight and not let him do that because you had him dead to right short Easier said than done when youre strong as a big fella Theres Were talking about the Stanford schedule coming up including a game against Colorado and old foe Thatll be a neutral sight game in Phoenix And eventually December 30th here at Maples Pavilion ACC opener for Stanford against Notre Dame Oh boy again the running the floor the good ball movement and eventually Oh Cory little short on the shot Oh my And then fouled there on Belaloos shot Be a three cardinal rule you do not foul a threepoint shooter Make a miss get him off balance Any kind of contact up around the wrist ball area is going to be called cheering See behind Kyle Smith there longtime West basketball coach and Jim Shaw who was with Kyle at Washington State also coached at St Marys years ago All right Belaloo Its under 20 for the first time in a while And my old pal Eric Revano the general managers associate head coach cheering the first team here at Stanford Alltime great teammates Keeler had a good look Foxwell trying to get himself a look Said its Belaloo barreling in applause Eventually Portland will end here with 17 to shoot Stanford has been very physical in this game inside Portlands just really getting kind of manhandled if you will What Stanford has not done because their threepoint shootings not been as prolific in the second half 51 points at the half only 28 so far in the second It would be unlikely that a team would continue to shoot at that level And Shante Ligins is a veteran coach Hes been around the block So Im sure he made adjustments and said Guys lets lets try something different Theyre killing us from three Lets drive him off the line Make him score in the paint Oscar Hilt coming in Shante Legends His teams just slowly edging these foul shots And again inside of 202 Well if they could get it to 12 14 points something like that they would feel much better about themselves going home getting back in the bus See if Stanford tries to go inside here got in Cameron or Gil He rather was looking for the pass on the roll Didnt get it And theres another setup to George Stanford back Ora runs the floor and then smart foul Dont just give a Ransky prevents that I think Portland has sort of fallen in love with that lob pass a little bit more than I Id prefer I mean Id rather have a straight pass for the basket rather than try the fancy stuff but cost him a bucket there and probably has cost him some other baskets Make the easy pass Easy play Okara 77 foul shooter this year and has been just behind Okor in scoring 157 and hes a big and hes got that interesting split Alpara coming in tonight coming into tonights game more offensive rebounds than defensive well he likes he likes to score the ball and he gets in that paint hes a monster boy he hell spin hell turn hell get to the basket Look at hes taking advantage here of the matchup Nice take right there Yeah just he had much shorter man on him Ronsky at 68 took Dent Smith in but he kept his head up and would have seen a double team coming Made a nice play Very patient Wow we got a foul first Guilt couldnt get free to try to haul in that pass Had GuillTech caught that he would have gone up and thrown that down cuz hes a sky pilot He really get he really plays above the rim I want to see that You were talking Well he hes blocked some shots in the few times Ive seen him that hes just gone up and really gone above the square and gotten them Oh missing the front end All right so Stanford these last uh the last 10 minutes of the second half theyve not been able to just finally put this away Hell had it then didnt And ODonnell lays it in for Portland Stanford gone to a zone whos slowed things down a little bit but maybe taken a little bit of their aggressiveness away I was watching that in the uh Stanford shoot around today how much they were practicing zone and of course thats just so unusual after recent Stanford history a couple of head coaches here that were not big zone guys You know its interesting that all of a sudden the threepoint shot is not going down as much same shots pretty much and Portlands been able to cut into this thing a little bit Thats why I suggested early Why dont they try to go back and pound it in late clock Nope And a good rebound by Okara You know that goes down Ted Its a 13point game It sort of makes it a little bit more interesting That went down I was expecting a timeout Although were in a official timeout zone Hell tay in Nice spin and finish Spinning to the left Well you theyre letting him get into your body Boy he like they like that lob Yeah And then feeding George inside and one Good call Naggerwall called Got to have a come down to the ground 16 seconds over the top music Yeah See now he didnt he had no place to land He has to have he has to have the ability to change directions and he didnt have it Good call But hes got kids that stay and they learn the system and then theyre very good and and Herbs done a really good job at Santa Clara But theres only been one Gonzaga Next year theyre going to be in the uh Pack 12 They are You watch them and obviously seen them on television a couple of times They are men Yes they are men Well Mark Fs done a great job I mean he really has You know we used to laugh and Agarwal nice job Just beat Williams on that drive Agarwal a very sound fundamental player Oh how about that split by Foxwell That was a good job inside Hell take fouls You just for as much influence as Joel Foxwell has had on games up to this point for Portland Stanford has done an excellent job of taking him out and not making him be a factor not allowing him to be a factor really But hes just a freshman even though hes an old freshman because he did play post high school in Australia All right TMo George at the line Of course we did talk a little bit some people that have stopped by to talk to us and so forth about the lack of any rules that exist anymore you know in terms of the rules that used to be five years to play four and you all this stuff There are no rules anymore The NCAAs lost total control of things and stunningly as it is a 15point game here Just over two to go Portland had a player denied a waiver this year Play a sixth year And uh I was stunned when I heard that cuz I didnt know that happened anymore I didnt know anybody had a waiver denied Yeah And I think hes playing someplace else Just go play Which I think he did I think he went someplace else and is playing Number 10 You said it best What you say Ask permission later Well the way its going right now teams just play everybody and you beg for forgiveness not ask for permission Yeah dont ask for permission but ask for forgiveness later Oh I didnt know that Yeah kid only average 28 for you all year long Thank you for asking Hell take at the line here for Stanford at 155 to play Stanford wont uh break their school record We talked about their prolific first half shooting 11 threes Program records 19 in a game Theyre at 14 right now Whod they have 19 against USC Wow On this floor two years ago That was a conference game two years ago laughter which has gone the way the Buffalo and Stanford has no need to rush here Very unselfish though that I mean the Stanford kids not looking to pad stats Theyre looking to pass the ball Ah Jeremy D Smith got in He with the follow Hes good Hes a nice freshman I mean very athletic Good legs as he learns how to play a wet spot on the floor Dilts quietly come up with 12 points and six rebounds for Stanford Jaylen Thompson into the lineup Yeah red shirt junior So Smith thought he might get a shot to play first time this year Or actually third time Im sorry Hes had three minutes prior This is Chriss screen a freshman that has got some promise Kyle Smith Ria Latia Yeah just a freshman but really likes him and likes his the two things a coach would love Attitude and work ethic Yeah Twopoint shot there by Knuckles for Portland Just a freshman Sometimes those kids from Europe take a little longer to adjust to basketball here Post defense foul there by James ODonnell Be a oneonone Theres Scranfords bigs All those kids a lot of them foreign kids are pretty athletic I mean you watch them They jump and run and they get in a weight room get a little stronger and work on some skill work Its u impossible to ignore the contrast when you understand some of the um things that have happened in our country over the last year and then you look at basketball and see how international it is Oh yeah In America the country that invented the sport Well well they teach the game in Europe I know Dr Nay Smiths relatives will get mad at me I know How about that ankle breaker by Geler cheering They teach the game in Europe like we used to teach it fundamentally They actually work on fundamentals applause and cheering Whoops Whoops Whoop Ah that is the definition of an ankle breaker Little bit like Montgomery in his Long Beach State days huh Yeah you bet A Ger blow by and Kilte follows Well were back to 20 So balance has been restored Shantae a lot of things to learn if youre University of Portland If youre Kyle Smith youve got to be pleased particularly with the effort particularly the attention to the scouting report what they needed to do Excellent performance by Kyle Smith and the Stanford Cardinal And so Stanford gets to seven and one As you see that hasnt happened here since precoid
