Notre Dame head coach a frustrating final season for the Irish but hes hoping they can get some confidence here at the end of the regular season no disappointment in his career hes been here 23 years 13 AC NCAA tournament appearances Hall of Fame coach in my opinion wake in the home white Notre Dame in the road blue and its the Demon Deacons and start with the ball all eyes on Tyree Appleby Randolph just hit on it could very well be the first ACC player to lead the league and assists and points and yet hes not nearly as much of the ACC Player of the Year conversation as alondis Williams was just a year ago although because of the success of the team and I think the field goal percentage of a lot is just a little bit better take a look at the Notre Dame starting five and get used to seeing the King these five faces because Mike Bray without his starting backcourt today they usually only run seven guys so with two out youre left with these five well the good news for Mike Grays team is they dont foul much so lets see how this works if hes gonna go to the bench at all and Wake Forest dealing with some injuries of their own Demari Monsanto out for the remainder of the Season had surgery this morning to repair a torn patella and meniscus how do you go about replacing Monsanto Randolph you dont I mean hes as good a shooter there is in a country that you cant replace him what he did to defenses and dictating the coverage thats missing no not its by committee the officials Lee Casal Rainey Steins and AJ Desai stopping play because of a clock issue Music Applause Music well get back to Monsanto in just a second lets talk about those Notre Dame injuries Marcus Hammond JJ Starling both out tonight thats 20 points a game that youve removed from a offense that desperately needs their production well the shooting is surrounding what youre really missing is your two creators those are the guys that put pressure on the rim that created for everyone else and with those guys missing its imperative that Notre Dame just be really strong and fluid in how they run their airport offense because they dont have anyone to break the defense down so expect them to attack matchups and maybe post up some of their guards to get torn inside and paint touches the dangerous thing with this Notre Dame team is you still have Cormac Ryan Dane Goodwin Nate lushaski and Trey wurtz four Shooters on the court that any one of them could go off they can and theres about the same makes you they might be able to go you know what theyve got a misleading record yeah you know a lot of people would look at 10 and 18 and 2 and 15 in the ACC and go this is an easy win for Wake Forest that it is not this is a team in Notre Dame that could show up and shoot the lights out theyve been in every game in their last five games theyve lost all of them but I really thought that they would be a lot better than this and theyre still hoping to get it going Applebee the steal and the easy two racc double header continues from WinstonSalem Randolph Childress Jay alter with you and you havent missed much Wake forested Early twonothing lead what a great answer Van Allen Lube in the Freshman rocks the rim wake a little late in their rotation and defense and youre accustomed to this team in the past and then Adam Lubin hadnt started much and hadnt played much early and youre used to them picking and popping and that time they cut to the rim and got a dunk Commack Cormac Ryan seals it away Works a trailing three he hits it told you Notre Dame can get hot from three you see there theyre one of the better soon we had the two of the better threepoint shooting teams in the ACC and we talked about that and you definitely dont want to lead trade Works open a bit of a trap game for Wake Forest backtoback losses at Miami and at NC State youre about damari Monsanto playing without him for the first time and youve got a Notre Dame team that despite their record has the ability to come in and make some threes and pull the upset when you get this late in the season in conference play throw the records out its just a familiarity with everyone you know the records dont matter Music the first meeting between these two teams earlier this month in South Bend wake one 8164 but Monsanto had 28 points in that game without him they lose so someones got to pick up that production you just saw just the past there Applebee penetrated kicked it out to Bobby Clinton he didnt take the shot took it that time that time he pulls the trigger and connects on kill he didnt shoot it the first time you dont have time to shooting just shooting you know if hes out there that was going up early but second time he didnt hesitate had successful surgery this morning Steve Forbes says hes feeling good words answers with a nice pullup pop expect Works to be really aggressive hes from local he is hes from Charlotte picked on him earlier because hes from home I asked him was his family coming he said no his brothers playing in the playoffs his brothers in the playoffs so he said all his familys down watching his brother play in the local playoffs coming in now wake just comes out great sign up your way wake fan with Bobby Clinton knocking down his first shot man in the starting lineup big smile too from the Freshman from Sweden heres Andrew Carr awake has the height advantage in this game with an undersized Notre Dame team its accustomed to playing small theyve been playing small all year they do a great job of not filing Applebee oh hes so crafty drills the three coming off the ball screen no help no one showed thats why hes leading the ACC and scoring Applause now the name doesnt have the Creator but they sure can shoot it get the feeling points are not going to be at a premium tonight that both of these teams are just gonna light it up I dont think either one of these teams are great on a defensive end of the floor I think rebounding will be the underrated aspect of this game Notre Dames usually undersides to get out rebounded quite a bit Carr has his right hand taped And he grimaced as he fumbled that ball lashesky knocks down a three Notre Dame shooting lights out to start this game Music officials the Irish a 108 lead and theyve made both threes theyve taken tonight Applause in March we move even faster Applause each round together and we dont let up until we are the ACC champions Music Applause Music Applause DC champions thats our move the 2023 Ally ATC womens basketball tournament Notre Dame there has been no luck for the Irish in the ACC take a look at these close losses and thats why that 2 and 15 Conference record is so deceiving just one in eight in games decided by five points or less just so difficult to win in this league and in any league but when youre getting these one possession game two possession games just make it so difficult to win and its just hard and theres nothing you can do when you got this type of experience as a coach and stuff it for Wake Forest you take a look at their close games theyve been in plenty of them and about even certainly better than Notre Dame has fared this year in close games but now playing without Monsanto Clinton certainly getting the green light in his absence and Clements played well this year he shot the ball very well and hes very capable of it but its just not theres no replacing you know the threat of what it does to the defense what massato brings to this team Trey word straws to foul Notre Dame perfect from Deep so far two for two team that lives and dives by the three youd expect them to continue the firing them up all night long but theyre not going to stop shooting I mean whether they make them or not thats a different story you mean in this first meeting first matchup between these two they were four of 21 hmm there were already two for two tonight and the last five games in particular Notre Dame has played High Caliber teams Virginia Duke North Carolina theyre owing five in their last five but the average loss of three points that theyre right in it they just cant finish yeah you know its just for them its just one possession game because theyre so lethal from behind the threepoint line and theyre also a team you wonder sometimes if they wear down they dont play with a lot of depth and then theyre missing two more starters tonight so be interesting to see as this game wears on does Wake Forest try to take advantage of that and go to their bench three seconds to shoot Hildreth denied theres two on the timer in Wake well have it underneath their own hoop what do you try and do here coming out of bounds just great foam ball defense against Hilda hes just so big and physical and thats why they could win on him I mean his size to help bother him as he gets to the rim Applebee no angle and thats a shot clock violation all the attention on Tyree Appleby thats every game but even more so with Monsanto out well because now you focus more your defense is more restricted you dont have the space I think the pressure from Monsanto not being here was you didnt rotate off him plus you had to have a really Elite defender on him because he was so explosive with this size he just elevated over defenders the shot right over top of him into the game first off the bench and he knocks it down seven nothing Notre Dame run they lead by six we talked about it today and shoot around its just there was a activity level a pop about Notre Dame they came in you know they didnt come in with a team worrying about their record they came in expected to win this game Music just comes in hes just strong with the ball there gets out of the tribe kicks it to the Zona thats a big possession there because if thats a steal it goes the other way and you come down in an unforced turn over there and then come down and get out of the foul wait because uncharacteristically A little sloppy here approaching the Midway point in the first half careless turnovers against a team that doesnt pressure you know another game is not a fresh routine the other thing is Wake Forest is yet to get to the foul line thats something that particularly Tyree Appleby likes to do but this Notre Dame team very disciplined they dont often foul wake is Wake Achilles heel has been turned over to basketball and you have to do a better job against this Notre Dame team because they do not pressure sometimes you can just get caught trying to do too much and it looks like what theyre doing now is but it aint falls back into their 23 Zone foreign Music foul at The Rim sends the Freshman Zach Keller to the foul line with Matt Zona in there giving Notre Dame a little size played five minutes of the loss against North Carolina but 16 minutes at Virginia those will probably be the only six guys you see for Notre Dame tonight with Marcus Hammond and JJ Starling both out in the Irish backcourt well I can tell you this Zona and Lubin lineup has not played much this year together Tuesday nights double header on acc Network starts at seven Clemson and Virginia a battle atop the ACC you not want to miss that and then The nightcap Virginia Tech against Louisville a terrific double header right here on acc Network Music what a crazy day in the ACC Randolph you have Florida State hitting a 40foot buzzer beater to beat Miami the Hurricanes were in the drivers seat to win the ACC regular season now you could argue Virginia Clemson Pittsburgh and of course Miami one of those four is going to win it you just dont know which somebodys going to win it now you know that that we know thats about the only thing we know foreign Lubin stayed with it second effort was good its been out of lube and starts that center now hes kicked out to the four with Matt Zona at Center you see because of this lineup theyre out in their Zone this is a big line up there with Mike Grays team know the Irish this is as big as youll see them get all season Clinton a three much needed and he knocks it down from the corner Bobby Clinton I mean today and walk through JJ Starling tried to give it a go so I cant imagine they even thought that this lineup would be possible now Nate lashewskys playing at the three hes playing on the perimeter now and he started this season as the fiveman rattles in and out no good then Alan Lubin couldnt come up with the offensive rebound Music Clinton passes up the three looks inside car everything but the Finish thank you foul called great pass there by 216 guys you dont usually have a 16 guy that can come off a ball screen or get downhill and make a play Music Applause you know whats funny Randolph is this Notre Dame team you look at that first meeting in South Bend totally different when you take Hammond and Starling out so yeah you won by 17 but then you dont have tamari Monsanto who had 30 in that frame they singlehandedly brought you back that game yeah he went on a tears started you know shooting from the parking lot even that though that game was only 22 days ago yeah a lot has changed these are almost two different lineups that youll see throughout the night so how much can you really take away from that meeting well you can already because we can see we know the name were having a lineup on the floor that hadnt played together all year yeah you cant Scout this youre seeing it for the first time good win nothing but the bottom of the net Notre Dame shooting lights out theyre a perfect three for three from three both teams are shooting it as we thought they would shoot me well from behind a threepoint line we got six threes combined Music Lucas Taylor into the game for Wake Forest and he answers with a big time triple such a confidence booster for Lucas Taylor first time hes played since midDecember in the Appalachian State game grabs the rebound too what a burst Off the Bench Lucas Taylor is right now for Wake Forest has it here and hes got some playing time early in the year he actually started four games for the Dixon told earlier this afternoon hed be playing so he surely looks like hes got himself ready to go here he was calling for it on that possession too hes feeling it after that three when your first one go win you got to be ready to shoot the next one sophomore Guard from Wake Forest North Carolina Music foreign Applause Music Notre Dame too right now you should have been a little patient they want to control the pace because they just dont have enough bodies the threes keep falling for Notre Dame Trey wurtz make it four for four from Beyond The Arc for the Irish he works with the heat check shot early here and we were talking about that first beating theyve already got four threes thats how many they had in South Bend three weeks ago this is a scary team because you dont you cant get into a jump shooting contest with Notre Dame I dont think anyone wants to do that Taylor that time misses and thats the type of season its been for the Irish Dane Goodwin throws it at the foot of Nate lecheski itll be wake forth ball when we come back we got us a good horse game going on right now Trey herkson take that Ill take this three and go our Japan wait after the frustrating lawsuit NC State on Wednesday night Randolph I think Steve Forbes summarized really well with a lot of coaches who we talked to throughout the season think about the net he just cant explain the metric anyone you talk to cant seem to piece together why certain teams are ranked higher and you look at wake forests resume and two and eight in Quad one thats probably going to cost them the NCAA tournament if theyre four and six or five and five theyre probably in but what do you what do you think of Steves take I completely agree I think everyones frustrated by it I think it equally is with The Narrative of the ACC and I think some of the leagues are they get you know they get quad one wins and quad one opportunities that this league doesnt get and I just dont understand it I dont think anyone does its frustrating its frustrating for us you know having to watch it and you just dont understand its just unreal I I think its something has to be done and I think it has to change in some way yeah and you look at Virginia Miami two teams that are I think top 15 top 10 teams although they didnt really play like it today no not today I Its just tough because it feels like the net rankings are set in November and December and they just stayed that way because then you big 12 and Big Ten teams even if they lose eight nine games which as I say is ridiculous we watched the Penn State and Ohio State game the other day and Penn State wins on the road and its a quad one win against Ohio State a team that lost 14 to 15 its just ridiculous and no one has an answer to it but Applebee doesnt care if he comes down and says take that with your net he has been so consistent all season for this Demon Deacons team you know obviously the losses at Miami and at NC State feels like a missed opportunity even heard Steve Forbes there Say itll probably cost them the NCAA tournament this year the thing that the Demon Deacons have going for them is you have three games here at the end of your season they get some momentum go in to the ACC tournament 20 and 11 and then you never know what can happen in Greensboro you never know crazy things have been known happening you know that better than anybody brother I can tell you that theres some crazy things have happened in Greensboro so but no theyre playing well theyre playing confident they need to get back to winning and doing things like that maybe Lucas Taylor is the answer playing for the first time since midDecember hes hit two big threes and its a sixnothing run for Wake Forest and thats what you need a guy that hadnt played much didnt spend time pouting gets an opportunity late in the season hes taking advantage of it offensive foul going the other way and Wake Forest right back in this game getting the crowd into it for the first time tonight Music Taylor takes a seat after a big time three Applause hes done his part coming in giving this group a spark Applause Music a couple rebounds knocked down a couple of threes Music Applause Carr lines it up too much on it gets his own rebound though keeps it alive for Wake Forest Appleby pulls the trigger two really good looks so just cant connect yeah its gonna be a make or Miss game I dont think he you know the honesty about both of these teams but they struggle on the defensive again so getting your shots wont be an issue its going to be making them and when you dont rebound even without tamari Monsanto who leads the ACC in threes out tonight Wade can still take it a lot of them theyve taken 13 made six Cormac Ryan fouled on his way to the rim two Demon Deacons all over weve got a good one one point game Randolph we do and this guy here Lucas Taylors doing his part to get the Deeks in it back in this game got a great one here in WinstonSalem Applause every now and again an athlete desperately needs to win you look at the last meeting it Cameron Indoor Armando Bay caught only 14 points well it looks like Caroline Carolina might have found something tonight right now theyre up 10 on Virginia if they can beat Virginia and then Duke next week that that would put them in the field right I think it does I think itll give them enough I think theyre in a battle right now against Virginia they got to close that game out and not get caught looking ahead because theres a game in Florida State on the road and thats where frequency has struggled yeah great Point too because with Florida State a Seminoles team that much like Notre Dame so much better than their record and they proved that today go on the road at Miami whos playing for it ACC regular season title going up top Matthew Marsh count it plus the foul Matthew Duncan Marshall doing all of what he does every game comes off dont jump with him watch ahead call Matt Ryan and one Music its early like man you got to get him to Baltimore man wow but its a misleading stat because 59 of your 73 makes have been dunks hey no one can play with Shaq did it thats true no hes hes definitely does his role Well Springs Rose really hard plays really good interior defense for the Dukes all tied up at 27 back and forth game here in WinstonSalem Dane Goodwin so good on the Block this time he lost the ball Lucas Taylor again hes made a big impact on this game Goodwin and Taylor rolling around nice shot by the officials to get in there quickly Goodwin is really good in the post I think I said we talked about it earlier theyre theyre going to struggle inside getting inside got some help from Martian yeah guys getting on the floor getting after a little bit should you want to see from a guy like Lucas Taylor as well sophomore guard hadnt played much Applause Music this season hes getting down early hes giving his team a spark now hold on Dane Goodwin standing at the free throw line now hes backed off I thought the original call on the floor was a jump off yeah the jump ball was the call Dan Goodwins saying that the foul line saying I was fouled now either way wouldnt be shooting because Wake Forest only has committed four fouls like there was anything malicious done there so I think itd be fine here I think its a standard jump ball yeah Music if anything Taylor had the possession it was good win that fell on him yeah no harm no foul officials take a look at the monitor confirm the call jump ball so to stay Notre Dame because they had the possession arrow foreign Applause called for the moving screen and the timing of the play was thrown off Cormac Ryan slipped got up late and shezewski had to move his feet a little bit to get him an angle to try to get him open Notre Dame no made field goals the last three minutes its a loud Wake Forest to tie this game now looking for the lead wide open three too much on it Hildreth offensive rebound Taylor another opportunity right to the rim hes rejected but stays with it Applause Music now Appleby in attack mode decides not to shoot Taylor with five seconds turns it over Applause chaotic possession for Wake Forest yeah the Geeks are battling there they got three opportunities there and finally they turned it over and something theyve been doing and Notre Dames been punishing him and scoring days nine points off turnovers right now and Wake Forest with seven offensive rebounds in this game but it feels like they havent cashed in on those Second Chance opportunities great look inside Matthew Marsh delivers again feed the big man get that big man in the ball hes not dunking hes finishing great no look there Music being solid doing what he does catches it low inside off the great no look pad thats a difficult pass sometimes Biggs youre not expecting it but first lead for Wake Forest since it was two nothing back on top 2927 with 5 45 remaining against his first half Music expect a ton of ball screens now with this lineup out there they got their multiple handlers and the chesky can shot fake and get in pain himself Brian steps into a three cant hit it both teams with their five men will set a ton of ball screens like this drag screen here Music whenever we got the position on the floor theyll switch one through four Apple beats so much speed Runs been quiet no points for him tonight feeds it inside now Appleby again under 10 on the shot clock Appleby fires the three and thats it Applause its a 142 Wake Forest run foreign hes creating it its a big time shot late in the clock theres Cormac Ryan just comes back and answers for the Fighting Irish immediately quiets the crowd here at the Joel Notre Dame needed that you saw that last possession though you see mansanto being out a couple times their car turned down to three Lucas Taylor didnt have it he turned down to three and those are not open looks you give to the Dukes of mansanto was out there on the floor Music Applause Music crowd here and Winston nothing like that one back and forth game continues its been a wild day and the ACC feels like every games coming down to the wire why not this one as well yeah thats going to be a good one I think both of these teams are Music throw the records out theyre going to compete theyre going to take out the personalities that they coach and we have a Robbie Carmody sighting for Notre Dame Redshirt senior guard who has only played five minutes all season hes had to deal with so many horrific injuries throughout his Notre Dame career but is stuck with it been a great practice player for Mike Bray a great leader for that locker room and 24 and blue on the court right now for the Irish Notre Dame saying that was a tipped Ball but its going to be Wake Forest possession Demon Deacons leading by two four minutes left in first Music Justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 18th to the 26th as ACC Unity week Randolph Childress Jay alter with you weve got a fun one in WinstonSalem back and forth we go both teams shooting the ball really well Notre Dame 52 percent from the floor Wake Forest has made Seven threes and without damari Monsanto thats about seven more than I thought theyd make in this first half and they had more I think they turned down a couple of shots that theyve had but again theyve taken the right shots from behind the York right now theyre actually shooting it better from a threepoint line than they are from inside the arc Tyree Appleby shes been electric all night long all season long has it here thought about it three now shoots it was halfway down did not fall another offensive rebound thats eight offensive rebounds for the Demon Deacons but they had zero Second Chance points yeah they hadnt finished but they capitalize on them but eventually they will like that you cant keep giving a team second and third chances great job there finally capitalizing on the offensive rebound the announcers Jinx there lets Wake Forest finally cashes it on an offensive rebound fourpoint lead for the Demon Deacons with a little more than three minutes to play in this first half Blakes doing a really good job of chasing perimeter guys over ball screens then Allen Lubin cleans up the spill Notre Dame answers with some Second Chance points for themselves its a horse game right now it really is theyre happy in each other Theyre copying each other really fun game for the neutral though I think the whole you know for both of these teams theyve struggled defensively offensively on the offensive end there hasnt been many issues with these clubs theyre capable of putting up points their their issues have been getting stops three seconds on the shot clock Appleby has to heave Way Off the Mark so you think this will come down to who can string together enough stops yeah I think who can get stops and off to threepoint line will play a big part of whats going on here but who can get stopped when they need it and rebound the basketball dont Notre Dames doing a really good job of punishing the switches that time they were able to get Applebee trying to reaching around Goodwin on the drive then Alan Lubin odd given go off the leg freshman regathers great defense car smothering then Allen Lubin Music Hildreth youre right wakes hesitant down to shoot without Monsanto out there I think now Carr says Ill take it and Ill make it car says Im Not Afraid give it to me guys the largest lead of the game for Wake Forest at five not much resistance against either team and again Carl just catches him with his size and length Applause catches it in Rhythm and elevation takes a shot its not known for his threepoint shooting but he does shoot it 34 percent Music its great defense there walls up blocks The Freshman tell him gets it out of here and then catches it in rhythm youre not up on him comes late late close out there knocks it down Andrew Carr getting it done on both ends Notre Dame enters the bonus so one and one for Nate lecheski Music the Ally ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins right down the road at Greensboro on Wednesday every matchup but the championship game right here on acc network and on the ESPN app our first round coverage begins 12 30 Eastern time Wednesday Notre Dame will take it with him be back in 30 seconds Applause Music Applause never done that before Music now for Mike Bray this is familiar territory Notre Dame nine games of the ACC decided by five points or less its a one possession game right now how different would this Irish season feel if it was eight and one in those games instead of one and eight I mean they take five and three true I mean five and four anything right now but one and eight I mean that team is you youre just surprising with a team with so much experience is that a confidence thing that has to be I mean I think this team is so battle tested and theres so many parts from a team that went to the returning players from a team I went to the double a tournament a year ago won two games in the tournament yeah they did well yeah and I think you know you I think Atkinson is the biggest piece that I think they miss the most his ability when jump shots werent falling and being able to dump it inside to him I think they just missed them dealing itll be interesting to see what is next for Mike Bray because he reiterated it today and it was in the press release he is not retiring its just the end of his chapter with Notre Dame after 23 terrific years and he theres gonna be another chapter written it is he might be up here with us he might be on this island I poke with him about all the rumors Ive been hearing about him and hes linked with hes going to be linked with every open job of the country already yeah and he should be he should be I should ask him about how was that Irish whiskey he got from Virginia yeah those are the gifts Mike brand has received from ACC teams do you get him anything Randolph I didnt I I but you know he told us well catch up later hell catch up with him at another time well I have to find out that it was really like I plan he joked he goes if Im taking another job youre coming with me yeah he joking about the Georgetown guys were both DMV guys yeah you guys so Ive known Mike for a long time did he recruit you no no I mean I I dont remember where Mike was when I was you talking forever ago I mean he might yeah you know its he wanted to know the name then he must have been to Delaware so it wasnt Delaware you you were you were above uh yeah I wasnt you were taking a look at the my blue hands he might have sent me a letter in the mail in the 10th grade after that it was like appreciate you coach but nah its so different now you know they describe getting a letter in the mail I know I wish it was still like that and Mike Bray thats part of the reason hes moving on from from Notre Dame is it just feels like this was a a chapter that was so successful but times have really changed and he thinks its good for both parties both Notre Dame and him to to move on I mean theres a lot of change going on throughout the last couple of years were losing a lot of legendary coaches now theres a lot of great coaches in the wing and theyre coming up up and coming guys and its just time I think he feels as though like Coach Wright did that coach Williams did like Coach K did and eventually coach bayheim and Coach ham down in Florida State these guys will turn the leaf you know turn the Rings over to some some other young great coaches now the alltime wins leader for Notre Dame pass Digger Phelps is 482 and the other thing is even though he wont be on the sideline for Notre Dame next season its still going to be really well connected with the university he said still an ambassador for Life yes for the Irish and also going to help in the transition hell be on that hiring committee yes for who his replacement will be well you should with all the knowledge he has trade work try to penetrate there and lost and handle keeps the possession of the basketball hell be able to help out and provide some insight to whomever making that final decision Music not many coaches he also joked about today you know hes just to retire somewhere without getting fired yeah thats a victory all within itself absolutely and right now hes in a dog fight on the road luceski lines up a three cant connect gotta open look there at the top of the key to Nate liszewski just not able to knock it down Music Steve Forbes with the use it or lose it time out and elects to use it gonna draw something up for the final shot of the first half there are all kinds of products in this world things that make life easier more and more fun but New York lifes product is different its 12 000 experts whose responsibility is to be there in most difficult times people who know the most valuable things in life arent things at all this is our product this is what we do so this is the first time weve seen Steve Forbes Team without damari Monsanto after he went down in the NC State game had surgery earlier this morning to repair a torn patella and meniscus how would you assess the Wake Forest offense without Monsanto out there its industry when he offers have been with the Deeks overall I think at some point the remainder of the season they will miss him I mean his size and shot making ability is unmatched hes a good shooter that wasnt a customer right now the Deeks already have eight threes and a potential for another one here so just overall it hasnt affected the threepoint shooting Appleby fouled with under four seconds left in the half hell go to the line for one and one Music first trip to the foul line for Tyree Appleby tonight usually he visits it pretty frequently drives and puts so much pressure on your defenses but again this Notre Dame team does not file much theres your ACC scoring leaders Appleby leading the conference in both points per game and assists per game you mentioned it earlier Randolph chasing what alondis Williams was trying to do exactly this time a year ago buddy buddy buckets from Syracuse clipsed him from the you know for the on the final page what day of the season I dont believe anyone catches them to be honest I think I think he I think the assist total was gone theyre not going to catch that either I think hell finish strong you know strong enough on the offensive ending a tray words just passed it to the official strong half by both teams Deeks responded at the early run great job Mike Bragg with a big laugh Music Applause Music Applause youre here in WinstonSalem take a look at those scores Clemson a Beatdown on NC State who saw that coming Florida State shocks Miami at the buzzer that Virginia goes down to North Carolina which of those results shocks you the most I think the NC State won I mean Clemson that game was a 40point game at one time and thats you know I we hadnt seen a game we both was here and I mean Clemsons capable of that with the way they defended but I cant see them being Plus 40 Wake Forest gets a stop to start the second half and Clemson now puts them selves back in the title race in the ACC its going to come down to those four teams Clemson Virginia Pittsburgh and Miami I also think that win gets them back into the tournament they were on the first for out I think that that wents big and I think its a big win toward getting them in I think theyre deserving of it as well our ESPN bracketsologist Joe Bernardi as Ben Allen Lubin slams it home still has the Tigers on the outside looking in but thats as it stands now for Clemson theyve got an opportunity midweek against Virginia if they win that game then theyre a hundred percent in right now Clemson still next four out Im with you though I put them in you look at them today eye test tells you thats an NCAA tournament they talk about when teams are healthy if the committee looks at it that that team struggled with injuries and were missing guys I know the schedule always comes into play but theyre definitely an NCAA tournament team and deserving the nod to get in right back to Ben Allen Lubin back to back buckets for the Freshman hes starting the feast down low lets get more touches today no Hammond no Sterling hes get down no starting hes getting a couple touches that he usually dont get and hes capitalized on him and we showed you Bracketology and were way at the bottom Wake Forest still under consideration theyre above 500 in ACC play if they win the last three here its a favorable schedule for them theyd end up with 20 wins 20 wins and above 500 in conference play usually good enough to get you in but still well on the outside Music Applebee lays it off and thats a mans Jam from Matthew Marsh great Drive Great pass great finish by Martian traffic Music restores a threepoint lead for Wake Forest and you can imagine the pace is going to slow down something in the second half I mean both teams went to the bench a little bit but I expect him to ride their starters hard here in the second half both teams battling through injuries so no depth at their disposal tonight it may be these five the rest of the way for Notre Dame without Hammond and starling down low Marsh draws a foul Goodman was right there came over late in the rotation it was right underneath the rim and just great drive there about Applebee again another drop off by Marsh takes that strong dribble just gathers himself and overpowers the Freshman inside Music whats up Tangled Up underneath wurtz and Hildreth two quick fouls for this Notre Dame team and again with no bench not a lot of fouls at the disposal blocked out of bounds Detroit Works looking around hes like hey I hit the 40 twice here and theres no whistle and hell get the fighting for position clean block from Ben Allen Lubin Music a lot of talk about the Notre Dame veterans Van Allen lubins been a big bright spot for this Irish team theyre going to totally rebuild and retool their roster under a new head coach but then Allen Lubin at least to me is the one building block you have going into next season well the question would be is you know what does JJ starting do as well I mean they got top 100 recruits here that has decisions to make and you know I dont know if JJ starting will test the NBA but I think he can use another year to kind of develop his game but he has the physical tools that if he wants to put himself in it NBA draft and go forward I think hell have that opportunity misses the layup Wake Forest in transition Clinton cant connect but to your appointment you know Lubin therell be a bunch of schools calling for this young mans Service as a freshman guard freshman big out of Orlando is I mean hes already with 125 so far here Works lost the handle Scramble for the ball its a jump ball Applause Music possession arrow with Wake Forest Applause foreign Notre Dame has really cooled off from three they started this game four for four from Beyond The Arc since just one of eight an airstriki team and I think thats what hurts them I mean again we talked about it earlier they were only 4 21 early and came out tonight hit the first floor four and thats where theyre going to miss Hammond and theyre going to miss darling right now I mean when those guys arent but those guys missing they put pressure on the rim and they beat you off the dribble they dont really have a Creator out there right now so its putting so much pressure on him just running their offense efficiency efficiently and just getting shots and then when they get them they got to knock them down because I think wake is a much bigger team than and hurts them on the glass Music Applause heres core Mac Ryan been quiet today off the mark from three Ian manzato and two players I think they just shoot the basketball the way you want to teach it and looks good every time it leaves a hand Music these teams have both gone ice cold to start the second half in a scoring drought of two minutes and 30 seconds for both of them one possession game though these two teams have played close games all season long and its continuing tonight Applause The Venture X card from Capital One you earn two times miles on every purchase so noise canceling youre being too loud whats better than champ week and its almost here Randolph Childress Jay alter with you of course the New York Life ACC mens tournament Greensboro right down the road March 7th to the 11th every game on ESPNs family of networks on the ESPN app as well its wide open anybody can go into Greensboro and win it this year it is I think if you get once you get there everyone should have it a very high level of optimism that they can come out and win it I mean weve seen these teams get on rolls and right now we thought Miami was the most dominant team coming in and they struggled today lost the game to Florida State at home so its truly who can who shows up who shows out mad Zona frustration foul after the missed layup if I had to put you on the spot who would you who would you take today in Greensboro thats thats a thats a tough one I I I think you just today was indicative like yeah who do you thinks playing well going in I would have said maybe for NC State and then I mean look at that oh my gosh that game today was just baby could be Clemson I Id say this I think Pitts yeah people dont talk enough about Pittsburgh and certainly the most consistent team right now I just think theyre a tough matchup too with their four guards that they have I mean they they got a closed when Burton whos an allconference guard and and the question is going to be if you dont show up theres plenty of teams now that are the bottom of the lead that are beginning to play Louisvilles a tough out Georgia Techs playing better Florida States playing better who would have said Virginia Tech this time a year ago two last year yeah yeah they enter in and win four games in four days yeah I wouldnt want to see them either no I mean those are teams you dont want to see earlier in the lower seat of the bracket Music here in Winston theres theres Lids on the rim right there yeah neither team has scored in the last four minutes hey that is four minutes without any points for either team after a first half that was nothing but points yeah what was happening is both teams too they play outside in and I expect wake to get to now theyre trying to get Hilton going inside and post him up has a step and he misses the layup travel there yeah yeah he he was just trying to get himself going there hes been in a couple of scuffles with a couple of guys and its a physical game and just quite not quite been able to get the ball in the basket here Music these two teams have missed 12 shots in a row making 13 Im gonna make jumper out here on the limb someones going to score on on this possession or in the next 13 minutes and 30 seconds Apple beam hes the guy you can count on Tyree Appleby delivers I mean hes the guy hes been the guy all year for the Deeks and Applause claim for the ACC Player of the Year as well I think if he ends with as the leader and points it assists itll be tough to pick him yes but you know even today in Forbes and I agreed on this I I think you reward winning and we both talked about what a lot of the awards yeah I think that could be a tie breaker if you think two guys are tied you take the one whos on the better team Hildreth comes alive is that three and its the largest lead of the night for Wake Forest you know just said I had enough of that frustrated again stops in wanted to knock down a three putting the Deeks up largest leader today up eight here in WinstonSalem Applause Music Applause Music Music penetration is scooping late breaks a five minute drought and Gilda just comes down and bangs his first basket the V3 for him yeah the lid is off for Wake Forest back to back baskets after going four minutes without one its the largest lead for either team tonight and it feels like the crowds into it for the first time finally starting to rock on a Saturday night well making a couple of shots will help but do that to you like a five minute drought well Notre Dames still on a five minute and 46 second scoring drought yeah I was close to putting out some cards man its not playing a game challenge I think game with dunk or something like I didnt know what to do oh the Irish desperate for a bucket at least when both teams were missing and kept it a one possession game now Mike Brays team down eight but again when youre a jump shooting team youre just you know shooting the three like that way they dont have anyone to take pressure off and beat anybody off the dribble I think Van Allen Lubin has been good dropping it in the post Hood uh Cormac Ryan hes been quiet tonight but thats a huge bucket six minutes without any points finally comes to an end quite a little different defense just missed shots no theyve been playing D I think you know what I think both coaches went into halftime and said we need to start getting some stops thats what it was well well say that now there were a couple misplayups in there big time three Davey and Williamson delivers you dont want to leave him open and thats what he does I mean Damian Williamson is a 39 threepoint shooter and catches that one in Rhythm and knocks it down and for a senior thats been with four of us you know I asked Forbes today about him and asked him you know hes going to miss him when he first got here Damian Williamson came in and just allows you to coach him and hes just tough hes as tough as anyone in there is in college basketball he doesnt get the notoriety a lot but plays a lot bigger and tougher than people giving credit for Music Williamson again that way off the mark but he gets his own rebound leads to another three Hildreth no good Applause Music the other shot the first one was a little hesitant on that one I thought he just made one just dont even hesitate knock it down just like that Goodwin quick release gets his own Miss and draws the foul Hildreth again hes been on the floor a lot tonight his first foul as Williams hit his first buck of the night a three Demon Deacons up by nine download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life it supports the local Boys and Girls Club score points for your school and after the tournament your local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking Randolph Childress Jay alter with you Notre Dame missed nine straight shots when scoreless for six minutes its a loud wake Force to open up a nine point lead and Trey Ward struggling to get it in five second violation Wake Forest has really stepped up the defensive intensity they have theyre starting to get stops and again this loaded aim offense is struggling right now theyre really they dont have like I said theyve lost their two guards they can give the ball to create off the bounce and this defensive Wake Forest youre starting to get after him a little bit offensive foul moving screen Applause Carl was trying to get out of the way there and Music accidentally ran into yo just a Defender and refs got to call that on him but hes just trying to get out of the way forward saying my guy got pushed he didnt like the call Music I think Steve Forbes has been in a constant state of frustration ever since Wednesday night in Raleigh well I think he knew going into that game that was a big part of their NCAA tournament hopes was getting a win like that either the Miami game or the NC State game so I think some of that press conference was just frustration yeah losing those two games just felt like that was the opportunity to yeah to bolster the resume yeah to get that win that that signature win coming up right after us stick with us on acc Network its been a crazy day in the ACC and the best way to get fully caught up nothing but Nat Kelsey Riggs the crew will get you in studio right after this game goes final Music Id say this has been the craziest Saturday in the ACC so far this season and it feels like every Saturday is but you got Florida State beating Miami on the road Clemson laying the hammer on NC State Pittsburgh almost put 100 up on Syracuse yeah I think its so you get this late in the year its just such a familiarity so you shouldnt be surprised I I think the biggest surprise is that some of these wins the road win did Clemson win at home is just I mean on the road is just shocking I mean that that was a game that was I watched the attendance it was a nearly a sold out crowd nearly 20 000 there and it went home early when you look at the box scores see the highlights what was the reason I get you know what was the recipe for the success for the for the Tigers today I think theyre healthy and theyre one of the teams that can beat you in all three levels PJ Hall inside gets going Hunter Tysons having an allacc type of year and and I think that guard play is just as strong as anybodys as far as Chase Hunter is a good Great lead guard and today Brevin Galloway just shot the lights out and hes capable of doing that so when theyre healthy they have an identity that team defends and they can score and theyre a team that easily can go in the accs weekend and win it I mean I think they theyre just a strong team on both sides of the basketball is it Panic time for Tony Bennett in Virginia backtoback losses Boston College and today North Carolinas Appleby Banks it a three no no I would call it Panic time I mean theyre a team that struggles the score and when the pace gets up and they get to a you know a game like that I think they just they just lost the game on the road losing the Carolina and Chapel Hill isnt a bad thing Carolina struggles on the road Big Time bucket plus the foul then Allen Lubin hes been the brightest spot for Notre Dame tonight hes played really really well I mean hes already up to 14 points and just having his way inside mean again this is a top top 100 recruit you know freshman and hes been in and out of the starting lineup but hes sitting here now going at the line for his 15th Point already with five rebounds and with that made foul shot a career high for Van Allen lube and on the road tonight in WinstonSalem 15 points need some help though Notre Dame still down by nine Wake Forest in the drivers seat with a little more than nine minutes left in regulation I think Mike Grays been challenging this group to defend more in the man to man I mean this team used to play much more Zone than they have man and I think hes just challenging these guys like hey if you if you want to win in this league you got to put your chest on people and you got to sit down and you got a guard and Tyree Appleby you know its coming you still cant stop it and they went over that play and shoot around today that Euro handoff playing for three in Applebee Ive watched him do that I know four or five times this year you know its coming and you still cant stop it 19 points for Applebee continues to build his case for ACC player of the year and banana Louvin comes right back off the distance scores adding to his career his his season high that was a heat check from Appleby might have forced it but you can give him that after what hes given to the Demon Deacons not just tonight but all season long well theres certain shots to certain players take it to live with hes one of them hes taking care of the basketball and hes making shots he also has six assists Applause luceski lines up a three doesnt drop bounces out to Goodwin fresh shot clock stolen away by Appleby and Goodwin called for the intentional foul ripped the Jersey thats an easy call for the officials just a frustration fouled by a veteran that knows better and good one struggling tonight its only one of seven from the floor Applause you know just has the ball stolen from him and its just a frustrating frustration foul and hes just reacted in a way of Music his team two shots in the ball and again when youre struggling from the field and these guys want to win theyve been struggling so bad theyve lost six straight theyre wearing this is wearing on them theyve had so much success hes been a part of winnings in his career and none of these veteran guys like the way this seasons going and they dont turn things around in this last eight minutes theyll be heading to Seventh Street loss and who would have thought a team that made the NCAA tournament in one two games a year ago would be in this position to take a look at Applebees numbers what he is doing in this league again a year ago we were saying it was historic alondis Williams its never happened and yet Appleby I just feel like is not getting that same love no I I think because of you know I cant explain why I I just think that people arent talking about as much because we just saw is that our fault is that our fault it could be it could have been because were still were still seeing the same storyline oh its never happens never happened and then so people I think now just not giving him credit but theres nothing he really is and something well talk about when we come back if youre a transfer sitting out there Wake Forest has to be the top of the list Music Tyree Appleby has scored or assisted on Wake forests last 11 points were having the conversation before the break he is not getting enough love Alanis Williams last years ACC player of the year you could argue Tyree Applebys having an equally or even better season I mean you can I think hes run away with the assist you know lead this year and hes continued on that pace right now he already has he already has six this game and I think hell finish up with more but again hes Unstoppable here hes leading the ACC in minutes played hes put so much pressure on you he does it in so many different ways and and Forbes just puts him in so many different situations off the dribble and off the catch I mean running half court stats he just pushed the ball in his hands late clock so hes gonna have scoring opportunities and you just nothing you can do about it hes a really good player so now if youre Steve Forbes gonna recruit the transfer portal again you have a twoyear sample size and alondis Williams and Tyree Appleby to say to a kid come here look at what you do I think theyre just adding to the long history of elite guard plays this University yeah for quite some time and no no no it even remember that number 22 is hanging in the Raptors up top oh Bobby Clinton rips the rim off with that alleyoop Bobby Clinton is gonna be so good he he scored a lot early and hit a couple threes early and now hes catching lobs and finishing at the bank Lucas Taylor this time throwing it up top wow throwing up to the big Swede Music Bobby Clinton is so talented gonna be exciting to watch and see his development in the future of the Deeks critical time right now for Notre Dame yeah theyre in the danger zone right now Trey wurtz knows it rejected at The Rim Wake Forest gonna run Clinton Scott Notre Dame and match up Music wide open three Williamson owes halfway down didnt drop saves with Wake Forest underneath their own hoop great effort there by Carr going to the glass wasnt able to come up with it but created another possession here for the Deeks last time they run the brand that play Appleby took the three and hit it this time on the drive rattled in and out again thats two that were halfway down on that possession I think this is the difference we talked about it before is where Mike Bray has challenged his group know the name I mean usually this team will begin but fall back in place so much Zone even with their bigger lineup on the floor right now hes hes going back and hes like hey were gonna have to defend man man put your chest on people stay in front of the ball and guard now Notre Dames falling into another scoring drought the second half has been so unkind for the Irish offensively five of 21 from the floor oh of seven from three and thats the type of half its been but right now with the lineup on the floor they really only have trade words to initiate offense and the other guys out there theyre good Shooters and good scores inside theyre just not good at creating offense so theyre gonna have to rely so much on the half corset and right now theyre back to their big lineup again and there you have JJ Starling and Marcus Hammond there watching and those were the two guys that created so much offense for him and now between the group they get out there is just massive theres a big they got their started oh Zona Lubin and see have all started at the five man for them throughout the year its the opposite of the way theyve played all season long yes and they have to go Zone with this lineup I mean I I cant imagine again with JJ Starling actually warming up and shoot around today that they expected to play this lineup but now theyve gone to more than Zone that weve known in the play throughout the year Ella gets them a stop now can they cash in on the other end good one passes up the three heres Matt Zona and now Trey wurtz I dont know Zona knew he had Hill to be going him that time he could have scored turned around and scored on him in the post ripped away Lucas Taylor been a big bright spot Off the Bench for Wake Forest great pass Andrew Carr hammers it home its all Wake Forest how about Lucas Taylors been giving the Deek some great minutes creating finding plays finding guys Applause the defense here by the Deeks helped by Clinton on the Block and then Lucas Taylors been given so many good minutes coming and knocking down shots here turning down the shot finding the car for easier basket to get it done on both ends of the floor here second half Wake Forest outscoring Notre Dame 2413 this was a one possession game for pretty much the entire first half now what changed well I think the defensive intensity of the Deeks turned up I mean theres not much of a threat to be theyve been vulnerable to teams beating them off the bounce and beating them off the dribble and Notre Dame just doesnt have that and they have size they have length and I think youre seeing thats taking this toll and then its forces Notre Dame team to rely on players theyre just Zone and hes and he hasnt played much its an Irish team that is yet to win away from home have not won a game outside of South Bend they are oh and ten Zona passing it to the front row and again again coming out of a timeout we talked about it zone is experience but he hasnt played in quite some time hes been in a system but not a lot of live game minutes here this year and comes out and passes it to some friends on the first row there so midweek this week Notre Dame hosts Pittsburgh Pittsburgh the number one team in the ACC itll be Mike Brays final home game at Purcell Pavilion if the Irish have a last punch to throw this year it feels like its got to be that game send Coach Bray out with a win not going to be easy with the number one team in the ACC in town no that pit team and it guard plays wow I mean they can play Four guards out there at one time and they really get after you with a level of physicality and you know theyre a team that I I think will be in the postseason and a team that you just dont want to play and thats whats crazy about the net in Bracketology right now Joe linardi as it stands today has the pit team as a 10 seed if youre a seven seed or a two seed good luck with that youre thinking what did we do wrong oh my goodness its not a team youd want to play with the with the expectations that youre going to have with possibly being a twoseed I mean that team is capable of beating anybody because theyre going to get after you on the defensive end they have a physicality they got great guard play and they have a closure JB Burton is definitely a closing foul on the floor Notre Dame down 12 with 323 left Wake Forest through the drivers seat Music there are all kinds of products in this world February 18th to the 26th as ACC Unity week Randolph Childress J alter with you the Tyree Appleby show continues it WinstonSalem 12 point lead for the Demon Deacons this was a a big one for them backtoback mosses at Miami at NC State a lot of fans feel like that puts them outside the NCAA tournament conversation now this could have been a trap game for them and theyve responded very positively and theyve come out tonight and answered the bill I mean this is a team that came in and they dropped two Road games but theyve been good in this building theyve been a difficult out now Appleby thought Ryan kicked his leg out there to draw the foul I agree with him when I initially saw it I thought it was a shot he was playing for the foul when he jumped up I thought he kicked his leg out and Applebee had a something to gripe about there I thought he called they could have left without instead three coming for Ryan the ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins Wednesday right down the road at Greensboro Coliseum every matchup but the championship game right here on acc network of the ESPN app our first round coverage begins 12 30 Eastern time with nothing but now Music Notre Dames gonna have to extend their pressure here a little bit out of their character but theyre gonna have to come out in some type of pressure trying to unable to make the free throw so they cant set their defense now only made one of three Appleby dribbling up the court probably thinking ball dont lie a little bit I wasnt happy with that foul call Applause 216 assists for Tyree Appleby tonight theyre gonna put the ball in his hand and let him close it he draws fouls he finishes in these moments and Applause Williamson down the lane into traffic offensive foul Applause uncharacteristic for Wake Forest guards to get offensive fouls driving they do a great job of getting in the paint playing off two feet and I think Damian Williamson just thought hed didnt see the rotation there but great call Great Step Up just taking the charge there for the Irish Goodwin you know the threes Are Gonna Fly that one off the mark Applause and a tough night for Goodwin just I hadnt been able to get shots knock shots in look at that bottom left threepoint field goal started four for four red hot since one of 15 yeah and theres cooling off and then theres that Laughter I mean theres no one out there I mean Lubin has benefited when theyre not shooting threes because theyve been able to throw it inside to him for him to score but as we said earlier so many times today the inability to to attack the pain off the dribble to something that this team is missing without Hammond and Starling and its its showing itself right now step back three goes begging from Appleby and it stays with Wake Forest now Bobby Clintons been really good on the offensive glass tonight Applause wake Scott they handled so many offensive rebounds and opportunities and created so many Second Chance points I mean thats 15 offensive rebounds and and a doubledouble for Clinton but Notre Dame struggles with that they struggle to finish I mean struggle to finish possessions and think secure rebounds Ryan Coast to Coast lays it up and in you dont see them extending their pressure at a time hes late theyre just not built that way though theyre theyre lack of depth has enabled them to doing that all year they dont foul they usually mix up theyre playing more Zone lately I think coach Bray is challenging this group to defend better man to man another offensive foul Ryan draws it again Music after a wild day at the ACC you dont want to miss Tuesday nights doubleheader Clemson Virginia that is a mustsee matchup at seven right here on acc Network and then The nightcap Virginia Tech and Louisville I think that Clemson team is scary I mean people dont talk about them as much as I think they should another offensive foul that one against words you have to be talked to him last time and they rewarded him this time you know coming up right after us and a minute at 16 seconds youll be in studio the nothing but net crew will recap a wild day in the ACC crazy Saturday youll see Florida State beat Miami at the buzzer and going into Greensboro truly anybody can beat anybody its wide open I mean you saw some Road winds today that you just didnt expect to see and because you saw Appleby try to put the shesky in the blender there Applause Wake Forest defense the story in the second half held Notre Dames just 18 second half points we talked about earlier whos going to stops and second half Deke stepped up and Music trying to get stops and today credit to the Dukes they did it on the defensive end we knew that it was such a good offensive team we knew theyd continue to score but today dick stepped up and got stopped when they needed it as you look at the ACC scoreboard one game we havent talked a lot about Pittsburgh putting 99 up on the orange against that zone but again we talked about their guard plate I mean its as crazy as it sounds would you make Pitt the favorite they were 14th preseason second to last in the preseason but I think you have to after what theyve done well and its its also why I say I think of all the races that are wide open in the league I dont think coach of the year is I think thats capables and I think you can start putting his name on a reward I I just you know how many teams have lost hes lost his quote unquote preseason best player in Joel Hughley and then his team comes out and and just I mean pick 14 totally changes everything that they were doing and last year they played more inside out and now their entire system is changing theyre leading the ACC o its funny I doing a lot of games down in Pittsburgh this year one of their fans told me we were picked 14th out of 15 and the only reason we werent 15 out of 15 was because of hugely yes it was so so without them they they really should be 15 to 15 and yet without them they might win the league how about that its unbelievable isnt it to see credit to Jeff Capel and his staff yep I mean thats going to be I think an easy vote for oh coach I think thats the easiest vote of anything yeah the the first team allconference will be interesting Player of the Year like who wins that award I mean second team who wins it no idea you know Wake Forest wrapping up another home win I know that guys the first team all guys thats not up for debate I I think hes right there from player of the year as well you know then Allen Lubin weve said his name a lot tonight 19 points a career high for the Freshman eight rebounds as well hes been the bright spot for Notre Dame whos going to likely Fall to oh and 11 outside of South Bend thats a crazy stat it is it is and lets see what this team looks like when they get their garments back right when the Hammond and Sterling comes back because neither the injuries are significant we dont think their season ended no theyre going to be back for them tournament it doesnt seem again theyre capable of shooting the basketball well they just you know they go through coal streaks and they did tonight and they had no one else to fall on but the freshmen has stepped up and done his part been out in Louisville has been really really good and hes a bright spot to be interesting to see what he does with the decision of Mike Grayden to move on that season then you said it earlier you know people are going to be calling oh my gosh I I think the phone started ringing the day the announcement came out the microwave was going to be back and thats so tough brutal you know whoever the new coach is first thing hes got to do is recruit his own players well you better hope hes there before you when you get there because of that well do you think part of that timing was strategic for Mike Bray to say you know what I want to help this program so rather than wait to the end of the season Im going to tell them now so they can at least get a jump start on the search you know what I wonder that would be Mikes decision you know he could hes earned the right to say or do it whenever he wants I mean theres so much respect for him you wont find it just a better guy um you really wont and I I like I said I had the privilege of calling the game right when he made that announcement and I you know you heard me tell him today a shoot around that it was just something different about him like he wanted just to get that off his chest there was an energy about him like he was just so dialed in like I got to get this off yeah he said he decided over the Christmas break yes you can tell he was intentional about just making that announcement boy hed love to bottle up some of that magic he had in 2015 in Greensboro in a couple of weeks 10 days from now yeah he said hes going to tell the guys hey were packing for a few days yeah yeah why not and theyre a dangerous team when they when theyre healthy as weve seen in this league if you dont show up youre going to lose and it doesnt matter who youre playing and so many teams in the bottom half of that League throw their record out theyre playing better basketball cartel files out with 11 points foreign Music double figures tonight balance scoring yeah obviously Appleby leads the way I thought Lucas Taylor came in and provided some really comments really good minutes I mean gave him six points and locked down a couple of Threes And His limited his limited minutes and thats what you want to see for a guy thats really impressive for somebody that hadnt played much all year Wake Forest moves on to face Boston College on Tuesday the Eagles coming off that big time upset against Virginia talking about a team you dont want to play yeah they defend you man and and Quentin post is as good as any player in his league and had he been healthier all year yep hed be someone wed be talking about hed be in that first team all ACC it was funny if you look at his numbers against quad one opponents the only player better than him in the entire country listen Zach edia Purdue Ive watched him dominate guys that we think are the better bigs in this league Ive watched him personally dominate those guys and thought the league better be happy that he hadnt been around all year long great win here by the Dixon turned it around defensively on the second half and unfortunately for Notre Dame it got cold the losing streak continues but
