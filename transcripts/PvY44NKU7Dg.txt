lineup for NC State brought to you by your local Toyota dealers keep an eye on number one in that back foot with Smith darkell Joyner from Kevin Gates Joyner had 26 points at Miami in December to lead the way for the pack and a losing effort here we go with round two NC State and Miami and Tom one guy we didnt touch on the open Jordan Miller for uh Miami had a massive game first go around 25 points for him a lot of great matchups today Joyner is the second leading scorer on the team just over 16 points per game hes number one Smith with the ball Zero Applause the shot clock is down at seven Applause lets it Go long rebounded Joyner so quick and that one got blocked Poplar came out of nowhere couldnt have collect it away wow great reaction time and the Poplar is one of their better Defenders watch The Help side come in quickly really close to a goaltending full court pressure from NC State to start and you know what its not a bad idea especially with the noon start Tom maybe get to get everybody revved up get into the game how you feel about those new and start times Mike oh mirror to the rim too strong as the broadcaster I love it player not so much just a little too early for me a little bit of time to warm up the engine and thats two inside for NC State and Gowana well you got two guys out there in Duane again who arent big scorers but you cant not pay attention to them off the pick and roll he had an easy dunk itll be a foul on the play the one one matchup to look at I was curious to see how Jordan Miller has started off on Greg Gantt number 23 Miller watching defensively he roams a little bit out in the paint Applause coming off the win Wednesday at home against Boston College is packed goes back to grab it Ill tell you what Pat Joyner is not a bad matchup to zero in on either inside omir and gawanna and its omir winning the fights a lot of taller but omir has got the size he was able to get underneath he wanted that time get a body on him one as a shot blocker you want to try to keep contact well near the sophomore and transfer from Arkansas State goes 67 248 pounds from Nicaragua Applause came up short and hit the deck this is Isaiah Wong one of the more flashy players in the ACC hanging and scoring as the defender went on by while not only beating his primary Defender but seeing where the help was coming from too and you talked about hanging that Split Second allowed him to get the basket talk about a consistent score for Miami 58 of his last 69 games to double digits for long ing it on in too strong omir now when he does in that situation he had a clear out they will not come and double team him long for three and he knocks it down now this is going to be a treat today watching these two back courts go at it quick five points for Isaiah Wong and the kings were three of four from the floor a little bit of a struggle so far in the first half currency state Joyner what other amidst some popular elevates and watch the Miami big guys on those on those screen rolls theyre going to stay with the shooter an extra count Applause Miller had it bounce off bounds and that is packed basketball Applause Jordan Miller to see him Miss Mike is actually sort of a rarity he leads Miami in the history of its program in field goal shooting close to 55 yeah 53 this year so really coaching why you know what its just right there shows you that uh Smith can go with either hand either that way you know you want to make him have him beat you with his weakness well he did on that drive to his left his sophomore sir quavi and Smith from Greenville North Carolina the leading scorer in the ACC almost 19 points per game North Carolina State switching everything out on the perimeter except the big picture this is packed pack against the pack and a misfire Smith on the Run trying to get away from Miller tough shot Kawana comes over the top maybe that was a pass intended for Kawana Mike you know so far its you know aside from that easy layup Fuller slides down and he Trails the play tough pass on the break the lid skipped and stayed low Music 50th career game for Smith trying to create some contact the crowd wanted it the officials dont agree all afternoon youre going to see a swarm of uh the black jerseys around him a mere fancy dribble Music Applause and hes a guy hes going to play the fewest minutes of the starters uh but still a key part of what they do and uh just about eight points a game sophomore from Philadelphia will go Poplar Music Marcel has been quiet so far in the first half transfer from Virginia Applause with a turnaround deflected omir the race is the other way two on one with Miller nice job NC State getting back to cut off the breaker had a steam in the paint and he lost the handle right down Broadway wow I mean you know its a size mismatch but he started with the dribble behind omir and just flew past him there was nobody back to help Smith had 22 points to lead the team last Saturday in Virginia Tech 7369 oh mayor backing down on Kawana defended it well and what a shot falling away your chat home here still time on the clock left and that was about as good defensively as youre going to play him in the post omir shoots 61 percent on the season that is the best in the ACC but a lot of times much closer yeah and thats I was going to say thats about his range right there he was a player of the year in the Sun Belt Conference a season ago as the shot clock runs down a four on Joyner trying to shake Miller and he hits it theyve got two guards who can create at the end of the shot clock and Joyner that time but so far youve seen NC State go deep into the shot clock Miami doing a decent job playing their screen roll action Joyner went for 21 points and eight boards on six of 13 shooting in the win at Virginia Tech with the most recent game for NC State pack Defenders on his hip has to retreat OMeara is determined to get to the glass and he plays the angle lets see if NC State comes with a different package than right now theyve been theyve not double teamed him so far they may have to start omir just bullying his way all the way to the remedy hes got six points so far for Miami he is their leading scorer Wong right behind him with five I mean one thing he can do Tommy he can face and put the ball on the floor which puts a lot of pressure on Duane to defend him Smith leads the way for NC state has the basketball now with four points that hits the side of the backboard trying to get it to Miller it was knocked away to pack in the corner offline Joyner Smith free ball little chirp into the bench after that made three now foul call behind the play on North Chad omear correction Poplar got it Poplar got it how about the action its out of PNC it is time for our keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer with Mike jaminsky a little focus on defense time you got the number two and three scoring teams in the conference and state in Miami for Miami theyve got to defend in the pick and roll with that backboard and for NC State Kevin Keith was not happy with his defensive effort down at Coral Gables theyve got to defend for 40 minutes Kevin keets team is 134 on the season three and three in conference play and he hopes he has a group so I can take him back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since his first year as the head coach back in 2018 when they went 2112 and 117 in ACC play Miami made it all the way to the elite eight a season ago Burns is into the game for NC State number 30 in white Marcel forces his way inside a foul is called against the caves lets step aside for a minute well come right back to Raleigh after this about the farther behind the line he is the less efficient his shooting percentage you see these first two misses Tom a good three to four feet behind the line but then the one he makes uh he is very very close and that could be a little bit of the NBA bleeding in uh to the guys thought process under threes but certainly theres a correlation between him and getting close to the Lane Smith on the bench right now the maid three was his 52nd of the Season Michael leads the team in that category 34 percent from Beyond the arc on the year with more sell at the free throw line keep an eye on to DJ Burns is going to be a big part of this game hes hes had a terrific game down to Coral Gables 16 points eight rebounds season high in minutes with 31 his issue has been staying on the court with foul issues but hes been very productive Miami coming to double team him early thank you Burns who goes 69 275 from Rock Hill South Carolina and a transfer from Winthrop Winthrop South this is long and they want to try to involve burns into pick and roll his guide guys Garden will be the strainer Miller over the top foul against Miami Applause and I think you know a couple things for uh Jim larenega that hes given OMeara an early rest here in the half but you put Anthony Walker in the game maybe save a couple of fouls uh you know against army or having to guard Burns Applause Burns got the double digits at Virginia Tech in the most recent game inside and itll fall in the foul Ernest Ross NC State and all of that happens Tom because look how long they stayed with this double team and then out of rotation right just a nice job of Ross getting in and shaping up morsel with the delivery Ross with the Finish long with the foul NC State now with its first lead since it led two nothing start this game and this is again this is a game plan and a coach whos you know you got to pick something and uh Ross coming in 815 from the line but you know Jim larenager wants to get it out of the hands of the guards on those pick and rolls so hes going to stay with that Bensley Joseph driving and scoring for Miami this guys a closer hes got a great body he can fit he can really defend uh you know hes he is their primary leads him in scoring rebounding in assists Off the Bench Joseph averaging close to six points per game and two and a half rebounds this is Burns halfway down and out as it spun off the rim Applause now Beverly just uh illadvised look ahead that time fourth turnover for the first half for Jim larenagas team one more win and hell tie Terry Holland for ACC victories for 10th all time assistant with Coach Holland at Virginia Tony Bennett just became the alltime leader in wins of Virginia out of the corner Thomas with three pretty good from there hasnt taken a ton of Threes on the year 713 coming in its a good percentage though Mike 54 you know why not take that out for spin everything itll test drive long in a congested area over the front rim with the touch and seven points Ill tell you what Miamis been making some very difficult shots here in the first half OMeara had one early Smith doesnt get the soft bounce and Mir tried to save it and did to Joseph who were tied at 17 Applause a spinning Walker off the glass and good and you know what a nice recognition that time he had the switch he had Smith on him and rather than bail him out with a jump shot went right at Hitman Smith let him go first points for Anthony Walker the Junior from Baltimore Maryland Smith had it poked away this is Walker flying in and that was on the double team to jump on that pick and roll and Walker with the really quick hands hes already exceeded his average great points off the bench for Jim larenaga first turnover of the first half for NC State Burns creating space and getting well he creates his own space and he has got a wonderfully soft touch around the basket DJ burns with the bucket for NC State Miami with the ball and Joseph slips down loses the handle on the Run Applause Smith demanding the basketball Burns trying to fill the lane other side Ross and how about Ernest Ross weve got a couple guys off the bench who are being really productive Im going to give Burns an assist on that one sure a little strong on the jump shot hes at home third tie of the ball game and 21 all just a fantastic matchup to start the schedule on a Saturday in the ACC Smith off the missed by long down shifts to the rim omir caught him Ross follows boy how about Ernest Ross Off the Bench playing a big role here early he and Greg again have really stepped up with the injuries that North Carolina state has sixth lead change of the game Ross had six points already welcome of his average per game of 22 Beverly misses from threepoint range Joyner ran into Walker okay theres been some contact in this game and the referees letting everybody play both ends Bill Covington Jr Raymond stions Clarence Armstrong stealing the backcourt and Beverly the reverse layup so Miami wants to do they want to get out in the open floor have their defense turn into offense as much as they can all right again after the Beverly basket his first of the afternoon 29th alltime meeting between the teams it is split right down the middle 140 long got caught and he ran into Smiths second foul on Wong how about the hustle here by NC State Smith had at both of these coaches philosophies and its written in stone you pick up your second foul and thats just a you know a pump fake that Wong didnt need to bite on hes not going to block that shot but probably Seen the Last of him for the first half and thats good news for the wolf pack lets see how they take advantage of that in the last six and a half minutes Miami shooting 61 percent as a team one three of four from the floor seven points does have a threepointer to his credit as well Zaya Wong Junior from Piscataway New Jersey on senior Bonner High School in Pennsylvania appears to be staying on that Jim larenang event for the moment with the two personals leads the team in scoring almost 17 points per game for Wong but weve seen I mean all that being said weve seen some great bench contributions by both teams State 11 points of the second unit Miami with eight and this is a neither team goes really deep into their bench theyre gonna have to in the first 20 minutes here seven different NC State players have scored in the game and that includes turkuevi and Smith at the freethrow line with seven points against the only one who hasnt scored a wolf pack as large the people who played against missed on his two shot opportunities Ross has been a spark for Kevin Keats Off the Bench in this first half remember in Coral Gables in the first half NC State build a 16point lead at one point and led by nine at halftime Miami came back to win it in fact they only LED for about four minutes to close that game out and there is the three from pack and hes you know Wong out the uh we havent talked about him as the other guard in this matchup but a very capable scorer so hes going to have to step up Applause burns on the Move got to try to make him go to his right hand he loves hes a lefthanded player you know going that way hes automatic Joseph was barreling down the lane and got bumped theyre gonna call Smith on the foul heres the look and uh you know I I thought yeah thats the it was early reaching and I you know I thought that burns was going to get the foul but the Smith with that wave in its a cheap foul to pick up Music leading scorer in the game for NC State to Cleveland Smith with eight points three of ten from the floor so far Miami with a basketball the traveling black uniforms wrestled Away by Marcel turnover number six in the game for Miami Marcel trying to do it at the offensive driving and scoring and he had been looking inside that was going up he had only scored one point to this point in the game very aggressive going to his left all right back of the handoff beautiful away batted by Walker to Smith Applause Applause Burns against two Defenders a much better job forcing him right that time Applause Miami still at 60 percent shooting in this half Mike the trailing by two Miller has not scored shot clocks inside a 10 a spinning Walker score that basket and to the freethrow line and actually Burns had given some room daring him to shoot the shot but he did a nice job forcing the action here and it was just a big quickness advantage there for Walker nice finish for him talked about Burns Tom his average four personal fouls each of the last two games only 16 minutes game but hes been terrific when hes been very productive only the sixth freethrow attempt of the season for Anthony Walker now four of six and neither Miami or NC State do a lot of scoring from the freethrow line and that was a that was a big Advantage for Miami in the first game Burns got the defender in the air and theyre going to say no shot on that Music first on Walker Applause Amir is back into the game 15 in Black Joiner will trigger the inbounds for NC State four and a half minutes to go on our first half so glad that youre with us Tom wormy Mike jiminski in our outstanding ACC basketball production crew Burns goes the other way and lays it in youve got to think you know a lefthanded player on that side of the floor is going to come back to his strong hand and then when he when he Barons you on his back I mean you cant even see the defender six points now for burns showing some Nimble moves with the ball down low stingy D with the shot clock to eight Joseph slips and he traveled coach cant believe it seventh turnover of the games Miami so far this year were at Ronalds team six game winning streak undefeated in conference play and theyll be at Wake Forest which has not lost at home for Steve Forbes this season Kevin Keats Jim larenega Kanes impact second time this season a winning Coral Gables in December for Miami in the first meeting omir with a forceful rejection out of bounds and mirror was the second Defender that time he had a running start into that block could help defense near has four blocks in the game Smith long distance that shot was almost an afterthought time it looks like he lost control over ball and he said Im here remember talked about him being less efficient behind the arc well not in that case its a double digits now for Smith with 11 points largest lead for NC State after Smiths second three of the ball game Burns comes up with it pack wants to run this is Smith touch and it falls 13 points one thing you have to do in transition is take care of whoever stopped the advance of the basketball and nobody got to Smith foreign Applause Music Applause Music Music six of their last eight shots yeah and all of this has happened with Isaiah Wong out of the game with foul trouble so thats been a big issue for Miami here late in the first half Music seven point Advantage for NC State with 249 to go in our first half well well say down to down in Miami they were ahead 4334 at the end of the first half and then Miami really came out and lit it up offensively in the second 20 minutes as Smith had 19 points of a losing effort he is our hearty star to watch so far today I would keep watching him with 13 points and a couple of Threes as well right for him but the good thing about for him is that his assist numbers are up before youve got four uh just under five a game and even more important is assistive turnover ratio is better Tom making better decisions by the way Miller has not scored today Mike for Miami and Joyner only two points for NC State yeah and theres Miller right there and he got fouled the average is 15 points per game and now hes in the Box Score late in our first half well this is the thing I mean you look at Miamis offense the bulk of their scoring is going to come inside the threepoint line so its going to be important for them to at least stay close to NC State from behind the arc but they are they are just so good inside hey they shoot 56 which is 17th in the nation so Smith leaving the game for NC State with his second person along is already on the Miami bench with two personals Miller who shoots 80 from the line completes the old school threepoint play and its a fourpoint game well now its time for uh Joyner and Marcel to maybe look to be more aggressive looking for their offense Music get Burns and omir fighting down low Mike that is a Titanic matchup that steps the range nice job created some space between himself and the defender caught it in rhythm points for more cell second ear in the NC State program playing as 101st Collegiate game 14 in white translate Joseph all the way down to three Beverly thats the force up a three and it goes all the way around the rim and it spit it out did a nice job just to get it up on the glass before the shot clock Miami now just two of seven on threepointers okay this is a good magic defensively for Miami with Joseph Joyner but he makes a tough shot offense beating defense remember NC State led by nine in the first meeting between the teams ultimately a Miami Victory and right now the difference is nine and that is the third Court violation yeah they were really casual getting the ball up and that actually it was a late call there were 18 seconds on the shot clock and they hadnt even gotten over half court yet turnover number nine in the first half Applause for Jim laronegas team most wins in school history at Miami for Coach laronega ninth among active coaches in career victories what a season last year first time in program history to the elite eight one step away from the final four which involved two teams from the ACC Duke in North Carolina inside of a minute and down to seven on the shot clock Burns preserving The Possession trying to put it on the floor knocked away Joseph tries that youre all around the defender and a foul against the pack Joyner gets it Applause well it all started on the other end with Burns putting the ball on the floor yeah there was he moved his left foot and you know Joseph did a nice job going laterally here and then you see the open up and he stuck the leg out that was a good call friendly Joseph 65 for the free throw line body of work this season with the two main guards out of the game NC States done a better job of weathering this than uh than Miami theyve really missed Isaiah Wong Applause after the free throw now three points Joseph Joyner midcourt Burns shot clock at eight hes got an open man underneath theyre gonna double team big across and that was a great find Inside by Burns DJ Burns what an assist to an open gas eight seconds on the game clock pack has deflected two players for NC State struggling for the basketball and well stay at this end look at this double team coming down weak side has to slide down to pick that guy up great find and thats not an easy path for a center second assist of the game for burns who has six points as he goes to the NC State bench for the final four seconds Beverly on the inbounds more importantly for burns only one personal foul right now so hes in good shape for the second half some confusion over by the NC State bench and now the referees are over Randy stions and Clarence Armstrong are over at the scorers table with four seconds to go I think theyre checking on the time and now Bill Covington Jr has joined them over there but we have a moment lets get a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo so right now there are four seconds on the game clock Ill tell you what the three most fatigued guys in the building may be those referees right there this has been some pace for both teams Applause so theyve changed it Mike now to 51 Applause Miamis led by five in this half NC State by 10 right now largest lead both teams up above 50 shooting for the first half side Miller had it knocked away clock running down off the back border no good from Joyner who wanted the five so NC State will go to the locker room with its largest lead of the game its a 10 point difference and halftime is Straight Ahead from Raleigh North Carolina long played 13 and a half minutes in that first half we crank up the second half Miamis in the traveling black NC State in the white Applause Miller Applause almost coughed it up Poplar grabs it and misses omir over the top shoulders his way in too strong heres Miller over the top as well the first two offensive rebounds of the game for Miami but thats omearas game but he averages four offensive rebounds per game pack shot clocks down to one needs to shoot it weak side will meet her up front and he gets it and was fouled on the play thats his game right there I mean he does so many things but thats why I talk about get the shot up he misses right here but great position on the weak side no mirror youve got to block him out farther away from the basket first foul against Awana eight points for omir and he finishes off the threepoint play Applause NC State shot 51 percent of the first half to build the 10point lead but a guarantee coach Keats told them about the game in December Mike they had a nine point halftime lead in Coral Gables well its just been NC State defending much better in this game long was fouled you know if youre going to get a pick and roll and you get a big guy switched on you in your guard you just take it take the action right to him force him to move his feet first free throw attempts of the game for Isaiah Wong Applause 82 percent from the strike this year leading scorer for Miami and hes up to eight points not about a lot of free throws in general by either team shot in that first half how about the performance we saw from long Mike back in December against visiting Cornell when the teams combined for 212 points long going for 36 uh he was he was certainly dynamic in that game and there was very little action for me and a very little room to call it was up and down you carry today Joyner misses long on the Run theyve got the numerical advantage to the rim that was dewana coming in late got a piece of it and a goal attending violation you know when you have a corner jump shot like that youve got to get people to rotate back NC State didnt have anybody and that was an easy two a 70 run out of the locker room for the canes and its a threepoint game early stages second half so they close with the three heres our game summary brought to you by Keith long and Smith Mike but heres the thing I mean you both got two fouls Tom but for you know from Miami you cant really hide Isaiah Wong defensively because both guards for instance state are so Dynamic scoring the ball you know you can uh you know if you want to you can you can take a guy and and you know put him off the ball maybe hide him a little bit against Nigel pack 13 points from Smith needs all scorers hes the only player in double digit yeah weve got long as Wong is on Smith man to man Joyner with the shot clock winding down and it pops out and omir wrestles it away from the Defenders Applause thats now eight rebounds for OMeara and uh look expect to see the both of the rotations tightened up a little bit in the second half midair Collision on the driveby Wong has picked up his third Mike well and thats but thats you know Smith laying off the play right there he did not want to pick up his third theyve got guys behind Juana that they can bring in but theyve got to keep number zero on the floor double digits now for Wong as DJ Burns saunters back into the game you know if Im for both of them really its regarding one another they should both be in attack mode on the offensive end of the floor Applause keep it at 10 points for Wong leading scorer in the game for Miami Burns Music Applause I mean I just loved him on the offensive end of the floor slipping the screen that time something they worked on yesterday in practice and he gets on that side of the floor hes money hes a little bit farther out this time he can use the glass effectively Music nine points now for burns after the free throw anything too and we talked about it that he only had the one foul in the first half so hes good to go here in the second Applause long against Marcel Music trying to work off The omir Scream Music Miller let cant go by and he hits the midrange again were really flying by him and he aiming hes too far by he couldnt recover on biting on the pump fate you watch Miller defensively against him he can wander a little bit and be a be a help in the lane watch him on the weak side Smith throws the corner runs into three Defenders and then with 15 Miller was there to help but didnt bother Smith at all terrific finish six of 13 shooting for Smith that includes a couple of Threes Poplar and a retreat trying to create some space burns the block and he grabbed it Applause Music Burns rifles it across the court Smith comes up short get the onearm rebound Applause around the perimeter trainer for three but how about Dance I mean this is the value that he brings to the floor this is a guy who has 10 vnps early in the year injuries he comes in hes playing 30 minutes a game he gets on the offensive glass gets an extra convention Applause Music and hes got 12 just a fabulous gaming you know the thing is you know I talked about sometimes the sluggish started for at noon both of these teams came out ready to play and its carried over Applause again over the corner yeah hes going to the freethrow line punch counter punch Burns defensively unpopular and look at the unselfish basketball Joiner knocking down a three ball and the answer comes from number two in Black just playing nasty Isaiah Wong 5244 having a heck of a time on a Saturday afternoon were glad that youre with us and we want you to stay tuned for the back break presented by your local Ford dealer the house is a bump and Mike and Tom nice answer by NC State a little push early in the half by Miami but DJ Burns has been the difference for the wolf pack here in this little stretch the length of the lead out Music in the lane between these two teams Mike a combined 54 points in the paint so far you know it was interesting early in the first half Miami came across and double team burns on the catch they havent done that yet in this half lets see if that changes up defensively 12 points for Wong four or five from the floor and forganton that last play one has got a chance for a threepoint play but he picks up a foul on omir as well first on omear cant get the free throw line with four points NC state has lost three in a row in the series against Miami and that includes the match up earlier this season in Coral Gables so gantu had very limited experience at the free coal line this season Mike had been two of two from the line this season Richard Jr from Fayetteville North Carolina giving the pack to the ninepoint lead as we are about to cross the 15minute threshold of the second half dazzling dribbling display from longer than he finds Joseph for the three ball right and thats a again with uh Bensley Joseph you may want to you know youre going to take that want to get the ball out of Wongs hands I thought he over dribbled on that possession but made something happen anyway Josephs got six Joyner hits the jumper we are seeing some great shot making today timing the defense has been pretty solid the guys are making really tough shots nine points for jarkel Joyner the graduate student and transfer from Ole Miss his 132nd career game long Glides to the rim effortlessly 14 points you know something I dont know how he can surprise you with his quickness but the weak side help was not there he just exploded to the rim look at those shooting percentages for these teams in this game oh my God Applause theyve changed up now they were going to come on the catch with Miller the double team Burns inside Joyner offline with a three ball so just a moment to catch our breath here frenetic Pace NC State in Miami these teams as Mike mentioned have come to play on this Saturday afternoon a little bit more pressure up the floor by NC State in this half Applause foreign Applause has turned it over so far seven minutes into the half long step in back and he hits that three balls I mean he had the same open Lane well play NC State over compensated a little bit and yeah you just you got to pick something when youre guarding the guy the dynamic is that 17 points and a couple of Threes for Wong thats now 28 threes on the season yeah hes only 34 so you got to take your chances there instead of at The Rim second on the team and made threes behind Nigel pack another long three that time by Smith cleaning that up what you wonder why you know you know in the NC State with him in the lineup seven points for Camp that was deflected inside Thomas got a piece of it cant just the guy who is really accepted and embraced his role Applause you may call foul if Kent is going to get the foul on the play Applause second on gance Applause heres a look you know nice unselfish play might have taken the uh that shot early but then yeah it was it was close but enough there to call the foul so despite that foul Mike Gantt has seven points his average on the season 14 coming into this afternoon her game but you know what you almost have to you almost have to start anew with him over the last couple of games where he started getting 30 minutes on the floor you know lets track from that from the Duke game between his first start going forward what he is on his production hes a big win against the Blue Devils Joseph on the drive Bensley Joseph and there was contact weve got other guys Step Up Now Joseph did not score in the game down in Miami but you know for Smith right there you want to put pressure on him make him defend and thats three points for Joseph at the freethrow line and as Mike just mentioned turquavian Smith just picked up his third personal as the leading scorer for NC State in 15 they call him Bens and that last move was a smooth drive to the rim Benz has the threepoint play and look at that scoreboard Mike a twopoint game after NC State led by 10 at halftime yeah its been uh you know NC State is tried to pull away Miami has been Brazilian Smith was twisting on his way to the goal and got fouled lets take a timeout in a twopoint game between Miami and NC State trouble but he is gotten started here quickly in the second half doing a nice job position the ball so explosive and then you take away the drive and he knocks down the three really scoring at all levels right now its going to be interesting to see who turquavian Smith is guarding defensively to me with the three fouls again if youre going to choose a guy its going to be Bensley Joseph but hes done a nice job attacking one or attacking Smith Joseph is up to nine points Mike McQueen Smith with the 15 points couple of Threes as well maybe maybe a Zone if youre NC State to try to hide him for a little bit here get under the six seven minute Mark in the tour in second half Music led the conference in May threes a season ago now with 53 this year and at the free throw line 70 percent for the season from the line now hes just one of three in the game on free throws Music great chat with Coach coach Keats prior to the game said the energy defensively Mike has helped them to this five wins and six game stretch you know for some turnovers out in the open floor running a little bit especially with this backboard nine points for OMeara in the game looking for a handoff along Applause big fake trying to drop it off to omear shot clocks at two and then puff it up and youve got to leave your feet as a scorer not as a passer that was pretty good defense that was the first turnover of the half for Miami they had cleaned up that part of the game foreign from the floor is a team NC State heres Burns back out Thomas fires away Applause Music Applause against Burns over the top of number 30 in white 11 points North Shadowmere they just spread the floor and let him go to work off the dribble against Burns and thats Advantage OMeara in the open floor theres a mirror the transfer from Arkansas State showing off some moves they look at everybodys spread no help coming over Applause solid move inside player of the year the Sun Belt Conference a season ago just found a home Carl gave us one of the big contributors to the success of the canes this season 142 and 51 in ACC play Marcel battles around Amir goes up for the rebound hes been quiet that was a good find by Burns Music James throwing away that was just a sloppy onehanded pass by Wong Applause you know in this game especially on the road and Nigel pack going to come back in that you know every possession is so important and to have just a mental lapse like that really hurts so Wong comes out with 17 points pack is in the game hes got five and so Gantt coming out Ross Who provided a spark in the first half enters the lineup Burns putting it on the floor against two Defenders poked away Walker and Amir was there too Mike now the best scores that you have for Miami or Miller and no mirror the mirror and The Millers got the mismatch inside now Miller up and under nice job again attacking Smith he doesnt want to pick up that foul you got a small guy on you take it right to the rim so Millers basket gives Miami its first lead since it was 2624 in the first half and this has been long out of the game too Applause foreign Applause State inside hey this is a great find and a great defensive play thats five blocks now for Amir one short of his career high for Chad OMeara Ill meet you at the rim and more salmon down hes clutching the right shoulder he was down and he is in some pain and omir came up to set his screen and there was no communication watch this he doesnt even know its coming and he runs right into a brick wall thats on actually thats on omearas guy whoevers guarding you got to be up and talking to your guard right then right here so Marcel in need of some medical evaluation at the end of that bench for NC State and thats a shooting shoulder too with the inbounds Miller fouled by trynter Music Applause well this is a uh all of a sudden now that Miamis starting to you know making advantage of the freethrow line Nixon States left some points there with some misses Mike have we seen this movie before between these two teams NC State by 10 at halftime 2816 right now in the second half Applause and Miller in this game Tom he went for he scored his 1500th points in the first half its a big milestone for him Applause NC state has missed its last seven shot attempts three of them right at the front of the rim Burns trying to set a screen for Joyner unsuccessfully shot clock inside of 10 200 needs some assistance Smith trying to provide it with the pullup shooting eventually Joseph really bailed him out the shot clock on their back and you just got to go up and contest that make it a difficult shot dont put him at the freethrow line Joseph the sophomore from Arlington Massachusetts committing the foul to put Smith at the stripe well its just what a huge lift for uh Kevin Keats to have him going to see Isaiah Wong on the bench and but to have turquois Smith come back this year has not been through hes not been Stellar at the freethrow line so far 17 point points Mike but three of six and free throws for jaquavian Smith eight and a half minutes to go in the second half wormy Mike chavinsky our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you from Raleigh heres a Wheeler on the drive against two Defenders Ross with the save to Joiner up to the sideline in front of McCains bench well and you know Ross just wanted to get the ball out of his hands quickly and Joyner was right on the line as the pass came seen enough of the game without Isaiah Wong in Bensley Joseph coming out but he is that you might see down the stretch him coming in and seeing uh pack and long with him in the game if they choose to go a little bit smaller Nega hit a milestone in his coaching career earlier this season with a win against Providence is Alma Mater 700th and that is his career and early on before Georgia Tech they had to play the next day against Maryland and got really waxed in the game again a very emotional turnaround foreign Applause Smith Jeff just uh you know with long terrific use of the pump fake him back in I mean its you know it was maybe you put him on pack and roll the dice there but maybe just a little Sly smile from Isaiah the NC State theyre down asking Marcel if hes okay with his shoulder and Fabian Smith is waving to the bench saying leave me in Im good I dont know you know they went down and checked I dont know if Marcel is going to be able to come back in 19 points now for long its got the heat to fly to the shoulder there for more cell on the screen by omear earlier in the half clean play no foul call they are really driving NC States guards out off that pick and roll action Keynes had built a fourpoint lead shot clock winding down for burns rattled out second chance Ross how many offensive rebounds as NC State had right there who cant convert Applause stuffed out of bounds that was Beverly in the corner so well step aside with 7 42 to go in regulation the caves have taken the lead 6359 its time for protecting the pain its brought to you by CPI Security and its North Carolina whos been the difference five block shots for him so Im really a really nice job protecting the front of the rim and hes hes not a dynamic shot blocker he came in every he had 21 blocks in 16 games so you know a little over one you know per contest but its been outstanding this afternoon there is our game summary the quavion Smith is on the NC State bench with four personal fouls Isaiah Wong 19 points in the game hes five of six from the free throw line 12 points in the second half for one well and the good news for NC State to Marcel back in see how that shoulder is if he tests it out with the with the jump shot Applause shoulder bruise for more cell not enough to keep him out of the game Burns collaborating with Ross you know that was a great decision because they they had Thomas all the way in the corner and they had one Defender who was caught in between Applause its now eight points for Ross as Thomas stumbles down and then runs into the Beverly forget and Ross together 15 points for the wolf pack great production so Gantt on the season Mike averages 14 points Ernest Ross averages 22 down 15 instead of three for average I was the first foul on Thomas first attempt from the line today well in the bonus and theres the two guys who are out now they do expect them back at some point in time but from workich and Clark you see the numbers there 17 points 14 rebounds between them thats a ton of production plus older guys that theyre missing and two guys in the portal that Kevin Keith was really relying on and Clark has a core muscle injury that was against Clemson on December 30th and while hortic right kneecap injury against Coppin State hes missed the last six and now seven games Music Applause for the board and he took it away from Burns it not a bad rebounder from the guard position but that was just really strong averaging four and a half a game hes gotten more this afternoon hes got the ball and hes got a switch Applause nice job Marcel sticking your hand in Applause he wanted to go to he had Ross switched off on him Music six seconds on the shot clock for Miami this casino Kevin Keats is just sitting over there right now how long do I keep turquadian Smith out of the ball game with those fouls Premiere turn around Applause as good as shot making as hes made if youre Burns thats some shots that you would prefer ONeill to take seven boards for burns exactly six minutes to go in regulation Applause no double team cover late double team s Burns shot will not come now heres the heres the change that Miami now theyre coming on the dribble with Burns they came on the catch early but the guys can be active as Ross thats where the double team is coming from hes going to make himself available and hes been productive third foul on North Chad omear Ross at the free throw line in the bonus all for one so far today Music Applause Smith remains on that NC State bench and its looking right you know as long as you know as long as they stay close enough you know two three points I think they can weather this a little bit and I imagine Kevin Keith would like to get under the four minute Mark and then take his chances empty possession on that losses only at 53 freethrow shooter on the season well thats what youd rather than give him the dunk inside if youve got the fouls to put him at the freethrow line on the court taken by Miami over six feet of the country NC State on the very edge of the top 25 rankings look at the standings to the ACC and the Clemson Tigers other stories so far Mike 60 first time in ACC play in their history in the conference well and you look at it and theyre starting to get a little separation NC State trying to stay in touch with that pack at the top you see a bunch of five teams at four and two the bottom four in the league are really struggling the bottom five really but then after that everybody above 500 Tech was at the Dome on Wednesday and lost to the orange and tonight the Tigers host Duke inside Little John Coliseum Virginia Tech withering some injuries up to this point Music and it you know its good to see because there was a seismic change with Mike shasheski retiring and Roy Williams retiring a two Hall of Famers right there all Hubert Davis did was go to the final give him yeah couldnt get it up on the rim and here comes NC State Marcel back in the game launching at three OMeara out leaves everybody for the rebound well the good news with Marcel is the shot looked okay with that shoulder didnt have to make pack dribbled himself into a turnover with that last rebound Yorkshire near his 43rd DoubleDouble of his career and eighth this season crunch time baby inside of five minutes to go GMan and Tom just to show you how important he is on the glass hes got a third of the rebounds in this game earns spins it in well you give him multiple dribbles and hes going to get you in a bad way Smith still in the NC State bench 11 points for burns Miami by one Applause heres the look into Miamis trying to give him different looks coming with the double team this time letting omir play him oneonone you know I think for a mirror right now although hes the thing is hes got three personal fouls so he cant be overly physical guarding him man up Music first attempts for Thomas unless he will be attempts in a bonus even with that make Mike seven of 14 from the line for NC State Applause a couple of big free throws Thomas thats after they win 20 of 25 from the line Saturday at Virginia Tech for the win and with that free throw our 10th lead change omir at the other end takes it up again against pressure too and thats the thing he can handle the ball well enough he just saw a lot of open floor between himself in the basket working on that 43rd career DoubleDouble for Chad omear and the lead swings back to Miami and they got Wong on Marcel Marcel try to hide him a little bit locked away patchy recovered defensively against Thomas and a foul is called a foul on NC State Applause kirkwavian Smith still on that pack bench for the moment for NC State well I may need him desperately Tom in the second half NC State eight of 26 from the field one of them from three so Smith was out for about four and a half minutes Mike since the 8 20 Mark hes back in there with the four personal fouls well and 17 points yeah the big thing is Im curious to see who hes guarding out on the floor now this again this Miamis counter and have gone a little bit smaller with the three guard lineup with Joseph in there with long and Nigel pack Applause 12 of 16 is a team from the free throw line Miami long gets another Applause 20 points for Isaiah Wong Applause were now 21 for Wong to lead all scorers he and omir in double digits Smith and burns double figure scoring for NC State for burns 10th time this season hes got to double digits well good matchup for defensively they got Bensley Joseph on for Cleveland Smith a little beyond the range of burns trying to gain some territory spinning in the lane DJ Burns again theyre choosing to let him go oneonone with OMeara inside good Patriots by him 13 punch Burns little pector action along Miller found him well great play then everybody lifted above the freethrow line and the set play coming out of the timeout Applause 23rd time in Wongs career 20 points or more hes up to 23 turns power dribble and theyre kick it out more south front of the weak side Ross well with Miami going a little bit smaller and NC State taking advantage with Ross on the offensive glass 10 points for Ross everybody up inside of PNC Arena offensive foul on omir never got set on the screen on the fourth on omir back with a chance to take the lead after building a 10point halftime lead they saw it dissolve in the early stages of the second half and now were closing again on two minutes to go in regulation Burns against Miller dropped in lower NC stayed in front by one a season in careerhigh 12 points for Ross and its been Burns finding his guys on the weak side oh no it was no they called the timeout I thought boy I thought Smith might have caught a foul there but a timeout before then timeout ticket by Kevin Keats at NC State Mike how about 12 lead changes in our game the last one thanks to Ernest Ross well look at the big man finding people hes a little bit farther out from his uh where he likes to operate but to forwards the power forwards for NC State have been very active how about burns with five assists in the game number 30 has done it on many different levels Music come up we have Burns 13 points seven rebounds five assists DJ Burns graduate student from Rock Hill South Carolina other side of the Court Isaiah long leads everybody with 23 its not I mean its not surprising that hes productive when hes on the board I mean hes shown that its just foul issues have you know kept him off foreign s tied his career high with 18 points in the big win against Duke on this floor hes been a factor today with 16 points against this team then it was Miami 28 minutes of action for burns long has the basketball a minute and a half to go its a onepoint NC State League down low OMeara almost lost the handle recovers defensively Joseph shot clocks at two Joseph must shoot no in time gotta have shot clock awareness at this point in the game yeah there was it was not even close getting out of his hand turnover oh Miami is a crucial one now I think theyre just looking to see where if the game clock should be reset at all its out of two minutes the officials can check Bill Covington Jr Clarence Armstrong over at the scorers table fine is correct Applause 30 in white 69 275 this one should be they should add two seconds back to the game clock three seconds 118 but just a great defensive possession for NC State that time out taken by NC State each team with one remaining Music well if youre looking at the foul situation in the next North Carolina State foul Miami is going to be shooting two theyll be in the double bonus Miami 188 team fouls dont forget tomorrow one Eastern weve got ACC womens basketball action Florida State taking on Louisville with Wyckoff Jeff walls the

like this just get a hand up and it was the followthrough that got the just barely clipped his arm but certainly a foul Joyner is 78 percent for the season however making his first trip to the free throw line with 55 and a half seconds to go in this one thank you Applause 11 points Joiner threepoint lead Kansas back in Hearns to the left 55 and a half seconds to go offensive defense for NC State going down the stretch 23 points for long to put it in play sixth time in the last eight games hes gone for 20 or more the difference is three dont need the three right here maybe get something going to the rim try to get to the oldfashioned threepoint play reflected out of bounds nice defense by Smith great active hands still plenty of time on the shot clock 13 seconds everyone standing inside a PNC Arena packed nine and one this season on their home floor trying to avenge the loss earlier this year than Coral Gables against Miami shot clock down to 10 for long Miller got it back five seconds on the clock for three in the tie Applause three they were trying to go inside to omir and what a what a huge bailout shot for Miller NC State going to take a timeout with 18 seconds left in a tie game Wow first threepoint attempt of the game for Miller look theyre daring him to take this shot at a late late challenge but that was just cold blooded his 18th May three of the season has tied us at 73 Mike has about four seconds on the shot clock well right now your NC State couple of things you want to make sure that youre getting the last attempts of the half but giving yourself enough chance for an offensive rebound or a couple tips now remember early in this half theyve had issues finishing around the rim on those Second Chances with 182 on the clock the shot clock is off eight ties 12 lead changes here we are 73 all well for and for Miami I I mean Im making somebody other than turquoia Smith beat me you know if hes got the ball in his hands Im jumping him and getting the ball out seeing if somebody else can step up 17 points for Smith 12 for Ross 11 for Joyner 13 for burns who is back on the floor for NC State remember omir with those five block shots as well more short of his career high in that category obviously Joseph is going to be on Smith Applause Joyner 15 seconds to go Applause and now 10 seconds gotta go iner Beverly on him needs to shoot it Charter throws it up over time Applause Joyner had the last chance but how about Miami defensively on that possession yeah and that was that was not a good last possession for NC State I mean youve got to get a better shot than that something going to the rim they waited way too long to get into the play 3D scores today along with 23 Smith still has the four personal foul 17 Applause we got to Craven Smith with four and youve got omir with four personal fouls so Miami has three doubledigit scores NC state has four Miami in this game by the way 59 from the floor as a team were in overtime in Robin so glad that youre with us wormy jaminsky in the outstanding production crew along with a basketball Applause Miller trying to catch a tough pass from back well lets not forget you know theres been a lot of Heroes in this game but Jordan Miller knocked down that three with the shot clock on his back to tie this game up that was his only three attempt of the game its about three or four seconds on the shot clock and he had to launch it and Kevin Keats had to watch it hit the bottom of the net 14 of 19 as a team Miami from the line and Miller and at 80 percent from the line misses on the first one 13 points for Miller thank you theyve still got a mirror on burns see if they give him some touches try to pick up that fifth foul Marcel cut off by the defending a pack with the shot clock at 14 Premiere fighting around in front to keep the ball out of his hands Smith creating space and hitting the jumper and Joseph on the challenge picking up the foul well again aside from the foul I mean really good solid defense but just a tough tough conversion Applause 20 points or more for Smith and four games in a row and a small time this season hes gotten a 20 at Walmart for long six out of the last eight theyve come as advertised back for the lead great putter Nigel back wow I didnt see that coming he just he didnt even hesitate to rise up now they went underneath the screen Applause second three for pack whos got 32 on the season best for Miami 15th lead change Applause Burns got it back morcello at The Rim they got caught in between that time and Marcels guy they were both over on

foul that time Applause way behind the line Smith with the board and a chance to take the lead for the wolf pack Smith on the Run Marcel from the corner from the weak side out of bounds Wolf Pack basketball Applause gotta take a look at it Applause well heres how about four white dark jerseys around raw he is just having a terrific game Applause Ross was pointing at Joseph play along that Baseline stions and Bill Covington Jr at the monitor Suited it doesnt it doesnt look uh theyre right if it is that left hand maybe at the last second lets see if the lets see if the ball doesnt really change I think its going to be Miamis ball so again you must have indisputable video evidence to overturn the call Mike which was packed Ball but its that close I mean yeah I think he does get his hand out of the way Miami has a onepoint lead Applause trailing by 10 at halftime were in overtime for the first time for both of these teams this season Applause checking the replay to see who has possession of the basketball Applause here we are in overtime turquavian Smith 20 points Mikey leads the pack both teams really shot the ball well in the first half but it was these two guys Smith and Isaiah Wong and then uh Applause TJ Burns having an outstanding afternoon Miller with the three to tie us to send it to OT 73 all 18 points in the second half for Isaiah Wong so one official right now Clarence Armstrong is talking to Mike juminsky and Bill Covington Junior and rainy stions are at the monitor I mean it is so close Bensley Josephs left hand on that replay Tom its kind of blurry type so Clarence Armstrong is over here at the table Applause so it is NC State basketball ever so close but theyve they spent a lot I mean if they spent a long time looking at that really really close but the pack with the basketball Smith Catching Fire he hit the deck OMeara long both had it for a second NC State ball looks like Applause foreign Applause keeps control Smith too strong a mirror the rebound 120 to go on the game clock yeah I like the aggression though I mean you know trying to draw the foul and she stayed a bunch of opportunities Applause omir lost the handle for a moment shovels at the back shot talks at six and the final minute of OT Peck trying to get free Miller got the shot away Burns pulls it down packed with a chance to take the lead Applause Joiner rattles out Ross Ross on the offensive glass 8281 Miami wants a timeout Ernest Rose 16 points Ernest Ross well hes just been able to get its make himself available for passes and just working on the offensive glass Music average 22 he had 37 points on the year coming into this game waste your chance when its your time to the occasion we talked about Greg Grant and what hes done with his chance to get us into the starting lineup but it has been Ernest Ross for the wolf pack this afternoon Ernest Ross overcoming an ankle injury from a season ago where he played in 14 games seen action in every game this season but none more significant than this afternoon against Miami all right 306 on the game clock 27 on the shot clock 16 points ironically this is the 29th meeting between the teams they have split the previous 28 14 wins a piece and here we are in OT quiet you know again theyve wandered a little bit off of that position thinking uh you know they could help out in other areas but uh folks cant end especially Ross have made Miami pay thats what in this last possession Tom I mean you know you got Wong is the obvious guy Miller may be the the choice he may be the guy thats open in this situation foreign each team has one timeout remaining Miller is the reason were here Applause so about a two and a half second difference game and shot 306 to go in OT NC State by one kick theyve got quicker Defenders out on the floor burns not in the game for defensive purposes Applause Joseph will be on the inbounds for Miami Applause foreign Applause ninth rebound of the game for Ross and its enormous all right here we go oh of three from the free throw line foreign Applause if its a tour if its if he makes them both do you foul in this situation Applause still a onepoint game thats the only thing he doesnt hasnt done well Mike hes going for four from the line yeah if he makes now if he makes this the the you know what I like to do on the road go for the win take the three makes the second lets see what Miami does theres plenty of time for a run and theres theres plenty of time to get into your shot here 123 on the clock so the Ross free throw gives Miami the 83 excuse me NC stink the 8381 lead Miami has the ball just called its last time out with 123 seconds to go Jordan Miller hit a three late in the game late in the shot clock as tyus is 73 to get us to overtime Music Jim larenegger trying to design Something Mike throws a tie or win yeah I mean either way but you know the thing is the only guy thats in foul trouble for Miami in his own mirror with the four so you know if youre Jim Miller naked you decide all right were going to try to tie and extend do you try to get something going to the rim and get a foul in an and one Music foreign 25 points six of 15 on threes not in Miami if they decide to go for the win the Nigel pack has got two made threes in the game as well gotta go the length of the Court Music Applause theyre gonna have more cells theyre going to try to keep the ball out of Isaiah Longs hands back on the inbounds Miamis out of timeouts final 10 seconds long down by two trying to spin locks the handle balls on the floor hell ball the arrow favors NC State theres only four two in the club Miami never got the shot away well and they kick Miami cannot catch they cant even steal and shoot here Miami would essentially might have to deflect the inbox to tie the game well this is just really solid defense and weve seen a couple of possessions at the end of the game and this is again and how about how about Ernest Ross cutting off the driving lane for Isaiah long Smith who played the entire overtime with the four personal fouls leading scorer with 20 points and long just could not find any daylight Applause look at that three and four players trying to get a piece of it you know they were again theyre looking at the clock to see if theres an extra tenth on it and thats an enormous tenth because with point three you can catch and shoot you must have 3 seconds right now its point two so that would require a deflection by Miami off the inbounds pass even so Mike they would still I dont know if its even though yeah no and theyre leaving point two one so if there was point three yeah to intercept catch so you know almost no you cant right but then youve got a tip right Applause Joyner to put it into play just throw it long and look who catches it across the pack wins it 8381 over Miami in overtime Music Applause what a game
