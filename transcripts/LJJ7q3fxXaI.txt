on the road and the Tigers win the tip with the Freshman Mike Williams the third controlling the point here is Baker an early touch an early three rims out and Jaylen Reed goes over the top for the rebound gets back as o Miss and throws it right to Chris Bell the sopore for Syracuse on a team that is stuffed with sophomores three in the starting lineup are four of them along with bell mint Starling and Taylor the two guards can really score it and the transfer for Florida State naheem McLoud at 74 leaves it short LSU starters Jordan Wright the Vanderbilt transferred Carlos Stewart the Santa CLA transferred Baker from Nevada along with Reed and Williams two very talented young players in the lane Williams scores the surprise starter at point guard this year Mike Williams has given LSU a real burst of energy he runs their offense and thats one of the things Matt McMahon has has really developed an early trust with Williams he does play outside of himself Judah MS yards his leading score out of two and its Reed the sophomore from Jackson Mississippi for LSU Jordan Wright rims out of three get used to this pace because this is how both teams like to Music play a Syracuse team that is shooting just 29 from three they get most of their points around this area and thats a Miss from Justin Taylor another sophomore orange to three empty possessions to start Williams does not use the baker screen rolls to him and Baker is denied theres an early block the cloud winning that portion of the matchup and it leads to a Taylor three and it leads to a Taylor three and thats you know theyve got to get him going he started to get going in that game against shamad on the way out of Maui only 31 though from three so far this year transition big for him if he can find that line early Baker giving a whole lot of space and Baker ribs had another second offensive rebound for Reed Stewart set up he cant connect from three and LSU which is the much better the two typically from Deep very cold to start heres Bell puts it on the deck left it right to mlau m a happy accident for Syracuse Tigers run the floor after the make and its right laying it in Syracuse slow to get back back of the gr transfer Jordan W scores it well both these teams like youve said Kevin are going to look to push theyre not great or havent been executing in the half court against set defenses but theyre both very athletic and very good end to end 18 point per game score mince fakes a two Bell maybe their best threepoint shooter is crowded they want to crowd him make him put it on the deck he has to there Mintz late in the shot clock DRS it thats a three for Judah minz and he has shot the ball certainly better than last season and certainly better than JJ Starling I think youre mag man you can live with that three early from Judah its his penetration youre concerned about Reed steps inside on Taylor and scores at the sophomore Jaylen Reed who is just oozing with potential and thats the matchup that has really been problematic that four position defensively for Syracuse telegraphed pass by Min Stewart got a piece of it they got a piece of JJ Starling the Notre Dame transfer Starling right through the hands of McLoud Bell feeds Taylor and the shot clock reset which it should not have Roger SS Ron Gro Tommy morsey are officials and Roger ARS is going to fix this shot clock situation as its dropped down to 10 thats a play nem M Clouds got to be ready hes got to be a receiver you know one of the things with McLoud he hes got to make multiple plays hes not a multiple play guy you know hell block a shot and think the play is over he doesnt rebound outside of his area like I think there hes going to crash the offensive glass assuming shot and it was a really nice pass vce a strong Drive left side right handed no theres McLoud to clean it up shot clock did not reset and theres a foul at the end of The Possession with two and a half to go perhaps a little bailout for Justin tor on the games first foul Syracuse has not been a good rebounding team to this point in the season theyve already given up two offensive rebounds to LSU but theyve gathered two offensive of their own to extend possessions ba off a curl too strong and Reed has the rebound bounce off his head to himself Stewart Baker will go to work on McLoud now and McLoud Smothers him but is called for foul before the shot so Nim McLoud already with a block shot picks up his first foul and well step aside with an 86 Syracuse lead of the Dome ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is

disease which so many folks have been able to beat in part because of the help of the V Foundation its knocked away from minz will baker has the LSU takeway an 87 Syracuse lead early in Min is on the deck to punch it to Bell hes got the big man McLoud running the floor McLoud stuffs it there was a heck of a play by Judah minz cuz he thought he got fouled he he started complaining about the no call but then he converted the defense and made a heck of a play that led to the points and a turnover here Jordan wri standing on the sideline you know Judah minz is a hard guy to officiate cuz hes hes so good off of the bounce but a good job just getting Square there forcing a turnover when youre that size my friend doesnt take much to flush it home these are two of the best defenses in terms of steals in the country both very aggressive on the ball shot fake by Bell puts it on the deck and McLoud is there to try to tip it in mcclouds on the floor and slow to get up LSU has a five on four here they can use it and they still have right open as McLoud was late to get back it leads to a three buried by the sophomore Tyro Ward a terrific shooter Off the Bench its not a great shoot threepoint shooting team certainly not a volume threepoint shooting team but thats what Ward does 10 for 22 on his season Starling the cloud fouled on the dunk attempt this time n McLoud will shoot two tell you what we thought coming in will Baker was going to be the matchup problem for Syracuse in the early going its Nim McLoud you love his activity started with being active on the offensive glass you get him a dunk on that Steel by Judah minz and then there he is just rolling to the rim being a big Target on the year 14 for 16 from the field coming in 6 for 11 at the line and the cloud pretty good stroke for a seven for ultra big man they lost Jesse Edwards to the portal Syracuse they bring back most of the team Joe Gerard and Jesse Edwards both transfer out Edwards who was an allconference player went to West Virginia and McLoud is not going to put up those kinds of numbers but his per 40 minute numbers are very good only playing 18 minutes a game averaging 65 and about three blocks and he hits the free throws Music there Williams cutting inside by the Pressman McLoud is there again to deny and devastate Starling juse is four and five for a moment there mint will take it in strong anyway and the orange continues to control the paint starts with the penetration early by Starling breaking down the defense really nice Baseline skip to Taylor over the Min and another Guard breaking down the defense Baker with a touch out High get McLoud again starlings very active on the ball and LSU is deep in the shot clock with Baker calling for it theyre not using the screen deep in the clock its w a contested jumper is now close a smothering 28 seconds of defense for Syracuse and then an over dribble by Starling leads to a turnover for Ward On The Run heres Applause Baker and thats where again turnovers can be oxygen to LSUs offense theyre forcing 16 a game its an offense that can struggle to score in a half court you give them life if you turn over turn it over especially the live ball ones foul by Williams on Jud Min we look at JJ Sterling penetrate once more and heres where two guards who are so good off the bounce can be really tough l I its just two breakdowns of the defense starts with Starling nice little extra pass from Justin Taylor over to Judah mince and you get a team in Closeouts thats where those two two guards Starling and Mintz can really be devastating SE for Starling right now Kyle cuff the Kansas transfers in the game Benny Williams and Malik Brown Off the Bench for Syracuse as well Minch trying to bully his way to the line the fouls against LSUs wnie Wilkinson its interesting talking to Matt McMahon today he said look I know Mintz Judah Mintz can make a threepoint shot he said our concern is him drawing eight and a half fouls per 40 minutes Judah Mintz is attempting eight free throws a game and its not just the points that he puts up from the line cuz hes a 77 free throw shooter its the foul trouble he puts your team in and so much of a game a Syracuse game is how judin is officiated he is so good at drawing contact and accentuating the contact 20 points since four the first six hes got seven tonight the lead is four for Syracuse which nearly had a takeaway cuff stepped out of bounds what are you noticing on this side of the floor right now Al use offense against Syracuse defense theyve been very aggressive in denial and you know even when Nim McLoud was out there in that drop coverage his length covers up stuff around the basket which can afford those guys on the perimeter to be more aggressive to be more in denial DK fountains on the floor for the first time for LSU trade Hannibal as well and Hannibal muscles it in through the contact of Malik Brown the red shirt senior Off the Bench and thats where Brown doesnt give you nearly the rim protection as McLoud mince again and mince once more draws a foul its a lot easier said than done but you have got to go vertical with Jud Min on that penetration hes so quick I hes hes got such a good first step hes really long long and athletic went through that NBA draft process over the summer decided to come back at the 11th hour I just uh went down to the last moment him deciding to come back to Syracuse you like the call for him to come back for another year I do clows it away there what needs to improve about his game is here we know about the shooting but what else do you see hes got to be become a better decision maker and there are times where you know defensively like youve got to make him defend youve got to make him work on that end to sort of take some of that legs from him offensively and he goes in and out defensively Trey Hannibal double team manages to get rid of it in the air heres Stewart on the drive Stewart is blocked by Brown and off hand rejects in the fourth Syracuse block of the game at a twopoint orange lead cour score the ability to protect your basket huge in this game against a driving team in LSU Chris Bell coming over Malik Brown doubling Music up tonight as part of the inaugural ACC SEC mens challenge a matchup that would be pretty good in football and is getting better and better in basketball Clemson and Alabama 930 Eastern 830 Central over on ESPN the first edition of the ACC SEC Challenge and ACC thats hoping to grow a little bit this year Chris and an SEC that the last few years has really established itself as as deep a league as there is in America I had a chance to see Clemson at that tournament down in Asheville course Joe Gerard former Syracuse guard now playing for Clemson slow start to the a shooting the basketball for Gerard he got a going actually in the championship of that tournament first sign of Zone here from Syracuse out of the timeout LSU very late to get into the tee of this 23 and a deflection by Starling with two and 1 half to go the mix so far for red alry in the first six games manto man versus Z how do you like the way hes mixed in Mass defenses I like it I I actually think their manto man defense has been better than maybe the numbers would indicate and I think part of that is the tempo theyre playing Stewart all alone for the offensive rebound off a Miss by wri heres Fountain who ran into cuff tried to draw the charge no call either way Brown is high out on the George Washington transfer Hunter Dean four to shoot for LSU its Hannibal late in the clock its got to be Hannibal didnt get the rim Dean did on a follow the shot clock reset but Brown have the airc rebound but thats the other problem Kevin with their defense is theyve been a bad re rebounding team they havent finished possessions I mean even there no points for LSU but three offensive rebounds to keep the possession alive K cup Jr the sophomore transfer from Kansas Syracuse team that is fueled by secondyear players in a steal a takeaway and a break Stewart ston Carlos Stewart began his career at Santa claraa he is from Baton Rouge and unless you really prioritized homegrown Talent the transfer portal and against this defense theyre too plugged up youre not going to be able to back down like that if youre Starling into a clow C up it well short offensive rebounder Brown and snatched by Applause Fountain ARS have gone about three minutes without a point and this physical game is not seen too many fouls whistled just one against Su so far right right right through the body of cuff theres the second foul as cuff reached around Kyle cuff Jr picks up the personal but de Copelands going to check in for the first time for Syracuse Chris Bell as well something you didnt always see in the Jim beheim era nine players play in the first half for Syracuse which would sometimes be only seven deep in some of Jim Bim Seasons little bit deeper a little bit more faster paced as you said for Syracuse still a team finding an identity seven games into the Adrian a era Trey Hannibal will draw the foul Copeland just in the game picks up personal well the reality is playing manto man takes more effort it takes more energy and so youre if youre going to play it the way that Adrian archery wants it played youre going to need to go into your bench a little bit you know the other thing too Kevin like I think hes still trying to find guys who can do multiple things theyve had a lot of onedimensional guys in the early part of this year like if if Chris Bell is not making threes what does he do you know how do you impact winning and I think he goes Adrien Archers gone to that bench to try to you know continue to try to figure that out they Haven been a great threepoint shooting team they havent been a great low post presence team they had a lot of their points from attacking with mince and Starling but right now mince is off the floor and Syracuse is very deep in the shot clock with no forward movement its a long two Brick by Starling in the Tennessee gagi games we saw two many of those types of possessions for Syracuse well and from Starling in particular he takes too many tough shots Music right LSU with four reserves in the game right now along with Stewart right nice drop off Fountain finishes and a really nice cut from behind the defense by Fountain really a smart player off the ball tigers have trailed most of the game on a seven nothing run C in a difficult layup here is Stewart on the LSU run out Stewart hopping in into traffic fountains there for another offensive rebound for the Tigers somehow there was not a tie up or a foul until the very end and theres a Syracuse personal Roger SS has a foul at the end of all that against Benny Williams they are letting him play like call the first foul I mean there b could have been called for foul on there too listen weve always said in the ACC SEC challenge throw the records out the window we have always said that all 11 minutes and 20 seconds of this competition which will continue with the mens games tomorrow womens ACC challenge wraps Thursday Jordan Wright bricks it three and Williams is first to the ball for LSU which has been great on the offensive glass and then the Tigers throw it away you know Syracuse they play two3 Zone on under out of bounds its a default and I actually think it it gives them an opportunity in this game again LSU like in that game against Nicholls they lost at the buzzer Nicholls Zone them the whole game Wake Forest Zone them the entire second half I think zone is good against LSU four and a half without a point for Syracuse that drout is over out of three from Chris Bell Applause with his feet set he is a deadly threepoint shooter Reed over dribbled it but Clouds back on the floor Syracuse has the takeaway heres Benny Williams its not a good shot a long two early in the shot clock and Adrian ay immediately goes to his bench for Justin Taylor per perhaps to get Williams for that reason well find out at the under eight Tigers just one for seven from three in the game 8 for 22 overall another Miss three and Reed cleans it up the ninth offensive rebound for LSU on 15 missed shots its a 60 offensive rebound rate early in the Applause game in the too strong right with the rebound look at the tempo LSUs trying to play with right again Williams high points at an LSU is screaming for a go they will not get it and we will step aside Chris Bell when his feet are set he is a deadly threepoint shooter you cannot be off of him on penetration and then how about this on the other end Jayla Reed send it home Music Matt McMahons LSU team has been rebuilt by transfers this year they are still without another major one though and theyre hoping to get Jaylen cook back but without him LSUs become a little bit of a bigger team theyre relying Less on ball booing on point guard play theyre dominating the glass right now against the Syracuse team that does have some height and a lot of it coming with nem McLoud off the floor and there is the aention Jayla cook who a 20p point per game score at two lane last year began his career at LSU this is a second time transfer the NCAA denied his appeal to play immediately November 1st LSU is appealing that decision and about a month later theyre waiting on the results of that appeal so the Tigers have taken on a little bit of a different tone without him they run the offense more through this guy Baker all oh denied by McLoud and Taylor its a shot clock violation what do you miss with Jaylen cook besides the high octane scoring through LSU well you miss his experience I mean youre playing a freshman in Mike Williams at that position and hes been serviceable but hes not jayen cook and so you miss that experience the scoring the ball handling the decision making late game stuff late shot clock stuff just a dynamic scorer and an experienced player JJ Starling fouled and as with most of these appeals it is still a mystery as to when there might be a ruling what the ruling is based on not all twotime transfers are approved by the NCAA cook started his career here when will Wade was the coach very good player at tan was first team All Conference player there hes practicing hes traveling hes still Sitting Waiting Wishing for an opportunity on the court JJ starling its the first and two you know this this waiver thing you cant have it both ways you know like coaches complained when we were getting multiple transfers but when its their guy they want the waiver granted and Im not saying there arent sad stories out there now Jaylen Cooks would not be one of those but you know not all of these are are equal obviously but I think the NCA is looking at at it like that because they were asked Applause to teams do not have to make the information public as well as to why they apply for certain waivers so as M draws a blocking foul its still something thats going to frustrate fans if its your team if its another team you dont understand it theres a lot that goes into it it it is a frustrating process I know for folks but it is the process right now well the the interesting thing about Jaylen Cooks as he started his career at LSU and of course you had the embarrassment that was Will Wade and that whole situation he goes to Tain for the two years like you said now hes back at LSU so his Situations a little bit different and you know ultimately is his transfer hurting to Lane maybe maybe not its certainly not hurting LSU because hes trying to play now again at LSU Mike Williams whos had to play a lot in his absence just picked up his second foul as mince rolls a couple of free throws home Syracuse is back in front there not been a crisp offensive display for either team earns at 30 tigers at 35 one for eight from three as Bell knocks it out of bounds from right that MC manah told us before the gamr assist rate is like at an alltime low for when Ive been coaching four assists right now on nine made field goals why is the ball movement not there well will Bakers been taken out of the game and not only does he score he does a lot of facilitating of their offense in the corner Stewart that would have been an assisted basket from Hannibal Reed with another offensive rebound for LSU 11 of those right another Miss three Baker and a foul underneath that will go against will Baker tell you what Syracuse is lucky that of these 12 offensive rebounds LSU has only two second chance points and a lot of it is theyre kicking those offensive rebounds out for three and theyre not making those theyre one of 10 from three but at some point you know that water is going to meet its level and that offensive glass is going to become problematic for Syracuse its a oneonone situation here Roger SS is walking over to the scores table for some confirmation we get to see who should be shooting the free throws Judah minz is ready to do so if it was a question now its Jud Min Id try to shoot the free throws too hes already shot four and made them all we go and MIT will get the second Syracuse coming off a Maui Invitational where they lost to Tennessee 7356 and kaga 7657 and had a 49point win over division to Shaman in the finale its really struggled against Tennessee at 22 against Gonzaga and then in the big win over out more of a facilitator five assists only took three shots he has been the scorer for Syracuse this year Dustin Taylor with a oranges fifth foul well part of it in that Tennessee game with mins he was in foul trouble and thats why I I think youve got to go after him youve got to make him defend hasnt picked up a foul yet tonight inside Reed the cloud is there and Reeds able to finish all the same third basket for Jaylen Reed he is so talented Jaylen Reed guy who originally signed with Florida and then when Mike White was was let go from there reopened his recruitment ends up here at LSU 610 with guard skills McLoud with a catch McLoud over Dean a whole lot of contact there and no foul call and then LSU throws it away if this games going to become a crisply played basketball game it will probably have to happen in the second half yeah its a foul no question Vince as shoes the McLoud screen and mince is fouled again this is Matt McMahons worst nightmare right now I mean Judah Mintz has taken almost half of Syracuses free throws on the season I mean his ability to get to the line is prolific and a lot of it is his athleticism his ability with the ball hes very deceptive hes good obviously using the ball screen but hes very good at rejecting it hes very good against drop coverage like I I think so many guards s have worked and worked against drop coverage that theyve become so much better at playing against it and creating that twoonone but hes also good at selling it and and its you know how hes officiated is a big part of Syracuse games that McMahon mentioned the eight free throws a game he felt like they could not give him right now he is eight for eight Syracuse has hit six shots from the field and 12 from the line and leads by four four Wen the brick wall of McLoud Cuts him off Stewart misses a three dean fights for the offensive rebound LSU wins it stage up all over again miss three offensive rebound usually that ends with another Miss though from the Tigers right and theres a make and thats their game and off of those offensive rebounds those threes are open for a reason I think you got to start driving that basketball if youre real issue this their second basket after one of the 12 offensive rebounds Starling drives Starling misses as Starling picks it back shot clock didnt reset its down to eight its Bell stepping in and he has not been the same off the dribble as he has as a catch and shoot three and it was a good close out by Jordan Wright to make him take that dribble LSU without Damen Collins a 610 Jr from Kentucky Dean getting some more minutes in his stad and Dean turns it over with a travel the uniforms look good the basketball so far not so much the lead is two for Syracuse here the JMA Wireless dome in snowy Central New Music York the buzzer uh well Jud has been the story tonight guys hes taken twice as many free throws as the entirety of LSUs team hes got 13 of Syracuse is 27 Syracuse had six shots from the field Chris 6 for 23 from the field and yet theyre winning the game yeah and theyve given up 12 offensive rebounds its been a strange first 17 minutes fair to say no field goals in about 520 now for the ARs mint driving again Min will pass pass out of it this time Starling no hes only hit one three on the year and then youre not going to believe this folks youre really not Judah minz was just fouled person foul number Jordan wri Syracuse is in the double bonus and minz will get an automatic two more be in the bonus I mean he really is like a running back finding the hole I mean that that drive there on the kick out to Starling that defense is trying to collapse and hes just so Shifty when he gets in there and with the way that JJ Starling has shot it good job assuming a miss and Gathering the offensive rebounds some guys man especially scorers like Mintz they just have a knack for getting to that foul line and hes got two more 10 for 10 from the free throw line for Judah Min Syracuse a team which has historically had some trouble shooting free throws is perfect on 14 tries last week against Tennessee they were 8 for 17 at the line in a loss and theres a foul on a high against Sterling thats the sixth on Syracuse JJ Sterlings first will Bakers on the bench right now with two for LSU Tyrell ward has two fouls Mike Williams has two no Syracuse player for Adrian ay with more than one thats what Im saying its not just the points that mince puts up from the line its the foul trouble he puts your team in Stewart driving an into mince who does not have a foul and holds up brilliantly there tried to poke it away from mince tried to bump him from behind Taylor spinning waiting all kinds of trouble to pass two tall for mince who just barely kept it in the front Court Orange avoids the turnover and theyll reset with two to play and 10 to shoot why not min again is the goto guy it inside to Brown Its a field goal the first in about 6 minutes for Syracuse Syracuse and a great look to Taylor the shooter you cant leave him leaves brown wide open Brown defending on Reed that foul will be a continuation foul Ron gr delayed before counting the shot nice job here he looks at Taylor and because Taylors that shooter you got two guys going to Taylor help from Jordan wght coming over late and a dunk from Malik Brown and some vociferous booze from the orangs CL folks as Reed finishes a threepoint play Hannibal and Wilkinson will return for LSU Stewart and Ward take a seat 90 seconds in this first half which has been dominated at the foul line by Syracuse 14 made free throws seven made field goals Starling Taylor fak it into a mess of traffic vce will give it to Taylor on the left wing no good on a three brown high flying the deflection and Minch will throw it right to read LSU always looking to run the is stuck by the rim stuck it on the front of the iron and now Bell Way Off the Mark lets see if this chaotic sequence will continue with a gr transfer right good time out it will not good timeout you go two for one what a I dont know what to think of that last exchange thankfully we have 30 seconds to try to sort it out by a word Sprite moment Judah his own tonight I mean hes been by far the best player on the floor hes looked like a pro and hes done it really started off the bounce I mean he has gone right by this LSU defense and often times we talk about a shooter being in a Zone you can get into a Zone driving the ball but then they lose him here I mean how you lose the best player on the floor and leave him that wide open have no idea 25 on the night he has just been dominant he has scored 18 of the last 20 Syracuse points over a 9 Minute 34 second span coming out of that timeout the only basket Syracuse has scored in the last n and a half minutes that was not scored by Judah brown or Judah minz was assisted by Judah minz the dunk by Malik Brown so every Syracuse basket or free throw and nearly a 10minute span Juden has had something to do it game high lead of 13 for Syracuse out of the timeout LSU thrown it all over the place tend to shoot for Ward Trey Hannibal Off the Bench into the corner step in for right M cloud is there right lays it up and right scores it Jordan right six points on the game for the gr transfer from Vandy its Trey now draws the Jud assignment LSU shapeshifting defenses Music here Starling a cloud to the tip no its going to be LSU ball well it the shape shifting whatever it is I mean they are matching up to your point theyre in some sort of a Zone but it didnt stop the penetration again I mean easy access ACC to the middle of the lane for JJ staring what can LSU do better with the ball on offense or they just look so uncomfortable and again theyre not this refined offensive team a steal for Starling hes got Min running with him Starling tried to take it himself hadal emerges from The Fray LSUs got numbers here four on two right with space another Miss three one for 14 for the tigers in the game and here comes Mintz and Mintz is going to draw a blocking foul in a year where its very difficult to draw a charge Judah Min draws a f on Hannibal I mean thats close like I you know his foot was it started on the restricted Arc and then he lifted it but regard regardless when youve played as well as Mintz has youre going to get the benefit benefit of the doubt and it what starts the break for Mintz was another threepoint shot a long rebound the block charge rule has changed this year Defenders must establish a legal guarding position before opponents place the last foot on the floor the plant foot used to be ah had to be in a legal guarding position before a player takes off and goes airbo so there have been a lot more blocks and a lot fewer charges called this year the thought is thats going to help offense in the game early on do you like the way the new Block charge rule is being applied I like it conceptually um I I dont think its made it any easier for officials to make the call in fact I think a lot of calls have aired on this its interesting the way it was we had officials airing on the side of a charge I think were airing more on the side of a block and missing some charges hanal off the offensive rebound scores it Trey hanal is a very good rebounder for a smaller player at 62 LSU continuing to crash the glass now 13 offensive rebounds Starling Taylor tied up by Hannibal back out for Miss Starling he is not a threepoint shooter hell drive it hell lose it pable to takeway good minutes for him theres Tyro he lays it up and LSUs back with a nine turnovers leading to offense thats that oxygen for LSU and JJ Starling has not played well tonight I mean thats just a soft giveaway eight points off seven turnovers for LSU we will um fill in the gray areas on that block charge you a little bit more when we return to the doome you visual Learners through the new Block charge rule for this my demonstrator alltime Defender Kevin Brown going to help the way the old rule was written the secondary Defender had to slide into position before I would go Airborne so there he is wow hes been bulking up thank you now the way the rule is written hes got to slide over before my last foot is planted so here I come come in its clearly a flop and a really really big time block Kevin Brown hes dead Im still sore is this the replay of your oh no this is the play in the game its hard to tell based on the level of physicality I mean that was more of a charge than what you tried to take know what you call what you were doing youve been playing in foul trouble all day my friend you have been on the bench press though I could tell yeah those pectorals of yours yeah the bench press of holding a fiveweek old who needs a Jim just going a baby that was the play ear was called to block against Trey hanal Judah Mintz living at the free throw line hes 13 for 15 hes got 27 of Syracuses 43 points the orange with one basket from somebody other than Judah minz in about a 12 and 12 minute span and that is not somebody other than Judah minz he does it again hes got 29 a new career high for the sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland there is nobody on LSU who has taken up the challenge of trying to keep the ball in front Hannibals giving LSU a spark Off the Bench Ward thats a little better now ball movement wise for the Tigers and theyre starting to to stack some offensive possessions scoring possessions together they just cant stop really Judah min oh but six of LSUs points have come into paint minin gets around the McLoud screen hes got the length of Ward on him at 66 right now mince back from Starling now Reed at 610 fronts in lost the dribble Taylor they lost him he does not make LSU pay and McLoud and Bell somehow kept it in bounds but its Hannibal little three on two here and Mintz knocks it away from right and its going to be Syracuse ball M doing it Applause Music all its not a good ball handling team to begin with I mean that theyre its I I should correct myself right really knocked away from himself yeah it mince stood up there but I mean that was selfinflicted 13 turnovers for LSU 16 made field goals they are giving Taylor lots of space a late clows out a drive by Copeland and the first basket for somebody other than mints in the second half clader Copeland is on the board just four bench points for Syracuse in the game a deep three is good for Jordan wri and finally after a 1 for 15 nightmare of a start of three goes down for the Tigers Bell thats his Applause spot and these other guys for Syracuse were quiet in the first half get a bucket from Copeland and theyre from Bell right off the bouns to Dean Bell goes flying over the shoulder and a foul against Chris Bell his first and heres that c copelan bucket and this has been a microcosm of LSU all Night Watch Hunter deine here heres the penetration and this is just thats Olay I mean thats nondefense and its been like that obviously on Judah Mintz most of the night but nobody from LSU has gotten in a stance tried to keep the ball in front syracus has has had access to the rim all night long de at the line now the grb transfer from maville hits the first of two Daman Collins suffered a dislocated shoulder in the north Florida game on Friday s Dean has been a big Off the Bench the cloud will take a seat leik Brown Music returns one for two Applause kadine so Syracuse team that returned three starters three of its top four reserves from a year ago four sophomore starters a young team growing game by game in the first year under Adrien ay Mitch lost it got it back left it short a rear Min Miss its saved by Brown Copeland shovels for Bell Taylor didnt take it Bell will take it B will make it at the other end War could not Applause answer and thrown away by Copeland right back to LSU much to the dismay of a red hot red Al we saw that expression a time or two from his predecessor in the last 47 years you got to love it I mean its you know his his point is well taken where are you going you got a 13point lead playing a team thats had a hard time scoring you certainly dont need to be in a rush what did you take away from the pregame chat with red hre you know he hes trying to establish a different set of habits know its his program now but hes trying to do it with a young team to what you were saying a moment ago that tight up thats a jump ball well played by brown and suu has the era and you know look theres some guys on this Syracuse team whose body language doesnt give you a lot you know Chris Bell sometimes you wonder what hes thinking he can shoot though its 4 three and it leads to a Matt McMahon timeout this

three they are two for 18 from Deep they are not a good threepoint shooting team typically and they have not been tonight mince again penetrating and a foul is going to go again against LSU Tommy morrisy says keep it right Music here you know when you build a defensive scheme it starts with deciding what youre willing to give up and and you know clearly Syracuse willing to give up that three to a team that hasnt shot it well all year and theyre 37 but its low volume 14 for 26 in the opener six game sense they made five threes per game at 31 its a driving team and a team thats played around will Baker who Syracuse has taken out of the game Taylor denied theres Baker a good defense and Bell gets the recovery Copeland behind the back a little Dipsy Doo Prader copelan making magic Applause happen oh by the way Malik Brown had the bucket that is the secondary portion of that play another the three hoisted and if youre an LSU fan you got to be feeling like its the same possession on repeat two for 19 from three and the orange running away with it we are celebrating vwe here at ESPN the story of Jaylen Reed a young man whos been through a lot when we return to the Applause Music Dome more harrowingly than others Jaylen Reed a terrific sophomore for is from a line of basketball greatness in the SEC his dad Justin was an all americ and all Miss six years ago his dad Justin passed away at age 35 angio saroma of blood cancer was a phenomenal player leading score in the SCC LED Old Miss to its first sweet 16 you can see his dads name tattooed on the left side of his arm its Dad Justin its under a basketball with wings theres what looks like a Halo but is a letter O for a man named Omar Carter who was jaylens trainer somebody who spent a lot of time in the gym with after his dad passed away young man whos been through absolutely the worst you can be as Taylor hits it through we get to spend some time with Jaylen before practice today Chris an incredibly impressive young man the way hes dealt with adversity in his life was very powerful to both of us incredibly powerful hes a stud and you know just asking him about the grieving process and and losing a father who as he told us he was incredibly close to he looked up to its just is an impressive young man whos got you know obviously everything going for him he also told us he was 59 as a freshman you asked him where he got his guard skills from yeah i played point guard at 59 he said then sophomore year I was 67 so he is one of their better decision makers at 610 and now about 242 lbs and hes had a good start to the year you know he hes put on about 16 pounds of muscle in the off season hes gotten tougher hes going to be a good player nine points 10 rebounds tonight but his team down 21 and thrown away by Ward another turnover 15 for LSU Copeland Bell basket no Browns tip in is there a 16 to one Syracuse surge to take the life out of the Tigers a little tussle after the whistle here with a frustrated Tyro Applause Ward Music Applause Music yeah there was nothing there in fact looked like Malik Brown got took a shot in the face you know its interesting teams coming off of Maui if you I dont have the data in front of me Im not a data guy Kevin math was never my strong but I would imagine and certainly if you look at it last year you know some of those teams coming out of Maui the performance was not good its and you would understand why I mean the travel for certainly a Syracuse would be far to come back its three games three days a lot of teams coming off of that trip you know the energy in that first second game back is not great its been the opposite for Syracuse tonight I mean they have been shot out a cannon out of a cannon from the opening tip the balls had energy to it their defense has been active this is as good as Syracuse has looked all season and I think you know look they lose a Tennessee Gonzaga both teams seems like they didnt find anything you know both those teams are obviously as you know as good as anybody nationally but the shamad game just to feel good about yourself to see the ball go through the basket to see the ball move other guys get involved I thought it was an important game for them on the way out of there and theyve had great energy tonight had seven players in double figures they won by 49 now its Shaman its a division 2 Team you should do that but a team thats lost its first two games in Maui may not have the motivation may not be feeling great about themselves so Adrien Audrey was really impressed with that performance and one of the big numbers is three Judah minz took three shots in that game didnt need to force the issue in the game Syracuse is winning big tonight when Syracuse was lacking for anybody else offens L he does force the issue well and you know judahs into the game if hes attacking the rim you know there are times where he can settle for Jays and you know tonight he knew early that he was going to have a going and getting to the foul line a big part of that two free throws for Jordan Wright the team High 11 for him third foul on cader copelan judeman with 29 a new career high surpassing the 26 points he scored the second game of the year against kesas MCE trying to break down Fountain in the lane swatted out by Brown who gets his hands on so many basketballs and Chris Bell connects at the end of it brown the tip Taylor the feed Bell the Deep delivery his fifth Music three and theres Copeland active hands again this time it didnt work out for him and Tyro Ward finishes but the activity continues to be strong defensively for Music Syracuse Taylor a lot of dribbling by right theres Brown again who throws it off of Rights not sure anybody on the Syracuse team gets their hands on more deflections or loose balls than Malik Brown he knows his role he excepts his role thats a heck of a play there and you know the difference between the first half and the second for Syracuse has been these other guys around Judah minz contributing getting involved Malik Brown who is 68 now with two steals tonight he has multiple steals in all seven of Syracuses games this year averaging nearly three per game theres a telegraph pass by Copeland take away for Stewart and he beats Fountain Derek Fountain the 610 senior from Holly Springs Mississippi with a two Vince again going to work Taylor little bit sloppier the last couple of possessions for the Y Syracuses 11 turnover JJ Sterling will take over for Copeland its an LSU team that has lost 12 consecutive true Road games their only true Road game in the nonconference there were 0 and N last year and they are in an abyss here in the dome Reed hting a round offside iron and its Starling just in the game with a rebound Taylor another Telegraph pass and this time its a finish for Jordan wri and a atres pointing for at least one player Benny Williams off his bench with frustration mounting despite the big lead and hell take a timeout try to settle this situation down six in a row for LSU trying for a late surge but they are in jumping ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires beginning tonight right now its the SEC on top in two games South Carolina tring to get 6 and0 into Lamont Paris Kentucky beating Miami in the headline matchup Georgia Tech over Mississippi State at pit and Missouri in a tight one in the second half at the peak surprise team for you in the ACC this year what do you think you know I think Pittsburgh if you know coming off of what they did last year I mean how is he still wide open Syracuse is seven for eight from three and a half at Chris Bell with his six threepointer of the game you know if were in a pickup game and a guy has three threes you know somebody saying get on that guy I dont know how hes still open How about if he has five anyway to your question Pittsburgh if they can come back you know you you do it again uh and I think they have the ability to do it even though theyve turned over that roster pretty significantly yeah if you havent seen pit yet uh watch for the Freshman guard bub Carrington Baltimore kid who was pretty special Blake Hinson returns as well Panthers trying to go back to back in the NCAA tournament under Jeff cable Mintz fake the pass drives it and scores it hes in the 30s for the first time in his career 31 for the terrific sophomore and then theres that a quick three Miss by Applause Music right if looks could kill from the LSU sideline inside mince and a takea away Brown got a hand to it again the brown got fouled the want to in this game I know you said youre not a data guy you cant measure that but we can see which team has it theres no question I mean the the energy from from Syracuse all night and I I think youve seen it build here in the second half cuz other guys are starting to make shots and offense will do that to your defensive energy and look there are times I mean we talked about the number of new faces for LSU and the job that Matt McMahon has has with all of the transfers hes had to plug holes with and they have looked fractured at times they have looked fractured all night I mean they look like a bunch of individuals out there on the floor its a team that played well too in the Charleston classic they lost to Dayton on the last second three they rally to win the next two games beating North Texas by four beating Wake Forest in overtime Matt McMahon liked the way that they responded to some late game adversity Matt McMahon just waved off a player that was going to sub in the game and he is as up to his wits end as weve seen him been a long time right now with LSU down by 22 tigers have turned it over 18 times tonight Benny Williams getting some late minutes for Syracuse a close out on Bell finally but B will just do that hell score it off the drive and hes got Music 20 Reed drives it count the bucket for jayen Reed double double for the sophomore you know it was interesting talking to Matt McMahon earlier today you know his best teams hes had really Dynamic guards I mean start with John Moran I mean hes had some really good guards that he has coached his best players this year are big guys we havent seen will Baker play play well tonight and hes been horrible and these other guards are theyre not again not real skilled and so its been a different Dynamic I think for M McMahon to try to figure out how they can be consistent offensively again they didnt know if theyd have jayen cook but they hoped they would have him 20 point per game score point guard transferred in from tan still waiting on the result of their appeal from the NCAA for immediate waiver they just cant shoot right now theyre two for 21 as Williams misses a three Syracuse meanwhile a team that has struggled to shoot its now 10 for 17 after that bell Miss kept Alive by Brown inside to Williams and Williams is rejected by Wright Jordan right on the drive Stripped by Brown and off the kneecap of right back to the Music AR it did go off him Jordan Wright has not played well and its you know I think hes trying to find himself offensively his efficiency has been down especially in their last two Music games mince with 31 he and Bell have combined for 51 mince as long of steps as you can get make it 33 and now the mince Spell combination has as many points as as the entire LSU team as Fountain misses a Applause Music bunny Benny Music Williams the airs out of the shot clock for Mintz hell set up Williams who is off Target for three they could use some nice late minutes for Benny Williams who has been in and out of the lineup defending now against Reed and Reed spins and misses a highpoint rebound for Music Applause Williams just an utterly dominant second half 3328 after the first half Syracuse with a 4325 plus 18 advance half here Starling back from Brown Williams Brown and another takeway Here Comes Ward and Ward is denied High Point rejection by Chris Bell heres Williams back for Bell blocked the shot on one end missed the three on the other been a while since weve had a whistle it feels like and sah Qs a slowing down who cares were up 23 right two for 22 from three for Music LSU what an early impressive marker this is going to be for Adrian atres team three home wins as Williams buries it from Deep the oranges 113 and this LSU team much like Syracuse is still a work in progress but the orange starting to finally come alive in game seven of the Adrian alri ERA this has been a heck of a show for Chris Bell look at that block up near the square and then Benny Williams getting in on Music it Chris Bell show those two have scored as many as all of LSUs 10 tonight thats a heck of a graphic right there I mean what do you make it that uh I make it with the Judah bids and Chris Bell have been pretty good at basketball tonight thats my high level analysis right there Chris thats why I get paid LS that is to draw charges from you hey look that was the highlight of your night that was it the charge you took the low light of your day look there are two sides to to tangle with here in the last two and a half minutes the LSU side which is a couple of close losses late to Nicholls and Dayton some tough last second losses but a more encouraging start for m m mans team after last season they really cratered down the stretch theyve just been outworked in every way theyve made poor decisions offensively that you pointed out where do they go forward from this I know its early in the season so theres plenty of time to figure it out theyve got to hang their hat on defense and I think what you saw tonight is they really struggle to guard the ball if you dont hand it to them if in other words if you dont turn it over you you are going to make offense hard to come by for them by the way final score the ACC SEC mens challenge the first game to go final Advantage ACC Mississippi State knocked from the ranks of the unbeaten by Georgia Tech One nothing ACC as a strong finish comes here for Hannibal 67 59 in Atlanta and the ACC looks like its about to go 2 and0 to start this challenge after for Syracuse brought their best performance of the year the second half against Kate they were down 24 they greatest comeback win at least since 1976 this has been the Oranges best allaround effort and theyve finally done so with some threepointers but its been Judah Min leading the way so did you learn anything tonight about Syracuse do you think Adrien ay learned something about about his team yeah I I think the rebounding can still be an issue cuz remember they they gave up 12 offensive rebounds in the first half it didnt hurt him because LSU couldnt convert but it it gets back to the point we making at the top with cuse if Chris Bell if Justin Taylor if these guys off their bench Can impact winning in other ways you know then thats when this team I think takes another step and you know certainly Mintz putting on solo show in that first half but in the second half the difference has been these other guys and he will get an appropriate Ovation after 33 hey tip off your weekend with another star studed NBA double header we started in Boston with a 76ers take on the Celtics at 730 Eastern then nicoa yic and the Nuggets defending champs against Devin Booker the Suns coverage begins at 7 Eastern six Central with NBA Countdown on ESPN and the ESPN at Peter carry getting some run the sophomore from Sunderland Massachusetts big number 23 in orange and white with a minute to play in a 23point Syracuse Music lead B with 20 points five off a career high tonight heres Williams and LSU will have a couple of possessions left in a game where will baker their leading scorer scored just three that three is missed by Wilkinson and the Tigers it appears will finish two for 23 from threepoint range a lot to work on for Matt McMahons team which will be their 13th consecutive loss on the road as a program for Syracuse an explosive 40 minutes particularly in the second half and of the shot clock Copeland will just hold it take the violation and its time for tonights player of the game brought to you by Continental Tire tough call who Could That Be what a night I mean what a night he he was all over the place we had to get our whole crew to vote on this it was a big tiebreaker career high 33 points for Judah Minch it is a budgeting in the ACC SEC challenge Syracuse swamp LSU with a huge second half 80 to 5
