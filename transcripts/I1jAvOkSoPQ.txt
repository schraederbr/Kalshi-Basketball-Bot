see hes working hard downstairs and he puts it in off the glass Notre Dame starts the scoring tonight great footwork great footwork inside and if youre a big thats something you really want to have is great put work great balance as you get banged around in there you dont travel Nate lashevski leading scorer on this Irish team averaging 15 points a contest and the three ball goes on the other end for Britain Watts hey Britain Watts a local product quick fire just missed by Dane Goodwin Watts played for Colbert Academy right here close to Notre Dame Watts with a lot of family in attendance tonight as you mentioned just about a 40minute drive south played high school ball at Culvers Academy this is his first Collegiate game back in the state of Indiana so he wants to what make this one count for sure and on the other end Cormac Ryan drains it he stays hot hes had a great run here lately the ball seems to just find the net Ryan 14 points last outing against Syracuse and then the matchup prior the big 23point outing against Michigan State where he actually absolutely lit up the floor from Deep ski goes up to grab the board Ryan uses that screen takes another jumper Applause and on the other end Watts wants to push the tempo backs it out gives it off to Fletcher tinnin very important Boston does not let the ball stick got to continue to move the Irish defense Music I on the Block posted up against lachetsky hes got four left has to force it off the glass and it rolls out board is secured by lachetsky Applause Music looks like the Boston you really wants to try to push it a little bit more against the Irish trying to wear down five or six guys that play a lot of minutes Notre Dame a team not with a lot of depth theyll only go about seven deep and thats with the recent edition of Marcus Damon who finally got healthy last game against Syracuse that made his season debut but before that they were only going about 60 Goodwin working hard underneath and it looks like itll stay with Notre Dame early on from this one Notre Dame has a year as we welcome you back we take a look at head coach Joe Jones now in his 12th season with the bu program number two alltime in wins at bu hes done a great job what a great competitor he is hes a perfect fit for this institution and you know hes done an incredible job getting this team in the postseason play being able to be consistent get those 20 wins uh really uh well respected especially in the league led the Terriers to 22 wins a season ago and is poised for even a bigger season this year after they were picked to finish number two in the preseason poll in The Patriot League meanwhile Cormac Ryan picks up where he left off with a triple great kick out by his teammate Dave found him on the perimeter got a great look and knocked it in Ryan averaging just over 12 points a game and hes been shooting the three ball crazy as of late and on the defensive end Notre Dame with a big block underneath throwback Ryan has a great instinct to block shots hes very long good win looks the bulldoze white inside instead itll go fade away Nevin zinc was in search of Walter White cutting under the basket for the two miscommunicated Music work together as a team coach Bray talked so much about dont let the ball stick and theyre just a great kick out if he gets a great look right now it just in his mindset hes going to make it and weve seen that the last few games where he just has a lot of confidence from that threepoint line Ryan been shooting the lights out of the ball as of late 11 of his 16 last threepoint attempts have gone and Trey wurtz finds himself in an interesting situation that one wont count as we take a look at head coach Mike gray in his 23rd season at the helm of this program and hes got a squad thats his most experienced ever this year it is its amazing that the age of his players and that tells a lot about him as a coach that they want to stick around they want to play for him and they theyve all come back to win for him and get back in this tournament another name is coming off a 24win season and made their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2017 fell on the round of 32 in a close contest but one two matchups one in the first four and then one in the round of 64 and this year with all the returners you got to think theyre poised for more and it wouldnt you shoot like that its gonna be a long day for Boston University Cormac Ryan continues his hot streak and timeout bu shot that one from Granger Cormac Ryan Music theres four Mac Ryan already eight points in this contest and 23 as he has Notre Dame on an 80 scoring run you know when you get a young a player especially like Cormac Ryan that just has a feel now every time he lets it go its just hes got to think its going in and in reality it has here lately miles Brewster checked into the game dishes it off to Harper in the corner none of the block zinc has it in his pass is picked off by Trey wurtz wurtz tries to use the screen from Alan Lubin instead Marcus Hammond has it his second game back in an Irish Jersey takes a shot from the corner Hammond was out early this season but made his season debut against Syracuse played 19 minutes and thats six points and you know thats exactly what coach Bray is trying to do is get these younger guys in the game early and uh its a breath of fresh air to get a rotation of seven where a coach feels a lot more comfortable Nevin Zink the senior from Newtown Connecticut with the basket on the other end to stop the scoring run for Notre Dame Brewster has it gives it back the zinc who tries to make a move on Ben Allen Lubin but hes hit with a foul hooked him with the arm you know thats an automatic call today by the referees you got to be able to make sure you stay Square not book hook the defender good call by the official substitutions from Notre Dame weve seen Ben Allen Lubin check in Marcus Hammond also on the floor yes I dont think weve seen this group together all year Applause where it started closely by Brewster gives it inside to the Freshman Van Allen Lubin who kicks out Goodwin has a three on the way and the board is pulled down by Brewster Dyers have had two really good looks at the three Morales this is inside the sink and its blocked from behind by Ben Allen Lubin you know what the thing that uh the Irish have really tried to focus in on they lost a tough game of Syracuse but they have not been healthy is an opportunity where again you get beat on the back side but you have the athleticism the blocks are shot and uh your race would have been an easy two points well lubins a freshman but in recent games has really seen an uptick in minutes has three doubledigit scoring performances in his last four games and you know he played early with a mask and that really as tough as a as an athlete and you can tell hes just being a little more confident without the mask one three from the corner from Nick Napoli comes up short words thrives inside makes the move and he finishes it all that was a concern as we talked to coach before the game is not allowing the Irish to drive on a straight line to the rim and there was an example where she was able to take a right to the rim Anthony Morales pulls the trigger from defense got it good looking shot by 22 he just came out there squared up and let it fly Morales with seven points Off the Bench the other day in the win over Mary Mack double ball screen here Works uses that ball screen Lubin has it from the top of the key and theyll take that free throw line jumper with ease were watching a freshman just grow up right in front of our eyes where he feels so comfortable the game is slowed down for him you can detail hes a lot more poised on the offensive end Mike Bray describes Lubin as a positionless basketball player as on the other end Brewster to the rack and lays it in off the glass yeah hes just got a great Knack and a great field that he could guard one through four very very easily and sometimes he was the post player hes had to play post defense a lot Hammond looks to drive inside has his pocket picked by Brewster Morales thought about for a second instead finds the big man zinc inside who gets an easy two great transition offense by Boston University there allowed a big to post up against the guard which is an easy tune for Boston you Applause Works has it being guarded by zinc a bit of a bit of a mismatch guard on big man right inside Lubin has it goes up top strong and is foul from behind just about 10 minutes into this contest Notre Dame a twopoint advantage over Applause these are two of the most experienced rosters in the country of Veteran leadership Music head coach ing look at that look at this is like a pickup game at the YMCA I think the average age is about 24 which is great for both teams for both programs now you dont see that every day this is actually Mike Brays most veteran team ever those six grad students but the most of any power five program out there well the thing I liked it as an educator hes the master educator theyre graduating from Notre Dame with her degree and many of them have moved on with a masters degree what a credit to the Notre Dame program well heres the young gun at the freethrow line and he sinks a parable to give Notre Dame a 1612 lead just over nine minutes into this first half all right Boston University talked a lot about trying to get the ball to the middle of the floor against the Irish and then attack him Tynan swings it over to Harper being guarded by Starling who used the screen from chimezie in the corner white has it takes the shot gets by Goodwin dishes it back out eight left on the timer white drives goes to the left hand and a beautiful finish for Walter White wow theres what you see someone thats got a lot of experience sixth year at bu and that was a great shot over great defense white took his medical red shirt in 2018 to 2019 and then he had in the extra covert year and hes in his 60s season here at bu hes a preseason all Patriot League selection and its warranted hes the leading scoring and leading rebounder on this team this season and theres the Freshman from the wing JJ Starling sinks the triple Irish now back into looks like their 23 match up here for the first time tonight and thats a big three for storylines youve been struggling shooting as of late one of his last 16 threepoint attempts fell coming into this contest thats true one of the things that I turned right back over which is unusual Applause turnover Beats from a corner three from White zi was battling with Ryan for the board and Notre Dame will win it yeah I think one of the things the transition for any freshman shooting that threepoint the game is just so much faster you have to work so much harder on both ends of the floor the shots been a little bit flat you can tell you had a little lift on that shot if he starts knocking down to three thats gonna be really really tough to defend him no question that Talent is there from Starling as he goes to the hoop and is fouled by the grad student Jonas Harper thats a great example right there you have to go out and guard him you dont close out very well then he doesnt take the shot then he attacks the basket which as youre watching this young player you have more than one skill set you got to be able to shoot it and drive it and thats what this youngster does so well Starling is a fivestar recruit he was ranked number 19 in the country by ESPN thats the highest ranked recruit in Notre Dame program history again played his basketball right over here at La Porte Robert Ramirez so the Irish staff got to build a great relationship with him being right there in his backyard not to mention Starling the first McDonalds AllAmerican at Notre Dame since Demetrius Jackson back in 2013 an excellent player during some really good basketball years Mike Bray had here yes Music another local Town Demetrius Jackson is oh heres the other Indiana native Watts foreign yearly had it poked Away by Ryan Music Applause Zone has really stymied for you right now the Us got to move Harper forces it from Deep Applause Dinan poked it out but now Notre Dames On The Run Ryan another three heat check and hes got it wow great find by JJ Starr than the great communication being able to see the floor being able to find the open man and if you want to find an open man you got to be looking for number five in the white Cormac Ryan already in double digits 11 points on three defaults secures another rebound Applause Music Ryan has possession guarded closely so he gives it off to Starling who misfires offensive rebound from Malcolm chimezie he gets it back working up against lachesky a few ball fakes finally gets it off but cant convert the one thing that you want your post Defenders to do is wall up but did exactly that he just stayed on the shoulder hands high didnt jump didnt leave his feet made up very very difficult to shoot over him Ryan looking to get a shot off instead he drives and kicks to Dane Goodwin in the corner and Goodwin buries it Applause theyre one of the best teams in the ACC Dane Goodwin shooting it at over 50 percent from deep and thats the reason why he can make it when he takes it really good shot selection from good win all season long but on the other end the counterpunch comes back from Britain Watts Watts says I can do that too and had another good look and said made two wide open threes foreign Music does so well is find the open man Beautiful Finish inside from starling and you can just see how his confidence has grown hes been given the ball hes the quarterback of this team and you can just see as a freshman hes getting more and more confidence each and every night out starting now up to seven points so far in this first half Watts trying to cut this lead a little bit Notre Dame on a 1331 and Starling charging towards the basket Applause Ace has been up and down and again I think the Irish would like to kind of slower back down and run a little time and run their offensive sets and Ray mate Boston you guard them so far Boston University only three of 11 from downtown meanwhile Notre Dame five of nine nice curl cut thats they good ones shot but just didnt drop Applause Notre Dame has played really solid defense here the last five minutes Music Boston Universitys only hit one of their eight last field goals but Walter White will change that Trend with a bucket inside Applause Irish a little bit winded you can tell this has been a long stretch here with not the ball really hasnt stopped very often no very fouls and so Iris needs to get to the rim the shots Gage rides Baseline and finishes finishes it nicely with a beautiful little floater from Nate lashetski well he can do a lot of things well you know and that was the concern for Boston University staff is how theyre going to handle him because hes not a true post player so its really hard for a fiveman to guard him because hes outside a lot looking to shoot threes and now he can put the ball on the floor as well Britain Watts only needs one hand to finish that basket off how excited is he to be back in Indiana playing and hes hes got uh his entire family uh Community everybody wanted to come back and see him since he has not played here in Indiana since leaving to go to the youth and hes putting out a good show so far eight points on three of six shooting Starling step back jumper Applause both teams playing up and down the court havent had a break in a while Fletcher Tynan drives inside on Goodwin his fade away is left short I think Goodwin got a bit of a piece and finally a timeout comes from Notre Dame and Mike Bray Notre Dame has a 10point advantage over Boston University theyre shooting the ball well Music so far so far tonight its been Cormac Ryan with the hot hand 11 points on tonight and Coach hes just been on a terrorism oh my goodness you know if you look at his statue look look at the three points thats not free throw percentage thats threepoint shooting percentage and the thing about flying Carmike Ryan is that hes not just living off the three he loves to attack and take that midrange jumper as well video game like numbers these past three games for the New York native he has Notre Dame with a 10point Advantage as we get a whistle and the ball will be headed the other way and well send we welcome you back we talked about how much of an experienced team there is and theres the numbers to back it up coach but were a thousand points scores on this round yeah you know you look at uh experience and experience happens to be the the formula for Success if you have experience it just covers up from so many things that you have multiple guys to score on the floor and you talk to opponents theyre playing Notre Dame they talk a lot about theres so many guys that can score different ways and that makes it so hard to defend them Cormac Ryan looking to join that list hes just under 900 career points so far and hes off to a good start tonight to meet at 11 points as well three from the corner Falls for Anthony Morales thats a good sign hes hitting threes thats gonna really open up the inside part of the game for Boston University Applause Music Goodwin uses the screen from Lubin gives it off to lashetsky great switch out there by Boston defensively Notre Dame has three to work with on the shot clock lucensky has it underneath throws it off the glass up and in count it and hes got a chance for one more at the line and knowing how much time he had on the clock that was precious it look at it he knows hes got to put up the shot hes gonna go draw the foul then he has the touch that it takes to go up high off the backboard big shot by the senior been having his best season to date came into this contest averaging 15 points a game to lead all scores on Notre Dame and hes doing this hes coming off his worst output of the season last game against Syracuse only had two points yeah and so far already surpassing that tonight with seven the two three Zone the length of Syracuse was very difficult for him to deal with he just didnt get too many opportunities not to mention eight rebounds tonight are ready for lachevsky underneath that time by Nevin zinc man zinc is a strong load he doesnt look like but he is very strong got wide physical took it strong to the basket and scored thrown up top to Dean Goodwin underneath Applause likes to do probably just settles for three he can post up his great postentry pass but better defense by Boston University there look at that basket from zinc look how wide and strong and then using that left hand and touch around the basket is so important for a big you have to play physical inside you also have to have a great touch at The Rim Nevin zinc transferred in last season from South Carolina Upstate and his season ended in the sixth game he had an injury that set him back a little bit but this season hes come back stronger than ever hes been a starter in every game and hes been averaging just under six points at about five rebounds per contest hes put together he is a strong young man Jones has it on the last second shot attempt but it doesnt go rebound to Trey works Applause Irish right into their motion offense a lot of cutting slip screens Applause awesome really pushing the ball up the floor underneath by Nate lashetsky yeah its a battle down there between the two postmen I mean hey the cheskys trying to fight him off but uh you can really see the sink has a great hes got the ball right where he wants right dead in the middle its hard to defend a guy when he gets the ball right in the middle of the lane well theres no doubt that zinc is the Big Man on this team he has 20 offensive rebounds entering tonight hasnt made an impact on the offensive glass yet but thatll be coming as his pass is tipped Away by Lubin Hammond has it and he wants to run dishes it back to Lubin who found him down the floor and a foul will come you know I think thats just a great hustle zinc gets blocked at one end but he doesnt pout about it as a coach you want to see how you handle that hes sprinting back and got a block at the other end foreign makes a mistake youre really looking as a coach to see how are you going to handle that mistake Sprint back and get back in the game so blocked out of bounds by Bu from the Baseline good win a quick jumper Notre Dame is so good on her out of bounds plays and Boston University worked on that today but they still were able to execute and get a great look diving at the midline is Nevin zinc and he retained possession for his team Britain Watts goes to the hoop puts it up and will be fouled by then Alan Lubin so hell be heading to the charity strike for two hes got to feel good about his game with so many of his fans and family right here uh watching her in South Bend After High School team I believe is here watching the game as well coach Mark Galloway and his team came to to cheer on a former alumni Watts drains the first and hes been having a fantastic season double digits three times this season for Ethan Britain Watts he only had four times double digits over the previous three seasons combined right thats a second were talking about a team thats older hes part of that group thats older and mature knows exactly what they need to do and theyre really excited theyre predicted second in this year but they feel they could win it all Watts hits both and now hes in double digits tonight with 10 Music foreign game clock shot clock difference at about seven seconds Music Ryan gets the handoff kicks it over to starling now wurtz has it uses the screen from lachetsky matched up against Nevin zinc now gonna have to go four on the shot clock Ryan has it working up against Brewster Brewster tipped it away Ryan has to force it last minute tried to get it up but it came up short and thatll be a beautiful defensive possession for the Terriers absolutely great defense and again thats what you want going into you dont want to give momentum to the opponent right before half and thats a great way to stop it by playing great defense now they have a chance to knock one in here in the last seven seconds Brewster picks it up use the screen from zinc hell go straight to the basket puts it up and a whistle comes looks like itll be another foul against Lubin great finish here by Boston University right before half you want to have some momentum going into halftime and you get a great stop and now you get an opportunity to cut that lead second foul tonight against Lubin foreign ER hits the first and he has three points on the night people have been making their free throws in this game too which is also a key part of an older team you just find that the they feel comfortable going to the line lets see what the Irish do with those last three three seconds to see if they can get a good shot up in the three seconds plenty of time Goodwin has the rebound doesnt have much time to go well have to keep it up from Deep looks like he didnt even get it off in time at the halftime break itll be Notre Dame with a 3629 lead over the Terriers from herself Pavilion stay tuned first half highlights coming up soon after this first possess a 3629 lead over the Boston University Terriers from Purcell Pavilion its been a great one so far as we welcome you back court side inside Purcell patch guarded alongside coach Mike Lightfoot thanks for staying with us and Coach a great first half Notre Dame was up by as many as 13 at one point now its been cut to seven at halftime you know its a great example of what we talked about the beginning of the game veteran players dont clinch and thats exactly what Boston University did this game they kept playing tough and both teams played solid I like the flow of the game because we had a lot of good things happening Inside Moves here Nathan going over that left shoulder which he loves hes solid in that again theres a local guy knocking down to three he had a great first half but both teams played really really solid uh insight and outside Cormac Ryan loves the different shots weve talked so much about him finding the net here and again Applause see another block inside so both teams have played really solid if they havent turned the ball into a great box again weve talked so much about getting the ball inside again heres a great up and under on the five but its been a great first half Applause no doubt its been an exciting first half you can see some of the story lines Cormac Ryan leading all sores 11 points and then Britain Watts right behind him with 10 points but the three ball for Notre Dame playing a role early theyre five of ten in that first half talk to the Irish talk to coach bright he always says the magic number is making at least 10 threes and so theyre right on target with that they only have very few turnovers and theyre making their free throws thats exactly kind of the stamp that coach bright puts on every team here at Notre Dame stick with us more is coming up from person well its been quite the road trip for the Boston University Terriers theyre on their sixth game of a seven game Road Trip that kicked off all the way back on November 20th itll be ending this Saturday coming up at Marist and hats off to the team you know traveling being here in the Midwest being all over the place bringing up a Marquette that takes a lot out of the team that takes a lot out of the teams but theyve been able to handle them right through it and thats the mental toughness it takes as you have an older team to get through such a long road trip its a bu team with a 54 record they started a season four and one dropped three straight games at the Cream City Classic in Milwaukee and then got a big bounce back fist Victory last Friday night against Mary Mack dont have the ball to start as white loses possession look to be tipped so he regains it brings it up has 10 to work with on the shot clock gives it off to watts now watts is matched up with Ryan hell pull it and a beautiful shot over Cormac Ryan Ethan Britain watts is hot so far that was great defense but better offense wants 13 points thats a season high for him already he likes the Indiana air I think hes breathed a lot of his whole career you know thats something you want to see theres a great steal by Watts Watts climbs the ladder to take it away and now on the other end he gives it off to Tynan foreign Applause Music is only up one now Boston University a strong start to the second half its feeling good about what theyre doing and theyve come out really strong and focused here in the first three possessions Starling trying to change the fortune and he does that lays it off the glass nicely see if they go back to something else it looks like theyre going right to their Zone to try to find you know Britain watts and see if they can make sure that he doesnt get an easy look right here in this possession theres only been two lead changes tonight Notre Dame has led by as many as 13 Fletcher Tynan drains the freethrow line jumper great start by the Terriers great offensive movement Great Looks and great shots first basket of the night good win hands it off to words now over to Ryan who used the screen from lashetsky kicks it back out to Nate great closeout defense by Boston Starling matched up against Tynan fade away from starling Applause Foster on the way going up which made it Applause Walter White with a big time three in Boston University now has the lead theyre up by two great start again we havent heard white very much and thats got to be a concern for the iris because theyve been doing it without him scoring very much now Walter White only with four points in that first half and his partner in crime Jonas Harper was kept scoreless yes underneath a foul against Britain Watts as he was matched up against the taller Nate lashetsky and my goodness Ethan Ethan Watts yes what a start to this second half oh you know what youve gotta be excited for him hes playing at home hes got everybody back home here to the games and so hes really stepped up and many times that doesnt happen when youre playing back home but he has really played outstanding at both ends of the floor good win with the ball Faye gets by white now is met by zinc Applause Music light shot is drained from Cormac Ryan thats unbelievable you have a chance to even look at The Rim before he fired that one up that was nothing but net fourth threepointer of the night for Ryan Harper on the other end cant get it to go Ryan with the board looking to push the tempo dishes it off the Trey wurtz who tries his luck from the wing and Notre Dame easy offense with strict six straight points now we got threes going to both ends all right Notre Dame back on top with a four point Advantage you see it on your screen seven of twelve from behind the arc for Notre Dame thats been a big key to their game not just tonight but all season long the magic number has been 10 at least theyve got to make that definitely on track for that the hats off to Boston University Ryan gets a hand on it has it on the other end well back it out wise decision one more three on the way and why not Trey words with the trifecta Notre Dame back up to a seven point lead that has been a quick explosion by the iris and again Cormac Ryan doing a great job of getting the collection and didnt force anything kick the back out to his teammate for open three 90 Run for the Irish has them back up by seven be you looking to put an end zinc has it underneath goes towards that left hand and finishes it off wow a great look great post up and press it move off the left hand jump hook Nevin zinc eight points on the night hes been a big reason why bu outscored Notre Dame 126 inside but Nate lashetsky can get it done on the other end as well in the paint so hard to guard the chesky when he comes off that slip screen it was a great pass almost looked like a shot came right back oh thats a charge and the charge comes some good defense from three times Captain Cormac Ryan and well send this one to Break four minutes into the second half Notre Dame is up 49 second half for you six threes made total already just about four and a half into the second I think were gonna have changed the Nets they are ripping the Nets theyre knocking down shots its been fun on both ends before because both teams are just coming out of the second half on fire the latest 23 is courtesy of Trey wurtz and it has Notre Dame back up to a seven point lead a lot of times when you see people hitting threes they look at the shot but they dont look at the setup who made a great pass and theres been a lot of great passes that have set up everything for good looks on both ends and see the numbers on your screen three of three from behind the arc for both sides in this second half Works drives Baseline gets past Brewster and one for Trey works wow he has really been something special for Notre Dame you know when the injuries came about you have to go to your veteran and he has really stepped up here hes looking like hes going to drive opposite they just turns and goes right to the rim and gets bumped on the finish uh its been again a PunchOut Game one time team takes a punch the other one comes back with a counter punch and right now the Irish are back to the 10 point lead Trey words in double digits and its been quite a step up in scoring this season for Trey words hes been averaging 106 points per game last year when he was mainly coming off the bench he was only averaging four oh yeah hes really stepped up thats exactly great steal Ryan some tremendous defense has to slow it down five Steals on the night so far for the Irish again the ball is moving thats happening good things are happening for the Irish good win drives looks to kick to Starling as it tipped Away by Watts out of bounds here and again Notre Dames had a lot of succession out of bounds plays Music so many great things they slip screens they come off of double screens and it seemed like they get always a good look out of an out of bounds play Marcus Hammond and Van Allen Lubin check back in for Notre Dame Lubin had four points in that first half Hammond kept off the scoreboard in his nine minutes of play Ryan offensive rebound quick to the hoop is Cormac Ryan he just gotta love Cormac Ryan because he does all the little things rebounds defense makes great decisions and has been shooting us so well he is in a zone right now at both ends of the floor Notre Dame on a 162 run stopped a little bit by Anthony Morales Notre Dame got caught in a switch out there big on the guard and again Boston University well coached they recognized it they went right to him inside words has it blocked from behind by Brewster I think he was really looking to try to make a pass Nate maseski but when it was not there he started to take him to the ramp got deflected out of bounds play again going back to Trey works this season has just brought so much more confidence hes really stepped up in the absence you look at the off season Notre Dame lost guards Blake Wesley and Prentice Hub and InStep straight works and hes taking on such an expanded role thats really what you want from your upperclass from The Duo do those type of things you know play with confidence and thats been something that he has brought to the table works with two on the shot clock from Deep drains it downtown Trey worked wow that was a deadly shot there my goodness he just had to pull up and you know that was one of those daggers where Boston University plays so well defensively and then boom he knocks down a three you look at this shot here I mean he shoots it for him deep but he doesnt really even look at The Rim hes got to catch it here hes got a Defender long lanky defender on he just catches look at the quick release he has there and that gives him an opportunity to pull it deep and that was a big bucket again for the Irish as they are on that threepoint line matchup and theyre theyre well beyond their goal of 10 tray Works must have been disappointed with the box score at halftime he only had two points in the first half and then an offensive explosion so far in the second half with 12 points for Trey words now hes up to 14 total Notre Dame has got to have a variety of people that could score for him this year and thats exactly you know the right sauce for them to be successful JJ Starling with a great closeout to alter the shot from Walter White got numbers on the break Im going to come back and set it up good decision by The Freshman guard Starling beautiful dish inside Ben Allen Lubin takes care of it from there and if you look at a point guard you can look at a lot of things but Notre Dame press point guard loves the pass the ball hes just not thinking about scoring he loves to distribute the ball Harper has it in the wing drives inside on Starling will be fouled and Notre Dame has done a great job defensive way upon Harper theyve done a great job of containing him and making every shot attempt hard well coming into tonight Jonas Harper was averaging 18 points over his last two games he hasnt had very many looks at all Harper can shoot it from three is really dangerous leads the team in threes entering tonight Walter White working strong against Nate lashetsky has to throw it up Malcolm chimezie with a beautiful effort underneath and well finish it off got a great opportunity tonight to play and uh you dug that one loose got a loose ball went right to the rim which you should do underneath the basket and Malcolm chimezie one of the younger players in this rotation hes a sophomore and made his first career start tonight yeah you know this is the old team on both sides we said that before and then as a software thats unusual get one of those guys out there on the floor tonight from 15 point lead and a big reason why the offensive explosion from straight words and format grind he cant shoot better about three oh you cant thats a video game right bro look at that you know youre if youre looking at the stat sheet over there at Boston University youre thinking uh how do you defend that youre not missed Dane Goodwin cash is in from the charity stripe you know big good one has done so many great things uh he is a a son of a coach and that makes so much difference hes always thinking on the floor youve got to have those guys constantly thank you for as he misses the free throw that I saw his dad kind of wince on to the stat line from Goodwin tonight kept off the scoreboard a little bit to his standards only six points for Goodwin Music but those are the things that really make the Irish difficult to guard because theres so many different weapons and if you can shoot the three it really creates problems for your defense baseball pass up ahead to Trey Wirtz who will lay it in for Point number 16 on the night unusually get a breakout transition but Boston went hard to the offensive boards long rebounds long shots long rebounds long opportunities to score when you talk about all those scoring threads from Notre Dame their entire starting lineup averages double digits theyre one of only four power five teams across the country to have that to their name yes you know and thats going to have to be the formula for Notre Dame but theyre going to be successful in the ACC gonna have to hit all cylinders all the time and they kind of got a glimpse of what happens when they played Syracuse and that didnt happen uh you know they were they were stagnant offensively they just cant have that happen they came in came out to be successful in the league with so many great teams in the ACC and Mike Bray has said to us today his team is resilient theyre coming off a loss against Syracuse a tough one at home you lose by one point but they havent lost backtoback games in over a year when they lost back to back to Illinois and Boston College in the beginning of December of 2021 well you know he does a great job of getting his guys to bounce back great attack there on the rim but he really does a great job he doesnt allow them to solve them feel bad about it he gets him right back they were able to have a great practice on Monday and you know they finally got some guys healthy so you can actually get five on five and like he said I dont have to have a fake practice well Marcus Hammond looks pretty healthy on that drive as he makes his first basket of the night thats always a great sign when you can get knocked down after having an injured knee you come back and get knocked down its like a football player youre getting knocked down get back up now you can get back in the game I mean the grand transfer from Niagara three times all Max selection and on the other end Jonas Harper getting on the scoreboard with that three thats his first basket of the night Harper second leading scorer averaging just under 12 points a game has really been held in check tonight by the Irish the Irish have done a really good job he is at all times its been a frustrating night that was really his actions first really good look wurtz misses his first threepointer of the night he missed where its also becoming kind of the four general of this team he leads Notre Dame just over four assist again this is a critical time for Boston University weve seen how they responded when they got down early they cut it back down to seven eventually you know got back to the ball game now theyre in that same spot here with 9 27 well see how they respond and see if they got the energy they dig themselves out of this hole get back in the game seeing how Trey wurtz has flipped his script tonight Music trade words started the season off with three straight three straight games with doubledigit scoring since then hasnt been in double digits but gets the opportunity tonight to totally rewrite that and maybe set a new season high of points yes I mean he he could do a lot of good things for the Iration state to continue to make good decisions as a point guard but if he could shoot well Im just going to be on the floor a lot for the Irish diversity physical they really post up hard Cormac Ryan has had to battle down there Nate luccheski has got some family because Boston news playing really really physical down to the block they they post up strong they want the ball down there really Notre Dame has done a solid job at defending those guys on the Block guards of the Terriers are really physical as you mentioned and they play with a lot of length a lot of them six five six seven even playing kind of a guard forward hybrid roll and you know people laugh but theres such a thing as old man strength because theyre older they do have a lot of spring lashetsky held underneath by Harper again when youre trying to match up with the Iration that team that switches thats going to be a situation where theyre going to look for Nate vaseski on on that switch he goes right down to the block close up strong he has an advantage there Music foreign looks for a screen Starling fakes the jump shot drives in off with the right hand lays it in my goodness he just has the Instinct of finishing around the basket as a freshman Music great defense again like Cormac Ryan taking away the post Devin Zane Cross Court pass find Watts Watts just left it short again a rare Miss by him as well Applause coach Bray talked about how he needed to have a great practice and get everybody connected and practiced because hes really tried to protect his team as theyve dealt with injuries and now hes got more of his guys going back in the lineup hes got more guys to practice now well be on the floor it looks like yeah well maybe not Boston University now in the bonus of JJ Starling shooting one and one startling up to 12 points on the night now the staff was so excited when he committed to Notre Dame and you can see why hes hes all that youve been advertised as a as a player he has done all the things that you need to do to step in at the point guard of Notre Dame well the ACC has some of the best freshmen in the country and JJ Starling is up there with him hes third and scoring he leads all them in shooting percentage as well so hes been extremely efficient as a freshman theres a big time three from Caitlyn Jones who recently checked in came off a nice double screen there a great set great look in the shooter news that hey Im going to come off this look in the fire and he did Jones can shoot it he shot 37 37 from three a season ago hes a junior from Los Angeles California good win lost his footing for a second dishes it off to Ryan one more pass to lachetsky who underneath got poked in the eye and is down for now well be headed the break well be back to check on Nate lashetsky but Notre Dame right now has a 13point advance taken to the locker room and well take a look at that last foul coach you know first thing I thought was he got poked in the eye but I think if you look at it closely he may have gotten hit Square on the nose and that may have you know thats a concern because thats more where the concussion issues come about heres an unusual situation college basketball hes got Boston University picks whos going to shoot free throws and so JJs Charlies going to go Starling says Ill take it hes got 13 points already and uh if Im Nate says okay I said those should be mine you know just because I got hurt shouldnt I get those shoot those free or I get the credit for the free throws but thats not the way the game works give give him an assist maybe you know something in the score box yeah right Starling two of two from the line now up to 15 points and oh good balance by the Irish and Starling was struggling shooting in the first half a little bit but the second half picking up and hes been getting it done inside as well hes only had one three so its been mainly him driving and finishing yeah thats his game right now I think that hell develop all the time hes going to develop over time but right now he needs to just what his strengths are and hell get to the point where he can knock in that jump shot Terriers got five left on the clock and the board is controlled by Ben Allen Lubin and Lubin this is great minutes for him where hes gonna have to play Saul the rest of the way but uh thats what you bring him in here for to do those type of things Music works from Deep Lubin underneath yeah got a hand on it but looks like he went over top little push a little push off there which probably didnt need to do I think he could have rebounded that anyway but uh again critical moments here in this game if you look into Boston University youve got to got got to get offensive good looks knocking in shots to get back cut to sleep from 15 and bu was in a situation versus UC Davis earlier this year where they found themselves down almost 30 points and they ended up forcing overtime they did fall on that game but this is a resilient group yeah the mental toughness that they have is obvious to be down that many and the comeback in the college game says a lot about the coaching staff but also the grid of an old team that they have to back and it just didnt have enough of the overtime to pull it off theyre not going to quit veterans starting lineup for Coach Jones consisting of three grand seniors and then he had in a regular senior and Ethan Britton wants whos having himself a knight he is having some type of night Applause double stagger screen here for the Irish to you with six threes in his second half but theyre still down 12 theyll need more of that five on shot clock here Goodwin will drive against time and fade away from Goodwin coming up doesnt get quite the role he was looking for but how about that Lubin in the air finishes it off hes got so much length that he was able to find that ball just by extending those arms and great touch to be able to catch it and finish it so quickly lube and the fourstar recruit out of Orlando Christian Prep really broke on the scene this year with a doubledouble against Saint Bonaventure theres Devin zinc zinc is just a Workhorse down low he just battles and battles and battles you gotta love his effort I think five of six tonight from the field hes got ten words missed his last three or three pointers attempts now Applause foul against cormack Ryan who was it pleased with the goal there Music battled it seemed like he felt he got all balls but again those are good things as you look at this tape hes going to drive hard to the rim its going to be again a good take there and all balls Tynan drains the first but again if youre Boston University youve got to attack the rim here youve got to get to the freethrow line theyre doing exactly what they needed you got to get to the freethrow line you gotta knock in threes to cut this lead and all they have is back down to 10 get into the free throw line might be tough coming from them this is a Notre Dame team that doesnt foul often thats a staple of Mike Beret coach teams they only average 105 fouls per game that leads the nation yes and thats every year people have asked me so many times how do you coach that I I think mentally the guys are just smart they just know when to protect themselves and not found Starling pulls up Applause its been interesting with Nate luceski out of the game how the offense is kind of stagnant a little bit these guys are so used to playing with him involved in the game now you have a mismatch inside right here the Irish only with one true big man now in the rotation without lachetsky so itll be the Freshman Lubin who you expect to play the rest of the way and give credit again to Boston University they have not given up theyre attacking the basket theyre getting to the freethrow line that stops the clock you get extra points when you can knock in these free throws with no time going by Fletcher 92 free throw shooter entering tonight hes another one of these Veterans for bue started his last 45 games entering tonight and a big turn of events for Boston University as they cut it down to a sixpoint game what a threepoint attempt right there from Kailyn Jones and theyre Fired Up Notre Dame calls a timeout well be going to break when you come back Notre Dames looking to hold on to a sixpoint as we welcome you back the terriers have cut this down to a sixpoint Lane in the three ball has been the Catalyst it sure has and that was a great offensive tip out got a great look to knock it in and again now we got a basketball game six points four oh five to go well see how the Irish respond 80 Run for the Terriers and he just saw the numbers flash on your screen Ethan Britton wants up to a careerhigh 19 points tonight Trey wurtz has it use the Lubin screen Irish are a little bit out of sync offensively ever since Nate luceski had to step down but he is back on the floor and Im sure hell be back in the game after a four minute break over there on the bench hasnt checked in yet Music Jones has it wow quick trigger oh miss Leia and underneath Nevin zinc had a good opportunity but couldnt convert that could have cut it wow right down the floor here that was a big Miss Inside by zinc Irish now with a chance to push the lead back up Goodwin takes the shot looks to drive on white turnaround jumper for Dane cant get it rebound pulled down by Watts Notre Dame on a scoring drought just over two and a half minutes now Fletcher Tynan has his pass intercepted by Cormac Ryan collision at half court and itll be a blocking foul against Walter White and will be headed the break stick with us Notre Dames got a sixpoint lead Layton Music welcome you back to Purcell Pavilion the dance cam has the fans going and we got a good finish coming up Boston University is closing close in six but they have the momentum right now been a great run here boy by Boston University getting themselves right back in the game two possession game Cormac Ryan can make a dent here by shooting some free throws Ryan berries the first that was a great steal by him that uh got the Irish the ball got fouled now hes got a chance to extend that lead Brian playing really well defensively tonight has four Steals and now able to get Notre Dame back up to an eightpoint lead big free throws there 18 points for Cormac Ryan but Notre Dame needs him to continue his defensive ability here Boston University going inside to their strong veteran zank beautiful move down low and converts off the glass just a great turn back to the left left hand there they went to him he knew it and he finished Irish running some clock but they need to make sure they get a great look Lubin has it with 10 to shoot give and go which Rey works four seconds left Goodwin fakes the shot he drives now up the middle and he is fouled in a great possession by Notre Dame running it all the way down one second on the clock youre telling your kids just play great defense dont go to the freethrow line but look at this its attacked the rim hes got to and again contact draws the foul thats just a veteran so the line there making a good decision this is when that experience comes into play for Notre Dame we mentioned this is Mike Rays most veteran team ever four starters are grad students yeah theyre no Panic theres just no Panic in any of them they they know what they need to do and they know they can hit shots and theyve been involved in a lot of close games this year theyve won every one of them except the last contest against Syracuse and they had a shot to do that then go defense from Ryan Walter White strong to the hoop and will be headed into this charity strike again thats a big man move but thats so strong that just shows you the six bedroom its just willing to attack the rim draw the foul and go to the freetoline both teams have veterans that know what they need to do late in the game they got to get to the free throw line make easy shots and thats exactly what white did there Walter White kept pretty quiet on the night he now is up to eight points and theres a look at the two leading scorers tonight kept under double digits yes Applause both Connecticut natives played high school ball together at St Lukes school and then reunited at Boston University and theyve been putting on his show all season long but the Notre Dame guards have kept them off the scoreboard pretty much what theyre used to tonight huge possession here two veterans going at it down low against each other Goodwin his Fade Away comes up short worked as a pass to Cormac Ryan possession will stay with Notre Dame I think they got a foul in that situation I think Cormac Ryan might find himself at the freethrow line there will be a foul coming Fletcher Tynan will be hit with it so Cormac Ryan back to the free throw line has a chance to extend this fivepoint lead if youre a youngster if youre a high school player just watch Cormac Ryan hes always around the ball you know that was an air ball by Goodwin again look who finds the ball gives the freethrow line hes always active threetime team captain hes one of those players who plays with such passion hes described as the vocal leader not even on the court just off the court as well plays both sides hes the alpha dog hes the leader of the team if you ever attend a practice where he is the alpha dog and you got to have one of those if youre gonna win Applause time out from Coach Jones and Boston University Notre Dame has to hold on to a seven point lead Music well heres where a lot of your offenses come tonight its been the scores for both of these teams Cormac Ryans been hot but Ethan Britain wants stepping up for Boston University and again it has been both guards that have played extremely well and done so many good things offensively and defensively these are two guard heavy teams and theyll need their play down the stretch Watts use the screen from zincs he goes to the floater cant get it to go zinc will be fouled underneath yeah yeah again you win my good guard play and as you get into the tournament or you get in the conference play its got to be your guards that carry you a good situation there where zinc is just Relentless relentless on the boards he has just been so good around the basket big free throws coming up for Boston U foreign Applause jump look so the Irish just dont run the clock out full court pressure here we go one out of two from the stripe for zinc Terriers want to put the pressure on Notre Dame got to get the ball in bounds Goodwin has it stripped fight for the ball and itll be a foul against Dane Goodwin yes again Notre Dame had a very difficult time getting the ball in bounds and thats the number one thing youve got to be able to do Against full court mantoman pressure get the ball in bounds Music Walter White at the freethrow line he shoots it at about 73 percent thats a big turnover by the Irish right so far perfect from the freethrow line three of three tonight Notre Dame going with five yards here against the pressure Applause big screen out here good win secures the miss takes away the opportunity to press so that was a huge Miss by Boston theyre going to run the clock here its a fivepoint game theyve got to make something happen here both teams in the double bonus the Terriers dont want to foul here but they need to stop yes well I think I would have fouled early in that possession but uh lets see how it plays out five on the shot clock Wirtz has it step back didnt hit anything Nate Dane Goodwin came up with it underneath but his foot was out of Bounce Notre Dame one of their last nine field goals have fallen theyve been struggling finishing it offensively down the stretch and now bu has a big chance only down five when he left the game offensively the Irish began to struggle Britain Watts gives it off to Harper a few passes from the Terriers offensively good motion offense its taken and its blocked by Lubin on the outside foul comes a huge defensive effort from the freshman and I dont think Boston you needed a three though they just needed a bucket but it looked like they were all out on a perimeter and now all of a sudden you have a long lengthy big that can get his hands up and block that shot that was a great defensive backwards quite the turn of events in this game and now Lubin has a big chance yes got to make the free throws now so you do a great job defensively you got to finish it off by making free throws wow Music Lubin hasnt gotten to the freethrow line much this season but has made it count when he gets there you know I want to go back to you know what happened to the Irish theyd really struggled without 14 in the game you know thats been a key thing and and he brings so many things a mismatch and when that mismatches the game youre seeing the different Irish offense that really had to allowed himself to score for the perimeter board and uh thats something they didnt do a very good job of thats something theyre gonna have to look at when David sessions not in the game how are we going to find ways to hit scoring opportunities you know offensive struggles down the stretch from Notre Dame tonight but luckily their free throw line shooting cant ask for much more if youre Mike Bray theyve made it count when theyve gotten there yes they really have and lets go back and really get Boston University you know a tip of the Hat on what theyve been able to do in this game too they were down and out that theres no quit in this team and its got them ready to play they are theyre doing an amazing job and theyre still in the game if they can get a miss here by the Irish it becomes you know just a just a sixpoint game and it can its manageable whatever hes still at six just about 28 seconds on the game clock here Britain Watts has it Notre Dame goes by words hes left open has the shot back iron offensive rebound is pulled down by Fletcher Tynan he goes up with it and the Miss will be secured by Dane Goodwin now Notre Dame has a chance to close it out they did a really good job defensive there they switched every screen there was no easy looks kind of a four shot and then just didnt have an opportunity to get a very good look on the offensive rebound you know this could be a winwin for both teams you got to look at it for Notre Dame they fought through some adversity they made some shots but then you got to give again Boston University uh a lot of credit for not giving up battling Road Warriors which they had been they could have packed it and left and they did not do that it just shows a lot of grit of this whole team well at the beginning of season Coach Jones looked at these matchups on the road against Uconn and now Notre Dame and he said no matter what happens itll be a good test for us before Patriot League Play begins absolutely Walter White from Deep able to cut it to a fivepoint game and I think that if your boss and youth band youd like to see a lot more of that early but Notre Dame did not give him those opportunities and this one was deep here way behind the threepoint line but again knocks nothing but that back to a fivepoint game Irish gotta get the ball in bounds Walter White with a quiet 13 points now just that about at a scoring average so making his presence felt late in this one but I think that its been again you said it very very well its been a quiet 13 and if the if they were going to come in here and handle the Irish he was gonna have to have a big night and uh he just has been contained very wild by the Irish defense for Coach Mike Bray and Notre Dame theyve made Purcell Pavilion oh my a difficult place to play 202 over the last two seasons and one of those losses the other day to Syracuse the other versus Duke so the home court advantage its its been real for Notre Dame something magical about this place and they just come in here expecting to take care of the home court advantage another foul comes against Fletcher Tynan Cormac Ryan will be shooting no spray leaving all of his players off the line here matching up defensively we got a fifth foul situation so hes got a little time here I think theyre going to go back and look at this I have got a little bit close to the head and uh maybe a banger thanked him and theyre just looking to make sure it wasnt a flagrant coach this is the Notre Dame team they started their season off with five straight wins and then recently one and two in their last three and one of those wins a huge one against Michigan State here at home but whats kind of the recipe for excess when Notre Dame Ender enters ACC play it talked about three points shooting it talked about kind of having a short bench how do they kind of put it together when those things might not be falling the right way coach as youre looking down the road and coaches always are players are in the moment coaches are looking down the road if you look at it theyve got a rebound and if you look in the ACC the great length of the ACC is something that has got to be constantly a challenge for for Notre Dame but they need to be able to be productive on the boards in the past they found a way to do it so theyve got to hit 10 to 12 threes and they got to win the battle on the boards to be effective in the ACC well Nate lashetsky before he left this contest had nine points and nine rebounds just shy of a double double but hes been rebounding at his highest rate ever this season thats a good sign hes back on the bench he looks okay I think they just want to be cautious about things with him uh got hit in the head pretty hard still a sixpoint game bus gotta hurry Brewster has it Harper takes the shot said look and this one will finish off Notre Dame 81 Boston University 75 coach out another name do this one tonight all right thank you very much it was a great game great finish uh hey have a great break well see you next time absolutely a great victory for Notre Dame tonight over the Terriers thank you for joining us here tonight from Purcell Pavilion for my broadcast partner coach light by Mike Mike Mike Lightfoot producer Sterling Truitt director Derek Coleman and everyone involved in the production of this one this was a fun one from South Bend Im Patrick Gardner saying so long and thanks for joining us your final score Notre Dame 81s Boston University 75 Music this dude hes a complete package for the Irish and thats what you want from your fifth year senior what a leader 16 points and a seasonhigh nine rebounds in that loss to Syracuse for Dane Goodwin and then on the other side for Boston University coach theyre in the midst of a seven game Road Trip theyre two and three on it so far but a big opportunity tonight to get a big win against a good Notre Dame team yeah theyre really excited to be here to play it play at Notre Dame and again they have been on a long road trip well see what the effects of that has in tonights game fourth meeting all time between these two schools Notre Dame owns it at 30 in those games Music Notre Dame in their home white Boston University aways Scarlet jerseys Music and here we go bu will start with possession in the hands of the senior guard Ethan Britton Watts yeah watch watch hes done a great job a sixth year player for Boston University Watts lobs it up to malcolmezzi who is making his first career start tonight and that shot just off the mark tipped out of bounds and it looks like possession will favor Notre Dame boss of you picking up full court here mantoman and uh they will play strictly mantoman for the most part Cormac Ryan uses the screen from Nate lashewski now the Freshman JJ Starling has possession you can see another name a team thats very talented you just saw the starting lineup and its made up of four graduate students and then JJ Starling The Freshman to go along with it right interior defense there by the post player two left on the timer Cormac has to force it if you want to set a tone that first possession as a coach is very very important and thats exactly what you know you saw at Boston University there they dug in they played great defense today poor Cyrus take a tough shot Notre Dame a team that doesnt turn it over much theyre best in the nation only allowing averaging excuse me 89 turnovers per game as you take a look at a starting five for bu theyre led by two graduate students and Walter White and Jonas Harper 155 both average double digits a contest thats what Im talking about there we go there we go Boston University likes to switch a lot on the perimeter four out one in see if Notre Dame can take advantage of that especially inside Machesky ball fake tries to drive on the sophomore chimezie hes working hard downstairs and he puts it in off the glass Notre Dame starts the scoring tonight great footwork great footwork inside if youre a big thats something you really want to have is great foot work great balance as you get banged around in there you dont travel Nate lashevsky leading scorer on this Irish team averaging 15 points a contest and the three ball goes on the other end for Britain Watts
