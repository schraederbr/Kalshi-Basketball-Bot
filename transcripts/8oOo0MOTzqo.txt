Heros welcome as expected and Malik Brown to jump Center Kevin ji from Notre Dame and its the orange with a basketball Applause first Judah minz in and out the Fighting Irish come in riding a season long threegame winning streak and Burton is the man who makes them go keep your eye on number 11 the coachs kid Bren Shrewsberry coming off a brilliant game Wednesday against Louisville when he went for 23 points and for the orange it has been steady in recent weeks JJ Starling Justin Taylor Malik Brown Chris Bell of course weve talked about Judah Mintz with the basketball now puts it on the deck weaves his way into the lane and he travel you can see the adjustments already made to start they put Davis a bigger body on Judah Miss to try to bother him give him some cushion to try to keep him out of the paint forcing that early turnover there well Syracuse has had an interesting last week or so they knocked off North Carolina here in the dome then went to Georgia Tekken lost before going to Raleigh and beating North Carolina State on Tuesday 8783 so which Syracuse team shows up here this afternoon on Jim beheim day keeva John over the left shoulder and hes got the Irish on the board first and throw out the records because this fighting Irish team is defensively theyre the most physical defensive team in the ACC their defense allows them to be in the game as you can see there a near Ste by Burton theyre going to hold you down coach rbbery stand on top of his guys I mean the magic number for C for Notre Dame is going to be 70 points offensively can they make enough shots to get in 70 points if not they know they struggle to score they have some offensive challenges so well see what Notre Dame what what adjustments not the Dame can make Contin to keep bodies in front of the Syracuse team to control the paint Brown finds Mintz Shrewsberry with a rebound for Notre Dame Irish on top with the basketball two nothing Marcus Burton turns the corner Brown blocked the shot one of the best in the ACC at doing just that I think Burton thought he had the layup and brown is just such an underrated defensive player and I mean hes hes defitely in a defensive player of the year category conversation and you dont expect a guy of his size to control the game defensively the way he does Davis Deo lines up the three and buries it we joked about it earlier with Coach Shrewsbury yesterday talking about the depth reception youre in this Dome its not normal you know teams arent accustomed to that and so far his guys are coming out tonight like they theyre used to it yeah Fighting Irish spent quite a bit of time here in the building last night getting acclimated mince gets the the orange on the board the fans inside the JMA Wireless Dome now take a seat as Syracuse has its first field goal of the afternoon but yeah this Notre Dame team under the first year head coach is almost an entirely new roster made up of guys who until last night had never been in this building to get the sight lines down no matter what you say its just something you got to get used to and I dont know if you ever do you just got to shoot the ball with confidence but I can tell you as a former shooter the depth perception that you see in the back of the glass it makes a difference Tay Davis spins into the lane beat the buzzer Taylor after the rebound Irish knock it out of bounds and so Syracuse will have it for their first year head coach Adrien red ay and of course you know its Jim beheim day and that man was his first lieutenant for the better part of the last decade and got promoted this past spring its been a whirlwind 10 11 months since he got the job and its not going to slow down for a while it wont I asked him earlier did he have a chance to enjoy it yet he says he hadnt and I dont know if he will cuz soon as the season ends hes got to get right out the recruiting Bell hits his first shot of the afternoon this is a Syracuse team looking for its 18th win of the Year 17 10 overall mince found to complete the steel has the ball dumps it off Starling and this is one of the big story lines today Randolph can Syracuse turnover Notre Dame the Irish have had all sorts of trouble in that category this year until the last three games Syracuse meanwhile is the best in the league at taking the ball away they are noted Dame has had an issue with turning the basketball over the key for this game is can noted Dame take care of the basketball and can the can the orange rebound Burton bounces it inside and a powerful Slam by Carrie Booth great sign for the Irish see Booth getting going here and his length and talent just losing a potential and knocking down to three earlier and again getting that followup dunked Applause theirs darling no pass taken away by Starling Taylor gives it back to JJ Starling he kicked Applause it hell thats not his game but somehow manages to get it in and the orange retake the lead Chris Bell showing you hes more than a SP up shooter there taking that off the bounc and making a difficult Applause shot Davis the seat and Hall transfer sets the screen for Burton tries to turn the corner and get downhill goes to the left hand cant finish Brown may have gotten a piece and the foul will take us to our first break of the afternoon on Jin beheim day here in central New York ESPNs exclusive presentation of college

hazard coverage has her back for real absolutely were they made by like a bajillion Engineers well closer to 100 Continental welcome to the smart choice and tires back in 1962 Jim beheim came from Lions New York without a scholarship and earned his way into being a senior captain on a tremendous orange team after an apprenticeship as an assistant he took over the head coaching duties of the basketball team in 1976 and then in the 80s started stockpiling talent and turned this program into a national Powerhouse and that has led to multiple trips to the final four culminating with the National Championship in 2003 spearheaded by the great freshman Carmelo Anthony the wins over 1100 second most all time in college basketball history but perhaps his greatest honor was getting the opportunity to not only represent his country and win three gold medals as an assistant coach for Team USA but then coaching his sons Jimmy and Buddy of course that was the game when Jimmy came in for Cornell and later transferred to Syracuse to play for his father who just moments ago along with his wife Julie receiving a standing ovation from the adoring fans here inside the Dome youre exactly right Doug I theres no better honor than coaching your children and I was fortunate enough to be able to coach mine and it is the absolute best filling in the world and I I guarantee of all the great things that coach beheim accomplished that ranks number one on his list well Randolph childis you as well as anybody in this building understand some of those elements you were a star player of course at Wake Forest and you were on the coaching staff for many years and as you allude to you had your son playing for you so again you understand what coach beheim is feeling at least to a certain degree it no matter nothing that you accomplish on the court and its even winning that National Championship it means so much to everyone else but him coaching Jimmy and Bud nothing gets better than that its its just the best that you can ever accomplish and as far as we know neither of his sons were able to make it to the Dome today it was never said publicly that they werent going to be able to make it but Jimmys playing professionally over in Germany and Buddy is with the Detroit Pistons he was just resigned to a twoway contract he have spent all of this season with their gleague affiliate Judah men count the basket in one I think his dad will forgive him I think his dad forgive both of the boys I think they theyre out making money dad okay with that this is just part of what noted aim has to do better but what Syracuse does defensively theyre active with their hands Judah Min as we mentioned in it early in the game hes third and assist hes really active hands quick Applause feet cant give those steals break away layups and you more cant pile on top of that with an and one foul and rph where Jim beigh might be okay with his sons not being able to make it Im not so sure Julies happy that the boys arent here she really wanted thats cuz shes tied of gim theres the difference you can relate to that your wifes glad youre here with me and that home with her their daughter though is here theres another Syracuse deflection out of bounds Notre Dame will keep it with 14 seconds on the shot clock re reminding it guys he doesnt want him chasing he want them to be disruptive against the I mean against the orange you know he doesnt want them running their offense much he want wants the orange defense to be very aggressive in the passing Lanes controlling the paint keeping the Irish outest taking contested jump shots under five on the timer Julian roer gives it back Burton should have put it up instead its a shot clock violation so the turnover forced by the orange defense four early turnovers here as you can see and doing this win strength the Irish have done a great job of taking care of the basketball and the key for them is not turning it over and getting up shots just getting them up anythings better than the Turnal for this group Michael shrewbury and his staff have been pleased with how his team has just matured and the young players seem to continue to get better and they also talked about Randolph the fact that this team is still very much together they endured a seven game losing streak earlier in the year nice move to the bucket by Malik Brown for his first two points but you know when a team doesnt win it can easily fracture but that clearly has not happened with this Notre Dame team it has not but the one thing that they did doing that stretch that theyre not doing now is communicating they were talking communicating a lot right now the noise is bothering they seem to be a little bit distracted with everything thats going on and a lot of dribbling hit with the basketball theyre not moving the bodies in the ball Roker nonetheless able to put it in the Northwestern transfer Off the Bench with his first two drawing Notre Dame back to within five Roper a guys that coach R shury says Hey I want guys on the floor guys in this program that I can lose with and hes one of those guys that toughness he brings and an attitude toward the game darling shot goes out of bounds off of Notre Dame Syracuse wiy two of the top teams in the ACC square off at for Eastern today number 10 North Carolina takes on Virginia then its Texas and number nine Kansas and at 8 Eastern two SEC teams get out after it number five Tennessee hosting Texas AM it should be a great day of Hoops here on ESPN mince to Brown missed the layup he pokes it away rer has it for Notre Dame Notre Dame made an adjustment there in the ball screen defense it started the game in drops but it was allowing the orange to get too deep in the paint so now theyre bringing Jai up and trying to stop the ball on a perimeter and not let it get so deep boo misses badly Starling comes away with it this is a Notre Dame team that is last in the ACC in scoring at 62 points per game and again as youve talked about if they can get to 70 with the way they play defense theyve got a very good chance of winning the basketball game mince is fouled and hell head back to the free throw line no ones better in the country at drawing contact and fouls there and thats just imense usings burden inexperience against them sometimes you can hear the coaches can tell you time and time again but until you experience it you just dont know and Judah Min is already in his bag drawing fouls just doing what he does well he went for a career high 33 points in the ACC SEC challenge against LSU most points scored in a regulation game for Syracuse since Elijah Hughes went for 33 at Georgia ATT four years ago Minon heat up in a hurry well if hes knocking down threes you just cant guard him because hes a gets to the line draws fouls he controls the paint with his penetration and theres one weakness in this game is shooting from the from the deep and its only shooting 29 on the year if hes knocking down that then good luck trying to guard him J kzns come in for the first time for the Fighting Irish Tay Davis back on the floor as well as the Irish wear their root blue uniform Syracuse in the familiar home white with the orange script lettering which seems appropriate with all of the former orange men in the building uniforms of the P very much look like what we see this season for Syracuse now this is the dangerous part of the game for the Irish Burton is such a big part of their offense who do they run their offense through turnovers could be a real problem today

These Are the nights that players remember good luck dealing with this team when they get repetition and right Saturday prime time at 830 and a Sunday showcase double header at 1 on Music ABC morning by seven over the Irish and lets see how Notre Dame is doing on the road brought to you by Hampton by Hilton points allowed pretty steady they have been really good defensively thats been the calling card this year but Notre Dame has lost seven of nine true Road games looking to get one in the wind column here today in a building that up until today Micah Shrewsberry had never been in for a game and apparently was telling us last night and talking to his son Braden during a trip across Central New York for an AA tournament a few years ago mik had just pulled the car over and said were going to poke our heads inside the Dome and then they went up to the Mellow Center which Braden remembers the Mellow Center the practice facility for the orange more so than he does the dome but Dad remembered coming in here and just thinking wow and apparently its a family thing when theyre anywhere in the country they love checking out and I understand this Athletic Facility well when youre a parent and you know you have boys you travel all around the country in aaou so you get a moment like that with your family the kids in the car with his younger brother Nick shb is just driving around taking on his sights and stuff that they enjoy seeing he says hes a big college football fan so he enjoyed that as well and Drew the Mi is picking up where he left off the first three of the game and hes on his way to a big game already in double figures here with 10 points yeah he himself outscoring Notre Dame with those 10 orange up by 10 and that is the sixth turnover committed by Notre Dame and again during their threegame winning streak theyve been averaging seven which is tremendous and theyve already got nearly seven through the first N9 minutes here today well thats the other issue you have too with Burton picking up those two fouls early now hes the highest guy in the ACC usage R their entire offense revolves around him scoring and creating and then now it be interesting to see how much they can play without him in the game fer Copeland I think impressed himself even though he didnt finish that dunk came down going woo that would have been nice catching a back which is something not many of us could do maybe you no no no JJ staring who has been better at hunting his shot in recent months finds a wide open three and the orange have opened up a 22 to9 lead here at the Dome on Jim beheim Applause day Music if you struggle with CPAP you should check out Inspire H Inspire sleep apnea Innovation learn more and view important safety information at inspiresleepcom his name is Jonathan but everybody in the dome knows him as JJ Starling the local kid from nearby Baldwinsville and he has improved his shooting dramatically as the season has gone on Randolph so comfortable now and he struggled earlier in this role and adjusting to the system in new team and now hes figuring things out last five games hes averaging over 17 points a game shooting 50 from the floor and you can see now its two of four with Five Points here and just establishing himself as one of the better players in this league is just back for it as as good as any in the ACC yeah Starling leads the ACC in minutes played over 35 minutes per game Marcus Burton back into the game and he turns it over to Chris Applause Bal Copeland give it off we have seen that combo time and time again this year Copeland to Brown Burtons in the game now and has that turn over you can see his body Lang which hes got to be confident this teams going to need him to be aggressive and continue to be aggressive and not worry about turnovers now well in the ACC Rookie of the Year conversation as Copeland pokes it away where would you put Marcus Burton right now Randolph as far as the Freshman yeah I think hes hes right there I think hes one of the top two or three guys in the league and you know obviously you got Bob Carrington and and Jared McCain down at Duke and I think those three guys are in the running for the Freshman of the Year Georgia Tech certainly has a couple of guys who might wind up on the all freshman team I think those two guys round to list out but I have so much sympathy for Burton because hes a smaller guy in stature but no one has more responsibility for their team than he does and you would expect that when its transition in a program but you would want to rely on a veteran guy and so Im always sympathetic to that and Im just I I think hes the fastest guy in the ACC with the basketball in his hand and as things slow down for this young man you know youre going to have a he the play on game Tay Davis misses at the line yeah Burtons only 511 166 his high school Penn High School is only 8 mil away from the Notre Dame campus he grew up in nearby mishe Indiana and he said it was a dream come true when he got the scholarship offer and after the coaching change when Mike Brays staff left and was replaced by Michael Shrewsberry there seemed to be no doubt he was going to play for the Fighting Irish Yes Credit to him for sticking out sticking it out and committing to coach shrewbury he knew braen from a basketball being in the area but right now he has to continue to be aggressive hes got to be smart they got to help him in the post if he gets posted up but hes got to stay aggressive dont worry about turnovers just play B up it in talking about hot from behind the threepoint line coming off eight of 10 against CC State Burton gets it swatted back near coach beim Mal Brown trying to hit his former coach with that ball just gets downhill and you know if you get to the paint Malik Brown is coming I think he just wanted to say hello to coach beim get his attention and after Chris Bell made that three over the tight coverage of Bren Shrewsberry it was right in front of Micah Shrewsberry and I think something occurred between the two of them that perhaps Belle said something that Micah didnt like if Im interpreting correctly and perhaps thats part of the conversation there now Bell will go out well you can see red Ary telling him that theres things you do and theres things youre not supposed to do and thats one of them and you love him making shots and you love the talking but it cant be the coaches and I guess Chris is probably telling them hey I was just saying something to the guys and Shrewsbury taking up for his players Justin Taylor back into the game for Syracuse heres mince off the drive from Copeland Starling from the left wing left it short Fighting Irish do a really nice job on the glass they dont have a dominant rebounder but theyve got a number of guys including bat man JR kesn who averaged between four and six rebounds gni another local from right there in South Bend has his first two points you wont find any easier than that for kesn coming in known for more of a perimeter player but taking a strong to the basket there Taylor off the nice feed from Applause Brown weve lamented how much how strong the Irish are on the defensive men but its been fairly easy for the orange just controlling the paint getting there off the dribble or the pass he DAV is strong to the bucket no Taylor got a hand on it ball comes back out to Shrewsberry gets a clean look and cant get the Applause roll Starling the finger rooll and the foul he will be at the free throw line when we come back all orange so far this afternoon and when we come back we will hear from some of the people celebrating the longtime Coach 47 years as head coach here at Syracuse along with coach and his friend Dave Bing Applause Music

me it was just more about seeing him being in that presence my environment was totally different at that point in time so to see him embracing that type of environment and that those type of people in my community in my neighborhood I felt like he really understood me as a as a young man and and thats why Im really committed to him as a young boy a young man I never experienced that before being just being open with a coach and you know inviting with a coach and you know I just think that what hes brought to the game what hes brought to seres in particular the basketball as well as the community I dont its unmatched well the relationship forged between coach beheim and Carmelo Anthony was one for the ages Carmelo never lost a game in this building undefeated in their run to the national championship and the celebration will continue on here you see Mike too the longtime ESPN sports announcer now with NBC Sports he will as a Syracuse alumnus host an onc Court celebration of coach beheim and you can see that over on acc Network extra so well go off the air here on ESPN and then Randolph and I will be part of that as well and be able to bring that to you so that gives you plenty of time to find ACC Network extra hes also a classmate of yours guys a class of both Mike and I are class of 88 88 go way back we also saw his lovely wife Debbie gibat Debbie gibat chero former Syracuse player herself Chris Bell back into the game has another two points hes got 10 and Randolph not surprisingly there is a direct correlation between Syracuse winning games and Chris Bell producing points well its the second basket hes taking off the dribble hes known as a guy that you want to put the ball on the deck you want to force him to put it on you know dribble and hes doing a great job after hitting eight threes youre going to run him off the line great job by him showing patience and attacking you off the bounce and showing you hes a little bit more than a catch and shoot Guy Peter Carry has come into the game hes been sidelined the last few games with a concussion and so Malik Brown able to take a seat at least for a moment and without Malik Brown in there the Syracuse defense allows an easy bucket inside to Kev A J yeah car didnt drop that he drop below and thats his responsibility hes got to instantly drop Syracuse one of the adjustments they make in that zone is if its a shoot at the center will step up if its not theyll drop Justin Taylor with a chance for three his second made field goal on the Applause afternoon one of the things you got to worry about with Syracuse outside of Judah MCH the guards are pretty big and Tor they just overpowered kesn inside doesnt score a lot not as involved in the offense but he find ways he moves well he cuts well and they want to get him going if they can just add to the offensive fou power of this team he Focus so much on JJ scarling J to Mintz just another guy they need depth and production from other guys mint got a hand on the ball Burton gets tied up the possession arrow belongs to the Fighting Irish although we have a reaching foul before the tie up mince is called for the personal firstam foul fourth team foul on the orange and first on Applause mince I dont see a lot there did you well not on what we just saw in the look thats a Mery call like kesn runs into a brick wall Logan IM with three to shoot KES got to put it Applause up out of bounds back to Syracuse great defensive possession there by the orange the only thing they didnt do is secure the rebound even though they get the basketball but theyre playing in G keeping everything in front and if the Irish want to get back in this game someones going to have to catch the ball ready to shoot knock down from Shots the oranges are are content on keeping them out of the paint forcing jump shots g bo back in Taylor gets it back out to mince under 6 minutes remaining in the first half mince drawing a crowd of Defenders tck nearly travel gets it back to mince hes got to make something happen step through thats a twopoint shot Here Comes Burton as Randolph said likely the fastest in the league with a basketball instead its another Irish turnover mince at the other end and theres one thing to have turnovers what she cant have is the the pick sixes she cant just throw it away for an uncontested layup like that theyve had way too many tonight May today and theyre struggling right now just getting into their offense Applause 23 Peter Peter car picks up personal tomorrow Elizabeth kitley in number eight Virginia tack HS North Carolina at two Eastern on acc Network the college game day crew tips off coverage from blackburg at 1100 am here on ESPN well eight Irish turnovers like you say theres a big difference between a live ball turnover and a dead ball turnover and Syracuse makes you pay as much as anybody in the ACC yeah you want to make both teams you want to make this a defensive game and you want them to play five on five the orang is just having their way getting in transition creating turnovers theres a held ball between Taylor and Burton and now the possession arrow will switch after the Irish retain possession first year head coach of the Fighting Irish Micah Shrewsberry coming over last spring after being head coach of Penn State and his team has coughed it up again the ninth turnover and during that Syracuse has turned those nine turnovers into 19 points in count and thats why thats the game the game for the arvish is taking care of the basketball and they hurt themselves by turning it over another basket off the turnover I tell you what Malik Brown is a terrific distributor of the basketball in the lane again he finds Taylor on the back cup the balls allowed in the middle of the floor and thats difficult because you it changes Direction so for so fast that they cant get to their helps side defense got to get the ball out of the middle of the paint Burton a little strong long rebound comes to Starling the oranges done a good job on the glass this afternoon ball movement leads to a starling layup Brown fights for it goes to the left hand hes got a half a dozen in the Syracuse lead balloons to 4216 one team is struggling to get in the paint off the dribble and the other team is just getting there whenever they want and sometimes a day like beheim day can be a distraction the orange are feeding off of it the defense is just suffocating the Irish timeout here in Syracuse ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Progressive

big days for both Duke and North Carolina will look ahead a very businesslike mature effort so far from Syracuse on a special day where theyre honoring the great Jim baheim that is a professional performance that is commensurate with how great he was there as a coach this has been a complete Clinic how theyre doing on offense and defense and think question is can they keep it going for the next 24 minutes it looks great so far well find out back to the Syracuse Alum Doug Sherman thank you KC as we celebrate Jim beheim day here inside the Dome mookie Jones Brandon Trish couple of the more recent orange players who are here to celebrate their former head coach and the uh orange theres tus battle had a terrific threeyear run before turning pro he is back in central New York there is also a celebration up at drumlins Country Club tonight to raise money for charity so its an all day event and Coach beheim sitting Courtside with his wife Julie just enjoying what they have seen so far Syracuse in complete control to this point Randolph theyve just dominated this game had their way on the offensive end to the floor and defensively they just they just choked Irish out with everything just smothering defensively creating turnovers and just overall just executing a game plan and coming out of that timeout can the Fighting Irish close the half strong and get themselves back into it not if Malik Brown has anything to say about it its got to be ex extremely disappointed in their defensive effort I mean this is the second best scoring defense in the league and theyre theyve given up 44 points already in the first half with 3 minutes to go and they only give up 64 for a game and just cant contain the dribble not controlling the paint not playing with the normal level of physicality that they play with and credit to the orangs well the Syracuse team has shown especially recently in games against Louisville and North Carolina and North Carolina State they can put up points and against ACC competition its been a much better balanced attack all five or rather five different players with celand coming off the bench in conference player averaging double figures well if youre going to turn the ball over and get them in transition and look out theyre capable of beating anybody and they run to size but a center like Malik Brown with quick feet active hands his ability to play ball screen defense and switch his versatility just creates so many different matchup problems for team and theyre just able to just get after you couple of free throws from Kevin Jes putting together a nice afternoon so far sophomore from Centerville Ohio who followed coach shrewbury from Penn State and now he takes a seat so far Braden Shrewsberry has yet to score for Notre Dame that also a problem they need to get him going staring everything turning up orange this afternoon the basket just feels like its an ocean right now for the orange just so Applause confident Burton draws the foul on Starling and will go to the foul line for two thats the way they have to play Burton has to play that way he can ill afford to lose any confidence even when hes struggling with turnovers he has to stay aggressive for the Irish just to be in any game let itone win a game well he has won a couple of ACC rookie of the week Awards in the midst of a historic first season in South Bend hes come into the game 52 points behind David Rivers for fifth place on the alltime Freshman score list he came in 97 back of Troy Murphy who holds the record for most points scored in a freshman season by a member of the Irish I asked Michael Shrewsberry once I said hey if you can bring back one of your retired jersey numbers for the Irish what player would it be he said it be dve R okay and thats wasnt an indictment on Burton it was just a general conversation yeah I find that interesting that he would pick David Rivers I assume that means more that he loved David as opposed to what his team needs yes yes because like you say Burton is yes he was just a huged d fans as I was as well yeah Music Applause absolutely fans quite a few of the athletes here in the stands Applause today former competitors yes well it starts with Dave Bing he was not one of your competitors but he was Jim beheim famously his roommate and teammate back in the mid60s as players for Syracuse yeah its offensive foul there he just Hooks and and this is what happened with the Irish its just not a lot of guys who can put the ball in their hands Davis what you want to do is turn and face hes not a back to the basket post guy just turn and face and attack like youre on the perimeter even when youre posting up great job there by roer to get over the screen and disrupt that shot by Applause Bell Davis there you go able to get right to the cup yeah hes not a back to the basket guy most guys are struggling its not what he is but he can turn and face and drive and use his app atticism in length as he did there well deont his given name hes a coachs kid who played his varsity ball for his father Dre Davis Senior at Warren Central after KP was hired Tay Davis decided you know what I am transfering back closer to home after the freshman year at se Hall under a minute to go in the half shot clock down to three Starling has to pull airball Notre Dame has it that may be be the only bad shot the orange have had in this first half they have had their way the most points allowed in a half this season by Notre Dame was against Marette when they put up 52 beautiful spin move and finished by Marcus B lets continue to build off this block out the score you still got another half to play but thats part of their identity for Burton allowing him to use his speed and get to the rim again roer gets over the screen Bell with an ill advised pass that leads to a turnover back to the Irish who can hold for a final shot if they so choose coach shury is telling his guys he want one shot hell either run up and set a ball screen for Burton try to get the match up they want Burton attacks the defender goes down and Burton lays it in hes starting to heat up now the final 15 seconds of the half Applause bton has to be careful here he has two two seconds one rer beats the buzzer and bouns in a three the Fighting Irish so Signs of Life theyve just struggled all year with that I think its their Applause inexperience of a young group is trying to figure things out Jud in no lets see if Notre Dame can keep that momentum burtman Shrewsbury in the back court Booth sets the screen Davis and Roper getting the start here in the second Applause half Burtons pass goes out of bounds and that is turnover number 12 I think coach shury was expecting Davis to come up and set a fade screen to the corner for braen shrewbury and he didnt and another thats really an unforced turn over Applause there Taylor goes back door again and for the third time here this afternoon on a feed from Malik Brown he lays it in and gets fouled thats a great back door cut there times when your Defender over playing for that dribble handoff his head turned your back door and taking advantage of the Freshman BR Shrewsbury on the week side hes having himself a game nine points today and kind of a forgotten man in his in the orange offense yeah those 10 points now match the most he has had in the last couple of months he put 10 on Wake Forest down in Winston and other than that he has not gotten a double figure since all the way back in the nonconference against Niagara started off the year really well figures in the first couple of games this year and seasons going on hes been less and less of a focal point Tay Davis with the Lup sophomore from Indianapolis draws the Irish back to within 21 starlings pass deflected by Burton Brown gets it back to the corner for Bell spotting up and the Irish another unforced a Applause I mean I mean what do you say thats just something that coach Shrewsbury scratching his head over another unforced turnover that matches their season average of 13 turnovers Roper staying right with bell the pass to Brown a little low he couldnt handle it it got to continue defensive possessions like that keep the ball out of the middle of the Applause paint boo boo you to shot the first one on the catch dud Min was fouled and will head to the line to shoot a pair even when youre struggling on the offensive end sometimes youre not going to get a better shot than that he caught it hesitated turned down an open three to a contested pullup jump shot and allows the orangs to get out in transition and seeing Judah mix drive into the basket right here we go seeing ball you and basket just getting to the rim is just not a sign you site you want to see and by the way that was the third personal foul against Marcus Burton and if youre Micah Shrewsberry as far as Im concerned you have no choice hes got to play through it got to let him in and and again its coachs pointing hes Im sure hes lamented so many different things with with Marcus and you got to learn him play through this is part of him hes still learning and still growing as a player and so is his team four different orange are in double figures led by Jud Min with the 14 points Starling has 12 Taylor 10 Bell 10 and Malik Brown has eight that balance we have seen throughout conference play for Syracuse staring gets to the midrange very well couldnt make the shot though yeah theyre back to plan in their drop coverage where cry sitting in the paint sitting at the free throw line so that midrange shot theyre going to concede that raen shrewbury his first three points been shooting so well from behind a threepoint line coming into in this not today in the threegame win streak he was 16 to 24 from behind wow you want to get him going and shooting as many as you can including seven of 11 the last time out against Louisville here he is spotting up wide open he can heat up in a hurry that draws a timeout from coach ay as what was a 29point lead is down to 17 back to the dome right after this being the best takes hard work it takes early mornings planning

were not West Durham and Cory Alexander but I hope you can have fun with us whats this day been like so far and I know weve got hours still to come with the stuff up at drumlins tonight you know seeing the players come back theres so many weve have I think 80 players 70 or 80 players back for this uh seeing Dave bang back here who started Syracuse basketball if people forget we lost 29 straight games before Dave bang got here Y and changed the whole course of the program and then all the players seeing them seeing my the coaches that played for me red I mean theyre doing a great job this is one of their better defensive games in the first half and you know you always fall off a little bit in the second half but theyre theyre just playing really well moving the ball well when they do that I mean they can beat people the net is ridiculous but they have a really really good wins on the against North Carolina at Pittsburgh at NC State it used to be you get those Road winds and thats what people looked at and the strength of schedule theyre like eight or 10 in the country and the league has been so devalued I mean I know were going to get like five or six teams in anyway no matter what people might say if you watch teams play Wake Forest if you watch Pittsburgh win six Road games these teams are going to get in the tournament I I dont care what the metrics I dont care what the net says theyre good basketball teams and if we can win out here and get to 20 wins we have a shot and nobodys even talking about it that much but we have good road wins we beat LSU who is now playing good we obviously beat Oregon theyre talking about them being in the tournament we beat them by 20 on a neutral court so these guys have done a great job Adrians done an amazing job coaching this team they really really played better and better every game Burton for three hes got it the Irish continue to hang around talking about red what about the job hes done I mean following the legend like yourself I know youre humbled and you dont talk about it as much but the job hes done I think is amazing its incredible because hes twitched over to manto man which they had to do and I told him this is what we need to do and he did it and hes done a great job with that hes got six sophomores thats what hes got thats thats six sophomores no Juniors no seniors nobody in the country is that young and you know the other thing thats interesting this Notre Dame team Ive seen them a few times theyre pretty good they they got off they got off to a bad start but theyre a pretty good

coach it was great the way you uh uh pummeled us all those years I went to Yukon so thanks Jim for the sixth overtime loss in the Big E tournament thank you this isnt going well um I guess the best tribute we can give to coach beheim because we would see this win or lose he was basically the same person when he was at the podium after a Syracuse game so if we could all do our Jim beheim impersonation all the best coach we thank Dan Patrick and the danet what do you think coach well when I met Dan Patrick he was nothing and so I must have had something to do with him getting there but I met him 100 years ago at a Kevin Kostner party wow and we hung out together hes a great man great funny man funny man well earlier this week and throughout the week Mike Waters has done a great job as a beat writer for syracusecom for years interviewed including your son buddy different people remembering what you have meant to them over the years and you talked to Rick matino youre longtime assistant and and he asked him what is Coach bims Legacy and I like what coach patino said he said that it was about uh loyalty and and what do you think about that cuz it certainly Rings true because youve been here 62 straight years well probably nobody else wanted me I guess thats why I had to stay here but uh you know I love it here the fans look at 27000 people here today um we have great fans and thats part of what makes a good basketball program if you dont have great fans you cant have a good program mince commits the foul and Burton continues to heat up hes got a chance for three you know the thing about this game is Ive seen Notre Dame a few times as I said this young guard here is going to be really really good and Shrewsberry is going to be good theyve got they just got off to a terrible start but theyre in this game game theres 15 minutes to go and you know theyre in a theyre in a 12point game this this went from 27 to 12 and you got to regroup now this is a a big moment here these next couple plays are big so if you were back on that bench where you spent so much time Brown cant finish the lob what would you be telling the guys right now well Adrian did just what he should do there he ran a great play and they missed the layup you know thats coaching sometimes R if you you run a great play you get the layup and the guy misses and its like uhoh you know you can see the momentum now shifting with a 90 run to close the first half and theyre on a 131 run now and down 29 and they cut it to 10 Brown is fouled hell head to the line so they do a nice job again finding him inside yeah they theyve made two really good plays and thats all you can do you try to make good plays but the problem when you go from 27 to this you know now this is a game now youre in a game 10 points means nothing now let your foot off the gas a little bit and momentum change and you got to get back to defending which they hang their hat on well the end of the first half just was brutal yes thats brutal you know and this is what happens when things go bad as a coach then you miss a layup now you miss a free throw and now players start thinking about it and you just dont want to get into that situation Brown empty from the free throw line just over 5 minutes gone here in the second half where crowd is in the dome getting a little antsy where does coaching your boys rank on your list of accomplishments it was great it was fun coaching them theyre great kids it was fun really fun really fun coaching them we didnt win enough but we we had fun with it we were great offensively we couldnt guard anybody and thats not a good we were about eighth in the 10th in the country in offense and about 280 in defense so it wasnt fun but it was great having him here what do you think about the pride of Southwest Philly what quader has brought to this team tell you he is a tough guy he he makes some mistakes but he makes plays and hes going to be really good another year he needs another year always want a guy who takes pride in sacrificing his offense on the defensive end of the floor and wants to guard the other teams best player yeah thats what he does oh the Irish get a good look Boo has it rattle out Davis on the offensive glass he missed it but another opportunity for Notre Dame is cashed in its back to an 11point game theres one thing that the that the orange dont do very well and that is rebound and thats the strength of this Irish team yeah were not we look out there theres four guards and a forward when you look at our team and you know weve had some weve battled some but weve had some bad games rebound the ball H gets to the basket able to score over Bell and this is the problem with Chris Bell hes a great offensive player hes got to step up there and get in front and mins to Brown steps through the double team and lays it in really Brown is just so underrated he wont win any awards any ACC honors but as a player his IQ he just does everything well he should be on the all defensive team someplace because he does everything at 68s Garden Center coach have you ever had a 68 player who gets his hand on as many balls as brown does no hes in the top two or three in the league in in uh Steels Mor DOI was a little bit like that but Maliks even been better mince no look inside Copeland gathers missed the layup R pulls it down for the Irish this is what you think about after the game two or three Miss layups and all of a sudden the right backck in the game wow Marcus Burton with a highlight reel move to the basket Irish back within 11 I know s upset with that because the game plan was to Corral him you cant allow him to come at you with his speed and transition and not have more bodies around the basketball well hes been one of the most impressive freshman in the league he is Bell puts it up and this kid off the feed from Copeland can shoot the ball like not too many Ive seen Rand he gets it off so fast and he doesnt even have to bring it down like most Sho he catches it and takes it right up oh he almost made a defensive play that was that was you asking for too much coach that was an excellent Copeland missed the lefthanded shot Irish back with it under 12 minutes remaining in regulation the fans are getting to see a good game now after that start I mean it was a little too easy but I you got give Notre Dame and Coach shrewbury a lot of credit they fought back in this they were pretty much out of this game and theyve done an unbelievable job of fighting back with another takeway we talked about it earlier too the dep perception in the arena can bother teams yeah it can Ive seen teams comeing in and shoot lights out though so Virginia made 18 threes in here when the year they won the championship out of 24 plus they had K Kyle guy yeah I when you have four NBA guys they they they beat us the worst of anybody Ive ever they just did everything I think that team was top five in the offensive efficiency and defensive they were and another defensive breakdown allows for the wide open Corner three by Davis well before our time is up we just want to also mention the Jim and Julie beheim foundation and all the good charitable work that you folks have done raising over 8 million dollar doing so much good for the folks here in central New York well well weve been lucky weve had great support from the

all just1 1999 the possible ACC Rookie of the Year Marcus Burton really heating up here in the second half for the Irish he has hes got back in help get the Irish back into this game and see catches stand still three there and getting the n one against Judah Min this is what he does best attacking the rim get to the getting in the paint heres just a heck of a move there and wrap around and finish got 10 here in the second half and 18 for the game and this is the match up we thought wed see and we got ourselves a ball game now yeah again remember it was a 29point Syracuse lead late in the first half until the Irish rattled off nine in a row to get a little momentum heading into the locker room and they picked up where theyve left off and Burton has shown you the repertoire he comes in averaging over 16 a game over four assists per game and two steals per game again as a freshman hes top 10 in the ACC in each of those three categories he is and one of two players and the other as Judah mention see now red changes things up a little bit and goes to the Syracuse Zone and when youre in this you got to find to 11 you got to know where bra shury is and of course you got to know where Marcus Burton is how much fun was that for us to have Jim beheim join us here for the last few minutes on Jim beim day a hes amazing Im glad he took the time to come hang out with us wow Burton up to 21 points in County its a massive mistake there by the orange two guys you got to know where they are in the zone and not communicating you give up one to the guy whos playing the best basketball in the second half here in Mar Kyle cuff has coming into the game for Syracuse number zero in white mince banking at home working on Logan Imes for two more Logan ims going to need some help and thats no indictment no no no he heck of a player and sure is true to mention you got to just slide somewhere you cant allow him to play oneonone if TR bar boy hes got a pretty stroke gets it off quick and you know he has confidence shooting it when you DHS the coach and allows you to it no reason not to shoot him no one does it better than he is right now in the ACC at the last couple of games hes shooting 43 in the lead right now and we see Judah Min heading to the Syracuse bench looks like hes holding that left thigh perhaps or the knee Applause didnt see much contact there Applause but so now cand has the ball in his hands scoop pass cut layup probably known for his defense and he comes in there and just cuts to the rim and just rewarded for his ball his body Applause Shrewsberry doesnt matter if you contest him if hes lined up and his shot ready he can make that shot gets himself ready to run a lot of action for him youre so accustomed to him setting back screens but they they have so many counters to their sets and him ghosting screens and running off of pin down is its one of them and hes knocked down two back to back this is the closest the game has been since early in the first half copelan air ball great defense by Notre Dame Imes has it got to get back if youre orange you dont want to leave Marcus Burton here oneonone Bell recovers to block the shot it goes out of bounds Notre Dame will keep rer will return from the Irish bench didnt get back and match up lucky here Bale makes a heck of a play and getting the block but its difficult you get up 29 in the first half in a day like today and your intensity level drops the Irish now are confident J with an easy layup in that zone no quitting this team theyre playing now with a level of desperation and they are back in this game orang has got to buckle down to get back into their so their offense which was having a ball in the middle of the floor running it through Malik Brown mince will come back in at the next stoppage Bell its another assist from the paint by Brown got to put the ball in his hands allow him to make Applause plays well Shrewsberry is heating up as we had to break now four of six from distance same for Bell on the other side but Notre Dame right in this ball game thanks to the coachs kid getting the hot hand a nuts no no with planter nuts its not ah nuts

Counting the impact is real visit bombascom and get 20 off your first Applause order Notre Dame has turned the tide here in the second half back to within seven of the orange and we got a sense during the early part of this timeout truly the vocal leader and the loudest voice on this Syracuse team belongs to that man quader Copeland I think hes the verbal leader of this team hes not their best player but he is their leader and he takes Pride on the defensive end to the floor which is the identity of this team and theyre not defending here in the second half and they got up 29 theyve taken their foot off the gas and the momentum has swung to the Irish and hes letting his teammates know its the time is now weve got to get back to defending and he knows that starts with him you see coach alry there just telling him hey you got to calm down we dont need you upset we need you kind of leading this group and when you play with the amount of passion that cordier Copeland plays with you understand it as a coach and hes just telling him hey this isnt the the time we got to rally and stick together here and during that timeout we saw him talking most passionately to Syracuse assistant coach Alan Griffin former terrific point guard for the orange who shared a neat story during practice yesterday Brown pokes the ball away and he is fouled will head to the line Sherman Douglas one of the great orange players from back in the day back in the 80s was at practice yesterday addressed the team after practice and Alan Griffin who has a triple double to his resume had a game with 13 assists and so he said after that game for Syracuse he was feeling himself called folks back home and and was trying to feel really good about having had 13 assists and uh whoever was on the other end of the phone said you know what Sherman Douglas who you see on the left there in the light shirt Sherman had 22 assists in the game against Providence so why dont you you pump the brakes on yourself with those 13 assists yeah you got to know your audience there and know who youre talking to and you could talk about assist but one guy you dont want to brag to assist about is Sherman Douglas you notice I never brought a passing the ball in front of him no you I was smart enough to do that well again when Sher graduated from here he held the NCAA single game assist record and the alltime career assist record both since broken Burton continuing to impose his will its just so difficult and so fast with the ball in his hands and now they the aggressor attacking the paint Burton with another chance at an n one how does the smallest guy on the court finish as well as he does in traffic well hes got probably the biggest heart of anyone out there and youre that size you usually play to make it to this level and be this successful theres a chip on your shoulder a lot of people doubting you when he plays that way Judah Min to the left hand no Brown had a chance at it and IR Irish the Irish were the last to touch the Syracuse will keep with 20 on the shot Applause Applause clock T penetrates and lays it in Kyle cuff known for his defense so I can score it a little bit too when I get an opportunity there Burton again all the way to the basket they found something in that middle ball screen there just getting downhill a little resistance there the orange are going to have to switch that or figure out another way to Coral the ball Jud lets see if Burton has an answer Mr basketball in the state of Indiana last year becoming the first true freshman at Notre Dame since Chris Thomas 23 years ago to start the year at point guard what a marvelous second half he is putting together not that time on the held ball heuse Syracuse will get it intensity flaring up there now Applause its look like Bell got another blocked shot and then he got tied up and soah Syracuse gets The Possession coach shrewsburys team is known for its defense and they have been doing a much better job in the second half they got it down to four currently an eightpoint Syracuse lead yeah they dug themselves in the hole and no one in the ACC has had 78 points all year and against this team defensively even in their seven game losing streak no one scored more than 73 JJ Starling on the move its back to a double digit lead this back court the orange has been playing really well of late Min has always been a problem but JJ Starling has turned himself into a player and last five games just been 17 points a game shooting the Well from the floor and well unquestionably this was Judah mins team coming into the season and JJ Starling transferring in from Notre Dame by the way facing his former team but almost none of his former teammates here yes um but I got the sense and in talking to coaches that Starling was just trying to find his way being perhaps differential and and whats that like when you come in you know you changed teams as a professional as you went from place to place youve got to find your way and you cant just necessarily come in and take over Booth slams it down no you cannot and just take some adjustment when you come in and you have the talent that He has and being a former McDonalds allam you come in with a reputation but you have to tread lightly when youre coming into a new situation where players are already Applause established dff spotting up no rebound Davis hell dribble up cuff comes up to greet Shrewsberry about 35 ft from the basket and then he commits the foul on the Applause switch they like to run that ball screen action a and with Davis run into a dribble hand off giving you another angle hes going to dribble it to Burton K has given them good minutes off the bench he goes out Copeland comes back in he has hes been in really solid for Music Applause him Burton finds an open space at the elbow Brown Above the Rim for the rebound thats Burton shot there getting to the paint 10 to 15 ft elevating finishing that midrange jump shot Copeland probing spinning twice puts it up and in big guards for the orange even Min plays bigger than his size but hes still a 64 guard himself and theres nothing besides out there theyre going to be able to post up Tay Davis with the huge Hammer the Fighting Irish are not going away looking to spoil Jim beheim day here in the dome Syracuse hanging on to the lead but the Irish just keep

Bell Starling and brown the five on the floor for Applause Syracuse rooper and boo defending out front Min penetrates and rattles it Applause home had to match up defensively that they wanted with Boos length and it doesnt matter Burton and mince got tangled and mince is going to be called for the foul it was that was an odd hookup that they got you know you see a hook and hold when youre banging for a rebound but not on the perimeter thats a freshman showing you he has some experience there their arms get t angled up and marus bur actually Burton just hooked his arm and showing you his experiences as hes hes learning and growing as the seasons going on and thats a vet move right there hes picked up from someone that did that to him during the year and another missed front end there by the way that was the fourth personal foul on mince hes got the basketball with just over three on the clock theyve got to Coral the ball though theres too much theyre allowing the or to go oneonone choing their matchups guys got to be pulled in more and help the guy driver Copeland calls his own number no Davis with a big rebound for the Irish and that matched up no one picked up Burton here chuber boy that was beautiful you can see it coming the orangs you know you got to get back rebound was made theyre standing behind trying to take the ball from Davis they never got back and matched up and they paid for dearly with the three there he is now five of seven from long distance for his 15 points were at the guts of the game now yish has to get stops darling no yes Shrewsbury with a hand in his face and again Copeland is 66 long and had his hand right in the grill of the shooter hes just unconscious Lately from behind the threepoint line he just confident he knows its going in and knocks down his six threepointer here yeah so again he was seven of 11 in the game at Louisville this week now six of eight here this afternoon starling pulling up over Burton everything but the bottom of the net got to get back now you got to corow a ball here great job there by Brown timeout called by Notre Dame coach Shrewsbury wants to talk over this critical possession well take a break and come back to the dome in 30 seconds as we go right down to the wire see thank Music Music you hey may not try a breakaway dunk but Bron Shrewsbury sure can shoot from long range when you shoot it like this and you get this off so quickly I mean that is up and out and cier Copeland is just looking back saying hey I was right there but we talked about it no one is hotter in shooting threepoint shots right now than Bren shrewbury hes been unconscious in his threegame winning streak and he hadnt cooled off at all here today well back in the second week of January he had one of those games at Georgia Tech scored 25 earned rookie of the week in the ACC having himself a week again Roper left all alone and he buries it the Fighting Irish are back within three the play was supposed to be a misdirection play for Shrewsbury after the dribble handoff the orange defended that well and wasnt expecting roer to knock down that three in the corner mince to Starin shot clock reset and I dont think it should have Coach Shrewsbury gets the officials attention and well see how they figure this out great job of recognizing that from the the Irish bench and I thought it was an air ball myself and yeah you definitely dont want to lose 20 seconds year with I thought Burton might have gotten a finger on the shot maybe maybe not just well short Steph oh did it hit the rim there maybe it did thats a big play there does the rotation of the ball obviously change that doesnt look like it doesnt it from the other angle it looked like it hit the Rim Yeah man this game started out 29 Points down down to three we have gotten ourselves a game well you hear coaches talk about the last five minutes of the half first five minutes of the half being so important and that has borne itself out so true here today those final few minutes of the first half when Notre Dame clamped down no no no the Notre Dame clamped down and went into the halftime locker room believing again they got nine straight points to cut it from 29 down to 20 and and you never know how theyre going to react after a long break at halftime but they have picked up and made a ball game of it when you didnt think they could well what they did from that closing of the first half then they started in that first TV timeout in the second half they won that 4minute stretch and then they just kept chipping away and kept chipping away and theyre back in this game and this team is dangerous and theyre starting to to get stops on the defensive end well Notre Dame has won its last three games home against Virginia Tech then beat Georgia Tech before going to Louisville and beating the Cardinal 72 250 trying to make it four in a row with what would be a big road Victory all right theyve put five on the shot clock so it should not have been a reset they indeed said it was an airball so now if youre Syracuse where do you go on this sideline out of bounds well you got to find a way to get the ball into Judah minchs hands or JJ starlings here and Minch is taken out so lets see if they get a they can get a quick hand off after which Malik Brown gets it and then a dribble hand off with here the mitz tried to get it back back door it was there Jud blocked shot clock violation but the Irish have possession before the horn went off so Notre Dame can tie it with under 30 seconds to go you dont need a three Applause here coach shrewbury call timeout now you got a decision to make 5sec difference in the shot clock do you shoot do you foul take the quick two and get a foul when they first possessed the rebound they had enough time if they wanted to go two for one but when you have an inexperienced team like this thats learning how to win slow it down and get the right shot either way youve got a figure itll be Marcus Burton and Braden Shrewsberry trying to make something happen whether its an open three for Shrewsberry or Burton turning the corner and getting into the lane for himself but if you take a three here and you miss it the game will be essentially over because it comes a twopossession game at that point you start its a free throw game at that free throw shooting contest at that point in if you go in by one those free throws will matter you put more pressure on whoever it is but you got to keep the ball out of Jud de mins hands and but if you know the name you wouldnt turn down an open three no no no no youre going to run a play for shrewbury here but tell him he doesnt have to force it you see hes taking the basketball out keep an eye on Burton number three in blue near the free throw line guarded by Mintz looks like Syracuse will defend manto man on the Baseline out of bounds look at the Stagger look for a stagger or something for Burton come into the ball with Once is inbounded I expect even a pin down or something for Shrewsbury after he takes it out and now a late switch cuff comes out and bell comes in on the defensive end Copeland shifts over to defend the inbounder allows you to switch here it is coming up here it is he left his feet came back down it appeared no whistle missed the three Syracuse has it and Bell is foul yeah you had to know when Shrewsbury was taking it out there was going to be some action for him and while you make the sub and get a guy like Copeland and hes look at him close out ground avoid the screen and avoid the foul to be able to contest that shot was that a travel did shrewsburys right foot come off the ground yes but whos going to call it now I wouldnt have mind a little free basketball there if he if he was able to knock that one down what a game and so now Chris Bell who on the year is an 80 free throw shooter as you see its his first time at the line today young man from California his father Charlie played back in the day at Loyola Maryland very calmly hits the first yeah thats the cost of taking that three now its a two possession game now Applause and now be surpris if they take a three here yeah you said it Randolph take that three if its open but Dont Force It Dont Force It because now is a twopossession game and if youre the orange you just defend the threepoint line and now theyre back theyre allowing him to roll the ball at the court expect Jud de Miss to get up and force him to pick it up from Burton Im just putting my head down and getting to the rim here he goes banking at home 115 on the clock back to a threepoint game baseball pass ahead to Copeland and hes going to try and play keep away shuberry commits the foul with 93 on the clock coming up next well send you to uh Duke and Wake Forest as soon as were done here at the Dome big opportunity there for the deakes to get one at Applause home quader Copeland at 68 this year from the line the 66 sophomore misses the doors open do you foul or you let him play thats Burton for the tie no back tap Syracuse will head back to the line what a look from Burton and it looked like you were going to get your bonus basketball there he dribbled into one and I think he was expecting there may be a foul and the orang got a good look and it looked good from where we were sitting and now its no foregone conclusion that Kyle cuff is going to make these free throws hes only been there 12 times this year and hes made just six of them we have a timeout call Coach Shrewsberry letting the officials hear about Applause it lets go back to the studio and Kevin Connors and Doug we want to let you know the start of the Duke Wake Forest game is over on ESP on the ESPN app right now critical game for the Blue Devils a tied to top the ACC to start the day critical game for Wake Joel lardys first team out its underway on the ESPN app yeah the deakes with a big opportunity trying to become that next ACC team projected by Joey brackets into the field of 68 they certainly seem like theyre going to be there at the end of the day its going to be a great atmosphere in the lawence Joe today and decks with a opportunity to get on the right side of the bubble they need that signature win they do and presents that opportunity for sure played them well in Cameron and now they get their shot at home and that should be that should be a game similar to what we have here brought it out Rocky but this is ended up being a heck of a game well if I told you before the game that Notre Dame would score 85 points and potentially not win would you have believed me I would not have believed you with the way they defended but Syracuse has shown as weve seen against Carolina last week against Louisville against NC State when they are rolling they can put points on the board in a hurry so heres cuff six of 12 on the year now six of 13 the heave is going to come up short and the orange survived
