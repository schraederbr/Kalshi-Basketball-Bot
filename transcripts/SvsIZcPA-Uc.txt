next couple of hours roll on because the ACC has been Gathering the votes over the last couple of days they will announce on Monday Day After Tomorrow who the player of the year is the Rookie of the Year the coach of the year and on and on including potentially some of the players we have here tonight Pittsburgh with a basketball first leg it hands it off to Brandon Cummings The Freshman who gets the start here in this regular season finale Zach often with it between the Rings Pittsburgh coming off a loss at NC State on Wednesday their fourth in a row cam Corin off the nice delivery from Cummings Doug every game that Cummings has started hes played well and great start for him getting the start here on senior night and playing with low and legged on the floor just eases his responsibility be something F to keep an eye on him and see how started tonight translate for him Jaden Hastings getting the start again tonight big Collision underneath and hes going to be called to the offensive foul and so for the red shirt freshman from Orlando in his fifth start of the year hes played very well in their starts including Wednesday against Clemson when they lost to the 11th ranked Tigers but he has continued to evolve and show promise you see his growth hes start hes really growing on the offensive end of the floor hes always been really good at shot blocking and on the defensive end of the floor moving his feet inside they go to Corin spins to the Baseline Hastings knocked it away Corin with a second chance and hell head to the free throw line to shoot a pair Hastings did a really good job the first time in blocking the shot one of the guards has to come in and get that loose ball and so just like that just over a minute into the game we get the answer we expected asking Boston College head Co o Grant earlier today will we see Chad venning in tonights game didnt play on Wednesday against Clemson because of a recurring right foot issue but because of the immediate foul trouble by Hastings we do see the big fella coming in for Earl Grant whos winding down his fourth year now lets see if vinning is ready to play Heavy minutes hes easing his way back in with the foot trouble with Hast picking up two quick fouls inside a minute here Elijah strong missed from in the lane Here Comes Pittsburgh got a matchup of Houston point guards here low being guarded by Chaz Kelly Kellys out of sa Creek High School while low who actually lists Missouri City Texas as his hometown started Fort Ben Marshall and weve got our foul thatll give it back over to BC and Jeff cable the Third third in his seventh year has his team at 16 and 14 overall a season that has gone sideways the last couple of months they were ranked in the top 20 back when December became January and since that time they are in the midst Randolph of their third four game losing streak they have dropped 12 of their last 16 and theyre searching for answers while you see Cummings inserted in starting lineup hoping to make their offense a little bit more dynamic on the putback Deion Brown the Junior from great barington Massachusetts has his home state school on the board and thats been an issue all year long which been a surprise under coach cable theyve been a really good rebounding team this year they have struggled mightily to control the glass and theyre going to have to rebound because the guards of Boston College do go to the offensive glass as you saw there and there is a big back court there is a size and height Advantage for the BC GS leg it off the mar and then the Pittsburgh guards have actually rebounded the ball extremely well their point guard low averag is over four per game Le it their 63 shooting guard averages nearly six per game so the guards have done their part they have just not much from the front line the Panthers Benning off the window for two former St Bonaventure star who came to BC for his final year of Eligibility ties the score at four Benny can score you got to know he wants to get to that left shoulder so he takes you middle you you cut him off he spins back gets to that left shoulder Cams going to have to be conscious of that Corin with a back door pass and weve got a foul is Leed took a bump from Dion Brown picks up the personal great job there driving getting the contact and you dont box out Browns the beneficiary of that and heres Chad vinning taking your middle great job of cutting them off but then he drops steps with his footwork gets the angle and finishes off the glass out the bishop Lain high school in Brooklyn brown with a block shot second effort for pit by Cummings is no good out of bounds itll stay at this end you got to be okay with that your Earl Grant you dont want to throw the ball underneath your basket so youre okay with just going out of Bounds at least you can set your defense well one thing Earl Grant does when he comes into every road arena for shoot around on Game Day checks the rims he wants to see if the paint has been chipped Corin right to the rim hes got six early points for Pittsburgh and Earl says he likes it when he sees the paint shift it gives him a better Target to shoot for never heard that before but thats one of his things Ive seen him do it multiple times including this morning here at the be but us because hes a nonshooter so a defensive guy would say something like that I expect that for a coach that spends 25 minutes a game in a defensive stance well our first block shot of the Night comes from the accs leader in that category number 55 outgoing senior Zach Austin surprise surprise you got to know hes coming when you drive no one better and since were talking about votes and my votes thats my Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC because I love his versatility on that end of the floor well he is the first player in college basketball history there he goes skying for the rebound hes the first guy ever with three consecutive Seasons with at least 50 made threes and 5050 block shots look at the list that hes on is incredible to see that and I mean if you break down his 3 andd ability you cant help but to wonder does he have a chance will he get himself into the NBA at some point just saying it right now yes yeah and Ive been saying it all season long that he profiles for what exactly NBA teams and Scouts are looking for one because he knows what he is he knows his strength is the defensive in the floor and his improved jump shot will help him get an opportunity but his defense and his athleticism is what youre looking for and his versatility on that end of the floor being able to guard the ball protect the rim guard pretty much anyone on the floor vening out to strong lining up the three a little strong theres another rebound for Austin and hes also one of three all time with over 1300 points 700 rebounds 200 block shots and 200 made threes the others are Shane Bader weve heard of him and Jake Stevens who was great at VMI in Chattanooga and is playing professionally so again these lists that Zack Austin has him has himself on in multiple categories are really P opening it is that ACC list is just star after star yeah guys that are on that team well the Music last couple of years guys with 5050 30 uh 50 made threes and 50 block shots last year the two guys who did it along with him were in the NBA right now PJ Hall with the Denver Nuggets out of Clemson and Quinton post out of Boston theres better Defenders at certain spaces maybe a rim protector even though hes leading the league and ACC which showed you his ability to come help weak side I think his ability to guard the basketball as well as be a really good helps side Defender is why I think hes the best defender all around in this league yeah and uh Jeff capable his coach says he is the best best athlete he has coached during his seven years here at Pittsburgh couple of Miss free throws from Donald Han Jr averaging 16 points per game hes the fourth best by percentage free throw shooter in the conference and yet he goes 0 for two yeah thats surprising for him hes usually automatic from behind the free throw line so theres a lit right now on the basket both teams are struggling from behind the threepoint line we hadnt had one made yet lets see if G Mo can help us out G Mo Diaz Graham no Austin keeps it alive to himself another rebound for number 55 in white his third in the early going it extends the possession of the Panthers cash in thanks to ish lean first made three by either side so far tonight and I cant believe weve got six minutes into the game and we havent mentioned PG County or DC yet out of is here he comes again I saving it out of St Johns College High School coming great ball move backto back threes on that end low gets the assist and pit is humming this is what you expected to see Jeff capable the pit Panthers when you start it this three small guard lineup here ball movement dribble penetration spreading forward an ability to knock down threes an 80 run can be extended here off the Miss by hand no look pass to the corner Cummings great shot fake gets himself free and hes fouled by hand Applause when youre struggling to score from behind the threepoint line first time you get an offensive rebound youre not going to get more open looks than is the leats get there for that corner three ball here just another ball reversal comings no hesitation steps into it nothing but net pitch starting to heat up from behind the threepoint line and so our officials for our ball game game tonight Eric Lewis sha Hall and Michael kits that is Mike kits Jr his father longtime college basketball official four times to the final four and they are looking to see if thats a three for Cummings or if that right foot maybe touch the line yeah I think it does but is on an angle no its on the angle you cant tell from there for sure three shots yeah no argu in from coach cable and so Cummings now at the line shooting three he has had a uh encouraging freshman season if youre a Pittsburgh Panthers fan you know youre at that time of the year actually any time of the year yeah youre youre trying to retain Talent yes and can you keep him and allow for him to build on what he has done at least shown in stretches for pit this year well the culture is right now were in its everythings the year but hes definitely shown you enough that you would definitely want to have him back and continue to build this program to take another step next year of getting into into the NCAA tournament and when he started both games as I said hes played really well and hes off to another good start here being his third game of the season yeah hes got double digits in scoring three of his last four games and already has six in the early going tonight its a 154 lead you see the 11 nothing run errl Grant going deep into his bench to try and find a combination Luca Taves is come into the game hes high on him as a point guard Here Comes leget picked up by T Taz he thinks is his best pure point guard but hes its a freshman hes got his hands full with this any of these guards for pitch Panthers I remember Lucas older brother Kai who started UNCW he played for team Japan in the 2024 Olympics his younger brother winding down his freshman season at Boston College and you know for BC this is it they will not be going to Charlotte for the ACC tournament because theyre one of the three teams that didnt qualify only the top 15 in this new expanded era of the ACC get to go to the league tournament so while Pittsburgh will fly to Charlotte tomorrow Diaz Graham has his layup roll off the rim BC will put the balls away until next year still something to get used to now its hard to accept that you just assume that everyone is going to the ACC tournament and PC will not be a part of it how about the step through for Jaden Hastings back on the floor plying with those two early fouls and hes coming off a brilliant performance and the lost to Clemson a perfect eight for eight he becoming more and more confident on the offensive end of the floor Leed steps into a three and buries Music it Jeff Caps on to something now with this guard play all three of his guards are getting to their spots spacing the floor offensively theyre knocking down shots well he was last heres Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC and he has had so much more asked of him this year for Pittsburgh how do you think legot has handled the added responsibility and the added attention well talk about that up early he paid dividence with Coach cap and so I Circle back to what I was asking before the break how has legot handled the different role from being an elite Reserve last year to being at the top of the opponents Scouting Report every night well I think hes done well you just see even his shooting percentage hes still shooting in the mid40s from behind the threepoint line I think overall it hurts the team you know every team youre really good when you got a is legged coming in off the bench Brown lays it in BC back within 10 but hes done exceptionally well I think hes a twoway player what he brings to you from a leadership defense loow dumps it off and corins hot start continues his dunk gives him eight early points Zack Austin slow to get up underneath the basket and jayen low also bent over at the waist well cam corn dumped on his teammates there low dropped the dime off to him and those two guys Collide and lets hope that both of these guys are okay need a traffic cop underneath that basket looks like both guys are okay Friendly Fire there yeah I think jayen Lo is saying I got hit on a pass Zach Austins crashing the offensive glass with no need cam corn with the flush so Austin takes a seat we get our first look at amsal delich a 68 inch freshman from Bosnia and herina he defends beetle with the basketball right now Del has been really good when hes coming to the game really aggressive not only in making shots but just making plays on the offensive end of the floor beet him one and done for Boston College I know you had Pittsburgh on Wednesday and you repeatedly talked about the fact that as a coachs kid amsol delich does things the right way yes he does tell he lets the game come to him he aggressive when he comes on the floor has a really good IQ and both ends of the floor knows his limitations have ically but hes really good in the offensive end of the floor for a freshman he doesnt take bad shots there you see the big game against Miami his career high 14 points and then nine the game were talking about the other day you see he has still not evolved into a fulltime role as you go from 28 to 25 minutes down to 3 minutes but its coming hes improving and I think hes earned the trust what what he hes earned is the opportunity to get in games early you can tell this late in the year coaches are starting to play guys that they trust that earned it and all you know you got to make your coach play you Del delence Improvement has done that for Coach cap yeah and his father as youve talked about his name is air played 20 plus years of professional basketball overseas now a coach in bosnan herzen well you were a coach for a number of years at your Alma moer at Wake Forest as an assistant under Danny Manning uh did you guys when you were recruiting look at a coachs son differently did you value that more potentially you would talk about it because you know theyve grown up around a game and theyve seen things and they theres an understanding that comes a lot lot a lot of time with something like that and you can see that in their plate you saw me earlier talking to Jason Cables son whos a part of it and always going out in the court watching with him he the access that you have behind the scenes with kids like that the kids are at practice they get to see the good the bad the ugly they hear the positive things that you speak of and a lot of times they Implement those things as an early age right Jeff Capel and his younger brother Jason grew up around basketball because their father Jeffrey capable II was a highlevel coach was the head coach at Old Dominion and so it has been passed on from one generation to the next and like you said Jason one of his three sons loves the game of basketball and is out here every opportunity pregame at the pat working on things when coach childis gets out there and helps him with some pointers Im a fan of how hard he works hes always working funny story he traveled to Louisville with pit the other day and told his dad he wanted to go to Louisville right now so Jason had to laugh at that he loved the atmosphere at Louisville when they played at the Yum Center and uh when you and I were here a couple of weeks ago maybe for the Syracuse game yes Jasons son you could tell got to the arena a little later than he wanted to it wasnt his fault cuz he cant drive yet and uh he didnt get the work in that he wanted to Corin into double figures Pittsburgh back up by a dozen you got a guard cam cor hes not a shooter but hes a really good passer and he can put it on the floor and drive and attack the rim you got to account for him and hes emerged as a third lead score for the Panther Cameron Murphy Corin comes away with the Shot Hands it off to low and here come the Panthers Cummings thought about it delich back out around the perimeter under 9 minutes to go first half its a different look with Cam corn playing a five his ability driving the basketball and also screen and roll and catch in that pocket pass kick it to the weak side is presenting problems for Boston College how about cam Corin now a perfect four for four and over the last five games including this one Randolph he is 25 for 32 its pretty good it is I dont think hes had a shot outside of 3 feet here night so thats pretty high percentage shot there BC goes inside to try and take it advantage of its size Chad venning at 69 270 a complete mismatch physically with guo Diaz Graham but he gets called for the foul its a big foul here because again Hastings is on a bench with two already and you can see the hook theres no need for him to do that he has a distinct size advantage over gu OD Diaz Graham in the post hes trying to beat the double team so he tried to get a quick spin in and end up hooking and having the offensive foul L leaves his feet finds standing on the wing you had one BC Player having to defend two guys and he went the wrong way you got to make a decision now and I think the small ball lineup with Cel is presenting some problems and going to be interesting to see what this presents in the ACC tournament about that move by Joshua Beetle to gr transfer from Clemson thats the negative of this lineup theres no Rim protection G Modz Graham is is 7t but hes not a rim protector of the size is more comfortable being on the perimeter and if he can start gaining some confidence and knocking down shots behind the threepoint line and look out delich and hes a good passer as you can see there itll force you to have to start switching with him and thats not something you want to do with B with vennings you want to keep him in the Applause paint Fred Payne passes back across to the left wing for Beetle again one and done for Boston College delich dribbles up himself uses the screen yeah Beetle shoots a great percentage but not known for his ability to shoot hes more of a pass first point guard and shoots 50 from three but its more about his shot selection than his actual shot delich and then looks right at his teammate and says thank you for the setup guards on the floor starting Brandon Cummings and low and legged and its just spread at the floor with shooting and and spacing the lanes open up theyre driving theyre kicking if they can get stops and Rebound with this lineup look outs com the ACC tournament because theyre putting a lot of pressure on you and the defensive been to the floor well theyve got 10 made buckets eight assists and five of them have been from jayen low and youre right you know we only have to look back to last year matchups get hot at the right time if youre North Carolina state did you go into the ACC tournament as delich scores two more did you anticipate you could do that why not Pittsburgh this year well this is going to be the first time youre going to see this because they havent done it all year and you see that play there they have wings that can play with delich is his size and Zach Austin being able to come in as well Brown hits the triple first made three here tonight for BC could you look at the way theyre playing now Diaz Graham at the five youre going to put a guy on him and hes playing behind the threepoint line so your big has to defend on the perimeter and if he gets the knocking down shots as a stretch five and as you can see now this look at BCs defense it forces you to switch now off the delich Miss beo lost the dribble delich comes up with it here comes pburg with numbers if they Hur it well if youre 71 you cover a lot of ground without putting the ball on the deck theres a guy me Walky that agree with that we know who that is and I dont even want to say his name cuz I will not make that comparison but catching it on a run and taking Two Steps From the threepoint line his Greek Freak Like y mod Diaz Graham first two points come by covering about 20 ft with two strides wow he didnt even need to take a dribble and initially I thought if your delich dont give him the basketball here but if he doesnt have to put it on the floor who cares just a layup hand it very well yes he did quoted at threepoint line two steps layups at The Rim pits off to a blistering start here offensively they started out sluggish but theyve had their way if you cant take advantage of the line up and punish him inside back may have stumbled upon something here late both of these coaches are struggling and trying to find answers theyve changed the line if theyre looking for a spark Jeff C just may have found his pits been one of the better free throw shooting teams in the ACCC all year long they are perfect so far tonight that is seven out of seven and the Panthers lead is 19 well dont forget again Pittsburgh was ranked in the top 20 great action from Kelly to venning to strong for the layup but dont lose sight of the fact that two months ago Pittsburgh was in the top 20 they were viewed as a cant miss going to make the NCA tournament so the ingredients have to be there right yes but the injuries now I mean the Damen Dunn being in and out of the lineup and him being that versatile guard because this would have had we talked about ish lean and what he brought Cummings was coming off the bench and the option of having a big Wing like Damian done just offer so much it made the game easier for guys like cam corn for to shoot because that initial shot missed the iron is legged undaunted hes got double figures now 39 17 Pittsburgh see it all the time on senior day this leged is always aggressive you better believe hes going to be ultra aggressive here on senior night and Zach Austin and former walkon bason Stevenson with the three honored before tip off here tonight at the Pak low comes up with the basketball hes got Kelly to be theres your Houston on Houston point guard matchup and low will be at the free throw line an unfortunate he has to like what he sees right now from this group they have been lights out offensively well that may be jayen Lowes first point of the night but he has impacted this game positively in many ways for Pittsburgh he gets coupled at the free throw line 4117 and now low will take a seat delich returns Doug youve heard me say this before hes at the top of the Scouting Report yeah thats who youre scheming against he doesnt Force anything he really is a pass for his first guy even though he scored a ton for this pit panther team his biggest job is of getting everybody else going hes done that exceptionally well here tonight foul against Corin yeah the the list for low and what he has achieved got a lot of nice names hes rubbing elbows with how about the last ACC player to average 16 points four rebounds five assists 2022 ACC Player of the Year Lis Williams Good Company where he go to school I dont remember I dont recall he was a deak I got to poke at you a little bit he was a de he was a really good de he was he was a Player of the Year candidated a player year a candidate he wanted did you vote for him for most improved player hes pretty improved he was you talking about ales yeah ales oh yes I did yeah yeah not Jaylen Im going back I vot for for play the unit of course you did heres Deion Brown at the line out of Monument Mountain High School growing up in Western Massachusetts in the Burkshire mountains he said Boston College was my dream school he started at UNBC was really really good at that level last year First Team all America East conference average nearly 20 points per game and Earl Grant and his coaching staff really thought Deion Brown was going to be able to bring a lot more scoring punch this year than he has as the uh convers ation continues between coach cable and Mike Kips C saying hey you shouldnt have free throws that ball should have been in the Baseline out of bounds you see eight points for brown to lead the Eagles and the Diaz Graham twin brothers are out there together Ley gets it back to Cummings 10 on the shot clock Jorge Diaz Graham tries to set a screen instead Cummings is going to go oneonone with the switch little step back midrange out of bounds with under three minutes to go in the half thats a vital possession because youre talking about two guys that dont play a ton you got to switch with Cummings he doesnt need to settle and take the jump shot but thats where the Diaz Graham twins can start winning matchups you have a guard on him crash the offensive glass and get that rebound thats what you got to win if they want to play with this lineup and be effective in the ACC tournament the guard isnt always going to win that match up but the big has to win on the offensive rebound kmo Diaz Graham called for the foul trying to defend the paint and the 7 foot Junior from the Canary Islands with his first you know there are 10 sets of twins currently teammates flying in division one college basketball and we are looking at the Diaz Graham twins now in the third year together at the University of Pittsburgh and youd have to say in Pittsburg history theyve had a lot of brother combinations but hard to beat the king Brothers led by Billy back in the day whistling a foul its going to go against the Eagles that is Jaden Hastings now the uh cable brothers did not team up and they did just the exact opposite yes one went to Duke one went to Carolina yes went to the biggest robbery School you could you can imagine they went to the biggest robbery in in the sport both are really good players in their respective shades of blue and I would imagine there might be a comment or two around tonights game in Chapel Hill between the capable brothers that is scheduled to be just underway on ESPN so Caroline has seemed to write its ship do you think they are a viable candidate to do some damage in charlot and get themselves into the NCA tournament field to 68 well they get a chance to do it tonight and theyre playing their best basketball going to the bigger lineup allows them to to be more diverse more importantly defensively be a little better giving them a little length and theyre making shots right now theyre going to need to against against Duke who I think is Elite defensively not just good I think theyre one of the best defensive teams that weve seen in a really long time and I mean years of college basketball yeah and its not just one or two guys it seems like the entire rotation is Elite I think they put minimum whoever they have on the floor they have three of three best defenders on the floor and at times they can put a group of five out there where I think theyre the Five Guys they put out there can be the best five Defenders on the floor with Proctor as a guard and Cooper flag we talking about a ton but Sion James as a guard is a really good Defender you throw in Malik Brown malawat I mean these guys can just switch and just make them be so disruptive cut off the water so to speak in your offense so even if Carolina beats Duke tonight you know since they are the first team out according to Joel lardi right now does that automatically put them in the tournament regardless of what happens in the ACC tournament thats only going to be their second yeah it it puts them in but theyre not so far in that they cant play themselves out theyre still going to have to play well in the US tournament yeah another BC turnover leads to another run out and a foul against Brown Pittsburgh has had its way so far tonight with a Boston College team thats just playing out the string theyve been impressive on the offensive in the floor with the small the lineup but the surprises how effective they are and disruptive they are on the defensive end of the floor cor hasnt played a lot he hasnt been consistent in admin opportunities presented to him and hes been really active here and they remain perfect at the free throw line as a team Pittsburgh is now 14 for 14 Jaz Kelly dble zero for BC back in and Dion Brown who scored the basketball well so far for the Eagles takes a seat not the start you were looking for for BC they havent gotten anything working but the most disappointing thing is defensively this has been a very effective in their effort defending when they wanted to defend theyve defended really well and been so flat on that end of the floor I know they probably wasnt expecting this lineup change weve seen with capable where theyre spacing you out with four Shooters on the floor and playing cam corn and Y OD Diaz Graham at the five is just so unique and different that you hadnt seen it all year long and its its giving BC Eagles fits right now and something a lot of teams are going to be watching this tape to understand what that does to them defensively in the ACC tournament Donald Hs first point comes over 18 minutes into the game he is averaging about 16 per for BC and again he uh May wind up being named on Monday the conferences most improved player but weve not seen it so far here tonight gets one out of two from the line yes field goal percentage overall for the season not great but there are reasons why somebody may not shoot as well as they would like yes hes head of the snake hes the guy at the top of the Scouting Report when youre playing BC hes the guy you know you got to stop so hes going to draw a ton of attention and hes forced to take shots like that hes a guy because BC struggles to score Music offensively hes a guy that just like look you you see the basket you got to get him up he takes difficult shot but hes a difficult shot maker hes had a lot of big moments this year 31 against Florida State in that crazy game the Chaz Kelly won on a late jump shot under a minute to go in the half Leed is cooled off a bit the Diaz Grand Brothers bigger than everybody else out there thats Jorge with the putback hes got five points Off the Bench Jorges been really effective they crashing the offensive glass giving coach C really good minutes and a little bit out of control ball trickles out of bounds off the left hand of Chad venning and so the Panthers get it back they can hold for a final shot Doug that defensive possession will be on the tape tomorrow for kils Capel I I mean thats ideal of what this lineup will have to do going forward they double the post and then full rotation over everyone is communicating theyre doing their job they close out didnt secure the rebound it be the one way they had to finish but unfortunately for them it was off some just an outstanding defense possession there for the Panthers the zoo making some noise on this final possession low the pass deflected Leed had it knocked away two seconds 1 second got a good look but GMO Diaz Graham left a little bit short however followed the path they would have hoped at 12 and 18 overall only four and 15 in League Play can be see come out and put forth the good per performance to close out their year on their first possession a Miss three from the corner by Elijah strong and Pittsburgh will walk it up with Jaylen low the sophomore from Missouri City Texas he had a good first half although he didnt score the ball a lot no made field goals but he was the guy kind of serving as the Maestra yeah he is and and again its been the defensive into the floow with this group thats another great defensive possession there fighting for the defensive rebound and and the offensive end of the floor an open shot nearly a highlight there by Zach Austin trying to follow up then with him leate getting back up off the floor and down BC does a nice job to identify the big inside Jaden Hastings who was fouled he was thinking Sports Center yeah he was he tried to go get one with the left hand great job by BC identifying that hes on the ground we got numbers pushing the ball drawing a foul here he spent three years at High Point University including a red shirt at 67 210 senior playing his final Collegiate game here he is defending on the wing against Donald H lob inside nicely delivered and Elijah strong lays it in thats what switching you have to do you have to have the ability to do that to punish your small ball lineup and it is didnt do a lot of that early those were turnovers and deflections Applause and fireing under this group as they go back Zone theres enough time here to try to claw back in and try your Zone but no Rim protection there straight line drive easy too for the Freshman from Midland Pennsylvania Brandon Cummings now with 11 again every game he started hes played really well he has rewarded coach capable and whatevers been asked of him when hes been injected into the starting lineup strong trying for another triple hes got it young man whos been in and out of the starting lineup this year for Earl Grant with a couple of field goals 5024 now you see what he did on Wednesday in the loss to number 11 Clemson the sophomore from Charlotte has seven points gives you the versatility of being a inside outside score shooting over 36 from behind the threepoint line and the ability to post up smaller guards when you switch them Corin over his left shoulder hes having himself a good offensive night 12 points for the 610 junor hes been really good for this pit panther group just knowing his role hes adjusting to a different role now hes a theyre relying upon him to be a double figure score for this group and that was not his role at Florida State a year ago and remember he was hampered by a broken toe last year in his second year in Talahassee here he is again working in the lane this time over his right shoulder missed it with the left hand but he has been very efficient in close so far tonight he he has he flashes inside there and hes justs hurt you when he does that but thats what BC has to do more of you run that early ball screen you ID ify to switch great high low action there by the red shirt freshman Hastings and throwing it over the top TR round and out for Austin fight for the ball comes to Cummings it was Corin who got a hand on it to keep this possession alive for pit theres been a couple of possessions like this for pit Panthers where theyve been fighting to two rebound the basketball better they were plus six and a half very smooth from Brandon Cummings remember he went for 30 against d Kentucky back in December he can fill it up absolutely he can and following the footsteps of his big brother whos in the building again Nelly who played his Fifth and final year of college after transferring from Colgate to here at Pittsburgh has been along for the ride the whole Cummings family has enjoyed this season together you take your lumps when you the younger brother you know there some I get that he was a short end of the stick when youre younger growing up so you know theres a level of toughness to you dad is taking it easy on any of them sted with Dad and his trickle down to his brother he has been I think a really good freshman year for the pit Panthers and has a bright future here as a basketball player parents Rell and Brandy Brandon to them is BBA BBA yep nobody calls him Brandon boy hand has missed three free throws and again considering he is at 87 on the year coming in you would never expect that Zack Austins leaving the game picked up his fourth foul he argued it he didnt think he committed the foul so he gets a technical foul and takes a seat hell talk to him not long before tip off about senior night for him and his college basketball journey and its not the same necessarily as what we were accustomed to before this transfer portal era hes been at two schools but still hes had a a really really good college career he lost his mom back in 2017 to heart failure she wasnt able to be here but he was thrilled to talk about that his grandmothers here and his auntie is here hes got a couple of his siblings here and a niece and uh you went through this after your time at Wake Forest you had a senior day moment did you find it hard to focus on what you needed to focus on that night yes you do you struggled with that a little um but its a little different because for me we were wrapped up into trying to it it meant a lot we were playing for something still we were playing for the number one seed in the ACC tournament and so you still had something to play for so its always interesting when you have these moments and you dont know about your postseason play we were playing for seeding as nowadays BC is out theyre not in it and Pitch jumbled up in there youre trying to get a first round by if possible and so theyre actually still playing for something Corin lost it on the way up and then a foul is called First Media timeout of the second half and they can ill afford to have off nights well he was fifth as Corin misses the free throw loow was fifth in the league coming in in assist per game Nate Georgia Georgia Tech One Elliot gdau two for Carolina Chucky heurn who had a 16 assist game at SMU is third in the league then bofy Miller and then uh Lo pretty good point guard play in the ACC again this year it is a high level creativity with the leag guards Music and we welcome you to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania here at the Peterson Event Center in what has been a onesided Affair almost from the start Pittsburgh 54 Boston College trying to make a push here in the second half but only 32 points with Randolph childrenis Im Doug Sherman can Boston College make a push here in their regular season finale that will Mark the final game of their year well theyre winning the second half theyve come out of the locker room playing well but theyre facing this pit panther offense that we talked about that theyre theyve started a four guard lineup and its created its creating spacing opportunities its open up the paint its opened up shots from the rim as Jaylen low takes a shot here as Deon Brown dunks it we have a stoppage as Jaylen low who has been really good especially setting up his teammates with his six assists continues to try to gather himself seventh year head coach Jeff cable thei questioning no foul call my guys hurt something happened and well try to find it on replay to see what occurred Pittsburghs three guard offense has been really good tonight I think he took a shot to the midsection there and that elbow right there is what screened by Hastings he took a shot thought he was getting out of the way and looks like he knocked win out of it lets hope thats all it is yeah he seems to be getting up walking around well low has not scored at much hes got four made free throws no field goals but Leed with 11 cam Corin with 12 and then Brandon Cummings in the starting lineup with 16 points to lead all scores Randolph you think that is something that pit needs to tap into yes going forward into the ACC tournament its a different look and it gives them three guys that can initiate their offense before you you concentrated so much on it leg jayen low and then now you put Cummings in and hes shown as a starter we have a flagrant foul on red 22 two shots in the ball so Jaden Hastings gets called for the flagrant yeah he threw his right elbow there and extended it outside of his arm so would have been an illegal screen and obviously you can tell jayen low wasnt expecting it but this lineup four I dont think pit could win a game without jayen low scoring trying to be effective but now the floor spacing hes naturally been a guy thats gotten in the paint whenever he wanted but he doesnt have to four shots and finish hes spraying it out everyone else is benefiting theyre knocking down shots and its itll be fun to watch this off in the ACC tournament and so the gods godson of 1976 number one overall draft pick John Lucas American out of Maryland at the free throw line again Pittsburgh was ranked nationally in the top 20 back in early January but since that time they have endured four or three different four game losing streaks including the one they have at the moment trying to break going into the postseason but it looked like two months ago Jeff capable and his team were sitting on an easy NCA tournament birth can they get back to the level of play that they had back in November and December well find out theyre searching for answers and and with dun being out we know hes done for the year both of these coaches came into this game not knowing what they were going to get from their group I think cable has to be happy with what he sees and this is what happens come he gets the ball he gets to initiate offense he doesnt wear low down of having to come back and get it and what g o Diz Graham at the five now look what he does for spacing for everyone you have to switch with him and now you get the matchups you want with these guards against your Frontline guys well short on the Deep three Here Comes Boston College down by 25 Chaz Kelly theii tough shot Cummings stood his ground and we have not mentioned since we were joined by all of you on the network Zach Austin another one of the pit Panthers celebrating senior night he is yet to score and hes on the bench with four fouls Hasting with the layup off the feed from hand now thats the fear with this lineup is with G odz Graham as your Center physically theres not much resistance on the interior and can he rebound enough the officials are as we just talked about your physical specimen come on man Pittsburgh breaks the pressure Cummings legged and low the three guard attack out there with delich and guo Diaz gr this is deero now has that left knee with an extra wrap on it after having a bloody knee on the back cut pass from delich a little too far out in front its a turnover back to Boston College BC has come out in this second half and their energy is picked up more importantly its picked up on the defensive end of the floor theyre winning this second half its a lot of time left can you CHP away you dug yourself a massive hole in the first half but theyve come out second half and theyre attacking the paint and taking advantage of the switches trailed by as many as 29 Points but BC has made six of its last seven shots put a bad turnover there low tries to go eurostep and lost his footing and the officials confer to say indeed it was just a travel no Applause foul going to make sure Lows okay hes grimacing a little bit there well he came into this game 12 points shy of 500 for his season hes at five and Counting among the league leaders in points assists Steals and free throw shooting somehow that pass got through to strong who lays it in thats the matchup I thought and how I thought BC would play when this game started and strong has an an advantage inside at the four spot and Chad venning is the best low post score in this game on either side yeah venning back in the lineup after missing their last game with a recurring foot issue its a great find there he catches it fakes the spin Baseline and hits a cut in the eles are strong that thats the advantage that they have is there enough time for them to come back in this game figure it out but theyve been getting stops here on the defensive end of the floor low no offensive rebound Gear mod Diaz gr delich thought about it hes been aggressive shooting basketball tonight low always trying to get back to that left hand he does and has his first made bucket of the night where ply he just continues to get gets in the paint hes getting in the paint finding teammates and hes done that all night long oh Kelly attacks pass to the corner for Dion Brown you want to see pit Panthers with this lineup play with pace and purpose just continue to push the ball let the ball move move your body in the ball you got the matchups like this you want low starting to heat up give him 11 thats 499 on the year and thats what this lineup is doing its dictating what youre going to do defensively for your coverage you got to commit to how you want to guard these ball screens with G Modz Graham at the five from the short Corner nice looking stroke from Donald Han Jr part of the only fatherson combination in conference history to win ACC player of the week his father of course very good player at the University of Virginia back in the day yes did you guys overlap was he a league rival of yours hes I came I left out he came in leg it buries another three Pittsburgh has Justin champeny but it shows you the development that these coaches have in their themselves and their staff what theyre able to do with players given it time of course for Boston College Reggie Jackson still going strong coming off the bench for the Sixers these days in his 14th season in the NBA as Chad Benning lays it in and Pittsburghs got a couple of uh veterans in the NBA step Adams goes way back he was a one andone at Pittsburgh back in the day and then cam Johnson played three years here at Pittsburgh he is a Pittsburgh graduate but played his two final years at UNC so he doesnt make all the list but hes a former Panther also in the NBA so four former pit players in the NBA currently and two former Eagles so does pck claim will Carolina claim him Carolina definitely claims him and often times when a player leaves a school in this day and age the school that loses them often doesnt add them to their list which I think is strange I think why not especially with the way players move around now all Big East freshman team but it was not youre right in overwhelming season where youd say oh my gosh of course hes the one in done he obviously made the right decision he did great NBA career and you know what this game we talk about these two old Big East Rivals this game is a rematch of the 2001 Big East tournament championship game won by BC 7957 at that time the Eagles were ranked ninth in the country seems like two lifetimes ago it does this is the 20th season for BC in the ACC a wedgie on the block shot Corin denied from behind by Chad venning and The Possession era will keep the ball down at this end 20 years in the ACC for BC its a great job there by Vinnie hes laate on the play no help on the back screen just meets him at The Rim nothing will deny Corin on that one a nice look from corge Diaz grah if your V you got to know jardi C Ping On the perimeter its not an effective scorer there t puts it into the post trying to spin back to that Baseline side there he goes over Corin for two does a great job of taking your middle he makes you honor it but he wants to get back to that left shoulder low lobs it to the rim cam Corin whose father used to back up Dominique Wilkins with the Georgia Bulldogs having himself a big offensive night he is and now with the the spacing that they have it fre freeze him up inside and when they running that middle middle ball screen and he gets to catch it on the short road or the l a foul on the drive they might have gotten Li it a leg it rather that middle ball screen on a single side you got to tag but theyre running shootter up you see is legged coming from behind it CH Kelly unable to tag the shooter sorry Fred Payne didnt tag the shooter that time the rim roller and easy lob there and youve got to do that we talked about low his ability to score but the best thing he does is create for this team got to keep the ball out in the paint with him and got to Corral him on ball screens his vision and him turning the corner is just too good good we see Zach Austin coming back out onto the floor he is scoreless with four fouls including a technical now hes got 846 remaining in his Pittsburgh career here at home this is senior day for him he was recognized before the game and Im sure hed like to have a little better taste in his mouth over the last eight minutes than the previous part hes about the only pit panther who has not been involved in this impressive performance perance well he and low hasnt need are not needed on the offensive end of the floor Zack Austin does have six rebounds he picked up a couple early offensive rebounds and his impact is what we talked about is on the defensive end of the floor Los going to be called for the foul coming around the backside of Elijah strong giving up a lot of size there lo you want to try to get around in front theres something theyre going to talk about as they go in the ACC tournament with this smaller lineup but a little bit more length on the floor right now with both of the Diaz Graham twins on the floor and Zack Austin back to playing a Wings position and not the four Taves gets it in showed nice patience along the Baseline for things to open up and just like that Chad venning has the easy layup low down the lane finger roll and he gets the roll Music and that gives him 51 points this year he joins Brandon Knight and vono cummings as the only pit Panthers with a season of 500 points and 150 assists wow its a great list to be on but his ability to get to that paint you just see straight line speed its impressive strong commits the foul and thatll take us to Young and so they are part of what is a wonderful effort everybody on the floor today wearing special tshirts and again we want to help raise awareness and hopefully raise some money for research to fight ALS the impact that hes had on his sons and the game itself hes given so the dad gave so many people opportunities and one very close to me and Kevin Sutton Applause whos coach Jason Capel in high school where he was in high school AllAmerican he was my high school assistant coach and Jason and Jeff are the Godfather of his son and watch these guys grow up as players in high school and competed against Jeff in college when he was at Duke and I was at Wake Forest and just an outstanding family and great coaches great teachers at the game of basketball and life and among the other members on the committee for Hoops for ALS our former ESPN colleague Kate Fagan who lost her father Chris Fagan to ALS Chris was a terrific player back in the 1970s at Colgate University and played overseas and so she is part of the effort Chris is a former player on courts that I shared with him I was happy to play many many years with Chris Fagan wonderful man taken far too soon because of ALS Im just glad he took it easy on me cuz Chris could have buried me every single time too nice a guy Donald hand with the threepointer Boston College certainly a shot it better here in the second half this is what were talking about but now this lineup presents the problem and now G odz Graham is doesnt have to take those threes he it opens up the floor and hes driving the basketball and pit may call off the dogs but theyre on Pace to score near 100 points and again theyve been very successful when they want the game in the 80s and this small ball lineup if they can Rebound in it and theyve been able to do so here tonight theyre going to be a tough out in the ACC tournament as you see Pittsburgh only 7even and 12 in conference play theyve lost their last four but uh we dont have to look far in the AC history book to see an example of a team coming from nowhere to do a lot of damage in the AC tournament North Carolina State got on a roll as a matter of fact North Carolina State lost to Pittsburgh in last years regular season finale before going and rattling off one of the great runs in conference history and that n State team looked lost a year ago and its amazing what a win a due to your confidence now BC shooting 70 in the second half great look from Taves inside to Elijah strong its hard to keep your foot on the GL on the gas here when youre up youre controlling this game but your pit Panthers youd like to continue to play well here and finish his half Zach Austin looks to the skies no question thinking about his late mother getting his first made bucket on senior night he wished so much that his mom would be able to be here but unfortunately heart disease took her but in the pregame ceremony he had his grandmother here had his auntie here its been a rough night for him considering the foul trouble but so glad for him he was able to bury that three brother and sister Santana and Charles here as well and know he wanted to play better but I think hes happy with the win twin brother to twin brother nicely done GMO from Jorge thats big because again if they can punish the switch because thats what youre going to have to do when theyre in ball screens finish inside and win that battle again thatll thatll help this Panther team come ACC tournament play Austin with the takeaway under four and A2 minutes remaining in regulation Los been getting having his way again theyre going to run that ball screen and force elizer strong to guard in the ball screen theyve elected to switch and now hes got to try to keep him out of the paint tte Diaz Graham he makes more than half his threes and you can see hes got a really nice stroke youd like to see him and Gamo de Graham shoot more of those because no ones going to uhoh watch block no ones going to alter their Applause shot Austin going to try again this time able to lay it off the glass Zach Austin tried to make a poster the previous possession but was able to Coral that out of this young man and everything that hes accomplished in his career graduated from college and I think hell make a lot of money playing this game of basketball more importantly because he knows what he is and hes really Elite versal Defender got my vote for ACC defensive player of the year because of that versatility he shows on the defensive end Applause and shot 38 on the year from behind the threepoint line and knocked down his first one here tonight and thats because of foul TR know Randolph we talked about it in the first half and I know a lot of our audience wasnt with us but there have only been a handful of players in conference history to make 53s and block 50 shots in the same season hes done it multiple times and the only other four guys whove done it in the history of the ACC along with Zack Austin have either played in the NBA for a long time or are in the NBA right now so again he profiles yes as a player with his athletic ability to join this list as M hes already on the list but can he join those guys in the NBA he fits more in that he doesnt shoot it as well as a Danny Green was naturally but thats kind of his role knowing that hey my job is to space the floor and knock down open threes but where hes exceptional is just his AB ility hes a little bigger than Danny Green his ability to guard multiple Defenders at that size is what everybody at that next level will be looking for for him and heres another one for you Randolph the last guy at Pittsburgh to lead his team in both M threes and block shots in the season Moe yes also made it to the Music NBA its been a rough shooting night for Donald Han he has struggled to knock down shots here but its been much more competitive second half from the Eagles pit turns it over Dion Brown bounc past to pay and if its on Zack Austin that would be his Fifth and Jorge Diaz grah I love what he just did he realized that he doesnt want on Austin so he reached for his teammate amsol delich and raised his hand for him to say no the foul is on you yeah take the foul thats what you experienced veteran guys supposed to do to a freshman The Freshman doesnt want to get yelled at hes like coach I didnt foul him just Tak it Jorge says no you fou to put your hand up because Zach fouls out if he doesnt do this so great job by Jorge he like wait wait put your hand up he did it im like huh yeah yeah yeah whatever you say what a game hes come off the bench hadnt played a ton but hes played really well tonight knocked down a couple shots and running the floor and been really Music active Im thei just into the game for the first time tonight for Pittsburgh lost track of the defender behind him who knocked it away also Papa amadu kti getting his first opportunity with two and A2 minutes to go weve got a 30second timeout back to the Pete right after this Music Music Music lets take a look at our Star Stories for players who have been crushing it brought to you by Crush great balance offensively for the pit Panthers here tonight they have I mean offensively theyve been really impressive and if you didnt see their starting lineup theyve changed their starting lineup and youre one of these coaches you might have missed something for a scouting opport Unity but they went to that small ball lineup and it was really impressive to see and it took him what four or five minutes to get it going but once it got going the offense was coming for most of that first half when they opened up a commanding 4819 lead cam Corin inside and then those three or four perimeter guys also doing it and whats so impressive about it earlier when they were flying around defensively coming up with loose balls the issue is going to be can they Rebound with that lineup if they play with Pace theyre going to score points at the line number 52 freshman amsol delich 68 210 lbs hes got a versatility to his game that I would think is very enticing yes for pit high IQ the way he plays the game offensively he makes shots he can put it on the deck good passer just a really good offensive talented player and as he physically matures as we talked about it hes a coachs son hes going to be a rotational guy for sure as he move forward in his career the cheers you hear is because Jeff capable is emptying his bench and so Marlon Barnes Jr number 11 a red shirt freshman from Cleveland comes in vason Stevenson the third of the three outgoing seniors who are honored and its also a chance for Zack Austin to get a hug from his head coach and a nice round of applause is like it also we saw the two seniors getting welld deserved hugs after a really good performance tonight you wont find a better young man than is legged and even Zach Austin for that matter just guys that you would want on your team and Je Cape will fittingly bring those guys out together its me a lot over the last two years there you see vason Stevenson just put on scholarship in January here he is got to get a shot up number 21 all right going to the free throw line he went to high school just 10 miles west of pit and his father was a real good player back in the day here in the city of Pittsburgh at duk pressure here got to make these shots well he got he has two shots so you dont care how you score as long as youre scored this crowd will erupt for him his teammates is cheering for him will he smile he makes it got to smile he has to Kingo look at that the pose with the follow through thats like me hitting a good golf shot you know I just hang on to the follow through to let you know like that looks I do this all the time thats what hes telling friends and season him uhhuh out of Montour High School from theck Rock PA calmly with a couple of free Applause throws Music hand well thatll be two points but om de inja I wanted to make sure he had a crooked number in his line score hey about putting your impact on the game as a coach you dont have any issues with that when a guy goes up and challenge a shot at The Rim go tender not no layups played his high school ball at Long Island Lutheran and puam Science Academy as well in Connecticut Barnes for three no they say its a two nonetheless the end of the Pittsburgh bench is contributing this is what I missed the most about the rules change that were going to with walles and everything else youre going to miss were going to lose opportunities in moments like this yep that are so significant theyre so fun to be a part of and guys at the end of the bench walk on guys just coming in and look at what it does to the bench its awesome this is what Athletics is all about and wish we can find a way to continue to keep that in the game Marlon Barnes is just as much a part of this program as anybody else took a red shirt last year after picking Pittsburgh over Miami Ohio and Cleveland State knew that getting regular playing time at least early in his college career was going to take time but hes putting in the time he is and he looks apart when you watch him in practice hes improving and game is starting to slow down for him and somehow pay able to tap that in look at just being able to be a point guard for you just shows you the versatility in his game as as I say that he turns it over its been really effective just initiating offense for the Panther we will get you up to the JMA Wireless Stone just as soon as we are done here Syracuse and Virginia playing their regular season finale on this last day of the regular season they are underway Syracuse with the early lead over UVA 6 to2 oh by the way that other game North Carolina is leading number two Duke 5649 over on ESPN early in the second half Tarheels they have a chance theyre home and that in that rivalry game its you you cant expect anything and it would not surprise me if uh Carina can hold on I mean theyre theyre fighting for their NCAA tournament life and then you have a rivalry game theres a lot of emotion effort will not be the problem thats a daunting task beating Duke and thats a lot on the line Duke loses the number one seed in the tournament in the ACC tournament if they lose that game falling into a threeway tie with Clemson and Louisville and Louisville will get the number one seed wow thats just amazing when you think about what could happen if Dukes unable to come back and close out that Carolina game hard foul will send inji to the line youd never know Pittsburgh had lost its last four and what was it you said 12 of their last 16 they had multiple four game stre man but again trying to wash that all away with an impressive performance they will fly to Charlotte tomorrow before opening up the ACC tournament we dont know their opponent yet theres still things to be sorted out not just at the top of the league we just discussed with Duke and Carolina and what that means its also at the bottom of the league as well first time inji has been to the foul line this year he helped luhigh win the 2023 New York state championship along with Baylor Superstar VJ edka go John Buck doing a great job there Cen Anthony soon to be incoming freshman for your for your orange where did Coach Buck go to college all right just wait for us hes a hes a demon deacon but I didnt say that you did see I shot I gave you two chances you blew it off the first I wasnt going to say it I I but hes doing a great job of a talented group and just beat o kill the other night big time they did heck of a coach and I guess Carmelo was not conflicted at all watching his son beat his Alma absolutely not Chaz Kelly makes it 9367 shot clock is off theres no shot attempt here you just want to dribble a clock out and impressive performance here and the season ends for Boston College but really impressive game for the pit Panthers and what theyre shown in the offensive and ability to rebound here with a small ball lineup as they come to the ACC play well the Boston College season comes to an end Pittsburgh will play on and they will head to that eight
