W will be jumping it up against Bott brand Hampton with final instructions lets go baby and were underway Georgia Tech controls the opening tap that is Kelly with the basketball being guarded by RJ Davis really excited to see the way UNC defends over the last 10 games have held their opponents to 70 points are P how about that pass from The Freshman Nate George te could not finish and here comes Carolina in transition I for M Ryan no good and theres the first rebound of the night from Harrison Ingram whos been getting all of them lately danana takes it away for T automatically you can see the pace of this game is going to be fast Carolinas going to push thats what Elliot kdo and RJ Davis are exceptional at lot of contact between kdo and George no call Kelly gets his shot blocked and theyre going to call a foul on Bon like to see that one again drove right to the right side great job by Bott they coming along looks like got him right there in arm Rd thats the key you know its getting into the depth of their bench and trying to get fouls on a guy like Armando baa a lot of people say well his numbers are down I actually think hes playing better basketball this year than he has in his entire career with what hes doing on a defensive end and also the way hes communicating and blocking out H Davis said as much today about bot despite the fact that Armando hasnt attempted more than six field goals in his past three games Five Points in each of his last two hes playing great ball and this also important for George attch with Miles Kelly getting a couple of points early Damon stanmire in his first year as a jackets head coach talked about getting his leading scorer some easier shots getting to the free throw line its okay to take twos Georgia Tech has the first point points to the night RJ Davis leading score in the ACC has his first bucket that boy good man trying to tell you and Armando Bott great job recognizing the double team by turning and facing a lot of bigs get caught off guard but hes a good passer out of the double team theres another two on the way and Kelly has a bucket hes got all four guy had two shots versus pit zero points an absolute donut not being aggressive and turned around with 11 points in his next game versus Virginia Tech in the loss another oneand runner from Davis that one finds the back of the rim Here Comes Nate Music George Young Canadian how about that little pocket fee that danana couldnt finish thats two assists that George could have if they could finish around the rim cormack Ryan has his shot knocked Applause away lets see who is last to touch it itll stay on that end with Carolina here is Dam STM the outstanding former NBA player had a great run at Pacific as a head coach been on NBA benches and trying to rebuild this jackets program Harrison Ingram knocks down the three hes been doing a little bit of everything for the heels man a 40 point a 40 percentage threepoint shooter a guy that actually is a Swiss army knife can do so many things for them he can play defense you can switch him one through five he can knock down shots from the outside he can get you a bucket when he needs to he also give you a big time assist along the Baseline it is kaasi Applause Reeves this is not a great offensive team from Georgia Tech so theyre building a little confidence by making some of these shots early so Georgia Tech Team Rd that beat Duke on this court they beat Mississippi State theyve been in a lot of close games and thats a critical key for North Carolina early is getting stops not letting Georgia Tech see the ball go in frankly not letting Georgia Tech believe that they belong on the court with North Carolina last foul was called on danana who had his hands on Bott for that one and gets away with it the NC State transfer got him off just in time not implying there should have been a foul called there wisely took it away Kelly a step back three and Miles Kelly is off to a centilating start Applause Ingram trying to answer cormack Ryan flying him it hasnt ripped away and here comes George hand off to Kelly and theres going to be a foul called on the handoff against George Ill take that foul by George hes getting the hot player of the ball youre going to see Miles Kelly right here I mean what a tough shot over the extend the arms of Ingram just absolutely in the flow offensively but Rd he didnt come out shooting threes he came out attacking the rim finding a midrange jumper first thats something that Damon St talk Damon STM talked a ton about twos getting in those midi range shots early to see the ball going and build a lav North Carolina which has missed six of its first eight field goal attempts now throws the ball away one thing you talking to Hubert Davis about this team it hasnt always they havent blown everybody out theyve had to fight theyre getting everybodys best shot right now a certain calmness about this team is is an older group out rattle by the environment is RJ Davis on the Applause push for MC Ryan almost turned it over again Davis had an opening for a minute creates his own and knocks down the three RJ Davis will you start I mean this this guy make big time shots or what I mean even against Florida State down the stretch made that critical bucket driving finding a way to finish through contact its one of the most gifted guards we have in the game of basketball on the Collegian Applause level another freshman for Georgia Tech by Dango getting his first bucket of the night Applause good pass good look inside from K and theres a bucket for B cut Rd thats an assisted turnover ratio that you love about Elliot kadu two to one off the pick and roll finding your bigger player to finish with two hands for Amando bot we got a yellow jacket down on the four I believe that might be Dango will check on him when you come back I one the best threepoint Shooters in the game of basketball as you see the knee right there to the back of Nanos head a tough one yeah it was a you see after he took the contact from Bott Ingram was just coming to the offensive glass and caught him in the back of the head they walked him out certainly we hope by will be able to return to the game shortly tie Claude into the lineup for d stmy is they checking on Dongo and hopefully hell be there soon and be able to return soon and theres a foul called underneath and trying to create a little space if they going to get Miles Kelly thats a smart play by North Carolina applying pressure when you think about Georgia Tech they average around 12 and 1 half turnovers per game only averaging around 13 assist so getting them to be Their Own Worst Enemy and speeding them up is what North Carolina needs to do defensively Seth Trimble is checked in for Hubert Davis so too as Jaylen Withers when Withers played for L last year he went 19 and3 against Georgia TCH and Armando Bott doing work on the Baseline look R if theyre not going to come with that weak side double Im going to tell Armando Bott to drop 35 its going to be his game if they Applause Music Applause dont OD working on Withers fortunate to get that bounce pass back three corter no good from Reeves and here come the Tar Heels Davis with Music Paul so one of the things you have to do with RJ Davis is you have to have a hand up in transition hes always comeing down hunting his shot if your hands are down he has free sight at the room how about kdo getting on the floor and getting the loose ball Here Comes tremble Bott asking for it they got double team coming he not going to come thats left hand another record for arando bot an eight nothing Run for the heels the sense of urgency by North Carolina defensively this is a North Carolina team that out rebounds their opponent and defense is their calling C danana cant get it Bott pushing it up to tremble hell wait for a little help give her right back down to him there you go see if they run a second guy at him now here comes the double beat tremble for three miles Kelly got off to a quick start for the jackets brings it into the front Court Davis picks him up now Georgia Tech is going to double that block theyre going to have to run and Scat as quick as possible to recover on those threepoint Shooters George a little too much contact for him Withers able to Corral the basketball Huber Davis imploring every possession hu Davis is kick the ball up the court wow oh and one The Freshman from West Orange New Jersey will have a chance for a threepoint play something about those Jersey guards baby its not about Jersey guards Rd I mean this is what hes so good at doing learning how to probe in transition and by the way the reason why he beat n George he changed speeds at the beginning of the year cadell was playing fast all day long now hes shifting gears Dar Hills got off to a little bit of a sluggish start but they have hit the gas in the last couple minut Music minutes getting him to brush is no longer a chore the sink is yeah for you this weekend Saturday afternoon on ABC and ESPN plus the NHL allstar game North Carolina and Duke Saturday night 630 Eastern Time college game day will be there RJ Davis Armando bot will join us live on the show Pro Bowl on Sunday on ESPN ABC and the app and then what youve been waiting on I understand youre a pickle ball player pickle ball slam to Mack androe and Sher POA against ausy and graph one would think that ausy and graph would communicate quite well give the fact that their husband and wife have been for quite some time they ought to know know each others U Tendencies on the floor I would say their cadences I would think yes that last foul by the way Jay will was given to Nate George youve got Nate George with two fouls you got Dongo who took a shot to the back of the head so the two guys who have led them in scoring in seven of their nine ACC games now and some manner of trouble and neither on the floor now Kyle sturdivan is checked in for the yellow jackets a veteran guard number one now you make Miles Kelly the primary ball handler and hes also their most elite scorer so youre going to try to wear him down endurance wise throughout the course of the Music game see of ball screens in start offense tall reflected frustrates me sometimes if youre going to go set a screen actually hit somebody on the screen the guy setting the screen if you actually hit somebody the probability of you being open is exponentially higher cuz youre hitting the screen too many kids these days set Phantom Screens and they want to slip it all the time actually pop somebody on the screen let them know youre on the court thats what Jay bis do he sets hard screens darara gari was the one who hit the basketball he hit somebody Withers thought about it Tech closed out quickly getting out there was Ibrahim asako whos into the game Sodom Myers had to go into his bench maybe a little bit earlier than anticipated really enjoyable talking to Damon today about his vision for what Georgia Tech can be his love for being able to teach guys particularly his uh his young point guard Nathan George and even talking to him about Dongo who came to him and said coach I I watch film but I dont really know what Im looking for being able to Mentor the guys and we got a whistle out of bounds on the sideline by North Carolina you know Rd off your point about nango is how many players in todays game actually speak up when they dont know something a lot of players remain quiet or silent and just let the game figure out itself but when you have people that are willing and want to learn its a game changer here is stament Georgia Tech had come up empty on its previous six possessions in start of it ends that that last foul on the other end was called on Seth Trimble for the block so its a sevenpoint game as we head toward the 12minute mark here in mamish Pavilion in Atlanta Reese Davis Jay Williams with you and Jaylen Washington goes to the bucket and sophomore from Gary Indiana will shoot a couple of free throws man is there anything that Ingram cant do on the dag on basketball court I mean he can guard positions one through five you can switch him on anybody Rd defensively he gets you a ton of rebounds had 17 rebounds in his last game but also he can do things off the PR and hes a playmaker he has vision hes one of the most skilled players there is in ACC and foul was on Ty quad and then the 17 rebound performance wasnt even his season high he had 19 rebounds against ccy State his body frame reminds me a lot of Ron ESS back in the St John days right when hes just he hes hes a truck running down the floor but with the agility of a guard its special another guy who continues to improve a lot of talent for jayen Washington as time goes on hell he relied upon more and more back tap will give Carolina a free possession who gave you the back tap Harrison Ingram Harrison Ingram hes everywhere Washington scrambling around the bucket he goes up strong and hammers it you think about how North Carolina can win a championship we know what their starting five could do its the depth of their bench as you see a big time drive right there on the Baseline Miles Kelly trying to keep his team in it but guys like Washington Withers having that depth allowing Armando Bott to be fully energized and thats going to be critical towards their run darar gari hit that dunk grabed that rebound he had a 209 against Penn stain so hes capable of offensive output in Georgia teex is going to need it Amari Abram the transfer from Old Miss whos seen his playing time dwindle in recent weeks and trying to give them a Applause spark rattles out for Abram he gets it back tech hustling to save it uhoh gari was going to try it again and he was greeted up top by Washington and itll be North Carolina basketball well look we got some grown men playing down below and one of them is Mr Washington with a strong finish down low and if youre going to do that young fella let it out yell let the whole world know give me some anger I need more of that R coming Music Applause back new Kinder Music chocolate has been sizzling and that winning streak starts started after a loss to Kentucky here in Atlanta theyve won 10 in a row they are unbeaten in ACC played 9 and0 for the first time since 20201 and theyve done it not only with explosive offense but Huber Daviss defense has been strong as well holding teams at 70 points or under below 40 theyre second in the ACC and field goal percentage Defense number one in threepoint defense and basically youre not getting a second chance against them as they control the defense glass were getting a chance to talk to Hubert before this game he said that there was a critical juncture throughout the course of the Season where he challenged his team that hey look everything for US starts on the defensive end everything with us starts about rebounding that that is the Carolina way and when theyre disciplined theyre locked in defensively that leades two transition buckets which is a category in which they accept for M Ryan the transfer from Notre Dame cant find the range dvo Coleman as the rebound for Georgia attch Rd of Ryan becomes more of a consistent threepoint shooter watch out and Kyles thir of Applause it been old time talking an unforced error there a wide pass that Trimble couldnt handle well transition defense is critical for Georgia Tech but also for North Carolina if youre going to go under the screen right there it makes more sense to go over the top the big did a great job rolling down into the defender it knocked it down playing the best basketball of his career over this stretch averaging around 12 and half points in ACC c c of a great feed right there and gari was fouled on his way to the Music Applause basket talking with sturdivan today know Damon stmy his Godfather as Kyles late father Gary close friends with Damon killed in a tragic accident while Kyle was at USC transferred back here home to Atlanta made it his home and its been a huge part of the leadership during this transition into the Scotto era is gari off to a good start tonight R I just want to give a shout out the start of it you know we talked before the game and he said they had opportunity to to read my book and I said Thank you and I said you know what what stood out to you I said well I lost my dad not too long ago and the fact that he plays for his father the fact that hes around family with Damon stmy and uh those are the kind of stories within college basketball where the importance of team and Leadership with a great guy like STM as a coach really helps a young person continue to develop even through dealing with tragedy hes a really impressive young guy he says he once his playing days are over whenever that happens as kadoo makes the basket he wants to either be a coach or an agent that Kad basket sna the 7 nothing Georgia Tech run turnover for Tech RJ Davis working on stament stman keeps him from getting to the basket nice defensive play by Kyle RJ Davis deciding to use the right hand thats an even better block by third of it there you know that last way ell Kido I think at the beginning of the Season he rushed a lot of plays very much looks on balance now with everything he does Davis from the corner took a little contact at the three ball and RJ Davis the accs leading scorer is into double figures with Music Applause 11 if youre Georgia Tech you got to chase him you got to chase RJ Davis you cant cheat and slit the Gap look at him he tries to cut the Gap he recognizes it fades it back knocks down to three you got to chase him on that Baseline force him to curl into your bigs RJ Davis is too good at making reads off those pin Downs Rd when I see players shoot the Gap from somebody that knows youre just trying youre taking an easy way out trust me I took the easy way it out a lot in college okay Miles Kelly was working on the Freshman that was how they used to do you too when you were young TR to work on you you always out scored him though I made up for it on the offensive end okay yeah your plus minus was always strong because you put a whole lot in the plus category look I I I like this by Miles Kelly Sometimes the best way to attack a smaller guard is just take them in the block and this is the benefit of having a coach who comes from the NBA that plays to ISO sets recognizing those mismatches and then taking advantage of them with a smaller guard like a though our run it again Davis this stament lost his balance Davis has some help Bott coming on Armando has hit four of his first five shots tonight hes got eight so by the way thats a little man complex right there Rd right youre pushing the ball down the court you see a guy 610 you slow it down you allow your big whos trailing you get him involved and you feed your Music Applause guy tough shot Kelly has been taking a lot of those see if they can get a little something from kaasi Reeds on the other end and that one goes off of Ingram and thats a turnover for the heels thatll be their fifth so RJs pushing the ball down the court here off the turnover look he sees the big right here he decides to slow up look the biggest triling you feed your big man young guards out there were at point guard you when your big runs the floor feed your big reward him you want him to run the floor its going to open up more threes later in the game wait a minute um my co favorite Jay from duke reliabil informs me that you said last week on college game day you didnt care for big men so well I I I care for them when it can help me out Al okay thats a charge and its going to be an offensive foul on Ingram eightpoint lead for North Carolina when we come back to Atlanta Jay will and Damon STM go one onone you come back to Atlanta right know Damon stary talk about the 1995 pack 10 coplayer of the Year consensus allamerican I got a chance to play against him when he was in Portland when I was in Chicago you might have seen me doing a little bit of the Shifty shoulder work Rd before we went to break is because his shoulder movement was one of the best Ive ever seen people talk often about Sam Cassell the way they can throw you off with their shoulders but he was able to cut you with the angles of attack with his shoulders he was one of the best guards Ive ever played against and hes got his starting point guard back on the floor with two fouls and Nate George start him IR a 13year NBA career shot is blocked out of there and gari has made his presence felt 13 years Rookie of the Year doesnt have to coach does it because he loves it and going be quite pleased with that defensive effort from Tara gari the youngster from New Zealand his long is athletic and please do not mistaken that lowkey or even kill demeanor from STM to be not competitive one of the most competitive guys you ever meet as Ryan knocks down the three Cormac a 30 threepoint shooter capable of being even better than that something that you alluded to the 25yearold who started his career at Stanford been playing in Notre Dame for Mike pre and this year coming to North Carolina and RD when Ryan starts knocking down those shots if youre a guard like cadell or RJ youre going to start driving it toward their side every time cuz they cant leave him you have to stay home when that consistent threepoint shooter hes knocking it down at a high clip officials are coming over theyre going to look at the foul the foul was called on Evie Music daana well its not only just the elbow to the face but its also the hook there on kadoo lets see got John Gaffney going over well he stopped along the way talk to Miles Kelly and also to Nate George a foul on Dan his second I see invert and nothing nothing more to see there too by the way so Im glad they did that quickly cuz we just ran into him from behind so an 11point lead for Carolina as the heels go for their 11th straight win K has it in the front court inside seven minutes to play in the first half weve seen a little bit of Zone from them STM WS to wants to play manto man but went to Zone some against Virginia Tech with varying degrees of success on Saturday as Ingram locks it up in the possession arrow belongs to George Tech look if you got Pari here dont bring the ball and put it into his chest keep that thing on the left side tuck it away I mean Harrison Ingram with such good hands if you give him the ball hes going to wrap you up look at that I love that I love that I mean thats the kind of toughness that you want that Ingram brings to the table you know youre just not going to get position on me Im going to fight you Kido tried to swipe that inbounds pass he he knew what was coming to start the out of bounds underneath couldnt quite get up to grab it Kelly has Davis all over him Kelly finds a little space and knocks down another three miles Kelly Kelly his second triple of the night and hes into double figures with 12 Tech with a rebound its Kelly again Georgia Tech has done this all year Jay will they get in a hole they fight out hasnt always been successful in terms of getting all the way to the top but they continue to fight and Kellys knocked down theres some contact underneath and a foul is going to be called on Deana and if thats danana its his third it is and it is so danana the transfer from NC State who started the game tonight part of that rotating fifth starter spot for the yellow Music jackets and and Betty Valentines coming over to have a look again after that foul honestly I was a little blocked from exactly what the contact was so I a little would be making I would be making it up if I said I knew exactly what they were looking at a little black I Im sitting on a chair like Im Phil Jackson over here I couldnt see anything going see the up and its from the weak side here its a tough angle to see it I think you know what I think what Teddy was telling us is they were trying to see who who got fouled therefore who be going to the free throw line and he said 55 Music Harr you know one of the things I thats so impressive about North Carolina R we you and I do on game day we get a chance to see so many teams play so many times when theres a shot that goes up by the offense you see a lot of teams that stare at the fly of the ball and they try to out jump their opponents for that defensive rebound Harrison Ingram and Bott they put a body on somebody theyre literally carving out space to get that defensive rebound that is the one area that Ingram Im sure would like to see a little Improvement hes a little below 60 in terms of free throw shooting the rebounding is just fine however Aon w is checked into the game number eight another veteran transfer came over from Brown makot tried to get it over the top and he couldnt theres cormack Ryan knocking in his second three of the night four Second Chance points for the Tar Heels whove now scored 14 Second Chance opportunities tojust a single bucket for the jackets the lead is back into double figures those are the plays that hurt hurt the defense the most an offensive rebound tip that leads to a threepoint shot Kad kdog get pass George couldnt finish and rebound pulled out by Tai Claud really love to see Miles Kelly involved in more ball screens him andate George are really good at probing the defense off these good pass George great feed to Claud and that is why Nate George is second in the ACC and assist Applause how about that fine that guys going to be a Applause star and I think wji might have stepped out of bounds the turnover you can see George off that double off that pick and roll nobody comes from the weak side to stop the roller there North Carolina George with a beautiful pass to claw jasus slam and once again Rd when you flatten out the defense like that if theres no help from the weak side and even if there is help from the weak side they have a skip pass once again same play how about finding him again thats about the third time tonight that Georgia Tech missed a golden opportunity to finish at The Rim off really outstanding passes from the Freshman George Well Huber Davis is telling Armando Bott to push up on the screen to go out and hedge on the screen try to force the offensive player and George to go the opposite direction so the big can get for so the gar can get Music through little consultation between Ted Valentine and the North Carolina bench all resolved to most everyones satisfaction might have shuffled his feet and he did and Teddy caught him I thought hed gotten away with it for just a second itll be a turnover for the yellow Music jackets headed toward the 4minute mark sold out mamish Pavilion in Atlanta first sell out in a couple of years they try to knock off the number three team in the country north Carolina here comes a rambling wreck George on the pull out what great defense and what a better shot by Nate George Georges first points of the night Jay will he spent a little time on the bench with a couple of fouls coming back in there as Tech was looking a little desperate sevenpoint game jackets have it again Kelly three Applause Music ball Applause gy now with almost half of the Georgia Tech points another Miss Bott working on it CLA out bites him its a seven nothing Music run Kelly feeling it is he going to got him right take the shot on W and Paxton mics going to be called for the block lets tell you Nate George has a chance to be a special player in the ACC he can do it off a pick and roll and this is great defense by CDO but got to we at the little bit of a push off right there but if the ref doesnt call it its not a foul and then in transition if youre not guarding Miles Kelly we have a problem Georgia Tech is in a dog Music fight and be this moment when you know Saturday you got Duke at home and basically the game that never disappoints or always delivers you know what said I dont I know that we as media we lean into that I actually think that this is a North Carolina team and a Duke team you saw that last night with the way they handled Virginia Tech I think these two teams are squarely focused on the opponents that were right in front of them now Seth is right about taking care of The Rock versus Florida State in the first half they had 12 turnovers they had five in the second half did way better job pulled away so far eight turnovers in this game but to me Rd you tell me if Im wrong it seems this is a team that seems to be locked in into who their opponent is today but theyre veteran team older guys Carter Murphy into the game transfer from Air Force hes actually doing his first year of his Air Force Academy commitment as a student here at Georgia Tech hes had an increased role recently but I think the age and the fact that you have for Ryan whos been around and RJ Davis and Bot who played all of these games I think that helps him pass to I the maturity is is strong on this team Claude from the middle of the lane cant get it to go he gets it back fresh 20 for the jackets tell you this way Miles Kelly needs to be met with way more physicality he just has room to go whichever direction he wants got 15 here in the first half they lead all scores little rocking chair moved George cant finish Georgia TCH is within four 2 minutes to play in the first half and theyve been without the services of by Dango their outstanding freshman whos being evaluated for a head injury he barely played here in the first half certainly hope he clears all of those tests and is able to play later and the giveaway on that end and Carolina will have it back long ago you talking about a threetime ACC rookie of the week all tournament at the Diamond Head classic still the numbers Ain putting up Rd I mean an ACC play the guy is averaging around you know 14 and 1 12 points per game rebounding the ball exceptionally well three blocks per game shooting 61 from the floor against ACC opponents too and foul its called inside I believe going to get Kelly that one and thatll be second one on Miles you know I know all all games are hard especially Row games weve seen that this year but Ive said this in studio there are sometimes when you watch North Carolina when they elevate their level of intensity on the defensive end theres no doubt theyre one of the best teams in the country but theres sometimes where they take their foot off the gas and Ive used this terminology before Rd like sometimes seems like they play with their food right like they get a little bit lethargic laxidasical with the ball and out of allows your opponent to stay in the game another whistle as Seth Trimble is hit on his way up I would say that that metaphor that you use is indicative of a man with three kids under the age of five at home playing with the food yes it is thats my everyday life Rd I did not play with any of the food at the Silver Skillet just down the street here from mamish Pavilion spectacular record was Lisa the waitress brought me a lovely lemon ice box pie that was absolutely delectable coming up next our super Tuesday triple header rolls on Allen Fieldhouse Rock talk jhawk against Oklahoma State itll be followed by loyal marry mountain and Gaga uncharacteristically scuffling as it contains being a lock in the ACC tournament the Miss free throws and Carolina got it right back they havent scored in nearly four minutes Ingram will try to put a stop to that shot fake and no good as Ryan goes flying in bodies to the floor and Carter Murphy the air force transfer gets it and its a high hand off and a little too low in the pass from George George almost kicked up his third foul on Davis RJ all the way to the rack wild action inside and pulled away by gari and Georgia Tech has it with a chance to get it to a one possession game Applause first inside a minute to play George working on Ryan kick to the corner wide open from the corner and he knocks it down ibraim asako with just his third triple of the season Applause oh and the block is called inside as dlen Washington was trying to get it to the basket you going to see Nate George here probing offensively and he sees Washington in this small corner he gets into the Gap recognizes hes there and gives a kick out for a knockdown three now if youre going to be in that corner you got to hedge and get back Jay will that last foul was called on M Miles Kelly thats number three wow tough one to take against a much bigger Postman thats what youre taught to do if theres a smaller guard on the big thats posting you up you know you call take away that seat you let him bump into you once and then when he tries again you move away hoping he falls down and turns it over Washington one of two and the whistle and Kyle Sturman comes in to get Kelly out of there to prevent a potential disaster of a fourth foul in the last half minute of the first half also getting Nate George out of there for the same reason to avoid him picking up his third foul Zaden high is checked in from North Carolina freshman from San Antonio Music mayot returns 20 seconds on the shot clock 30 seconds left in the first half twopoint game tar Hills a couple of times have threaten to stretch it out and Georgia Tech wont have it cor Ryan I think theyre going to theyre going to bail him out with the inter bur whistle yeah I it just should be Georgia Tech ball yeah he cant touch it if he left his feet which he threw it down its Georgia Tech Music basketball its again another turnover for North Carolina a careless turnover but but you know what he didnt he didnt touch it thats still turnover right well they they they grabbed the ball but there was a whistle thats why they stopped play what Im saying Valentine immediately pointed to himself no harm no foul once again just North Carolina not taking care of the ball in the first half thats why its a twopoint game tremble is a great on ball Defender and zth a little too aggressive there but foul to Gibs yep so no problem there great pressure by Trimble though thats what you want want Nate George playing with his back to the basket but if they foul here now would send Georgia Tech to the line I would go right at that match up on the Block look get Miles Kelly the ball right there on the Block against Ryan Wy Reeves to inbound right in front of us and Trimble almost takes it away from George George gets past his man and its going to be a goal tend on Zaden high and thatll tie the game with a second to go and there are a lot of Carolina fans here but listening to this wide out crowd show their appreciation for a Georgia Tech team which has lost eight of nine and a second away from going to halftime tied with the number three team in the country it was definitely the right call he turned that corner and he got tremble on his hip there was nothing trible could do RJ Davis couldnt get it to go and Georgia Tech closes the half on a 121 run is of the standout freshman by Dango who suffered a head injury and has been ruled out for the remainder of the game after playing just a few minutes early first possession for the heels Harrison Ingram thought he got fouled no call and Georgia Tech with a chance to take the lead great job by Georgia Tech rotating for the weak side to contest that layup by Ingram heres Nate George way too long tech will get another opportunity kawy Reeves he gets his own and tries it again still wont go danana playing with three fouls he couldnt get it to go STM really frustrated on the sideline a lot of golden opportunities and then RJ Davis makes it look so easy got to convert if your Georgia Tech when you get four offensive rebounds those are the possessions that hurt the most RJ Davis so crafty in finishing the shot around the rim hes tried to slip that screen George gets into the lane cant get it Nate has it back and puts it home so five offensive rebounds in the last two possessions for Georgia te theyre a very good offensive rebounding team but thats been a strength to this Carolina Squad is keeping you off of your offensive glass but Georgia Tech one of the better offensive rebounding teams in the ACC theres Davis again knocked loose Ingram chases it down Ryan for three and its pulled out of there by Claude dont think that Ryan needs to settle for that shot the defender was sprinting at him put the ball on the ground and make a play Kelly misses another rebound for Ingram hes on the Run fires ahead to Davis RJ did well to keep that one in bounds Bott has it on the Baseline extra pass to Davis one and done for the heels and Nate George has it Georgia Tech with a chance to go back on top got a drive left if he wants him Kelly pulled up for two wild shot didnt even hit the rim shot clock still rolling Georgia Tech just out fighting North Carolina for the basketball right Applause now shot clock winding down and Nate George gets in there and draws a foul foul is called on Kad I mean thats the second time throughout the course of this game you feel like Nate George has gotten away with a little bit of a push off there on Elliot CAD they had one time on the drive in the first half and then there but still for North Carolina Huber Davis absolutely living here on the sidelines about the fact You given up six offensive rebounds I mean its in a span of of a one minute here and its carving out space getting those defensive rebounds that start the fast break on the offensive end jayw will theyve allowed more offensive rebounds in the first three and a half minutes of the second half they did the entire first half one of the reasons for the frustration were seeing from Hubert Davis here is Nate George and the Freshman misses the free throw not a great free throw shooter mid60s so heres what I would like to see from North Carolina right now Hubert Davis who Rd you and I have known him for a pretty extensive time one the most even kill individuals you ever meet his passion his sense of urgency his tenacity on the sideline I dont know who is representing that on the court right now after you have a lackluster first half who is coming out and setting the tone for North Carolina on the floor as a leader you know RJ Davis is a great scorer but somebody needs to bring it defensively Music Georgia attack you just saw had its first lead since the 152 Mark of the first half it didnt last long as the heels are back up by Applause Music one par with the screen and gets the pass George and he missed it right at The Rim yet another missed opportunity for the yellow jackets Daviss shot rims out Ryan fighting for it and Ang drops it in Carolina contesting at the rim and then giv George Tech a taste of their own medicine in an offensive glass George backs his man down and he draws the foul Applause Music again see just grabbing offensive rebound Ingram just being a recipient and going up strong and Hubert once again Im telling you the the energy that that hes trying to give his team right now on the sideline is what you need on the road oh everybody always says Road games are tough and they are Rd but if you can have that fight that tenacity like Hubert Davis just showed North Carolina would be in a different position also this weekend when I see our friend jff Sims Im going to have her evaluate this tape hopefully an isot tape on Hubert and I think we can get an entire 20minute highintensity interval training workout out of it its like a high intense Zumba class MMA MMA maybe yeah jab cross hook uppercut George has eight points tonight Nate George playing in a game like this when he thought a few months ago he was just going to play another year of high school ball scholarship came available late wound up at Tech just before classes started didnt play the first three games and now hes turned into one of the better young guards in the ACC what a great play and he has shown a veteran move from RJ Applause Davis RJ now up to 15 threepoint lead for the heels D set a good screen almost got it back from Kelly good active Hands by the heels and reached in and got stur of it on his way to the bucket Ando the youngster is running into some foul trouble in the last few minutes that was his third threepoint lead for number three but theyre in a fight in Atlanta its been so long since Ive seen you you guys should come over and watch the game again this Sunday theres look at a miscommunication right there by Nate George he thinks theres a switch you see a flare screen by Washington for RJ he comes over to top big doesnt get out there what great action by North Carolina and execution on the play and if youre Georgia Tech if youre going to switch switch if youre going to stay at home you got to be up on it and Chase RJ force him into the trees to be a twopoint Music score Davis with 15 tonight hit three of his six triples D Sturdivant the veteran going to the free throw line he now has a half dozen so what weve seen the last three possessions for Georgia Tech is when the shot clock is dwindling down each guard studt and George they are attacking that individual matchup against CAD Kyle makes them both onepoint Applause game Seth trembles return for the Tar Applause Heels Davis turns the corner all the way inside and theres a whistle as John Gaffney call the foul and thats just where Nate George being a younger player you dont need to swipe down at the ball you know make RJ Davis finish over the trees like that is a win you are bailing him out when you do that and RJ Davis is really unique in the game of basketball at finding creative ways to get to the free throw line a Sai veteran who understands how to play dont bail him out make him make ult shots well hes also the accs leading free throw shooter North Carolina hasnt done that well tonight as a team with that make theyre now just four of 10 that was a third foul by the way on George RJ with the highest free throw percentage in UNCC history on Pace the the third highest in the season in ACC behind JJ reck in 0304 and then JJ reck again in 0405 Kellys going to take a break they do leave George out there to run the show playing with those three fouls but I mean youve lost eight out of nine you might as well leave your dudes out there and try to get this thing turned around they have won two games against ranked opponents this year beating Duke beating Mississippi state had a went over Clemson on the road in which George was just spectacular in overtime he and Dongo as we mentioned earlier the head injury earlier will not return tonight what a great defensive possession by North Carolina Harrison Ingram was all over multiple players denying the ball everybody playing between themselves in the basket thats a very defensively sound possession for the tar Hills RJ Davis almost traveled thats the right call hands are on the back Music and the foul on danana and thats his fourth ta quad will return as danana will go to the bench hes giving Styer some good minutes toughness inside so too as Tara gari who in the Applause lineup once again didnt even hit him on the screen Washington short Corner Big Time move love the patience right there by Washington turn Face take a shot see all three of his field goal attempts he has eight points now heels showing some pressure in the back Music Applause Music Applause court where Georgia Tech gets points from right now with Miles Kelly on the bench the playmaker on the floor is studt and you got Nate George they have to create things how about some points from Tara gari threepoint game headed toward the 14minute Applause mark Harrison Ingram rattled out T Yans work on the board struggled a little bit to shoot the ball tonight theres out is two of nine Claude muscles it up and in claw claw with the big time defensive rebound and then the recipient off stud drive thats how you go up and crack into your defensive player and finish at The Rim Ryan had it contested by gari and put it right in his kisser A three ball from cormack Ryan thats his third Music Applause tonight B turns the corner and Teddy Valentine calls the foul on the floor the foul is called on Jaylen Washington youre going to see RJ gets into the Gap the defense collapses they just lose where Carm Ryan is on the floor and you talk about that three over the long length of galerry and what a big time shot by Ryan Music fourpoint lead after that Ryan three hes three of seven from behind the arc thats a counted for all nine of his points sturdivan throws it deep RJ Davis tried to take it away from gari but hes able to salvage it now sturdivan in the corner for three St Davis tries to answer and a whistle Applause inside me so it was a 5050 ball right here and prob just being taller hes able to get it puts the defense in a scramble situation like stur actually got fouled there after the shot going up what a big time play those are the types of plays momentum wise allows Georgia Tech to stay in the game last fouls on taian Claude now Davis has Applause it for MC Ryan this time inside the arc and that wasnt close and gari has it for Georgia Tech Brian got caught there he didnt know if he wanted to pass it or shoot it always shoot if in Applause doubt foul was stur it was on his way to the basket called it on the floor and coming up next Super Tuesday rolls on Allan Fieldhouse Kansas hosting Oklahoma State 900 eastern time itll be followed by the night cap oy old marry mou and Gonzaga West Coast Conference where and St meire was once a head coach in that conference at Pacific did a terrific job there coach of the year in 2020 W 23 games finished third that year right behind Gonzaga and St Maris yeah and many times in the WCC thats about the best you can hope for exactly Kelly hes been quiet in the second half gets his own lost it the officials will talk it over and itll stay with the yellow Music jackets number three he with 12 and 1 half to go on the ropes its been that way this season top 10 teams 24 and 27 on the road against unranked opponents and letting it fly as Deo Coleman and Georgia attack is back on Applause top tell you North Carolina is playing faster than what theyre comfortable with and you have to give Georgia Tech lot of credit defensively Carmack Ryan theyre forcing him to put the ball down the ground and be a shot creator for himself is not ultimately his strength he can do that but thats not getting the best shot for North Carolina on that Music possession Ryan not the touch he customarily has and and gari lost it on the way but North Carolina touched it last and well go to the Under 12 and Nate George in the yellow jackets with a twopoint lead I mean is this game everything you want it to be people say its the game before the game no its about North Carolina versus Georgia Tech right now he back to you well thats thats quite a Resume Builder for the Gamecock I would say and here North Carolina trying to go 10 and0 in ACC play extend their winning streak to 11 which is the longest of any team in the power conferences Georgia Tech hasnt beaten a top three team in quite a while did beat Duke here earlier this season Blue Devils are not ranked that highly and Ingram pulls it out of there as Harrison rebounded the ball well as nine tonight RJ Davis so so difficult to guard off off off the ball if youre not staying on top of him within pick and roll he can get into those gaps you know Rd lot people text me saying well its the game before the game and they look distracted no thats an excuse thats an excuse this is a veteran team that understands every game matters Ty CLA scored over Armando Bott whos returned after spending about 5 minutes on the bench largely the product of Georgia Tech wreaking habit on the offensive glass in the first three minutes of the second half we kind of finish Bott has Ryan for three the paris been really tough inside and hes got another rebound really felt like Harrison Ingram had a chance he lifted the defensive player up should have cracked into him went to the free throw line got three free free throws back with a twopoint lead in the ball nearing the halfway point of the second half B cut able to keep Claude from taking it away here comes oh RJ Davis will go Bott tries to take the ball away after Coleman had gotten it first and theres going to be a foul called on Rando Bott thats his second personal 16b rning fors number 14 R Jr Evo Coleman goes to the bench he gave them some good minutes hadit a big shot a few minutes ago Kelly has been controlled largely in the second half jayen Withers number 24 has returned from North Carolina stent lines one up three ball for Kyle stent a fivepoint lead for the Applause wreck death tremble tries to answer in start of has it Tech on the runy Reeves thought about it and he backed it Applause out Stan to Kelly Trimble out checking him Kelly tough shot over Trimble and Seth has the rebound tremble all the way to the basket and it was just wont go down but hell go to the free throw Music line Scott reporter is to go under these ball screens thir been a 35 threepoint shooter youre going to go under thats what theyre going to live with and hes been knocking them down Music today Jays tremble steps to the free throw line hes missed both of his attempts and its been a problem spot for the tar Hills in this game theyre just five of 11 Applause right into the student section Seth makes the first one every Thursday womens basketball double header on the ACC Network and the ESPN app number 17 Virginia Tech hosts Virginia 600 eastern time thatll start it then 24th ranked tarhill women take on oiah James and number five North Carolina State its all in the ACC Network and the app Withers going to give the heels a second chance on this Music Applause Music possession shot clock at five Ingram has to force up a tough shot its an air ball and gari has another rebound for Georgia Tech thats now a half dozen Kelly trying to find a man and tremble has it Georgia Tech gets back on defense great her St by Seth trible silky silky Seth Applause Music tremble zth might have used some salty language but that was a sweet move well one in Miles Kelly takes a bad shot and how about a little step through excuse me Seth triple sending the lead or excuse me ex cutting into the lead by two it is surpris theyre going to let you Seth Trimble just gave you one heck of one right left East to West Blows By stut and finds himself right at The Rim this young man was brought Off the Bench for a spark and hopefully he just gave the Tar Hill ones with one big time transition bucket under nine minutes to play Georgia Tech with a twopoint lead on number three Yellow Jackets No Stranger Jay will to close game 14 games decided by single digits third most in the nation theyre seven and seven in those games one of the things Dam stom talked to us about today sustaining in these moments used Saturday against Virginia Tech for example they Whitted into a huge lead got it down to seven points and then couldnt finish couldnt sustain yeah then George then Virginia Tech went on a big time run to blow it open you know the one thing he said they needed Rd was a leader on the floor somebody that can calm everybody down tell them you know what time and possession is and get them in the right sets I I think Nate George can be that Miles Kelly even though their best offensive player needs to be there as well I would say the veteran Kyle sturdivan has been that tonight as he scores again hes got Applause 15 its going to be on Elliot Kad to create shots for himself or other Applause people exiting that zone North Carolina is just one of eight in threepoint land in the second half all knock why Georgia Tech wouldnt grab that I dont know why Georgia Tech wouldnt grab that Im going to tell you what we talk about Miles Kelly we talk about Nate George but we have to talk about student man more and more and more you talk about putting set to join us live but you see what we have in store on Saturday heels have their hands full for the last 755 here in Atlanta yeah and Duke looked pretty good in their game against Virginia Tech well see how North Carolina handles this down to stretch but Rd I mean what a great slate of games on Saturday Houston Kansas is going to be a blast Duke Carolina and then Tennessee Kentucky I mean dton connect one of the top players in the country as well gdo whistled for the foul its his fourth thats his and all of them have come here in the second half are over the LI well you ask how is this happened well North Carolina is shooting under 39 from the floor and a Georgia Tech team that has given up 90 Plus in three ACC games and played really good defense against Huber Daviss team you know one of the big things to look of youre seeing La CAD right there number two body language is so critical and a lot of times young players you want to see him do that right obviously the game is not going in his failure hes been targeted defensively multiple times but the only way to get yourself out of that punk is to throw yourself into what the team is doing its apparent hes frustrated learning how to play through these moments as a young player is critical for the overall maturity of this team well Elliot has a tough go in the second half he does have five assists George puts down the the free throws and the yellow jacket lead is Applause four Georgia Tech in the zone got to get the ball in the middle of that zone the Harrison Ingram turn make a play weve shown it a few times and gdo has it wiped out of there and the ball saved in just some tough luck as the wasy Reeves couldnt handle the save speak about the athleticism third of got his hand on it the first time and then the block from the weak side effort by Georgia Tech is just tremendous boy Reeves had it in his hand very frustrated hes had a tough night just one of five from the floor but very capable Harrison Ingram has to flash or screen the top of that Applause zone got F at Music seven and another turnover for the heels as Ingram was expecting Davis to take it himself sturdivan slipped as he tried to get into Davis now CAU On The Run he leaves it with Ryan Cormac over the top and a good contest keeps it out of the bucket and here come the jackets and Sturman says were going to take things easy here STM tells his godson lets have a good possession here AAR with one heck of a contest stament hes been and I couldnt get that one to Applause go next switching Ds again R Bott Rond Bott had his man pinned down Carolina just fallen in love with outside shots that let the big man eat a little bit are you correct me if Im wrong but I believe they switched defenses on him that time oh they were in zone the first time and then they changed to man man at last possession they got him a little out of Swords here keeping him off balance yeah its a guards job to recognize Applause that and the foul is going to be called on gdo and thats going to be it set before they have been attacking Elliot k Applause defensively really putting him in the bind a tough game for a young player but still North Carolina right in this hunt all five fouls coming in the second half were not yet at the 5 minute Mark he was coming off just an outstanding performance in Tallahassee over the weekend with 16 points and six assists yeah but you know what Rd and that you know when they had 12 turnovers in the first half when when he got in foul trouble that sixminute span they had five turnovers you know his presence on the court is critical because of his decision making down the stretch hasnt been his game today but his ability to make plays is additive to a guy like RJ Music Davis eight George seven of eight from the free throw line hes got 13 points and Georgia Tech with a sixpoint lead Georgia Tech going back into their two3 got to hit Ingram in the Applause middle good pass Bott down low and Armando cant get it to go in itll go to the free throw Music line This is how you beat the zone you hit the short Corner they trap turn Face you drive you hit that Gap you hit him again those are N1 opportunities but thats how you beat the zone you cant just pass the ball around the perimeter and settle for a long contested shot you got to hit the short corner you got to drive you got to hit the middle of the Defense Force it to collapse he got a much improved free throw shooter this year just a tick under 80 hes got nine points that was his first free throw of the evening a difference in the game right nows at the free throw line teex made theirs North Carolina has struggled to make theirs one of two for Applause Music Applause Bott heres George again another good pass to Claude who just m on his way in had a chance for a threepoint play for taon claw Music so good at this High pick and roll look at claw with his hands look at him providing a Target Armando Bott if youre standing up he cracks into him pushes him back underneath the basket what a strong move by claw to finish for the Music Applause M1 K quad to 63 free throw shooter hes got it in Georgia Tech has its biggest lead of the evening with just over 5 minutes to Applause play Ingram with the offensive board it got deflected itll stay with North Carolina we go inside five to play now you just see a Georgia Tech team that is together right now look at that Georgia Tech just had their huddle everybody from North Carolina looks a little bit spaced everybody separate theyre not coming together its GE DET Tech has that sense of Music urgency official signaling put 20 on the shot Music Applause clock Davis trying to shake the Freshman Applause George that goes back to the miscommunication right there North Carolina not in the right set Rd I cant tell you enough when youre on the Road you have to come towards huddle so you can communicate what youre going to do each and every possession they didnt do that the last possession where Georgia Tech did just seems like Georgia Tech is on the same page whereas Carolina looks a little bit frazzled right now boy Tai quad almost doubled his scoring average and he has had a hand on virtually every loose ball hes been active on the boards hes been physical on defense done a little bit of everything there is Reeves trying to save Applause and hes out of bounds itll be North Carolina ball 20 back on the shot Music clock think the way KSI reacted he thought for a second they called a foul on him then he called him for being out of Music Applause bounds Davis into the paint draw the foul hell go to the free throw line RJ Applause Music Applause Davis RJ Davis what a big time play you see he Trails him on the pin down he keeps him on his back kind of leans back jumps into him a foul over the top thats a veteran going against a younger guard and thats four on The Freshman guard George weve already seen Kad foul out of this game both young guards getting a bit of a baptism from some of these veterans tonight Davis is pure hes got 24 heels back within five catch the ball he splits the defense and now Georgia Tech has an opportunity and kapari lost it out of bounds I think he thought he was feeding it for a dunk and well thats where you SW Kari if youre going to attack gim attack it you have the athleticism you have the mobility to finish around the rim attack thats the third turnover in the second half for the yellow jackets it would be a costly one Bott trying to get the handle inside tremble driving tremble driving and he puts it in Seth tremble on the drive so hes been making big time plays get getting into the gaps in the teeth of that defense and that is absolutely the right call avoids the contact kapari is off to the side that is a big time move by Seth Trimble and and one material what did they call last year yeah yeah right Call last year and this year but maybe last year more inclined to give it the defenses direction and now Trimble who has struggled from the free throw line just one of four completes the threepoint play and just like that number three has scored six in a row to get it back to two and George is in trouble in the back court but he is fouled hard to hear the whistle as Teddy Valentines going to get cor M Ryan for shoving a hip into him now with every foul for Georgia Tech this game is going to come down to free throws Georgia Tech in the double bonus both teams not being the best of free throw shooters got Georgia Tech shooting 67 on the season in North Carolina theyre shooting around 76 but not in this game they havent been shooting well at all Tech 303rd in the country in free throws and theyve made 14 of 15 tonight and George has now made eight of nine top 15 Big 12 womens basketball Thursday night on ESPN and the at Madison Booker and Texas rank 12th in the country taking on 13th Frank Baylor our coverage starts at

in minutes back to you Rd RJ Davis with with the Quiet 26 but look at the change of speeds right there shif the gear boom and then he finds a way to attack that Gap now look at this angle this is what smaller guards do to be successful when they attack look at the left hand the left forearm it braces up against the big pushes off finds a way to finish over the side with the right hand what a big time finish for RJ Davis with 26 points so far in this game Georgia Tech had to use a timeout to get the ball in bounds those 26 from Davis hes the only Tar Heel in double figures forat Ryan and Harrison Ingram are a combined five of 25 from the floor Kyle stur of it hey call Bank friendly nighttime banking hours and theyre going to have a look as Teddy Valentine going to see if its a two or a three the stur ofont have something called irrational confidence or what Rd I mean this is not a great shot youre going to see him lets see if he Sav away with the walk right there thats well behind the threepoint line got a little Shuffle beforehand thats a threepoint shot thats still the irrational confidence to take that three off the dribble that is a three off the dribble what a big time shot Georgia Tech has been riding the hot second half hand of Kyle sturdivan 13 of his 18 coming in the second Music half theyve had a couple of big wins but theyve come close and let it slip away so often theyve lost eight out of nine and theyve got a chance right now Damon stmy in his first year best performance of the Season by the Yellow Jacket bench now does rj Davis have another answer Bott has him Buri deep in the paint left it on the front of the rim and the rebound goes to Applause Kelly sure B wishes he can have that one back he pinned him down really deep on the Music Block heate George to the corner the Ws back into the game been played with foul trouble tonight Kelly had the big first half but that one well short tar Hills on the Move tremble looks away puts it up with the left cant get it to go Bott back up lot of contact no calling there bodys flying RJ Davis comes out with it shot clock did not reset Ryan for three too long and Stan comes out with it and hell settle things down again n seconds left in the shot clock when Ryan shot that would still love the ball to be back in the hands of RJ rattles out on stur ofan a heartbreaker hu Davis telling RJ Davis to push it George cuts off Davis Ingram wide open for three he got it thear Hills will take a timeout so that play was developed because RJ Davis pushed the ball down the sideline that is the pace Huber David and Nar hbert Davis and narios want to play with Ingram having some answers 30 second break Music Laughter here Tech Reese back to Music you and RJ just pushing the ball down the S line they rotate the ball Georgia Tech late to recover Harrison Ingram with a big time three three and thats in The Scouting Report shooting 41 from the threepoint line they got to get a hand out there and contest as he can spread the floor that make Jay will left Carolina two of 13 from three in the second half theyve been one of 12 but boy did they need that one desperately onepoint game under two minutes to go how much fun has this been I mean come on I mean we have some of the best slate in the games of college basketball coming up this Saturday and the basketball gods are rewarding us with a treat tonight Carolina coming off a little bit of a struggle against Florida State pulling away late with RJ Davis and some of the heroics and then once again Georgia Tech is playing with a sense of urgency today you know playing up to the level of their competition and North Carolina trying to find an answer late in this ball game Georgia Tech faded in blackburg on Saturday ended up getting blown out they are taking the fight right to the very end in this one can they finish against number three angry him knocked it away and the ball hits behind the backboard its about the fourth time that I watch Nate George keep running towards the Baseline in these corners and as he gets older in the game of basketball he has to try to find a way to catch the ball in the middle of the floor when you run towards the corners the defense can use the sideline and the Baseline as an extra set of Defenders and it puts You In Harms Way last couple minutes you know have a review here to see who hit the ball thats Ingram goes thats off Ingram thats Georgia Tech Georgia Tech basketball Phil youre youre playing into North Carolina when you catch the ball in those positions thats where they want to trap you now this is giving the Georgia Tech staff an opportunity perhaps to draw up something to combat that because theyve had an adventure trying to get get the ball in North Carolina turned up the backboard pressure thats one heck of a staff there for Damen stomer over at Georgia Tech Carl Hobbs head coach at Washington for several years big time assistant twotime National Champion with Yukon and Jim Calhoun BJ Elder who played here as well bonsy Wells who played 10 plus years in the NBA and they are they are prep to do great things here in the future at Georgia Music Tech starting to make some inroads recruiting thats by building relationships moments like this they could somehow pull it off would be it now lets look at this Music again thats off North Carolina thats Georgia Tech ball after some consultation okay they were looking they were looking to see how much time was remaining to get the ball into the front court and they deemed it its 8 seconds left therell be 28 on the shot clock notice where the Press offense is setting up the old Digger Phelps method got to set it up higher outside the top of the key and thats where Georgia Techs lining up now also Claude and gari need to come back and be as well there you go B did just that that gets it into the front Applause court theyll get in the hands of their freshman point guard Nate George CL with a ball screen let say Advantage right there Harrison Ingram can switch that action stur it straight great defense by RJ Davis to knock it fre now Davis has the ball Carolina can take the lead inside 90 seconds to play Seth Trimble needs to get out of the way you clear out of side let him go to work they caught running out Davis the back to Armando kind of out of his shooting range Ingram to three front of the rim no good George with the rebound throw his quality possession for North Carolina Ingram with a wide open threepoint shot good as Ingrams been he struggled from the floor tonight just three of 14 guard gantan possession for the jacket I would get Bott in the pick and roll not Harrison Ingram George little space tough shot hand on it by Claude RJ Davis beats everybody to the ball uses the body and puts the heels on top Music Applause are you kidding me RJ Davis he hunts down the 5050 ball right here now look gar there he bangs into him first throws him off balance thats what smaller guards do to bigger players thats a big time veteran Savvy move by a guard that is ruing his team to a onepoint lead and their first lead Jay since they were up 5251 going for their 11th straight win trying to remain perfect in ACC play with Duke looming in Chapel Hill this weekend I mean and RD I get it whenever you watch Zach Ed play he is dominant he is a force within itself but the most dynamic guard in college basketball that is RJ Davis he is doing the little thing it was a strip it was a 5050 ball it was backto back plays at The Rim but there knocking down shots his leadership is whats putting North Carolina in this position and now Georgia Tech down by one with the ball 346 to go what do you think were going to see from Damon stmy team if Armando Bott is on the court I am having the ball in cerent hands I am putting him in a pick and roll at the top of the key Im going to make Armando Bott guard the likes a cerent whos been hot this entire game Im not going to call Harrison Ingram to a ball screen he can switch that Music action G gantan possession first year St Meers the head coach an opportunity to establish how things are going to be when you come to Atlanta theyve already beaten Duke theyve got a chance against North Carolina ranked third in the country but the jackets havent scored in the last 253 n we said a lot of the games for the yellow jackets came down to those eightpoint losses where those critical junctures could have gone either way this is game time right now I will not go with this matchup though the Freshman Nate George guarded by RJ Davis hold it about a 4 second differential payot in this High picking roll now the shot clock at five George drives goes in scores tcks on top 77 Hubert Davis wants a timeout 46 to go how about the Freshman from Toronto Nathan George the kid is I in his veins Rd I said it you get Bott out in the pick and roll it kind of exposes their defense it puts him in a situation where he has to guard a dynamic guard and what a shot with the left hand softly off the glass off the left foot Rd the degree of difficulty is a 10 an excellent call by you a grow B cut its paid off and now Georgia Tech which has lost eight of its last nine games One Stop away from beating the third ranked team in the country you got to get quick action if youre Huber Davis in the tar Hills maybe a little pin down into RJ catching the ball into a pick and roll I would almost use RJ as a decoy Georgia Tech is going to be all over RJ its going to allow a guy like Harrison Ingram to make a play at The Rim you do not need a three youre in the youre in the bonus you need to attack the rim look for Harrison Ingram Ingram as weve said has struggled from the Flor tonight just three of 14 if they do indeed go to him and he has a chance at the play this last one will be the only one that matters and theyre putting Miles Kelly whos 66 on the likes of RJ Davis whos 61 trying to use that length to deter a contestant he shot Seth Trimble will inbound the ball gets it to Bott handing it to RJ Davis Davis for the lead the ti its over he got fouled did they call the foul no there a no call no call
