Florida State 9 and 23 one season ago Kenesaw stayed 269 ason Champions they raised the banner earlier this week after a 9346 demolition of Oakwood The Vibes are high for Kennesaw State in those owls Florida State trying to rebound Deon Robinson wins the tip welcome back college Music basketball its Terrell bur who has the basketball here on the drive deflected out of bounds hes joined by seon CLE can really shoot it zamon Robinson one of the best players in the Aon Jamal King and Frank Juan Sherman and that play right there AR is where the seminal will cause the owls trouble all night there have Elite length with their guards look for them to intercept passing Lanes all night here is Simeon cudle rotated around three ball in the air quickly no good rebound long Beyond The Arc is to the owls second chance opportunity something that was a key for Antoine pway turning the ball over was a key for Leonard Hamilton those want to run they do this well here is Cam Corin flips it up in NOS strike first here in tally Elite scoring on the outside for either team but cam corins another name to watch tonight he could have a big game if he ass served himself early down low on the other end Stripped Away here come the NES Miller on the push warley quickly hacked to cross the arm hell head to the line for two were running and gunning already but heres cam Corin backing down his man found a lot of success down in the paint but also a big man that can stretch it and shoot from the perimeter ble Jr from Philadelphia really good assist to turnover ratios one year ago a former top 50 recruit knocks down the first Florida State leads by Music three second one good as well Florida State last season 7 and 13 in the ACC one of the worst defensive teams in the conference theyre hoping like Alex said that depth allows them to play full length into the shot clock and be able to refresh those legs you get back into the coach Hamilton system where guys can give their all for four minutes and bring on three to four guys at a time on the drive the follow and the flush how about toan Robinson another guy maybe an ason snub last the season a great season a year ago for the hour first all time at Kennesaw State in field goal percentage he holds that School record four to2 early action from Tallahassee warley trying to take burn inside the basket is good and the foul hooping a harm for warley whos aggressive early really what you want to see from Jaylen Worley attacking the basket has started develop the threepoint shooting but getting downhill putting his shoulder into the def good body control gets the Music bucket four early points for warley misses that one now the owls want to run buron can really scoop on the drive oh the flush Frank Juan Sherman oh my goodness Sherman the Applause Freshman little energizing boost there for Antoine pway owl six to four noes trying to respond Miller three rattles out rebound to Music Cle on the attack ball nearly stolen away and you see warley again intercepting the passing Lanes but first lets take a look that slam Frank Juan Sherman my goodness with the left Music hand but you see the kenoff state owls want to run theyre going to grab a rebound get an inbound and look to get it up the floor with Applause Pace three ball rattles out now Florida State leading by two heres Watkins the VCU transfer to the Spaniard Miller Miller has that versatility you see the mismatch foul on the floor that is already the 1 foul on Tenn State something to keep an eye on owls calling thinking Baba might have wrapped his arm around the defender looking for Florida State go three against Kennesaw State but thats what you cannot get into his foul trouble fou was given to Sherman who had that flush and an aggressive dunk on the other end kenisa State last season first time they made the NCAA tournament nearly beat Xavier a game that went down to the wire green Jr can really shoot it and he buries the three thats what he does best number 300 for Darren Green in his career one of the best in the country oh Corin said no way in transition Watkins picked up his dribble turnover and now maybe the owls can run pass too hot for Sherman Ario were 3 minutes in this game is high flying high Pace both of these teams are so similar in that regard love to get out and run and that man loves to get out and shoot and how about the block from Corin aggression at The Rim by the way shout out to Darren Green Jr career number 300 on triples again one of the best Shooters in the country Darren Green Jr told us earlier this week I played so many minutes last season I feel like this year with the extra depth I can be a little bit better a little bit more efficient how about that block what a play by King in the corner swung around King now wants a three of his own no good offensive rebound stick back count it that is Ron G Jordan thats a key to watch tonight whoever can win the battle on the glass Florida state was a problem last year losing the battle on the offensive glass ow try to capitalize Cor in good positioning could not finish with the little hook the turnaround three offensive rebounds already for tenness saw state buron three ball no good into the hands of a teammate green saves it out of bounds Florida State leading by three under 16minute Mark now of the first half heres green Jr already has one dribble pull up Jay midrange bang silky Darren Green getting his Defender to hesitate hit him from three can hit him from the midrange as Music well on the drive the other way buron cant finish through contact on the other end three ball nope green doesnt shoot it now one dribble fire off to the right and the rebound to kenisa State heres Burton one of the best players in the Atlantic Sun a season ago foul calls itll take a to our firstmedia timeout while Florida State leads by five Darren Green Jr the pullup J as sweet as it gets rahee taking the owls to many first first division one NCA tournament appearance first Conference Championship first regular season Championship Jack thats a program thats on the rise and Antoine pway has the keys to a Ferrari he has the keys of Ferrari is right and hes the man to do it as you said hes got all the pieces and play and Im excited to see what happens with him this season theres no reason that Anton pway cant be successful in the Atlanta area for more on his arrival we welcome back Alex guys we talked to Coach pway about how did you inherit this team how do you get these guys bought in after such a successful season and he said I just wanted to get to know my guys I just wanted to make sure that they knew that I cared about them as much off the basketball court as I do on the basketball court he spent time with them he heard about their life went into the deeper stuff he wants them to be the guys that are with him to thick and thin he wants to be at their weddings one day hes done a fantastic job buying these guys in and getting that culture in place and that culture is so key leaning on guys like deont Robinson Terrell Burton I mean Jack those are two players two of the top three returning scorers are back two of the best players in the a sun and the coaches voted this offseason that Terrell Burton is the player they all fear the most and youll see it tonight his hand through the lane and ability to create for his teammates hes got that quick first step and Dean Robinson again another Aaron green got two freebies going to try and confirm if that was a technical foul that was issued before the media Music timeout believe that to be the case Florida state gets two free throws out of it green connects and now it will be Kennesaw State basketball great pressure defense on the out of bounds play by FSU leads to a timeout you go back to kesa State ARA I think one of the key things that we all saw in talking with Anton pway this week is the authenticity that he brings and thats what he brings to the entire kenesa State program that team and you can sense it with their players as well simal leading by seven here Music Music sir 136 Florida State leads 1523 Mark here NOS have been active on the defensive end Chandler Jackson did not play in the exhibitions battling an injury this summer as well in there the Christian Brothers Academy product now a foul burden clipped by Josh nickelberry the transfer from laau a 10 Sixth Man of the Year yeah both of those names are exciting for the semal Chandler Jackson just a bulldog at that point position can do it all offensively and defensively and nickelberry from behind the arc can shoot with anyone couple of new looks at some new NOS Deontay green as well Cameron Fletcher Taylor bbo a nice running floater there by number five seon cdle 62 sophomore from College Park Georgia South side of Atlanta cattle got his first start of the season last week versus Oakwood hes playing with so much confidence you can see it that his career high a few days ago here is Taylor B bow and a top 100 recruit for Florida State long and lengthy athletic now Fletcher back from an injury a seiz in to go not able to connect from that deep ball there bbo and long arms the rebound oh but he went out of bounds oh looked like a good hustle play from B Bowen just unfortunate for the Freshman to step on the line but how about CLE cool Comon collected right past his Defender makes it look Music easy and see on coddle an outstanding first game in Atlanta on Tuesday Alex what you got well we talked about how coach got his players bought in he said Simeon coddle is one of those guys that just has infectious energy hes one of the main guys that helped the other guys acclimate to a new coach and Coach is just so thankful they have a guy like him they fired off a three there Alex could not connect in the traveling violation on number 25 Ron G Gordon and you saw flashes with CLE a season ago had seven points in six minutes and Kennesaw States lost to Xavier in the tournament and then comes out against Oakwood firing an all cylinder 16 points for the sophomore nickelberry goes down tripped up no call out of bounds turnover great pressure defense there by kennol state yeah kennol State starting to settle in a little bit we saw that first 3 to four minutes of the game a lot more fastpac High Tempo kenesa State wants to play in transition in this half court is where they can cause some problems with Florida States length on the defensive ENT RJ Johnson oh blocked out of bounds by Deontay green 69 sophomore from Ashville North Carolina Florida State protecting the rim well so far in the first half and thats going to be a big question for the seminal no jayen gain still working his way back from an injury but bolon green and camc corn are going to have to step up underneath and be Rim protectors for the seminal cdle off the dribble great defense from Fletcher CLE shot no good rebound at the free throw line by nickelberry Seals want to run nickelberry three in the air no good rebound two lot of bodies hitting the floor jump ball coming possession arrow staying with Florida State how about the energy so far in this building yeah the energy in the tuck has been great for both sides but thats a big play right there Arya for the semal already six offensive rebounds for the owls thats the first for Florida State theyre going to have to win that battle theyre going to stay ahead in this Music game Jackson working against Johnson went 49 in one in high school a state finals Mr Tennessee the floater not going to fall long rebound to Burton and then a foul call on Taylor B Bowen B Bowen just trying to stop and slow down the break you see Terrell bur and gets the ball hits the Jets hes looking to send it the other way right away Applause already Florida State Jack has played 10 guys back to that old depth they can go 12 deep when theyre at their best yeah coach Hams got to be happy thats what we said prior they can play guys for 3 to four minutes at Max Capacity they can give all the effort and really put teens on their heels theyre forcing turnovers early in this game leading by five Fletcher on the leaner that rims out rebound to the owes Adam mccoya ripping it down now what can Kennesaw State do to respond you see those long arms that ball pressure from Florida State causing a lot of issues thats where itll be trouble for the owls in this half court Florida State crate in this manto man defense makes it almost look like the Zone foul calls on Florida State Music de itll be on Deontay green his first Florida States team fourth Music foul buron played just 10 minutes in the season opener scoring six points against Oakwood battling a bit of an injury on the scoop and the score thats pretty that is Terrell burden for you right there so crafty with the ball in his hand splits the defender Scoops it up and in Burton top 10 in kennes State history for points in the career nickelberry firing a three and connecting thats what the transfer does well at six games a season ago with six plus threepointers he can shoot it with just about anyone from threepoint land pull up jumper for the response is good nice looking stroke there from Adam mccoa Adam mccoya another one coach pway said to look out for this season pretty feed inside green too strong and hell have one more beautiful feed inside Chandler Jackson Florida State happy to have him back Terrell buron making it happen 7 Florida State leading Kennesaw State by six here 1125 to play a Kennesaw State team fresh off their first ever ason regular season Conference tournament championships making the NCA tournament picked second by the media for this years preseason picks it willll be a fun team to watch Under head coach Antoine pway you see some similari with pway and where he came in Alabama Under head coach Nate oats an offense in Alabama thats been fueled by transition Alabama the Crimson TI theyve consistently been in the top ranks in the country in terms of tempo on the offensive end youve already seen it here tonight the owls like to get out and run and the best part with head coach Antoine pway he gives the green light to his Shooters you see theres no no ones afraid to let a shot go drive to The Cup draw some Applause fouls green on the Miss CLE looking for the alley just a little too heavy its been active energy here for Kennesaw State thats going to belong to FSU but I look at the rebounding margin right now plus eight for Kennesaw State they have six offensive rebounds Florida state has seven total rebounds thats one of the keys right there kenol State winning that battle on the glass and especially those Second Chance points its a good rebounding Kena State team Miller warley taking burton all the way to the rack missed the Finish Corin all in the follow not able to connect through some contact and then warley guilty of a foul running into Burton talk about that rebounding margin 64 rebounds by this kennes saw State team on Tuesday night and that set a program record not too bad 64 rebounds already off to a hot start tonight but fortunate for Florida State losing that battle still up early green Jr has seven points to lead FSU six different players for Kennesaw State with two points a piece now heres Bon so quick with it high off the glass no good rebound to Cory likes to switch everything Baba Miller right on bird and well take it the other way Watkins a star in the two exhibition games for Florida State last week to Darren Green Jr who connects on the midrange J great to see Darren Green Jr coming out three of four from the field shooting well Applause CLE against Miller rotated around heres buron now Adam mccoya off to the right long rebound this time brought down by Watkins hes fouled by CLE that is the sixth team foul on chanisa state heres Darren Green doing what he does best has such a dangerous threepoint shooter as he is keeps defender on his heels able to get that first step past him pull up for the midrange something he was working on in the offseason Darren Green becoming more efficient off the dribble off the bounce hes known for prolific shooting from Deep you mentioned it ARA 34 minutes a game a season ago for green now this year limit those minutes a little bit more but create more opportunities hope to even raise that percentage as the season goes on Watkins connects now Corin in transition py play by Burton to rip it down what does Watkins bring to the table for Florida State Shamir Watkins is a forward that can play guard hes got that point forward tendency Elite length as well he played a little point guard in the exhibition match for Florida State versus Basta State hes a Swiss Army night really play everywhere on the court you see his numbers a season ago at VCU a great addition for the seminars VCU team that made it back to the NCAA tournament going 27 and8 Watkins choosing floorida St over the summer Miller tes up a three in and out rebounds King snatches it out of the sky now a cudle hes not shy and he buries theres the green light in the confidence no hesitation Simeon cadle says why not four of them against Oakwood on Tuesday night for Cle cuts that lead to seven not before Baba Miller on a pretty turnaround a stoppage of play looks like Jamie lucky is telling an Antoine pwes bench its a warning it seems already been teched in this game has been Kennesaw State just shows the energy though thats what they want to play with this whole Kenesaw State roster you see it already bringing the energy the passion and a lot of fight these owls got Johnson CLE Five Points already cudle trying to show off the strength in the air cant connect foul on the rebounds and now the NOS will be at the charity stripe into the Bonus Goes Florida State for the one and one thats big for Florida State only already 8 minutes remaining in this first half nolles in the Music bonus part what makes Florida State so great over the years has been creating turnovers last season it dipped middle of the pack in the ACC at forcing turnovers already seven forced turnovers have turned into four points for FSU but youre seeing them limit possessions for Kennesaw State yeah coach H must have been happy even in their exhibition match forcing over 20 turnovers then now tonight it just shows that length and how they play defense def they switch on everything its that junkyard defense theyre going to get after you theyre going to get after the ball and make it hard for teams to press green splits the free throws SNS by 10 three ball in the air for Robinson no good another offensive rebound stick back not there rebound to Watkins now the forward wants to push Watkins the red shirt Junior from Trenton New Jersey one of the best players in the state of New Jersey Miller shuffled his feet no call threw some contact as well now a foul will that be on FSU it will itll be on Baba Music Applause Music Miller Baba Miller trying to back down into the post is what he can do well good play RJ Johnson just getting a hand in making it hard for the sophomore Spaniard making him uncomfortable down low the owles will take it the other way Tena State seven turnovers shooting just 29 from floor Florida States done a pretty good job defensively so far in this first half again the owls who scored 93 points on Tuesday night against Oakwood as CLE got hung up in the air now Gordon working against Miller Robinson righty hook counted its a good little move from Deon Robinson man has done a lot of work in the off season to expand his game now becoming a perimeter shooter as well two threes against Oakwood but also can showcase it down low where he found a lot of success a season ago dropped 30 lbs this off seon as that ball scoots out of bounds turnover on FSU intended for Corin and its 2517 seals shooting decently well early Tenn OFA State trailing by a Jun has been heating up so far in the first half hes got 10 points Jack and he has shown all three levels so far tonight hes thr all shown all three levels is right this is a guy that shot 38 from behind The Arc in his career as those minutes come down hes got guys creating space for him hes going to get better quality shots and that percentage is even going to get even better and the seals are going to be relying on green proficiency from Deep for more on the Sharpshooter heres Alex guys guys we know how competitive the ACC can be but Darren Green was one of three players in this conference with 90 or more three points pointers last year when he learned that stat he said that he was surprised by it you know he knew that he had to come in and play all the time but he didnt realize that it was to that level now this year hes excited to be able to share the work but hes very confident in his shot in his fifth year of college basketball the only thing he hasnt done is made it to the NCAA tournament and he is hopeful for that this season his head coach Leonard Hamilton said of Darren sees Orange He has the green light to fire it away thats what hes on this court to do just to hit from Deep hes always got the green light for Darren Green Jr Darren Green career high of 30 points against St Johns last season in the Orange Bowl classic transferred from UCF so he leads all scores with 10 nlls by eight activity level on defense has been through the roof from FSU having the depth to be able to run the type of Defense a Leonard Hamilton team wants to run you can see it causing problems for a Kennesaw State team that wants to get to the back and then she threes on the other end how about nickelberry showing the Finish let him know after two M Robinson straight up and nickelberry what a finish seal re extend the lead by 10 on the other end the three ball up in the air no Robinson offensive rebound fouled on the floor that is the seventh team foul on FSU now both teams in the bonus Josh nickel Bear right to the cup look at the body control in the air to hang just for a second and up off the glass good play from the transfer points out ARA Kennesaw State one of 10 from behind the arkc with 36 versus Oakwood thats what head coach Antoine pway says he likes his team to be able to shoot the three have the confidence its hard to stay in the game when youre one of 10 so Music far Anan pway going to be relying on on Deon Robinson to get his team back in the ball game the former Murray State Music racer famous Alum johnar of course Robinson comes in thinking that he could be one of the most dominant players not just in his conference but in the country and you see the size 69 235 we mentioned hes dropped 30 lbs trying to get in better shape and he said look I feel great the the lighter we has had me moving at a level Ive never done before yeah he feels great and he looks great you said it he can move so differently now and allows him to stretch his game out of the perimeter and it makes it so much harder to defend him when you know hes not just going to be in the post he can also back you out and shoot it from behind the ark six points for rebounds now green light Darren Green cant make it tried to race it down noes do get a second chance now Fletcher how about that move on the Baseline Drive well first thats what you want to see from Darren Green following your shot this the bases but Cameron Fletcher seemed like he was just starting to come on last season as he got injured big bucket Another Second Chance coming now for kenis aate heres Robinson Johnson fires airball trying to throw it off of Darren Green JR could not do it was Gordon now Florida State can run in transition pass intended for house intercepted oneonone layup at The Rim count it for Music cuddle check that thats Johnson RJ Johnson The Freshman from Huntsville Alabama top 100 recruit a fourstar player as Corin responds yeah Johnson the number one player out of Alabama originally supposed to go to Alabama now coming with Coach pway to Kennesaw State you just look at him hes almost built like a running back in away but hes got the ability to get Above the Rim and also expand his game and shoot some threes as well that time it was coddle indeed on the floater eightpoint Advantage Johnson a big piece Fletcher firing a three that one Applause short foul called there for more on Johnson we bring back Alex guys I talked to Coach pway about what it took to recruit a guy like RJ John he said it was just the relationship he is what you see he wants you to be real with him they got really Titan thats where getting him was huge because he knew he was going to make such a difference for this Kennesaw State team now without a doubt you know what he did he punctuated it with a top 10 sports center dunk on Tuesday night number six when ow fans woke up on Wednesday morning i say its a pretty good way to start your career entering in the top 10 on ESPN in the next day with a slam I love that especially which Alex just said hes a no ego player he just wants to learn in get better thats the type of player coach pway wants to have and the culture that he wants to build that one missed the mark by a long shot the Lefty trigger by Adam mccoya house the birthday boy a birthday fre its got to be better on your birthday right you can hear the PA announcer yell out its his birthday Tom house turning 20 years old hits his first shot attempts of the evening nice response by Johnson big response from Johnson starting to heat up a little bit is the Freshman simal offense has heated up as well five for their last seven from the floor Darren Green Jr count it and the foul all three of those for Darren Green Jr oh look at that shot daring green what he does best to see this high ball screen right there a little confusion from the owls trying to go underneath just creates a little bit of Separation thats all he needs enough for the Sharpshooter uncanny ability to let it fly from Beyond The Arc he has 13 to lead all scores the former UCF transfer looking for the fourpoint play could not connect how about Fletcher the activity on the o boards house another three time out Tena State happy birthday Tom house not one but two brother the sophomores teammates love Applause it tonight the tuck is his house and Florida State leading by 15 here as the timeout taken four five seminal Riding High here in the first leading by 15 been Darren Green whos connected on a couple the seminal have five so far on the evening Tom house a quick 60 run on his birthday nothing better on his birthday for Tom house but exactly what coach ham wants to see got more ball movement but also finding the open man theyre getting better shots better looks all around thats why five has been able to fall so far house who career high is nine points also in the season opener last season against Stetson when he hit three triples now just three shy of that Mark yeah the nolles have the length but they also have the perimeter shooting and Tom house Darren Green nickelberry and the list goes on so many different ways these seminal can score and stretch out a defense you can already see early on and it was one of the themes of the week Tom house the rest of his teammates we chatted with a couple of them the culture of this team the camaraderie much stronger than it was a season ago they all said were much closer we trust each other even more than we did they think thats going to help them getting back to Old School Florida state in the way that they love each other in the program absolutely I think what stood out the most to Aros when we got to check out their shoot around pregame and the energy that they brought especially from cam Fletcher whos going to be a veteran leader on this team this season every single player seemed like Smiles werent leaving their faces they were yelling they were all in it together how about house why not three triples blow out the Applause candles the tuck is rocking for house and quickly trying to silence was Johnson how strong is he to the rim I said it before how hes built hes able to put his shoulder down and go right into a Defender makes it so hard down the lane to get up and block that shot interior feed def Fletcher intercepted by Johnson on the feed swing pass active defense from Green gets the deflection out of Music bounds another look in transition Darren Green the same spot little Deja Vu for Tom house he likes that side already three now a career high again tying with those nine points must be something about season openers and hes going to get a lot of congratulations as he heads to the bench great Ovation Florida States already played 11 guys in this game so far feels far more vintage FSU that shot going to miss the mark short NOS want to run great Outlet pass Fletcher in the open court Lefty layup no good hes going to the line for two on the foul it was Johnson yeah you said vintage FSU playing 11 guys he getting out on the Run Cameron Fletcher able to get to the cup and draw a foul number 21 Cameron Fletcher sh Cameron Fletcher from St Louis began his career at Kentucky he has healed ever so quickly from a torn ACL against Virginia early December last season in about 8 months he was ready to rock and roll Fletcher said the hardest part has been just trusting that his knee was going to be okay he said look I feel 100 again I trust my skills I know Im a good basketball player its making sure that I trust that this knee has recovered fully yeah and I think hes slowly going to find that again I said it before those last couple games before he got injured it seems like he was really finding his stride and showing that cam Fletcher that was recruited to Kentucky now hes going to find it again for the seminal and again be a veteran leader in presence for Florida State started to improve his outside shot as well from Beyond The Ark you see that career timeline there for Cameron Fletcher a foul called on the floor again so the NS will hope to get Fletcher back up to basketball shape he looks to be in solid shape so far hes on the bench does have four points a rebound and assist already tonight yeah an incredible rebounder as well he excelled at that a season ago but already I said it in that shoot around it was cam Fletcher I dont think the smile left his face the entire time he was bringing the energy for the teammates you could really see him being a leader heres Terrell buron two points couple of assists knocks down the free throw buron the ason tney MVP last year hitting that gamewinning free throw to send Kennesaw State to the NCAA tournament for the first time in program history knocks them both down keeps kenesa state within Striking Distance latter stage of this first half its been all Florida State so far in the early stands up especially how they like to play and get out in transition they can change it over quick ball Bowen lines up a three that one rims in and out hit every piece of iron B Bowen another 610 freshman but has that ability to get out to the perimeter and shoot the three makes it hard to the men how about that jump ball forced by Chandler Jackson strong hands you see the build there from Jackson a boxy body knows how to use it well especially on the attack one of the better Defenders on this FSU team as well he got injured last year too missed a handful of games early had to play some games with a cast on his hand never really got into the flow of it until late in the season where he started having some big games yeah he just brings a presence a little different than a Jaylen Worley or Jamir Watkins with the length that they bring but its the energy defensive presence again for Chandler Jackson hes not going to lay off you hes going to be on at all times not just defensively but on the offensive end as well some people in this program believe he has some of the same traits that a Trent Forest once had here in Tallahassee Burton on that drive its bouncing around green able to save it before it goes out of bounds but its intercepted by the smallest guy on the court knocked into the seminal bench itll remain Owls basketball thats what you love to see from Terrell birden the hustle as you said already the ason tournament MVP a season to go and head coach pway said hes as good as any point guard I coach one of the best guards in the Ace on this season toddle attacks lay up no green clings the glass into the hands of Watkins pushed up ahead to Jackson Jackson flying in fouls must have been some body before the block from Gordon yeah the owls couldnt believe it Jackson going hard at him a little hand contact got him on the Music wrist CH shooting Jackson to the line for a couple of free throws 10 points in Florida States win at Miami last season that ended in that Matt Cleveland buzzer beating heave seven points nine assists shows off his ability to create for his teammates against Syracuse slate in the Music year yeah he can do it on both sides and again another player that brings it back to coach Hams system and the ability to run 10 11 12 guys at all times you look right now Florida state has Jackson and warley on the floor at the same time a unique look extra ball handling allowing Florida State to play small Gordon three ball he missed that by a ton oh my goodness B Bowen carals up ahead to warley in transition now Jackson had an ocean to shoot now to B Applause Bowen a talented freshman to a sophomore and over to orley 15 on that shot clock Jackson calls his own number for three left at Short rebound Robinson his sixth rebound of the game and CLE step back Jay is pure from Beyond The Ark theres that confidence takes it up himself rest of his teammates back down the floor decides to take a little step back swish hes in double figures now with 10 points a pair of triples two of 15 from three are the out Watkins that wont fall grabs his own Miss floater that one also short a third opportunity and Jacksons three rims out lots of sem crashing the glass foul cold itll be a one and one for King on the other end love to see the hustle from either side but how about Simeon Cado little fake hesitation step back straight through the net seon coddle the Energizer Bunny Puris head coach Antoine P white we asked him earlier this morning we said hey whats your role on this team he said I bring energy and I Get Buckets certainly got a bucket right there and this is a guy that scored 51 points in a high school game with no free throws whatsoever he is a guy that can score on all levels and to pair him up now with a Terrell burden with the confidence that hes playing with itll be deadly for the owls down the road and so at the line itll be Jamal King the 67 Junior transfer from West Music Virginia had a nice debut on Tuesday night with 13 against Oakwood for these kenesa State owls he knocks down the Music Applause Music first king another one of those transfers thatll be key for Antoine pway this season cool story with them too he played pway played with kings uncle at Alabama when they played in the early 2000s Irwin Dudley was the SEC player of the year the best man at his wedding and now gets his nephew on his team in Kennesaw pway wants a stop to try and end this half for Kennesaw State this has been a frenetic Pace we are on track for over 80 possessions in this B basketball game not surprising with what Florida State wants to do in Antoine pway being a disciple of Nate oats warley with five on the shot clock green with three green with two buzzer beating he and he buries it a dagger in the owls Hearts it was a technical foul just called on Kennesaw State as well no it was not just a timeout Roger a is pointed at a Kennesaw State player itll be just a 30C timeout with FSU leading by 15 simal sound revving up the fans here in Tallahassee Florida State shooting 50 from the floor so far leading by 15 Jack so far the NES theyve impressed here in the first 20 minutes yeah shooting well and again as weve been saying this entire half getting back to Vintage Florida State style basketball pushing the tempo most importantly def defense that creates offense theyre getting in the passing Lane and in turn getting down to the other end and getting some buckets shot clock is off buron with three right at the end of the half loses the basketball with one second out of bounds it belongs to Florida State s on the clock Burton calling for the fouls what he does hes slicing and dicing through the lane cutting through Defenders just a little too much not able to keep control just under a second for Florida State BB into warley not enough time to let her rip came oh so close wouldnt have counted and at the half Florida State leading kenesa state by 15 Jack the Music Applause NS Leonard Hamilton told us earlier this week he thought this could be one of his better perimeter shooting teams that hes had in a few years hes had the number of options we have that that can beat you from Beyond The Arc has increased with some of the additions back door cut warley half foot on the line turnover for Florida State right out of the Music gate and Coach Hams got to be happy 35 so far from behind the arc really are they just getting better looks not forcing shots when they have guys to rotate in feel like you give your all for those couple minutes curious as to what kennes saw State might do to make some adjustments for more on Antoine pway thoughts at halftime heres Alex guys we guys I spoke with I spoke with Coach antoon pway coming out of the locker room and I asked him what his thoughts were he said that he felt that the team came out with great energy at first but then the size and length and strength of Florida State started getting to them so now he just wants this team to make better shot selections and control the possession with they have it and on defense he wants it manto man he wants it to be tight and intense as its been the whole time so hes pleased with that he just wants it to stay focused yeah defensively going to be the key no doubt for Kennesaw State they left green Jr open for three and he made them pay yet again another Bullseye from Beyond the orc yeah theres one man you cant leave open its Darren Green he showed it time and time again tonight again thats the open looks that Florida state is creating by getting back to their offense getting back to the scheme that they want to run Darren Green now over 300 made threes in his career hes got three more tonight adding to that Mark here he is 22 on his back Miller has been quiet so far Baba Miller turning Lefty low couldnt finish on the finger roll attempt it was knocked out of bounds itll stay with FSU Baba millery unique Prospect help Spain to a 9 F World Cup Championship this summer 11 points in the title game against France and its a guy again who hadnt been a seminal consistently especially last season had to miss the first 16 games he said its been a huge difference for him this year yeah its hard to get acclimated when youre missing half the season obviously still practicing but getting up to game speed now Baba get as you said Arya gets that experience again over the summer and comes out tonight only three shots he said hes been quiet but hes got that build the NBA tendencies as well the length I mean he stretches the floor just with his shooting hes going to be special this year for Florida State heres warley on the turn theyre not going to count the basket on the floor says Roger Music aers he said it was uh a dream come true for him did Bobba Miller about winning the u19 World Cup with Spain and youre seeing that International flare come into the NBA more and more we asked him give us your top players in the NBA he said you got to go Nicole yic first and Luca and Giannis those were his top three Watkins shot rattles Music Applause out how about the ball pressure from warley 90 ft from the basket thats Florida stay basketball for you right there Sherman three ball two strong rebound Miller this third rebound of the night calls his own number and leaves it long last touch though by King itll stay with FSU thats what you got to love to see from your 61 forward be able to grab the rebound push it the length of the floor and attempt to step back three thats a shot that he can make as well we said a unicorn of a prospect still developing all the intangibles to take it to the next Music level Florida State shooting 47 from the floor Corin from the feed from Watkins connects there from about free for Line logo area cam Corin was thrown into the fire last season for Florida State maybe before he was ready but he gained valuable minutes because of it yeah became the fulltime Center by December was not expected to play that roll so early that you said it ARA thats how you grow as a freshman getting that experience early on is paying dividends already this year like to FSU causing problems green misses the three thats a great look Florida State transitioning from defense to offense now buron one of the quickest players in the a sun left that short warley grabs the board and uh tumbles down foul called thatll be on 25 its a gets the arm in as Barleys trying to Coral that rebound but thats kenas state in a nutshell getting it in transition attacking the basket their best Shooters will spread to the corners and spread out theyll look to kick it out and make the three its just unfortunate for the owls tonight two of 16 from behind the Ark last season that was Florida States enemy for a lot of the season and as warley was looking for Miller not on the same page not enough in sync on the pass either a foul now called on Miller but the seminal in ACC play Team shot better than 40 from Beyond The Arc against the nles thats tough not much you can do when teams are shooting that well but youve seen a a change in this second half a little more pressure full court pressure from the seminal coach ham said it to Alex right before halftime that thats what theyre doing theyre driving downhill theyre trying to push it seal trying to to limit that pace and Tempo just a bit Johnson took warley inside and the seminal guard guilty of the foul Johnson playing Bully ball all night havent seen him much from threepoint landan but attacking the glass using his body to his advantage Johnson cant connect on the free throw but he did connect here Jack this is a hammer how about that RJ Johnson your first game has an owl in front of the home crowd shows it off its got to be a good feeling waking up the next morning and seeing your number six in top 10 miss both free throws Nolls by 20 in control here in the second half warley so Corin warley on the Drive hammered by Johnson it will be a shooting foul and so warley back to the line seems like Jaylen warley has been in control of the seminal offense here tonight has really had a good grip on the game had a really good grip on the game and you saw flashes of it last year started the season off really well not turning the ball over kind of changed as the season went along but again a candidate to break out in the ACC he had the lane from a point guards perspective but Florida State got a lot of guards they can rotate in Sub in so having jayen Worley step up and play that pick and warar game especially see it right there assist to turnover seventh in the ACC this is a guy coming out of high school played with Derek Lively one of the top prospects now in the NBA ran that pick and roll game seals like to do that a lot offensively trying to force the turnover here long deflections long arms Miller a timeout called by Tenn OFA State Robinson was able to save his teammate there so well take a break as well Florida State leading Kennesaw State by Music 22 and so on pway down 22 tonight but part of his resume part of his pedigree is being one of the best Recruiters in the country was the recruiting coordinator for Nate oats at Alabama and pulled in some of the best players in the country and some of the top recruiting class as you see this turnaround that hes had to have new coaches coming in a couple players go with Abdul Raheem 2 USF but he did keep a couple of big names as well as at a number 61 ranked recruiting class which is the best ever at kennes State I mean its pretty incredible and impressive to do that in your first season at a program you said the expectations are still high in Kennesaw under coach pway brought in a lot of good names and you said it as well Arya and his time in Alabama he was responsible for bringing in some of the biggest names in the college game and many guys that are playing in the NBA today his paths crossed with Leonard Hamilton at Florida State a couple of times on the recruiting Trail for more on that we welcome back Alex guys we did talk to him about that earlier this week we said pway what is your experience with Coach Leonard Hamilton he said Ive only seen him on a road a couple times I know weve been in recruiting battles when he was at Alabama coach Hamilton here at FSU pway said he never won but hes so honored to be across from the sideline from his tonight he is a legendary dude in the words of pway he said that hes an outstanding person and the things hes done to in coaching is second and none so hes excited to be here today in Florida States house yeah without a doubt said after Cs layup by the way said he battled a lot with Dennis Gates see why Charlton young for Florida State couple of assistants who are now over at missou as Miller buries the three from that corner now theres Johnson on the flush oh baby wow RJ Johnson again showing off that strength at The Rim shades of a sports center top 10 yam from earlier in the week some fireworks now here in tally early portion of this second half Watkins wants another three that one short and the rebound to Kenesaw state Florida States hit eight triples so far in this game shooting nearly 40 from Beyond The Arc Gordon not able to to bury that one from Beyond The Arc and now FSU will slow things down slow things down indeed leading by 21 points no reason to push settle into your offense and as coach ham has insisted moved the ball around find the open man heres Watkins turning facing finds Corin easy Applause Music to Now quickly turned back over thats what you want to see jir Watkins on that previous possession he said hes listed as a forward but playing a good amount of point guard early on for Florida State and for him to Able be able to do that and fill in that role be important for the seminal down the road now Watkins turning Al and Miller knew exactly what to do with it bringing it down theres Baba starting to wake up in this second half couple of buckets in a dunk yeah Florida States defense the activity has been so energetic here in the second half now getting the Kennesaw State Defense to collapse leaving Baba open on the back door showing off some emotion and so Miller energizes the crowd here in Tallahassee Florida State seminal leading by 25 an FSU team again they went 9 and 23 last season after making four consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament theyve missed the last two a team that not too long made the Elite 8 and sweet 16 and backtoback Seasons sandwich in between that Jack its a program that won the ACC regular season Championship many people believing depending on who you ask some swear by it did that 2020 Co year FSU was making a final for a lot swear by especially here in Tallahassee but when you got a coach with the pedigree of leard Hamilton anything is possible thats for sure and as weve mentioned time and time again tonight having those 11 to 12 guys to be able to run the rotations and get back to Vintage Florida State basketball I think tonight may be a taste for nolles fans of whats to come this season nice pass nickelberry wide open barries a three thats what hes there to do knock down threes 40 shooter a year ago at lowl the A10 Sixth Man of the Year and thats the ninth three of the game for Florida State tonight yeah two for three for nickelberry tonight efficient score and a great addition to come off the bench B bow and wants one himself oh nearly bricked it but hes going to claim that was a pass to cam Fletcher on the foot back how about the h from Fletcher saying he threw it off and he jack will get rewarded for the hustle how to look b b and the Freshman getting up making it happen on one end and on the other side cam Fletcher sneaking around but how about the three Josh nickelberry Florida State much healthier than they were a season ago but that doesnt mean that theyre not without some issues this season Jaylen gain he still trying to work his way back from tearing his ACL last October in the preseason as B Bowen you see what makes him so talented long lengthy athletic he moves so well about 610 Euro stepping on the Baseline you said it Arya he moves so well theres a reason why he was a top 100 recruit he moves like a guard you saw it right there and well see it again just picks up the rebound little whoop right underneath bu Bowen another good pickup he like to see the reaction from the bench his first points of his seminal career on that drive a whistle was there a technical foul issued Music here yes indeed kenesa State a technical foul assess so nickelberry will get a pair of free throws cant make the Applause first was told earlier that the technical was given against rangi Gordon for ranji he came in the first half after he said something to Roger aers this Applause technical this one given to and pway the head coach so Roger rers just came over to tell us second technical given in this game to Kennesaw State so Rie Gordon earlier in the first half and now Antoine pway some frustrations and energy shown from the owls but a lot of thats just the passion they know the capabilities they can play to how about the level Florida state has turned up a notch on here in the second half he brought the energy I think we saw it in shoot around they were confident showing off and Jack this is shades of a Florida State team from a few seasons ago I guess we now have a look on the foul go back to the line you see it after with Fletcher up big still working still Music hustling Fletchers just been doing the little things all night no struggling from the free throw line here tonight maybe one area that you can nitpick big block but a foul called on green Deontay green it has been a 130 run for FSU to blow this thing open and the owls are hoping maybe with a free throw to snap a near fourminute scoring Music drought Jack doesnt this kind of feel like its FL to state of old and it looks it it definitely does the energy building inside the tuck I mean its one game is one game by no means is this the toughest opponent of the Season by no means is anyone claiming Florida stay back but especially this is far more the DNA of the way Leonard Hamilton has played in the past and especially how they started last season expectations still were high it was a slow start some surprising losses but now to come out firing on all cylinders only one score Darren Green Jr in double figures so they spread the ball around hasnt just been one person Fletcher calls his own number that rims out from Beyond The Ark good look there for Fletcher as Bowen a blaze down the middle of the lane hes fouled he goes down hard thats been the theme all night though Kennesaw State wants to get downhill pack the basket but check out 1 two three Florida State Defenders around making it difficult for Burton to get up and get a bucket and thatll take us to a immedia timeout here in Tallahasse the NOS leading right before conference play starts when the Nolls play Carolina in that early December game that could be a big difference leard Hamilton told me earlier today look if we get him back we have a rim protector right now we dont necessarily have that prototypical FSU rim protector but gy the former ivy league defensive player of the year he means so much the maturity the body the defensive IQ and the leadership that he brings to the table the NOS havent had a chance to enjoy for two seasons oh yeah I mean he really fits the build does gy when you take a look at him and hes a guy that showed it off in the ivy league but its been fortunate the seminal tonight theyve had mulp guys converging on the paint and that person thats going down and attacking the basket making it hard they got five blocks on the night but again get picking up a guy like Jaylen gy adding it to cam Corin and Deontay green and the development of Taylor bllb and future is bright in Music Tallahasse now Jackson and Fletcher nickelberry screen set nos running some action green big body down low nice move with the left hand that rims out Fletcher the energy the activity on the glass keeps it with FSU how much did FSU miss Cameron Fletcher a season ago oh a lot you see in the hustle just throughout the last couple of minutes hes making his presence known again hes doing all the little things hes hustling rebounding finding his teammates its what he does off the ball cam Fletcher that makes him special told us earlier this week look I felt like I was getting to be the best version of myself right before the injury hit that was the most disappointing part yowls down the other way three ball right wing no good rebound B bow in the long arms of the Freshman hes a great story as well was born in a refugee camp in Egypt his parents escaping from the second Civil War in sedan was taken in by a family in Vermont him and his two siblings as green connects there but now B Bowen a brighter future and maybe a bright fask basketball career as well CLE on the attack oh green called for a foul yeah really incredible story is Taylor bull Bowen living up in Vermont he grew up ice skating and in the snow but he says he likes the warm a little bit more so Tallahasse been a good fit for him thus far and hell be a good player for Coach ham random stats that are wonderful that Chuck Walsh finds his hometown in Vermont is the first place that the first known picture of a snowflake was ever taken its pretty cool things you would never even care to look up but Chuck Walsh got the job done hes the man as he always does and so if nothing else Taylor bu ban has that he does the good news is hes really good at basketball he is pretty good at basketball I would definitely say say that and again just so typical to a lot of the prospects that coach Hamilton brings to Tallahassee just crazy length in guys that dont play like they should for their position now Florida sts highest rank recruit brought in this season the NOS forcing turnovers 15 of them coach ham said thats scario weve got to get back to so you got to create off the dribble offensively share the basketball we a work in progress in that area a late foul called on the Drive Kennesaw States going to get a couple of shots yeah look at cam Corin for the foul C Robinson was asking for that after the play be two free throws for the senior Music Qui night for Robinson 6 points n rebounds two of seven from the floor the nolles have done a really nice job of neutralizing him hes got a chance to be the conference player of the year I mean he is a beast down low one of the catalysts from the program will will be a Lynch pin here for Antoine pway as he tries to establish the new DNA the building blocks of what his culture will look like now you see at the top two scores both buron and Robinson only 15 points combin for them tonight so its been a great job from the seminal shutting them down theres nickelberry got tripped up on the Baseline and forces it into a Music turnover now the other way deflection leads to an open three for Connell he can shoot it he can stroke it and he can bury it seon CLE third three of the night he has looked the best on this owls roster through just about one and a half games so far just playing with confidence tole at 16 points oh on a play by Corin no foul calls stick back by bbo and is there thats good move from cam Corin good to have Taylor bub in waiting and then Corin guilty of a foul on the low block another look coddle few steps behind the line no hesitation 50 for him tonight three of six from threepoint land 16 points against Oakwood and 16 points again tonight Sherman misses the free throw the Freshman lakon Georgia grov toown high school double double in his debut in an outl uniform on Tuesday 12 points 10 rebounds good size long arms kind of like what he brings to the table yeah had that big dunk early on tonight and you said it double double another player coach pway says you got to look out out for this season especially as the owls get in conference play he could be a key piece for kenol State its been all Florida State here tonight a strong start a team who lost to ston last year in the season opener a stunning look at what the season was going to eventually turn into heres atabc warley much too big for Burton easy play Applause that was a question tonight you see Jaylen Worley the 69 wingspan on 511 Terrell Bon made it difficult for him all night Jaylen Worley good little cut inside and Rises up nothing Terrell buron could do easy Music buck Music Applause buron leaves the first free throw short both teams struggling from the free throw line preseason always son team member the conference attourney MVP from one season ago Burton able to split at the line eight points for him tonight hes just one of nine from the floor though has made his living from the charity strike six free throws now green hes worked on that jumper there couldnt connect just for how kenth saw State wants to play three for 19 from three now three of 20 is tough Its the analytical mindset from Antoine pway shots inside and behind the ark adab BC on the Miss had a clear look I know his teammates want him to get into the book now this game has kind of lost its Groove bodies flying everywhere both teams still giving a ton of energy and a foul is called that takes us to a break Nolls by 30 here in the second half in Tallahasse and a pretty cool story as to why he wears the number 11 and its you can read the quote there but hes basically playing himself he wants to better himself every single day goes 1 V one against the man in the mirror and so that is why he wears 11 its so cool you just see it when you talk to him as well and we saw it here tonight it was a battle for him in the first half only two points not a lot of shots kind of taken out of the game now so far Five Points three a dunk in the second half making more plays but you said it a really cool story and a reminder at all times for Miller every time he looks at her Jersey why hes here and what hes playing for was cool to talk to him and shoot around and in the pregame warmups a lot of these mens basketball players were on hand last night as Florida States Womens Basketball team knocked off Tennessee 11th ranked Volunteers in a 9291 Thriller Baba Miller Darren Green Jr as that foul is called on house they said that was a an excellent basketball game Darren Green joked and said I need Omar Gordon to shake my hand so I can make some threes tonight but that love between the mens and womens programs at Florida State part of the family culture here in Tallahassee and you see Baba Miller a number of his teammates Jaylen warley was in attendance a number of the football players were in attendance Jordan Travis Jared verse Trey Benson all watching Brook woff get one of the biggest wins in her tenure at FSU really big win for that program and Brook wof Athletics all around at Florida State doing well as of late but maybe Gordon did Shake Darren Greens hand he is 50 from three tonight yeah both had three threes in their respective games that free throw knock down by buron second one no Music good turnover down low warley though active hands recovers it for FSU kick out to house swing pass Junior three not going to make it they call him Music dg3 hes got 18 sitting on that for a while you saw the night as a whole yeah Jaylen Worley just active with the hands too to get that ball back and another possession for Florida State Watkins couldnt hit nice drive nice finish for Cle yeah Simeon CLE he showed it off at the cup behind the arc all night TI for the game lead game high scoring 18 now for Cle Leonard Hamilton takes a timeout probably doesnt like the way the balls moving for FSU on the offensive side of things that was one area he felt like his team still needed to improve on he said were a little disjointed at times at times guys want the want a the ball around and they want screen set and then they want to attack One V one where at our best the ball needs to move around the arc two or three different times it needs to touch four to five guy different guys hands and eventually you find the open guy that leads to the open bucket yeah that was the biggest thing as you said get it to multiple guys and get that high quality look high quality shot that was one thing he mentioned to Alex just at half time wasnt as happy with the offense the defense has been creating offense and now as we get to the latter end of this second half wants to see some more ball movement in the half court and open up things yeah FL to say last season 9 and 23 we mentioned that already a couple times but they showed flashes backto back wins against Notre Dame and pit showed what this team could be Darren Green was hitting on all cylinders Chandler Jackson came into his own stunning Miami and Coral Gables essentially ruining the kans chance for a regular season ACC Championship the old that had too many moments and not enough consistency as house cant finish on the three h three of them in the first half Drive blocked by Miller he doesnt like the call foul as Sherman went up with two hands yeah was a good cut from Sherman Worley tried to intercept the pass Sherman just going to go back door on him Miller thought it might not have got him on the arm and nicked him on the elbow look like Miller might have knocked him with the elbows before the block so Sherman knocks down the free throw a lot of free throws in this game now 45 combined shot by the two teams here this evening up next for Florida State they take on Central missig on Monday team out of the Mac Jack you myself Alexandra will all be back for that one then they go on the road and play the Florida Gator Gators in Gainesville that is thats going to be a tough matchup early season on the road some hard tests for the seminal especially playing that rival in Florida always a good battle between both of those teams and then after that Sunshine slam Applause its a UNLV team thats been up and down just lost to Southern couple nights ago then Georgia and UNC so the next five are tough still getting work in are the seminal starters out trying to clean up some things as the schedule starts to ramp up just a little bit misses the free throw that UNLV game is actually a of the tournament in Daytona Beach so the NS will play at least two games down there the central Michigan game on Monday is an unofficial oncampus game for the Daytona jam and the NOS of course will play that ACC SEC challenge against Georgia replacing the ACC Big 10 challenge that is no longer in effect the ACC and SEC mens and womens now will be playing for a number of years thatll be broadcasted here on ESPN things getting a little bit sloppy now for both sides Florida State 0 for their last seven 550 to Applause play King fires off a Applause triple the put back not there the third effort not there and then a foul on Corin second chance third chances for kenesa State on that possession a little more fight on the glass buckets have not been able to fall for the owls tonight M Robinson getting in there fighting around I see Corin with a SWAT and foul But A Tail of Two Hales Kenn State seemed in the first they could maybe fight their way back their style of play and Florida State just came out on another level a different Tempo in the second half made it difficult for the owls to come back Jackson back in for Music Applause Music Applause orley 8256 after a couple of free throws by Robinson hes into double figures hes got a double double 10 points now 12 rebounds perfect from the line six for six three ball lck bang thats Cam Fletcher said it before Arya starting to work on that style that part of his game last season be big for cam Fletcher starts putting it in from behind the ark yeah no doubt about that as buron through the lane hes now in the double figures with 11 Music Applause Corin nice power move and the finish with the dominant right hands Corin now in double figures now classic Florida State spreading out all four other guys out on the perimeter opening up the space the Corin down low nice move there by Jamal King to create the space hang in the air and hit the West Virginia transfer of four in the Applause contest pal physical Drive couldnt Applause Music finish and then green swats it out a block on the attempt from Sherman fresh substitutions for Florida State and itll make Leonard Hamilton happy nobodys played more than 25 minutes so far tonight thats Darren Green Team High last season especially towards the end far too many times Leonard Hamilton said that he had to have guys play between 38 and sometimes 40 whole minutes no rest just because of the injuries and lack of depth especially for how coach ham wants to play with that high intensity at all times its tough for especially for Shooters to keep that going seminal late in the second up big simal sound groovin having a good time played Happy Birthday to Tom house a careerhigh nine points for him tonight career high three triples and season openers are Tom Houses thing had nine against Stetson last season nine more tonight here Robinson misses the mark badly from three theay up on the Music Finish was Burton sticking it back in for Burton 13 points here tonight most minutes hes played this season just 10 against Oakwood on Tuesday nickelberry behind the back dribble good recovery there from King inside Fletcher high off the glassen in cam Fletch are in the double figures now with 11 points to go along with five rebounds great to see for Fletch just backing down using his body three seminal now in double figures how about that three from Johnson Wow way down time first three of the night for Johnson weve seen the success for him down low in the paint freshman can score on all levels hell be a problem in the ason Jackson fre ball count Applause it well that from Chandler Jackson no hesitation deat green backing down creating space finds Jackson didnt think Applause Music Applause twice house now pushing the base nickelberry to Fletcher he wants the three that r out trying to stay with it he does behind the back dribble he goes down and Johnson rejected there I think Greens going to get credit for the block and a foul on burden 208 to play Florida State nearing the Sentry Mark here now just eight shy of 100 now three and double figures for the nolles but want to credit Deonte green have seen him tonight couple blocks or the sophomore thats been the importance as we said no Jaylen gainy maybe a few more weeks so to the play of Deontay green cam Corin now Taylor B Bowen those guys in the paint at The Rim be a focal point as well on defense for Coach ham so nickelberry nine points looking to get in a double figure oh I missed that one seals the one knock on them this evening 60 from the free throw line 15 of 25 theyve been very good defensively Bowen was looking for nickelberry that would have been special your 610 forward throwing the oop to the guard pretty cool seeing him him run the floor but that will probably be the one thing coach ham as you said Arya from the charity stripe got to improve there after ball pinballed around itll be fsus basketball we talked about Florida State Kennesaw State upcoming theyve got a game against Kaiser then an instate battle against Georgia Southern and then a game against nor Eastern as it is Music officially time to celebrate the victory hard ear minutes in practice turn into minutes in Music games heres Brown now to Thorp Spain hour at a BC oh he had an open look it was a great pass from Spain hour look over to the seminal bench and Stan Jones FL States associate head coach points at spainhower and says throw that one up get it High Above the Rim for adabi to go get you see adabi in their pregame warmups his heads going over the rim its a good call from Stan Jones Music nice move from Johnson thoughts on both of these teams Florida State State win in their home opener especially as we said from last year a lot to like and look forward to especially as you add more pieces down the road with Jaylen gy and Primo Spears hopefully added back to the rotation and Kisa State your first test underhead coach antoan pway you kind of see what youve got facing a team like like Florida State atabc how about that Sola adab BC former Scout team player for the Florida State womens basketball program hes on the board you learn a lot though if youre K ofas State from a game like this absolutely this is a team that is projected and will compete and ason can certainly make a run back to that tournament final and the NCAA tournament a lot to like an Anton pet W Squad slowly but surely at a BC again open not ready for it turnover on Florida State Spain hours had some good looks here late how about that that a BC makes it easy a twohanded slam Florida State the depth on display back to their old selves at least for tonight an opening night victory over Tennis Hall State dominating fashion
