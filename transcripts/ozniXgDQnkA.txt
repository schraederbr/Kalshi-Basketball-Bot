yeah steve ford said this is the key matchup tonight how they match up against armando bay cop and acc preseason player of the year garrison brooks they must do a good job keeping them under wraps in particular near the basket carolina in white wake forest in black our officials tonight mike roberts mike stevens and clarence armstrong as we are underway in chapel hill itll be the tar heels that start with possession take a look at north carolinas starting five roy williams team has started three and three in six acc games to start the season funny enough all six of those results have been decided by seven points or less so not good for tar heel fans blood pressure and wake four is well they must get the ball down low in the post we talked about it right off the tip thats where theyre going to have the advantage on the other side wake forest they must defensive rebound steve forbes was concerned about north carolinas bigs and their size on the offensive laps first two possessions they did a nice job blocking out and wake goes to the post going to be a big night for the sophomore odi oguama hes really the lone acc caliber big that wake has on their roster meanwhile north carolina rotates four of them one of them armando baker great post move to open the scoring well you can see the strategy when we spoke with coach roy williams yesterday he said look we must utilize our bigs yes we made some threes against florida state but tonight were gonna have advantage down low in the post wake forest is gonna have to make a decision uh they might have to start doubling early on any postentry pass five seconds to shoot jonah antonios in trouble hes gonna have to even know decides to pass it off kerwin walton comes up with the ball and thats a shot clock violation great defense and a lot of energy from this tar heels team early yeah and if youre roy williams youre definitely excited about the energy and thats going to be another key theme we asked him about that as well intuitive energy but this right here is great post position now if youre awake again you cannot allow him to catch the ball with one foot inside the paint you got to try to do a better job working position before they get a postentry pass right back to the post bank muscles his way in but misses the finish antonio triggers a three and hits it john antonio the sharp shooter from australia knocks down the triple steve forbes said that is going to be our formula uh for getting a road win we must hit some shots up front beyond the arc every single possession north carolina has gone into the post and right now steve forbess team has handled it relatively well first year head coach for wake forest he joked with us yesterday on our coachs call he doesnt recommend trying to build a program during a pandemic and yet thats exactly what hes doing at wake forest oh not ideal he said look i you know had all this great plans going in so he lives right across the street from the arena on at wake forest then he said look i havent been able to have the team over because of the pandemic and you look at this timeline right here thats certainly not ideal for the first year coach its one thing to try and start a build build a program during a pandemic but then when you get a month really covet block that really shut down this program they couldnt even practice it it really took them out of their rhythm and theyve had to respond get thrown right into acc play theyve lost five straight games but playing well early on the road at chapel hill a place they have not won in 11 years heres garrison brooks doubleteamed foul and hell head to the line for two Music jay this guy at the line is really for north carolina if youre looking for a leader a guy to step up and really carry some of the young players i think this is the guy preseason player of the year in the acc by many and again he is one of those guys that again hes going to draw a lot of attention tonight i think how he passes out of the double team tonight is going to have a huge impact on this game the curious case of leaky black now in his junior year he was scoreless last time out on the road against florida state his lack of consistency on the offensive end has plagued him for sure antonio left that one short north carolina is looking to run Music kerwin that one off the mark offensive rebound by brooks keeps the possession alive walton triggers another cant hit that one either well you cant ask for two better looks the first one in transition again wide open threes great job on the offensive glass and again he gets another really wide open look and just unable to get it to go a contested look there off the mark love in transition and the travels called just getting started on the acc network tied at five in chapel hill obviously not ideal not a lot of time with these guys really a lot of disruption they went almost over a month without playing so again its going to take some time but you know certainly a lot of people are excited about the direction that he can potentially take wake forest basketball in forbes last year for east tennessee state 130 gaines only lost four so early in his wake for his tenure three and five hes already lost more games here than he had to lose a year ago and we spoke to him about that he goes im a winner i hate to lose i want to compete the good news is he feels like his team has only gotten better and better you look at their results against virginia tech over the weekend they battled and could have beaten the top 25 team yeah and obviously both these coaches uh really have the same sentiments roy williams obviously a very young backcourt and he talked to you know we talked about you know just the progression of these guys and i think really whats hurt them early on is the lack of any preseason and any time with them leading up to the actual season so you know both programs and obviously all these programs dealing with that right now but obviously roy williams a hall of famer hes been here before and i expect this backcourt young backcourt to just continue to get better as this season progresses great point malcolm roy williams certainly spoke to us about the struggles that hes faced with this young backcourt but he said every program has had challenges this season but if you had to say the team thats faced the most he actually said this week its steve forbes and wake forest again with that month shut down due to a covet outbreak you come back play one game against a division two kroger and then boom acc play locked on at three falls to walter who pushes it great defense davey and williamson got back to deny any room to run for andrew playtech williamson dishes off inside easy layup and wake forest has grabbed the lead and thats all set up by williamson start it off with the steal and then draw the defense and get into the lane this is just a great individual play uh by williamson started on the defensive end right here carolina running their patented break williamson heads up play and then hes off to the races and right here pick and roll d help is not there draw the defender and you cant do it any better unselfish play expect to see him the freshman at six foot ten hell give odi oguama a breather right now working on brooks defensively acc preseason player of the year missed it and a jump ball underneath Music that time sharp deron sharp almost came up with a offensive rebound and again back to the keys to the game for awake you know thats going to be the stat line were going to watch uh throughout this one how theyre able to defensive rebound and in particular against a guy like sharp whos very aggressive on both ends in particular on the offensive glass masood lines up at three off the mark north carolinas gone two minutes and 40 seconds without points kerwin walton hesitation drives in brooks misses the follow tip in and theres a lid on the rim right now for the tar heels yeah theyve missed some opportunities early bayco and brooks with some tip tip ends and then also theyve had some pretty good looks where theyve had two feet inside the paint five straight misses for north carolina wake trying to capitalize heres carter witt in trouble double team plate tech can run the other way with it inside to brooks hook shot no good deron sharp offensive board cashes in for two i just love his motor and energy right now jay he leads north carolina with 46 coming into this game make that 47 offensive rebounds after that one right there wake forest an instant response the demon deacons playing with some confidence through david williamson Music rims out heres williamson again pushing the tempo one on three and the ball ripped out of his hands although itll stay wakes way this right here again pick and roll d thats poor communication by north carolina biggs but you have to be communicating which way you want them to go and then again getting out and transition but you know certainly if youre in north carolina you have to do a better job communicating on pick and rolls in particular the biggs of north carolina an errant pass says north carolinas bench outraged the officials say someone got a piece of the ball roy williams disagrees Music and the one thing with no fans you can hear all the communication between the coaches and refs players and players so certainly another interesting storyline heres carter whit with the ball right now about a month ago he was gearing up for a high school basketball season graduated early thrown right into the acc three on two for the tar heels rj davis fouled on his way to the rim here come here come here i did not see this in the scouting report for day ron sharp getting a steal and then leading the break with a beautiful bounce pass that is excellent touch and also court awareness by deron sharp and again you talk with the coaching staff of north carolina theyre really high on this young man obviously physically ready to come in and play as a freshman love his energy on the offensive glass but that right there is not something you typically see from the 611 freshman its a super difficult freshman class rj davis just made two at the line hes coming off being named acc freshman of the week he had a teamhigh 16 in the loss to florida state no doubting the talent from this freshman class roy williams just said we need them to play more consistently particularly in the backcourt caleb love rj davis kerwin walton when you look at rj daviss numbers thats a pretty good stat line right there obviously very efficient i think that 44 number really is huge for north carolina that game against florida state but they had a season high ten three pointers made so certainly thats a good sign to try to loosen up any defense that wants to double down on the bigs looking inside to another freshman walker kessler and its over the big mans head tied at nine slow going between wake and carolina december of 2019 obviously talking about anthony harris after he his acl for a second time and roy obviously very emotional about the injury there and to a certain degree malcolm he still is in our coachs call yesterday he told us that despite harris getting fully cleared by the trainer hes being very cautious in paris minutes because he doesnt want to have a situation where hes looking down at harris injured again seeing the pain on that young mans face whos had to battle back from two different acl injuries and he said to us jay the first time in his 33 years here at north carolina he said look the first time ive ever walked down to the end of a bench and talked with a trainer and asked him is it okay are you sure that this young man is okay to go into the game and you know again he said look every time hes out on the court i am just anxious because he knows the work that this young man has put in to get back onto the court so he said look anybody who thinks hes just going to ramp up to 20 30 minutes a game is crazy its not going to happen we are going to be very cautious with his usage harris in the game right now they go to deyron sharp off the mark carter whit battling harris for the ball its a jump ball possession arrow with the tar heels and if youre a north carolina fan you you see what anthony harris brought to this team against florida state in his debut back a team high three assists took two shots made both of them he only played eight minutes youre thinking man i want this guy on the court for 30 minutes but roy williams just easing the fan base saying we need to be cautious we cant just throw them right in well theyre a different team with him out on the court healthy i mean he was a plus 10 in those short minutes and you know three assists to go along with it so again i think he just makes it easier for the other guys in particular though of the energy that he brings to this team certainly they want to see him healthy right to the rack and wake forest has opened up a fourpoint lead Music Applause kessler steps back he misses north carolina shooting under 20 3 of 16 from the floor well nucias will not get credit for this but the blackout that he did on day ron sharp making sure he does not get an offensive rebound is huge ive been impressed with how they blocked out and theyre now stepping out and hitting the three its been execution early on by a weight dribble drives getting to the lane but then the defensive rebounding and technique really has been impressive its a 70 wake forest run carolinas missed 10 of their last 11 heres harris trying to provide a spark five seconds to shoot rj davis has to hurry pull up pop he hits it rj davis delivers a much needed bucket well sometimes better offense beats pretty good d not a bad defensive possession by awake but sometimes you just need a guy to go get you a bucket shot clock winding down and thats a big time pullup by davis who has been balling as of late for north carolina next tuesday this tar heels team travels to a red hot pittsburgh seven eastern tip off right here on the acc network justin champagne and the panthers have been terrific they beat coach k at duke last night thatll be a great matchup next tuesday david williamson four points three assists crosscourt pass there jalen johnson heaves the three at the end of the shot clock Music well better resistance thats just a guy really imposing his will right there again not bad d thats just a tough shot in the lane by the preseason player of the year davian williamson is heating up in this first half six points three assists hes been the goto guy for wake forest Applause well its simple jay right now north carolina is doing a couple things warmed and running and jumping at times but then two the bigger problem is ball screen coverage really has been poor and wake forest has gotten into the lane johnson cant connect sharp tried to keep it alive but his foot was on the end line so itll stay wakes ball and this has been the problem right here again the help is late and then nice little block out that time but again that has been a problem area early on in this game and particularly with williamson he has gotten into the lane with ease williamson played for steve forbes at east tennessee state a year ago was part of that 30win team aaron inbound passes caleb love trying to capitalize probably forced that shot on a oneontwo situation and when we asked roy williams how he would assess his young backcourt he said look i got a lot of gray hairs on my head and plays like that i think really again decision making he said look it needs to get better theyre talented but they need to be better with their decision making brooks left wide open for a three Applause those are the shots that need to start the fall for carolina and its not just tonight its been like that all season long even going back to last season theyve struggled to shoot the ball from outside the guard play has been inconsistent and thats two characteristics that you can typically count on in a carolina basketball team brooks from the same spot just two feet in and this one rolls in from dead on carolina cuts it to three Music carter wick calls for a travel wake forest leading seven to play in this first right now by north carolina really the bigs have got to do a better job cutting the ball down again theyre not really hedging and then theyre allowing williamson to get into the paint there needs to be better communication and the bigs need to do a better job hedging on ball screen so that way they can give the guards a chance to get over and get back in front got six points himself hes assisted on three others so out of weight seven field goals hes helped on six of them he is everything to steve forbes team jay hes getting some good looks early again thats two feet in the paint again just unable to finish on the jump hook another travel called against the young freshman carter with and thats just weight room right there when we asked steve forbes about his progression carter whit look hes talented he was a top 60 recruit a big time get for them but certainly again him without having any preseason leading up hes certainly talented but hes gonna have to get a little bit stronger spend some time in the weight room but certainly the staff along with steve ford is really high on him walter left open and he makes wake forest pay from three shooting 44 from three hes been the bright spot particularly shooting on a team that struggled to do it consistently garrison brooks steals that one away caleb love pull up pop and he hits it first carolina lead since it was four to three and the freshman guard starting to play well backtoback buckets from that young backcourt well theyre gonna continue to get better under roy williams uh one of the best in the business in terms of developing guys and you can see love has all the tools to be one of those other great north carolina guards to come out of here certainly though that starts with his pullup game hes got one of the best davian williamson ends a 70 carolina run we remind you tomorrow night womens basketball doubleheader right here on the acc network first its miami and pittsburgh at six easter to the georgia tech wake forest the nightcap of the doubleheader at eight both games right here on the acc network tied at 2520 to play wake forest looking for their first win in chapel hill in 11 years carolina pound the post they kind of backed away from that strategy but now going back to it yeah and again that goes back to the maturity and ill be part of the process for of these guards and this team understanding where you have the advantage yes in that florida state game you hit a seasonhigh 10 threes but roy williams made it very clear coming into this game our advantage is going to be with our bigs we want to play through garrison brooks bacon deyron sharp when they get in there and then obviously always in their transition game they want to get out make or miss Applause no field goals for the demon deacons in the last four minutes its allowed north carolina to grab a Applause lead rattles in and out showed off some fancy handles but couldnt get the shot to drop and wait continuing to do a nice job on the defensive glass limiting north carolina uh to one shot and then theyre cleaning up that defense glass that rattles in and out a lid on the rim for both teams right now defense to deny brooks in the post both teams struggling to shoot from the floor and weights hanging around four minutes until halftime carolina back in front 2120 floppy one so far at chapel hill you look at the stats 17 combined turnovers only 15 combined made field goals malcolm thats just the kind of game its been for these two teams and a big reason why roy williams said were a work in progress coming into this game jay north carolina had 186 assists to 200 turnovers thats not the number you want and it obviously starts with their guard play but theyd do a better job making decisions and then the bigs have to do a better job finishing some of those opportunities theyve had and to paint isaiah drills a three out of the timeout to take the lead back for wake their first field goal in nearly five minutes of play to go five minutes without making a basket and have a lead in the dean dome against north carolina thats pretty good defense caleb love triggers a three and he hits it the freshman caleb love answers with a three of his own well he continues to shoot the ball well and that last game against florida state but he was 306 from beyond the arc that time wake forest decides to go under the screen he ducks behind and makes them pay again when hes not turning the ball over obviously you can see the talent is there i think of the big thing for all three of these guys right here on the screen uh we know they can score i think its the decision making and then getting guys set when they get into the half court offensive fouls the call underneath itll be wake basketball Music yeah mucius has done a nice job not only obviously here taking a charge again hard to tell from that angle but brooks did look like he blowered the shoulder but i think uh defensive rebounding was such a concern coming into this one you know all five guys have done a nice job chipping down and also helping out with the blockout duties to keep the bigs of north carolina off the offensive glass ucs lines up another three cant connect on that one theres a foul on the rebound though gives us time to remind you friday we have the reigning acc wrestling champs north carolina state wolf pack theyre right number four again this week and theyre taking on pittsburgh friday night duels right here on the acc network six oclock start wake in the bonus and odie obama knocks down the front end of the one and one to tie it at 24 obama a perfect four for four at the line to give wake back the lead and right now jay interesting lineup north carolina has three bigs out on the court so lets see if they continue that strategy trying to go down low they do and obama read it the whole way trying to get the entry pass into bacon and the sophomore swiped it again right idea you got to see though and make the read see that guy coming over before you even pass the ball swing it to the other side and then see if you can repost him right back to baicot turns around bookshot falls carolina back in front and thats excellent patience and move by bacon i felt he rushed a few earlier when he had opportunities thats a beautiful spin move soft touch with the little baby jump up keeps it alive hes in a double team extra pass finds williamson for three and he knocks it down davey and williamson up to 11 points leads all scorers and wakes up by two back the other way wave off the basket for an offensive foul well this is just unselfish right here you call the j extra pass draw the d and thats just all set up by the second chance opportunity those 50 50 balls early on wake forest is getting a lot of those with that last possession right there excellent ball movement and unselfish play great block by love falls right to him heres the freshman kick out walton pull up pop hits it down to 28 thats the read that you want if youre roy williams from love great defense get out and transition dont force a shot kick it out and then you play from there excellent transition offense by north carolina uc has taken advantage of playtech isaiah Music brooks trying to answer for a carolina team that has been so dominant with offensive rebounds they averaged 16 per game they leave the country in it they have only managed five in this first half theyre actually getting out rebounded williamson step back three its good davey and williamson is on fire in this first half im sure well talk about that coming up at the state farm halftime report plus youll hear from packer of durham wake forest is fired up take a listen to that bench and caleb love will shut the pitch right up right before halftime silences the demon deacons on a three Applause nine lead changes seven times but its wake forest who has come into chapel hill and david williamson has given the demon deacons a twopoint halftime lead this halftime report is presented by state farm when you want the real deal like a good neighbor state farm is there heat changes in that first half wake forest a twopoint lead 3331 malcolm howd we get here well i think uh davian williamson was outstanding in the first half for wake forest ball screen defense needs to tighten up for north carolina and then the rebounding j you look at that coming into this one a wake right now out rebounding north carolina a plus three and that was such a huge key coming into this one for steve forbes its so far for carolina fans this game is following a familiar script and it usually ends with high blood pressure and no nails left to bite six straight acc games for carolina have been decided by seven points or less thats only the second time in program history that has happened in those six games to start conference play three wins and three losses well roy williams simply said you know ive added a lot more gray hairs to my head uh dealing with everything weve had to deal with and obviously with this young backcourt certainly uh thats something roy wants to see the progression see how they close out games and obviously its going to come down to decision making by the young backcourt that young backcourt in times of that first half played terrific at times played like freshman and roy williams just looking for them to grow up be more consistent get better he says they know they need it our fans know we need it roy williams especially knows they need it but until they get to that point youre going to have stretches like weve seen so far in this game and throughout acc play where sometimes they look great and you end up winning those close games and sometimes they cant make the play to win a game and you end up losing and thats why appropriately theyre three and three through six games yeah and i think early on too jay weve talked about this brooks again another quality look uh that time the pullup jumper hes had some looks too where hes had two feet inside the paint hey man bacon theyve just been unable to convert on some of those post looks that theyve had offensive rebound for wake forest thats been another key factor carolina the most offensive rebounds for any team in the country and yet its wake whos dominated the glass so far tonight antonio splits defenders another offensive rebound shot clock did not reset the bench is calling forward too much heaves it up and cant connect Applause ties it at 33 walton up to seven points in a super talented freshman class walton was the lowest ranks least talked about but you could make the argument malcolm that hes actually been the most consistent in the backcourt between love davis and walton yeah he came into this game leads the team leading the team with 23s made and thats an excellent read again all about the decisionmaking coming off a screen help was not there dont settle for a pullup jumper continue to get to the basket and youre right jay he has been playing really well for north carolina williamson weaving through that carolina defense didnt get a great look at the basket though love underneath is the freshman trying to take it coast to coast and this right here again decision making its really a oneontwo oneonthree you like the aggression but thats not a good read again you want to pull it out if you dont have the advantage and to try to get your team into your secondary break has picked the pocket of leaky black throws it up ahead obama rocks the rim old iguama hammers it home and delivers wake the lead Applause inside immediate answer from armando bacon is the officials whistle a flop warning issued to odie oguama and they read my mind i like the no call again theyre warning him do not flop obviously uh bacop did not apply that much pressure for him to fall over like that rest right on top of it i liked it not a lot of discussion knock it off play heads up and then next time youre going to get attacked williamson working on baycock with five to shoot backs in on brooks lefthanded no good Applause oh love darts in draws the contact itll head to the line for two caleb love has been a lot more aggressive in this game particularly on the drive right here again excellent defense by weekend you know going back to their virginia tech game where they lost by four they battled but they beat virginia tech in a turnover game they had 17 points off of turnovers against virginia tech so again they continue to try to create some offense with their defense Music Applause tenth lead change comes from the foul line carolina up by one deep three from jonah antonio cant knock it down heres leaky black he was a great pass and leaky black did the rest textbook carolina fast break excellent block out by bacon again he does not get the rebound but keeping wake off the offensive glass and then ball barely touched the floor head up pass it up thats how you run the fast break williamson hes had the hot hands step back three cant connect on that one Applause right back to bangkok muscling his way to the rim count it plus the foul largest lead of the night for carolina and armando baycod has one more coming oh this right here grown man move okay i have the size advantage im gonna take the hit body control eyes on the rim and remember in the first half they were unable to convert some of those paint touches that time going strong and then finishing with the soft touch and jay back to the really last two minutes for awake remember in the first half they were getting higher percentage shots i feel like north carolina has picked up i like the adjustment by roy williams picking up full and trying to force them into some contested shots its an eightnothing run for roy williams team and in the second half the tar heels are outscoring the demon deacons ten to two wilkins lost it trapped in the corner in a double team and right now north carolina on a second half surge getting it done in transition largest lead of the game six for carolina Music carolina on a 102 run to start this second half and you look at wake forest steve fords the first year head coach told malcolm huckabee and i that you got to play a full 40 minutes to win in the acc joke that hes petitioned the league to make the games 32 minutes and then he wouldnt have five straight losses but they are 40 minutes and you look at the last four minutes for wake forest and its a microcosm at what has cost them those five losses that they can play really well for 20 minutes but then they come out flat for four and just like that theyre down by six yeah and obviously that schedule did them no favors at the time all those teams the previous four were in the top 25 and you throw in georgia tech and now you come on the road to north carolina but the one thing that he is positive about his guys have continued to battle and look they were right there in a lot of those games and certainly some encouraging news for steve fords aunt and his staff there lost track of the shot clock though another selfinflicted wound for this wake forest offense carolina has continued to capitalize on the slow offensive start for wake in the second half Applause inside deron sharp battling in the post and he draws the foul freshman will head to the line for two Music and jay right here this young fella is physically ready as a freshman to play in the acc again that is really great strength but im going back to the patience and the read for north carolina as sharp knocks down a freethrow look theyre not settling for jumpers again they know they have a size advantage with weight they picked up the tempo defensively but then offensively they havent gotten away from look we still have to get some paint touches for our pigs tuesday tar heels traveled to pittsburgh theyre playing a red hot panthers team how about justin champagne last night a big win against duke this pit team is for real you can watch him in action next week tuesday against this tar heels team look at champanes night 31 points a career high and it comes against duke and what is a statement win for coach cable and you knew he was going to be very good last year all the physical tools but certainly this year hes going to be a guy that continues to be a name called in the acc look at that efficiency right there 1215 double double 14 boards to go along with 31 Music and that pit team beat duke and take a look at the ap poll this week no duke or north carolina at the top 25 for the first time since 1982 more than 700 straight poles with either duke or north carolina in the top 25 and that came to an end this week and its a little deceptive again a lot of people want to be beat up on these teams but look they both have young teams and when you have young teams that have really no practice time youre not having as much of a consistent schedule youre going to have some growing pains make no mistake about it though they have a talented group they just need more reps again with all the disruptions roy williams talked about it its showing in their play count the three plus the foul could be a fourpoint play for isaiah museus exactly what wake four is needed to halt a 120 carolina run and he continues to play great hat 10 points in that virginia tech game was great on the offensive glass and that right there poor close out by brooks and she is unable to complete the fourpoint play but thats a big three before wake forest tar heels got out to a 12nothing run wake four is shooting just one of ten from the field in the second half before that museus three how do the demon deacons continue the claw back in this game malcolm exactly this right here excellent ball movement and gets swings again defensively that last possession caleb love again not a good read no ball swings quick shot and then weight comes down excellent ball movement and they get a wide open three backtoback threes for mucias hes up to four triples on the night grabs that rebound there hes been really good tonight hes played tough with the post defensively made threes on the offensive end here he is with it now lost the handle there though carolina can run its a three on one Applause that ends a six nothing demon deacons run williamson goes into the trees kickout mucius again isaiah museus red hot buries his fifth three of the night thats again another poor closeout the guy just hit a three you gotta close out make him put the ball on the floor if youre in north carolina Music and you can hear roy williams screaming get out on him again right there you dont need to help thats a poor closeout the guy just hit one in the corner and again you have to be aware of your personnel out on the court you see us starting to heat up from beyond the arc you cant give him any air space hes got the last nine points for the demon deacons as its back to a one possession game heres anthony harris back into the game nice feed inside brooks couldnt make the bucket but itll get to the line two freshmen making a headsup play love today ron sharp and thats a beautiful post entry pass that time from the top of the key again you can see these guys maturing getting better with more reps making the right reads and thats what you want to see if youre roy williams that time your two freshmen making the right reads in the half court tomorrow night weve got a great womens basketball doubleheader miami in pittsburgh tips things off at six oclock and then georgia tech and wake forward finishes the doubleheader eight oclock eastern time right here on the acc network that is tomorrow and brooks gets both from the foul line as roy williams continues to rotate his talented front court youve got baycom brooks sharp walker kessler gets some burn as well roy williams still 13 games into this season still trying to figure out what his best five is as he turns up some full court pressure on wake Music i can tell you right now their best defense has been when they decided to pick up full and theyve been able to disrupt this wake forest offense the full court pressure forces it rj davis off the steal from anthony harris starting defense into offense thats exactly why the hall of famer turned up the pressure again the end game adjustments youre absolutely right jay that was the key turning point in this game for roy williams and north carolina if youre awake you have to do a better job not turning the ball over again thats how theyve created a lot of their offense north carolina they sped you up theyve turned you over and then theyre getting out in transition 14 turnovers for the demon deacons williamson attacking the rack blocked by davis it rolls out of bounds and that takes us to our immediate timeout carolina outscoring the demon deacons by nine this half isaiah museu is trying to keep wake in it trailing by seven midway through the second half fours to the finish line here in chapel hill if youre not one of the two juniors youve combined to shoot four of 23 only 13 points wake forest with three seconds on the shot clock he hits it isaiah museus buries his sixth threepointer of the night with the shot clock sounding an immediate answer in the post and north carolina continues to show great patience theyve only taken eight threes in this game jay and thats a good job of them following the game script that they want which is continue to pound the ball into post williams to the three he knocks it down well theres your story museus and williamson back to back threes those have been the two guys carrying wake forest just like that its a one possession game again thanks to the two juniors davey and williamson and isaiah museus a combined 37 of wake forest 50 heres williamson seven seconds to shoot step back three for the tie cant connect offensive rebound guess who its mucias he cant put it in aguama pulls down another board wake forest has dominated the glass tonight ten offensive rebounds for the demon deacons johnson a three its good and wake is clawed back from down ten to tie it at 53 jay its not how many threes theyve made its how open they have been that time dribble drive the help is late and another uncontested 34 wait baycock counted plus the foul armando bacon the answer Music well containing dribble drives again right here you make the north carolina d health and thats just an uncontested three off of a dribble drive kick thats just too easy to have to do a better job containing ball penetration and then getting out on shooters on the other end a wake has to do a couple things obviously their post defense has to be better but really north carolina has capitalized off their turner was right now j north carolina 17 points off the turnovers wake has made six of their last seven threes right now trailing carolina by two demon deacons havent won at chapel hill in 11 years five seconds to shoot jacoby neat lost the handle it is tar heel basketball thats excellent individual d that time i believe it was love and thats really been the one negative for wake forest when theyve gotten into their half court sets theyve gotten some high quality looks they just need to cut down on the turnovers Music Applause foul Music Applause so how about north carolina a team that leads the country and offensive rebounds per game getting out rebounded by wake forest 3126 and thats four fouls on armando baycot he heads the bench with nine minutes to go in this game just six minutes ago carolina led by 10 that lead is down to two williamson lost the handle great hands from carolina now can they cash in and davis is fouled Applause another opportunity off of a turnover again this is just a great recovery to poke the ball away and then off to the races before that wake d can get set up and jay that has been the one area that has kept north carolina on top the adjustment picking up full wake has been really careless with the ball when theyve had that extended north carolina d Applause rj davis missed it the officials blew the play dead deron sharp called for a foul thats now two fouls going for offensive rebounds the first call against bacon the second to get sharp in the last minute remember bacons on the bench with four fouls fullcourt pressure half court heave to antonio Applause Music then on the offensive end sharp cant knock it down still a one possession game backdoor feed to johnson he tried to kick it out rj davis intercepted it up ahead to leaky black right back to davis pull up pop his short follows his own shot and that time the acc freshman of the week rj davis puts it home Applause al called on the floor we stepped aside carolina leading by five weve got a fun finish coming on the acc network ed hot and hes kept the demon deacons in it and a lot of them jay have been core closeouts by north carolina that time off of a loose ball situation but again they do have to do a better job identifying the shooters for weight in particular mucias who has heated up in the second half on the bench right now mucias the only wake forest player to start all of the demon deacons games this season the junior has been a constant but the sharp shooting has alluded them again only four of 24 from deep coming into the night and yet he has hit six tonight wake forest down four how will they play with museums on the bench is the question hes been good in the post on defense as well they missed him there garrison brooks took advantage of the mismatch against ishmael massoud Applause and thats the matchup they need to go to brooks made a move the double was almost there before he caught it but he spun away from it thats a big bucket for north carolina to give them a little breathing room obama calling forward in the post brooks handling the sophomore backing him down lefty hook shot no good thats this great post defense by book brooks not giving up much ground and then contest the shot look out deyron sharp whos winding back to throw that one down but lost the handle williamson kick out three jaylen johnson hits it the transfer from tennessee buries a big time three cuts the lead in half time out taken and well step aside with it Music be the key coming down to the end of this game right now can north carolina adjust get out and keep williamson in particular out of the lane and they get a hand up on mucias on the other end theyre going to have to adjust how theyre defending the post because north carolina continues to pound the ball in the paint step back three caleb love leaves at short offensive rebound blocked away shot clock did reset for carolina Applause foul called on the floor now friday eight eastern time weve got our next edition of bald man not on campus jay bilas lafonzo and seth greenberg tell you what you need to know coming up on the acc week slate of games and its a good slate only on the acc network and the espn app the carolina already in the bonus front end of the one and one is good and this is where roy williams wants to see caleb love uh make progress end of game situations now in the first half he had two turnovers and the second he has no turnovers but the decisionmaking to close this game out i think thats going to be key for north carolina the freshmans got 13 for the tar heels tonight roy williams preaching more consistent play from his young guards williamson great drive kick out three johnson rolls in and out no good and thats a break for north carolina right there again another uncontested look williamson right down the lane again lays it up and in scoop to the hoop for davey and williamson Music Applause great response from leaky black drills the midrange jumper to make it a twopossession game and jay thats huge because right now wake forest is not even playing him so if theyre not going to play him he needs to step in every time like that and make that midrange jumper to try to loosen up that defense because theyre just doubling down low in the post and daring of the shoot double team on mucias illide shot no good ian williamson have combined for 40 of wake forests 59 love muscling his way to the rim follows his own shot counted plus the foul caleb love all part right there on his way to the rim thats just great work off of his own miss again a lot of contact no foul go get your own put back and that is tough finish for the freshman love now leads carolina and scoring with 15 these are the flashes from this talented freshman class that gives roy williams so much hope he just wants to see it on a more consistent basis see how wake handles the pressure this has been problematic for them didnt handle it well there hammers it home and the north carolina lead is back to 10 right now north carolinas face guarding thats what they need to do more bring a big up to try to relieve some pressure nice job i love denying the ball to williams 70 tar heels run in the last 60 seconds look at this right here a hustle effort and an unselfish play uh by leaky black and baycop with the finish and to close this game out if wake wants to get back into this one they got to do a better job handling the full court pressure you got to get a home run play going try to get a big coming up and try to see if you can run somebody long because the guards have been face guarding for north carolina so youre not going to get anything going back towards the basket see if you can beat them over the top demon deacons craving a stop loves been the goto guy as of late and a foul called on jonah antonio Applause tar heels enter the double bonus of two coming from the line as good as wake forest has played at times in this game steve forbes talked about the turnovers and how he was concerned about that and right now in this game north carolina has 22 points off of turnovers and that really sums up the second half for them when theyve gotten in half court theyve gotten some good looks but when theyve turned it over north carolina has done a nice job capitalizing and turning those turnovers into points Music foul called on garrison brooks who was reaching for that offensive rebound tears of wisdom on his head and obviously thats not a smart play again you got to understand time possession no need you like the aggressive nature trying to get an offensive rebound but you can afford to foul put wake forest on the freethrow line with no ticks going off lucius gets both from the line its a seven point lead for carolina demon deacons and tied this game at 53 in search of their first win at chapel hill in 11 years theyre not going down easy four minutes to play tar heels go inside theyve dominated the post tonight and it continues with armando baicot 17 points for the sophomore whos playing very confidently with four fouls right now Music williamson triggers a three off the mark and a foul called on the rebound now since this game was tied at 53 carolina has used a second half surge turning defense into offense armando baycat the first year head coach steve forbes told us that if games were 32 minutes long instead of 40 wake forest wouldnt be oh and 5 at the acc and well this game has followed a familiar script you credit the demon deacons they have fought hard against the talented tar heel team on the road but still lacking the ability to put it together for a full 40 minutes in acc play yeah really i think the turnovers really is the story of the game for this wake forest team it almost sounds like i could just press a recorder but that really has been the achilles heel for them in this one and then roy williams credit in particular love their guards have done a nice job in the second half sticking to the game plan go off of turnovers but they continue to try to find their bigs down low in particular bacop and the acc freshman of the week rj davis into double figures as well the largest lead of the game for carolina 7362 an 11point lead its got to feel good for carolina fans to be leading by double digits at least right now although isaiah museus as i say it watch out thats his seventh made three of the night he had come in shooting four of 24 from deep answer rj davis knocks it down well his jab step is really impressive thats just a nice little jab come off a little screen brush screen and right into your pullup jumper and wake forest throws it away how about the night isaiah yeah right here again the double team you make a poor read and again you cant give that guy a wide open three hes going to continue to hurt you if you leave him open from beyond the yard its a career high 25 points for the junior on a careerhigh seven threes well remember carolina in all six of their acc games theyve been decided by seven points or less right now leading by ten and carolina fans have no nails left to bite so they need a comfortable one down the stretch thatll help watch out big finish caleb love to put the tar heels up 12 if you want to teach fast break basketball off of a turnover run that play right there give go give it back unselfish play ball never touch the floor caleb love has come alive in this second half take another look at this and this is just unselfish right here poor post entry pass once it got over half court ball never touched the floor if youre a young player thats how you run it right there unselfish and in caleb love showing off the hops and hes been impressive throughout this game obviously we know he can score excels in the open court but his decision making jay and in particular though the defensive end and the pressure that hes put on the weight guards i think has been key and this second half again breaking the press and hammering it home guess who caleb love up to 20 on the Applause night are you serious Music but thats excellent press offense and caleb love again with another flush off the excellent ball movement after breaking the pressure Applause it is a career high 20 points for the freshman caleb love you read the tar heel blogs you talk to roy williams its the same answer we need consistent guard play well tonight it showed up in the form of caleb love and rj davis those two have been terrific in this second half Applause wake forest has battled all night long career highs from both isaiah museus and davey and williams and theyve combined for 50 25 Applause 72 of the demon deacons points came from those two guys mucias seven threes and yet looks like it wont be enough although mucia is still fighting steve forbes takes a timeout 66 seconds to play but he has brought a belief to this program and they have battled every single second of this game it might fall short down eight with 66 seconds to go but you cannot doubt the passion and the heart that the demon deacons brought to chapel hill tonight and armando bacon is fouled with one minute exactly remaining and you can see the strategy right now wake forest they did a nice job getting the ball out of loves hand an excellent freethrow shooter and put it in because in and came into this game shooting 67 percent from the freethrow line Applause down nine demon deacons have to hurry william suit and museum for the two hot hands heres williamson on the drive kick out mucus for his eighth made three that one goes begging Applause that was loves first mistake all night a double dribble with 28 seconds left and just when i was ready to sing his praises on the lack of turnovers in the second half got a little careless with the ball Applause and hes still our zaxbys player of the game well forgive the freshman at career high 20 points to lead the tar heels and this north carolina team is going to do something in the acc it all stems from this young inexperienced freshman backcourt playing like they did tonight well i think two things obviously the 20 points yes thats impressive thats the second time a carolina player this season has scored 20 points pullup game but i think this was the key for me right here his defensive pressure in the second half changed this game he was able to get out and transition off the turnovers that he created with his pressure and he was able to show off his hops and to me jay i think to go along with the decision making and the second half again first half he had two turnovers he settled down made some really good reads and didnt turn the ball over in the second half i think that was the key in the key reason why theyre up seven right now with 21 seconds youre right malcolm its not just the 20 points you consider the four rebounds three assists two steals two blocks hes filled out the box score tonight and put together a consistent game in the backcourt for carolina and thats the stat line that roy williams wants to see from this talented guard that he has again you dont want to take away his aggressive nature driving the ball to the hole trying to put pressure but i think at times he controlled the pace made the right reads and got his biggs touches in particular baicot in the second half wake forest is elected not to foul the shot clock is off so north carolina will hold off a valiant effort from wake forest hangs on to win it 8073 roy williams now seven straight acc games that have been decided by seven points or less that is the first time in north carolinas storied programs history that has happened yeah and i think you know look hes a hall of fame coach roy williams the adjustment jay in the second half to pick up full pressure the guards of wake fore
