in division one 362 threepoint field goal attempts per game Well North Carolina for only the fifth time in 35 years when wearing blue uniforms at home calling it happy blue year as we bear down on 2026 Great to have you with us tonight Florida State winning the opening tip They have struggled at times just seven and six coming into this big matchup with the Tarheelss McCra a leaner in traffic and makes it And thats not what you see a lot on Florida State is really attacking the basket scoring points in the paint But cheering North Carolina wants to stay home in those threepoint shooters McCrae does a great job getting to his mid game Well laughter Carolina off to their best start since 0809 and that was a pretty darn good team They won the national championship that year Trying to get it downstairs and no whistle Bogots hit the deck but no foul there The officials tonight excellent crew Roger Ays Lee Cassell and Kip Kissinger will make the calls and a jumper on the way is around and out by Somerville Martin Summerrville whos their number one threepoint guy at 41 Well and this is where North Carolina is so dangerous They theyre one of the top teams in the country defensive rebounding but you put the basketball in Caleb Wilsons hand to initiate offense and has the ability to play off the bounce as well Bills averaging 11 points a game on the dribble Hell step back and launch a long one but two strong rebound tapped and controlled by Chanty Wiggins the former Clemson Tigers Yeah Chanty Wiggins no stranger to playing in this building So he is the one guy that Luke Los can depend upon to provide some experience against the Tar Hills 610 product cant hit He does like to shoot it but hes only making 29 from threepoint land And you mentioned all of that rather extraordinary threepoint shooting by Florida State in terms of the volume but they dont make a ton of them Theyre only making 31 Downstairs for Vasar Theyll swing it up top Pogos open Got a really good look Couldnt connect Those are two wins for the Sims defensively Theyre forcing other players as Somervilles unable to get the three to go down Theyre forcing other players outside of Caleb Wilson and Henry Basar to score the basketball They want to keep it out of the painted area but its difficult to do with this young man with the basketball in his hands The swing for Seth Trimble getting back cheering into the lineup in the last game after breaking his arm a bone in his arm against Kansas in early November Getting him back although misfires cheering here thats going to be huge for North Carolina The Tar Hills three cheering of their four field goal attempts are from beyond the arc and Seth Trimbles going to pick up a foul on the defensive end as McCrae the fifth Simols want to play fast and Robert McCrae the fifth Hes the guy that makes them go wants to get out in transition especially off of North Carolina misses and see if they can get easy ones in transition Hes going to be cheering tipped out of play by the seminals off the hand of Le Jones the 67 senior Luke LS in his first year as a head coach for the Seminals who replaced Leonard Hamilton who retired after 23 years at Florida State Leonard coached him 13 years ago when they won the ACC tournament and they beat North Carolina in the championship game And Luke Lock still holds the ACC tournament record 13 assists in that championship game as Seth Trimble picks up assist finding Kyle cheering and applause Evans for the three Steen on a run out thats going to be deflected out with the cheering North Carolina basketball Tar Hills finally on the board Thats Alex Steen the 69 senior racing up the floor cheering Gives the seven some size Losses to Florida Texas AM Georgia Houston and Dayton They lost to Dayton by 28 the seminals did and Georgia by 34 and amazingly only lost at cheering Florida by two But Luke L made it very clear to us that their offense often determines their effort and this is a team that has to continue cheering to play hard regardless as to where the shots are going together The shot clock winding down Wilson launches a strong cheering one off the backboard and Jones will handle the rebound Florida State totally rebuilt Nine new players from a season ago Not to mention the legendary head coach replaced as well Someville trying to weave his way inside Couldnt lay it in applause Wilson hitting the deck Thats going to be a blocking foul against the Seminals here with 1609 to go in the first half Thats on Martin Somerville the sophomore Picks up number one But OB right now if youre loop out youre happy with your defense even though youre down one North Carolina five of their six field goal attempts have been from three And one of the things that he wants to make sure that happens is you keep the basketball out of the painted area away from Caleb applause and cheering Wilson away from Henry Basar especially at the rim North Carolina has not been great from threepoint land for the season so far 34 But Hubert thinks they are going to shoot it Trimble smashing inside and hes denied Seinals are playing some lock down defense early Jones will pull up and pop Cant hit it off the back iron McCrae zips the pass right back to him on the baseline Stevenson trying to deny him and they push it back outside from McCrae Seven assists per game for the senior from Columbia South Carolina Jones again and that one goes down He banked that one again And thats a tough angle to bank a three from Almost in the dead corner Still able to go off glass Jones had a school record 10 threepointers cheering and the school record against Georgia Southern I think you can see why if he does get going trying to get rolling off the iron and its going to be tipped out of play and stay right here 1512 to go We are in the first half of play and its a happy new year in the ACC A lot of people believe a big year coming in the conference Play instead of those being quad three quad four wins now they can become quad one quad two And those are the things that get you into the NCAA tournament in March Batted out of play by McCrae playing some defense as well Hes averaging 147 assists per game We watched Florida State in shoot around Talk about when that balls in the air Dont lay back and allow players to catch it Contest each and every pass See if you can get deflections to try to throw North Carolina out of their offensive rhythm Derek Dixon talented freshman out of the state of Virginia Guy can really stick the three Shot clock down to five Stevenson misfires The follow wont go Trible getting involved obviously very healthy feeling strong You talked to him after the shoot around today He promised you he would dunk one He he he promised it and I have witnesses He said it in front of you of course in front of Matt Barley our producer Michael Griffin our director So I told him Ive got witnesses You he said Im giving you my word Youll see something tonight Senior co captain cheering at 17 and eight in that Kansas game in which he got hurt Shot clock again down to five Seminals really playing some stickle defense here early on Down to one now Dixon has to launch a long one and it barely got up there and deflected out of play Luke L mixing up his defenses He told us earlier today hes not much of a zone guy but he would throw some zone into the action today Not because they havent played much of it He doesnt feel as though North Carolina would be prepared for it And right now Carolina only one of 11 from the field North Carolina averaging 81 points a game 48 from the field but Davis did not shot it well They will shoot it Ben the slam down the lane cheering goes McCrae So what happened on that play Obie They got the switch Now with cheering watching North Carolina earlier today Im not sure if Basar is supposed to be switching on the guards I think its one through four switches not one through five cheering McCrae was able to take advantage of the five switching order on the last possession North Carolina first six minutes looking like theyre asleep Offensively certainly cheering swing for the corner Trimble will drive it Goes up strong and cheering hell run a foul That was with 46 on the shot clock You see McCrae attacking but cheering hes got an opportunity to play against a foul man And although is a cheering very good defender the majority of his work happens at the rim Having to guard a point guard in the perimeter is tough to ask the big fella to be able to step out there and guard And McCrae able to get his shoulders pass and maybe a highlight that well see later tonight Just might Robert McCrae the senior one of nine children treble at the line They applause dropped in number one McCrae has had an excellent start to his season Transfer from Jacksonville He had a 36point game against Stson while at Jacksonville so he can really sizzle And hes back in the ACC Started his career at Wake Forest went to Jacksonville after his freshman year So told us hes grown a lot Jacksonville made him a much better basketball player and person cheering and hes really looking forward to getting back on this ACC court Hes been a great passer He can also score obviously And I asked him today which do you prefer Do you consider yourself a facilitator or a story He said Whatever it takes And hes got that same matchup once again Unable to get it to go but offensive rebounding And this is another area where the Simol excel over 14 offensive rebounds per game but that one ends up being a turnover for McCrae So North Carolina with the basketball They are 9 and0 here at Chapel Hill this season but a choppy start here tonight 1323 to go in the first half Also 8 day break between games for the Tar Hills where they of course went to Atlanta had a strong performance against Ohio State that saw with the game winner there and then came back here and made 12 threes against East Carolina So Im sure Huger Davis didnt necessarily want to see that break coming when his team was playing so well during the stretch No we came on here talking about how good the front court has been The line rocker wont fall Pow coming off the bench to battle for a rebound Its up in and a chance for a threepoint play cheering Wilson coming in at 20 points 11 rebounds a game Hes been sensational on the glass and this is where he excels Showing off his athleticism his ability to play through contact scoring in the painted area off the offensive rebound Opportunity for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way Obie Thomas Pong the freshman from Paris with the foul Wilson 69 at the line and the threepoint play to make it 87 Talk about 20point games by freshman What a great class legends at North Carolina and he is among them He is among them and again cheering hes still got 18 conference games to play So we could see that number rise throughout the season The game almost lost the Rebel shot clock to seven Regin trying to get in the paint for a turn around and cant hit it Wilson to the corner cheering Pow Yes Jonathan Pow burying triple But we talked about the danger of North Carolina Caleb Wilson who averages 108 rebounds per game has the ability to push and facilitate Theres going to be an offensive foul applause granting the basketball back to Carolina but Caleb Wilson off the rebound has the ability to push be a playmaker in transition and throws an absolute dime to the corner for Pal was able to knock down the three You mentioned how long its been since North Carolina was last on the court They look like theyre waking up now Theyre on an eight nothing run And and coincidentally this crowd seems to get a little louder when they start waking up Funny how that happens students are not here but everybody else is that packed the building pretty much as Wilson draws the foul and the allAmerican candidate starting to get really involved in the offense now for Huba Davis AllAmerican candidate and now Obie at this point hes starting to creep into that national player of the year conversation when you think about what hes doing and its amazing that throughout this season and now were almost two months in the best players in the country are freshmen I mean and Caleb Wilson is absolutely one of those You talk about of course Cameron Boozer AJ Debansa Caleb Wilson these guys have really carried college basketball throughout the season The freshman when you look at it it could be an allAmerican team made up of five freshman Thats how good the freshman have been this year NBA scouts in attendance here to see him tonight applause No question about that He has five points Obie this is an area where Hubert Davis talked about today They want to be able to create some turnovers but they can do it off of free throws The key is they cheering have to make the free throws Lines up a line sinks the three and the seminals really needed that Yeah but thats the way you attack the pressure if youre Florida State when you get those looks And of course theyre never going to turn down a look in transition for three So North Carolina by three Will screaming swing it for Derek Dixon Besar with a touch to the lane put a lot of pressure on him Back out triple and too strong Rebounded away by Chanty Wiggins senior from Atlanta in his fourth year now Lots of conference experience as you mentioned gets it back and lays cheering it out And nice job by Wiggins really fake to the corner BR out of his way allowing him to be able to get to the rim easier Bard down the lane flips it up low cheering and its Wilson a foul for two Every possession Caleb Wilson has to applause be contended with on the offensive glass If hes not taking the original shot you got to make sure you get a body on him or he will find a way for second chance points Wilson leading the Tar Hills in scoring rebounding steals cheering blocks just about everything Treble determined will cheering on a foul and Seth Trimble will head to the line looking for a threepoint play And Obie something that will not be recognized Caleb Wilson setting a screen in transition ESPN Obie we came on air talking about Caleb Wilson playing well beyond his years This a young man who plays the game the right way off a miss Hes out ahead of traffic but instead of him pouting because he doesnt get the basketball he stops and sets a screen for his teammate Seth Trimble to get to the rim He gets the foul gets the hoop and again youve been covering college basketball maybe twice as long as I have Youve seen young guys who when they dont get the basketball often times run away and pout Caleb Wilson makes a play to help his teammate put three points on the board Those are winning basketball plays So he got off to a bit of a quiet start Now he has six rebounds and seven points with about 11 laughter minutes to go in the half which is a a really good game for many guys Got a long way to go What a talent So 1812 North Carolina and an early danger zone for the Seminals but McGee with a terrific shot out of the corner Kobe McGee makes about 32 from three A late switch by Bovots allowing McGee to have just enough space to knock that one down Not enough communication by the Tar Hills on that one Jared Stevenson was a turnover there C able to save it So the save swing up top Long distance wont go by Evans 62 Junior off the mark Coming up on the 10minute mark of the first half Steen on the high post working on Stevenson and a hard drive and cheering its Wilson coming away with another block Thats the other part of Caleb Wilsons game Four blocks for him against East Carolina the last time out But Alex Dean former division 2 player who leads the ACC in offensive rebounding has really been a surprise for Luke Locks squad this year providing constant production on the interior often playing undersized compared to the monsters he has to go up against in the painted area The officials got Jiren Stevenson the junior for a foul on the play So that puts Steen at the line The senior from Florida transfer from Florida Southern cheering Kentucky Alabama Louisville were also in on him Theyve decided to play for Luke LS whose first year at the helm for the seminals Watson NBA style right Yes absolutely And of course we talked about Luke Ls two rings with the Golden State Warriors that player development program and also assistant coach with the Sacramento Kings So Luke L bringing an NBA style of play to Tallahassee and one that of course young players enjoy playing a lot of threes and playing uptempo Man do they want to play fast and fly up the floor Wilson with a pass tipped away from Stevenson 45 on the shot clock here Shot selection so far 53 on the threepointers Staggering number Theyve attempted 150 more threes than their opponents to date Yeah Often times in the NBA you know with only 3 seconds on the shot clock Caleb wasnt able to get a good look By the way Luke LZ told us before he is a cheering bonafide NBA player Its all what what hes seen from Caleb West Quick take out of the corner by Somerville but cant hit it Bogots in transition Cant finish but Mr Wilson does and with authority cheering What else can he do He rebounds it He makes the play His teammate doesnt finish so he cleans up the mess with the tip dump McGee over the top The intended pristine and the slam but he throws that away 2217 Caleb Wilson on with only 3 seconds remaining on the shot clock The nice touch on the turnaround over the top and then as he pushes the break gets to the burger box was able unable to finish but came up there to pick up and clean up the mess Already a solid game working on a double double laughter Nine minutes to go in the half Exactly Yeah Eight rebounds 11 points for Caleb And we showed all the superlatives Hes already has nine double doubles on the season which hes chasing that freshman mark of Antoine James of 13 as well They saw nowhere to go and he threw it away McCrae picked it off for a moment North Carolina winning it back And heres Wilson The fire battle for the rebound And thatll go the other way And a foul here against North Carolina with about eight and a half to play North Carolina 64 and8 in ACC home openers in their storied history Bogots will pick up his first foul One of those eight losses came to at the hands of this Florida State Seminals program Their first ever ACC game in this building as Somervilles able to knock down the three ball Sam Cassell Doug Edwards Rodney Doar Bob Surl coming into this building and picking up their first ever ACC win I knew youd remember that vividly Oh thats my freshman year A tremendous defensive stop by North Carolina Trimble getting up there Yeah and thats what he does He provides that energy especially on the defensive end for this Carolina team cheering Trying to get active keeps it alive on the baseline 751 to go here in the first half Back to Seth Treble to miss 42 days after that broken bone in the arm but undaunted going up for a spectacular rejection to take away a fast break dunk for the Seinals Seven points eight rebounds Working on a 10th double double in just what will be 14 games OB And this young man is relentless on the glass and not just offensively defensively as well but still has the skill to be able to make plays above his teammates and of course that no one else on the floor can make Luke Loss the Seminals head coach in his practice today was saying Hes going to fly Hes going to run the floor Hes going to be everywhere Watch out for number eight Dont lose him Easier said than done Yeah And he also said that many of the NBA scouts that are salividating about them calling him and telling them theyre going to be in the building today Yeah And he said cheering Well I dont know why youre telling me I dont think youre coming to see anybody on my team I know who you guys are coming to see Yes With all due respect we know exactly who everybody wants to see Hes number eight for North Carolina freshman from Atlanta McDonalds allAmerican leading the ACC in rebounds That is a walking double double And not just the scouts theyre actually NBA GMs in the building Ive talked to a couple here already this evening So and thats a welcome sign for Ky Evans knocking down another three his second of the game Transfer from Colorado State Id like to see that scoring come up for Evans the point guard And he had a combined three points in the last two games OB So hes already matched double that in the first half of this one Asar with the rebound North Carolina to run Trouble down the lane takes a hit and he will be off to the line again 2520 North Carolina Coming up next the second game of our double dip as Notre Dame squares off against Stanford at Maples Pavilion in PaloAlto California Beautiful PaloAlto Some high academic scores in that game You start talking about those two schools Yeah you got some uh Yeah those are SATs Im not quite acquainted with I dont think either of us apply Come on You go to Virginia not exactly a charm school nor is University of North Carolina Hubert School Now he was moved to tears in the East Carolina game before Christmas when his son Elijah was a walkon for the Heels scored his first points at North Carolina And of course his dad whos a star in that uniform in the Smith Center erupted like Carolina had hit a buzzer beater on March Yeah And Huber was still emotional talking to us about it earlier today and said I cant imagine many places where three generations of a family have scored in the same cheering program Incredible foul before the shot This is Elijah in the last game got into the contest He heaves it up there His place went crazy knocks down the three right in front of the bench and you see how excited his teammates were Dan tried to act calm in the midst of it Had a conversation with Elijah earlier today We talked with Hubert early asked does he want to coach He had a brief conversation with him pregame and he was a little discouraged by all that his dad deals with in a you know as a as the head coach University of North Carolina simply told him hey you dont have to be the coach here laughter Hey there are many other places you can coach and make an impact Yes its different here This is the big leagues Yes it is Does it get any bigger Trouble denied Heres Evans again All starting to heat up cheering Three threes now for Evans against that zone And the loops made it clear to us If someone else beats us outside of Caleb Wilson MSR we have to live with that But we cant live with those guys scoring 50 points in the paint to beat us This is the biggest lead of the night so far for the Heels Jones on the spin Heres Wiggins from the corner He got an excellent look It cheering would not go down And again its not about the volume for the Seinals when it comes to those threes They only make 31 as a team Evans again not this time So under six to go in the first half here at Chapel Hill Wiggins maybe 610 but he likes to shoot it from long range McCrae poked away by Treble But once again a great defensive job by Caleb Wilson Trimble doesnt have to help off of William Wiggins in the corner because McCrae cant beat Wilson to the basket And so when Caleb Wilson is able to sit down in the stands and guard perimeter players now everyone else can stay home which allows Seth Trimble to get the deflection Wilson affects the game as you said on both ends dramatically for North Carolina Hes guarding the point guard right now That shows you how versatile he is as a player Yuba Davis cheering has him guarding the point guard for Florida State Shot clock dwindling down They cheering do get it inside and a foul with 13 on the shot clock So a bit of a bailout there Thats on Karen Stevenson his second And that will put the seminals to the line Florida State picked 14th in the 18 team ACC this year And Wiggins will have another one coming Hes usually their best foul shooter at 91 Yeah a game like this those opportunities you cant give away especially knowing that youve been able to do a great job defensively on the Tar Hills to this point but in this building youre only going to hold them down so long Florida States going to have to score enough points to be able to beat these heels today He makes one of two 2923 and pressure now from the seminals and theyll back it away That brings out the logo calling out of play now for Hubert Davis Kevin Shot clock inside 10 Trying to lean inside Left it short and a whistle Roger blown a whistle A foul Going to get Caleb Wilson who had a grabbed the arm and then the rebound forcing the ball out of bounds But number one no only the first on Caleb cheering So a sixpoint lead for the Heels McCrae trying to get started Hes really been a magician in terms of the assist hole Seven a game to lead the conference Back downstairs its Wiggins Wiggins denied Its popped cheering up off the backboard Wilson gets it back Oh sure enough cheering the passing skills too and a quick strike as Trible lays it out How many times have we seen that already in this game Caleb Wilson coming up with the rebound and then initiating the transition play that time with a little fancy ball handling off of the rebound that got the crowd here in the Dean E Smith Center on their feet Jaden Young will pick up the foul His first time for a one and one and Coach L going back to his bench Hell bring the big steam back in And Henry Bessar returns to seven quarter for North Carolina And Bessar has been relatively quiet throughout this game So we really consider the fact that Caleb Wilson has done the majority of the work for that front court we came on talking about Besar is scoreless to this point And you talk about a young man who averages over 16 points per game and 92 rebounds So just what happens if he starts to get heated up here cheering Hes done it against some good teams too who had 20 against Kansas 18 and 15 against Georgetown So really hitting the backboards in that one Wiggins with another one coming second half of the one and one Obie there have been six games this season where both Kale Wilson and Henry Bessar have each had double doubles So two guys with double doubles in six separate games throughout this year I mean just a great combination And when you start talking about roster construction bringing in Bessar alongside Caleb Wilson was the perfect compliment to be able to put this front court together for the party From Estonia seven foot junior beautifully run and the slam by Stevenson applause cheering Now so far the play of the night for North Carolina they bolster the lead under four minutes at 3325 McCrae with a triple Rebounded by Trimble applause whos had a lively first half Senior from Wisconsin Trible to drive Little too strong but another whistle applause and a foul with about three and a half to go Some nice passing here by the Heels Yeah the front courts not all about their scoring Caleb with some nice ball handling gets out in transition and then drops the dime to set Trimble cheering and the catching in the middle of the zone Henry Bessar is music able to drop it off to Jiren Stevenson who drops the hammer coach I only wish I could suit up and let it fly but when you consider suiting up and letting it fly thats exactly what Florida State wants to do in this game Unfortunately Obie they have not been able to knock them down We came in talking about what they do from three Four of 14 already in this game And whats the number going to be Do they what do they have to make Theyve had a game where they made 18 earlier in the season Theyre going to have to make that many or even more to try to beat this Carolina team When you take 36 a game and are on pace to do that again in this contest at North Carolina when youre that committed to it you live and die with it right Yes you absolutely do And again you got to have the personnel that does it And Luke Los thinks that theyre a better shooting team than theyve shown as does Hubert Davis thinks his team is a better shooting team than theyve shown throughout this point Well see which one of these two teams starts to pick it up from beyond the arc Downstairs cheering by Dixon to get downstairs to help out defensively Off for Jonathan Pal Dixon will set it up now as we approach three minutes to play at Chapel Hill in the first half Wilson up to set the screen and a kick ball by Steen Itll be North Carolina basketball So the Tarheelss with a lead of 10 starting to look a lot more comfortable than the way the game started but you made a great point early with all the layoff time for North Carolina They were bound to be a little rusty Yeah and again they were playing so well before the 8day break Im sure Huba Davis didnt want to take that time away but they started to pick up a little bit of rhythm especially behind this guy Caleb Wilson down with 13 and cheering nine with still two and a half remaining in the first half Kind of like his chances of another double double right away but the threepointer will silence the crowd momentarily Martin Summerville knocking down another three And this is the guy that Florida State has to rely on to be provide that shooting from beyond the arc Hes been their most consistent threepoint man 41 for FSU Dribble on the dribble wants to spin and fire and it goes down to the touch Nice touch But you know one of the things I love about that OB Trimble makes the move makes the shot But the guy smiling is Caleb Wilson Hes excited to see his teammates have success And thats the type of personality that Huba Davis absolutely wants in this program One of the reason he talks about this is one of the best young men thats ever come through this program not even just the guys hes coached FSU A timeout My man the notorious DB will be on the call 100 pm Stanford North Carolina And then the the night cap LSU averaging 108 points per game Unreal Again you got to tune in to watch that type of action Tipped away and controlled by North Carolina Picked up by Powell trying to add on to their lead Trouble has hit double cheering figures here in the first half kicks it on Somerville Thats a pretty good matchup Looking inside and now up top for Wilson for the corner Around and out by Powell 117 to go in half number one McGee feeding Wiggins Jones hits the deck No travels McGee gets bottled up Heres McCrae open Got it to three And back to back threes for the Simos allowing him to get this back to a eightpoint game So thats the recipe for success for Luke Watson And more importantly the ball changing sides of the floor Multiple guys getting their hands on it Uhoh Well see Uhoh Right for the dunk and drops the foul laughter You werent the only one going uhoh There were some guys in the Garnet and Gold who were doing that But once the fake handoff happened and you see him get his shoulders past a defender right here you know somebody is in trouble Great job by Jones going up and impeding his progress to the rim Otherwise we would be talking about the number one play on Sports Center tonight Without a doubt Jay Jones the 67 senior with the foul to put Caleb Wilson at the line He makes 69 Thats another area of concern for Huba Davis He feels like not only can they but they must become a better free throw shooting team as the season goes along in order to have the type of success that he feels that this team has the potential to reach So but this is the area where he wants to be able to pick up full court whether its in their 23 mantoman fullcourt pressure or their diamond press but they have to make the free throws to set up their pressure Yeah As a team theyre 68 They want to be somewhere in the mid70s if they can So 43 seconds before the break here at Chapel Hill North Carolina recovering from a pretty quiet start Somerville way downtown but no Wiggins kicks it alive back for McGee launch and he hits that one Always the best time to shoot the three on the offensive rebound This team averaged over 14 offensive rebounds cheering a game and that one turns into three second chance points with nine Hes three for three cheering from downtown and a timeout Just under 20 seconds North Carolina to drop a play before halftime Well North Carolina was closing in on pushing this to blowout territory but back on the seminals hitting the triples and Kobe McGee three of three from beyond the ark in this game has stepped up and made big plays for his team as well as McCrae able to knock down the three So the back court for Florida State providing a punch here down the stretch of this first half They made three of their last four from beyond the arc and made it a sixpoint game So Hubert Davis calling a timeout The shot clock off 197 on a game clock before halftime and a sixpoint game is going to get Kobe McGee back in 32 from the threepoint line for McGee named after Kobe Bryant Inbounded for Trimble Hell set it up Down to 10 seconds McCrae guarding him Down to six Treble on the attack and cheering and applause its going to be a travel So an opportunity here for the Seinals to make it uncomfortably close by halftime Yeah Going to get Martin Somerville back in the game A threepoint shooter And this is a guy that could be dangerous as he passes the basketball in if he gets it back and is able to run into a three McCrae pass midcourt gets a look and cant hit it where he was really the guy that was the difference maker for them And so when you consider the fact that he didnt score in that first half Luke Gl has to be extremely proud of what his team did defensively but very aware of what he would do here as they get the ball to him to start the second half Boy that was right on Q And the slam for the sevenfooter from Estonia to make it 4234 Carolina McCre top assist man in the conference getting it downstairs and gets a foul too Alex will pick up the personal Hubert Davis clearing the side and what you see of four Tar Hills on one side of the floor which takes away the help on the backside When youve got a 7 foot one post player all you have to do is deliver the basketball over top of the defensive hand and hes going to get an easy one with there No no one to help on the back side So Steen at the line makes the first 69 for him Boy Florida State Talk about getting into the thick of the ACC A rough schedule Theyve got North Carolina Duke and NC State in succession to begin the ACC I believe thats what you call tobacco row laughter Thats what you call a gauntlet Yes it does The gauntlet on tobacco road Welcome to the ACC again Luke LS who of course was an ACC tournament champion at Florida State in 2012 Knows his way around the league but the league is a lot different than it was when he left in 2012 Now 18 teams in the ACC Well Carolina has a schedule coming up where theyre going to play on the road three schools out of four that and theyve never played there before Never played at SMU never played at Stanford never played at Cal but those are three of their next four games on the road And you consider the fact that the the Tar Hills will only play two home games in the month of January Ste with the Jones to penetrate and cheering block by Wilson He came out of nowhere ON THE OTHER END LAYS IT OFF AND in and cheering I cant wait to for us to see the replay of what Caleb applause Wilson did defensively on that possession Johnson is able to get to the midrange and knock down the three which isnt the shot that Luke L wants Only 3 of their shots come from the mid sloppy with North Carolina usually very stingy with the turnover Ste went for the scoop and let fouls back to the line Its going to be number three on Basar Watch this Obie He waits for Jones to get to the other side of the basket Lets him get past him knowing that hes going to the reverse Hes cheering going to block the shot but more importantly he blocks the shot and then keeps it to be able to kick the basketball ahead Great play defensive end of the floor by Caleb Wilson Hes provided so much offensively already doing a job on both ends the great Bill Russell and he would say the greatest shot blocker the game ever saw was a magician at exactly what you just described Yes Blocking the shot cheering denying the two points but keeping it in play and often directing it back to a Celtic Yes And again that allows the Tar Hills to start the break And now you look at cheering the division one leader in double doubles Caleb Wilson in double figures third nationally in double doubles Two missed free throws Obie crumble cookies for everyone in the crowd except me You cant because youre on a very very strict diet You may sneak a box or two on your long drive tonight You know me too well Bogavas will swing for Evans Evans beyond the three Shot clock dwindling down North Carolina had to heave it 4438 FSU still hanging in here but a turnover for the Seinals Oavas will bring it out So far hes had a rough game The 66 junior from Montenegro He finds Stevenson Evans will plant and fire And a second effort now for North Carolina And you can see the seminars will sell completely out to keep the basketball out of Caleb Wilsons hands in the paint Thats going to open up opportunities for Evans Bogots and Treble on the perimeter Bogots down the paint Flips it up there Kind of a wild shot Wilson cant tip it in Hell get another look Heres Evans That came off the hand Very ugly and out of play applause And Evans shot the basketball very well Three of five from three in the first half Dont expect to see a guy shoot a air ball but this Tarhill team had eight different guys make a three in their last performance here against East Carolina Only two guys have made one in this game and Evans has made three of them Theyre four of 18 from beyond the arm A little blood there for Seth Treble Always seems to be nicked up Not quite as bad as the broken bone in the arm but went into the crowd after the layup on the break He plays hard Senior from Wisconsin They played well without him And if youre the head coach and one of your best players misses 42 days and you go 81 without him youre feeling pretty good about your team But that one was Michigan State They really missed him in that game just his toughness and his experience having played in so many big games like that before and has experience playing against Michigan State played against them in Maui a season ago So was absolutely missed in that game but you look forward to having him back and now this team gets better with Seth Trimble back on the floor Now while he was out they won at Kentucky by three 6764 And right before Christmas they snuck past Ohio State by one point But the big story was Trimble coming back The return of him after the broken arm Thats 15 points a game And all sorts of valuable leadership for North Carolina And he can defend like crazy Yeah look what hes doing on the defensive end of the floor making life miserable for McCrae Jones comes from the corner and will set the three McCrae was fortunate to get that tremble off of him with the switch and then is able to attack the paint and do what he does best ACC leading 71 assists per game Drops another dime A little rumble goes through the crowd here at Chapel Hill as it tightens up again Yeah some of those remained a one possession game with their three not to lead the three Carolina missing five straight shots Trimble trying to end that up top Evans straight on His last couple of shots have not looked good at all And a threepoint lead here for North Carolina Its the recipe of success for the Simos A touch to paint and find a teammate on the outside McCrae determined drive and a kick for Somerville Hes been their number one threepoint man Second effort Jones on the spin working on Trible Backing him down Lays it out Nice play by Jones didnt cheering settle for the three Use the size against Trimble to get to the rim and get a layup FSU within one on the road to Chapel Hill cheering North Carolina for only the fifth time wearing home blue uniforms Downstairs Wilson will not miss that cheering one But Wilson continued to work He wanted the basketball on the high low Florida State selling it completely out cheering to make sure he doesnt give it Theyll give up the shot on the perimeter but that time Caleb works across the block cheering to get great position A big crowd of about 22 23000 on hand even without the students at Chapel Hill cheering Somerville off the fake Jones is open applause Florida State with an opportunity there to tie the ball game And theyve been down by as many as a dozen And a long distance shot too strong off the back iron by Dixon You dont mind Dixon taking that shot but hes got an advantage against when he has to go to the rim Holy cow Went for the slam but came up empty cheering and a whistle on the play with 1509 to go and a ball game here at North Carolina tonight Le Jones attacking off the bounce able to use his size music Great footwork to finish but Caleb Wilson the answer on the other end Post position and the finish Sure The Ohio State fans might have something to say about that Just just a bit 4643 Sevens with the ball and an opportunity to tie again Last time they led this game it was 7 to five We see that matchup again with Caleb Wilson guarding McCrae Now they get the switch and McCraes been able to beat Basar off the bounce able to do so on that possession but cant finish Wilson in transition on his best side with a dunk and thats how hes gotten his four points in this game and a great play by Derek Dixon attacking the basket and then dropping it off to the big fell defend trying to use his touch Suddenly Henry Vasar is beginning to become a problem for the Seinals and came out of the game with just under two minutes having been played in that first the second half as Pals able to knock down his second three of the game So Hub Davis got us all out quickly but now cheering and applause getting him back in the game He was playing with a little bit different intensity Carolinas number two scorer number two rebounder behind Caleb Wilson See if McCrae can get rocking and rolling He is the heart and soul of the offense for FSU And thatll be knocked down by Chanty Wiggins applause 610 He likes the threepoint shot Yeah And thats just a defensive mistake by Seth Treble And Seth knows better to be able to give Chanty Wiggins that type of space At 610 as you mentioned once he gets into his shooting form theres not much you can do with it as a small guard Chanty closing in on a double double Jumbo lines up a long one He got a great look Wilson Oh he beat everyone to the ball and a foul AS B WILL GO TO the line cheering But how about the hustle by the freshman Wilson to get to that Thats it Obie He He made the crosscourt pass with Seth Trimble to get the three And as the shot comes off Caleb Wilson comes all the way from the opposite wing outruns not only the Simols but everyone on his team as well to pick up an offensive rebound and then picks up his fourth assist once he corrals Well you got to love playing with a guy like that Absolutely But look at the smile This This is what I love And Ive known this young man for a very very long time This is who he is He is a great person And thats one of the things that Hubert Davis just raves about how good of a young man he is and how much hes meant to this program GPA in high school is 38 So he got it done every way you can get it done McGee off to Wiggins the swing for the corner and a long one is round and out by Miles He gets it back Heres Wiggins to launch Thats in and out Another loose ball Trimble finally comes away with it for North Carolina on the drive and a foul by Jones Smart play by Seth Trimble recognizing with Jones having to defend him oneonone with a full head of steam just getting to the rim finding a way to get to the rebound to get to the free throw line after Carolinas able to get the defensive rebound where theyre one of the best in the country but Florida State has made it difficult on them going after the offensive glass Jay Jones with his third foul Usually an excellent foul shooter 83 Jones will hit the bench now for coach LS And number two for the senior missed them both shot Seth got a lot of time with that broken left forearm to be able to shoot free throws Saw him in the gym doing a lot of one hand work You mentioned 83 You dont see a guy like that miss too often Miles another excellent opportunity but cant hit it applause And its going to go the other way The North Carolina basketball cheering Another hustle play by Seth Trimble Yeah How many times have we seen Seth actually in the stands on either end of the floor Weve seen him tumble over into the Carolina faithful a number of times throughout this game Oh he needs to buy a ticket Hes spending more time in the stands than he is on the court right now but you know Hubert Davis just loves the effort and having him back and everything that he means Hes going to get a breather here Completely different dynamic having him back in the lineup as you see him going after the loose ball And you know even though that may not actually be a a real seat he takes one I agree with you You got to buy a ticket to sit there I think thats an expensive seat here at Chapel Hill 5346 Dixon All talent from the freshman around the logo The shot clock inside Tim gets free WILSON WITH THE cheering SLAM BY TOMAHAWK Oh my That was resounding applause Well that brought the building to life in a big way cheering applause Wiggins will fling it here for McGee And around and out it goes But another effort now Somerville keeping it alive Miles on the drive The scoop shot No cheering Allar comes away with a loose ball applause Dixon with a quick penetration Finds the open shooter and a knockdown three And cheering a timeout Florida State applause Momentum is an amazing thing Obie And the momentum has been created by Caleb Wilson The finish with what a play that looked like it was going to be a disaster for North Carolina Turns out to be cheering a Sports Center top 10 highlight This might be number one for their Tuesday OB music Wilson 18 points 14 rebounds four assists seven out of 11 from the field Still has 12 minutes to go And the highlight of the game as Derek Dixon attacks the basket Caleb Wilson doesnt wait for the basketball He makes an impact with his cutting attacking the basket and then of course the highlight level finish above the rim and I believe we will see that as our top play of the day As Bud say that play went from absolutely nothing to Sports Center Yeah I mean Dixon was getting pressured on the perimeter and then once he finally was able to get past Somerville is when magic happened to say the least 44 dice for Wilson leading division one among many categories where he is tops in the ACC and the pass interrupted Got to Jones though and he cant sink it So North Carolina with an opportunity to put the hammer down LS couldnt wait He had to call the timeout even though he was under 12 m their largest lead and once again clearing that backside who has been a factor in the second half Dan Wilson with his fifth assist because if you take him out of the area then who the next tallest guy guarding cant even get over there to try to defend Basar once he catches the ball over the top McGee slamming on the brakes Little spin move Cant finish So Dixon will set it up here Puts it to the deck DUMPS IT FOR WILSON ANOTHER SLIDE 11 nothing run He gets to 20 points for the sixth consecutive game cheering He passes the great Phil Ford who did in five straight games The long launch No And all the momentum to the cheering men in blue McCrae is on the line LOOK AT IT cheering And so that will be North Carolina ball Big smile there from Phil the first time a freshman has scored six straight 20point games Of course Phil Ford maybe the music first great freshman in the ACC the first freshman to ever win ACC tournament most valuable player and of course Mr Four Corners loves to be here watching this Now hes all business again The score was 443 just a few minutes ago Since then North Carolina an 183 run and Florida State only two of 11 from beyond the threepoint arc in this second half Thats the way they were able to get back into the game North Carolina locking down defensively cheering allowing them to build their biggest lead of the game Evans on the dribble will fire it up But theyre part of the offense just get a shot on the glass because with those two guys on the interior youve got a great chance of being able to get off Its a rebound Well see a little too strong with that turn around Somerville trying to cut into the deficit Theres Jones has a size advantage here and knocks that one down taking advantage of Evans Hes 67 against 62 So Jones with 10 They need a hot hand though Wilson trying to jump closer applause to the 10 Hell draw the foul Thats going to be four Jay Jones the senior actually going to get Somerville to change that Its going to be done Somerville and thatll be his third 919 to go at Chapel Hill double up immediately gets rid of it They find the open shooter in power and outs Yeah another offensive rebound OB Thats part of the offense for the Tar Hills They average over 12 offensive rebounds per game Hubert Davis made it clear to us 38 of their misses theyre going out and getting And so he likes what theyre doing on the offensive glass He still feels they can be better Wilson trying to beat Jones and throws it away up ahead and foul against cheering North Carolina Thomas Bon a 68 freshman from Paris will head to the line with 850 to go And the foul on the poul will be his first Believes going to get Caleb a bit of a breather here One of the things about when you play as hard as Caleb Wilson does guys I mean and coaches ask you play till exhaustion and again thats of course one of the reasons he wears a number eight Kobe Bryant cheering and thats what Kobe said Play till exhausted play till youre exhausted And Caleb does that and Huber Davis recognizing it Going to get Caleb a breather here 850 remaining Most likely we see him back once cheering we come from the applause next media timeout But I love the way that the relationship between he and Hubert Davis goes We saw in the shoot around earlier today after they went over the scouting report and when Caleb was actually raising his hand to ask questions he goes over to Hubert and asks him about how do you guard a specific option Those two had about two three minute conversation while the rest of the team went on about their shooting drill And Hubert was very complimentary of the rookie during the workout today about four or five times He said Nice job Kale Nice job Thats exactly right Kale Really has a special relationship indeed with him Evans three on the way Treble on the weak side with the rebound Theyll get another chance He has six I believe thats three straight possessions where theyve gotten an offensive rebound after the initial action Shot clock to five Evans trying to drop it Runs right into a wall Got it up there anyway And it will be FSU basketball So we are under eight and its North Carolina with a 6249 lead in their ACC opener with FSU Presentation of college basketball is brought to you by K the official partner of Couples who love the game We love dunks and Caleb Wilson can provide those more than anybody in division one Big freshman from Atlanta Another sensational game another double double Obie coming into Calebs senior year of high school really the spring before he spent a lot of time on the perimeter and that was one of the areas of concern where people were wondering okay how good is this young man really He made a almost a mentality shift and he decided Im just going to dominate people on the paint and you see what what he does in transition He has the perimeter skill but once he made a decision that he was going to just dominate in the paint is where we got to see this guy that were seeing now as Cody McGee able to knock down the three ball But it was the combination of that and joining Cameron Katie Boozer for the Night Riders and he left the Georgia Stars to go play with the Night Riders and the rest is history He learned how to play with other great players which is part of the reason why hes helping this team win so much Had a breather there Hes back on the floor Just want to be a dog I want a respect from everybody I feel like Im the best player in the country and all I can do is go prove it And he has done so time and time again Now with his 10th double double and six straight 20point game 20 along with 14 rebounds and five assists Turn around and that wont go by Maloop Maloop 611 sophomore who is the cousin of Ball Ball of the Phoenix Suns getting some late minutes here with about seven minutes to go and the foul will go against Evans of North Carolina Maluk who made his first threepointers of his career the la two last two of the last three games knocked down two threes and again Luke LZ of course is encouraging everyone on that roster to shoot the three didnt make one as a freshman last year has already made two in the season cheering on the inbounds got a hand on it and hes had an excellent second half yeah really has hes done all of his work in the second half hes only two points away from a double double having not scored in the first 20 minutes he gets a touch up Heres Treble Wilson will swing the shot by Evans Got it Timely shooting by Evans Five for him on the evening Yeah 15 points He came in averaging only six points a game Theyll give up the layin But if Evans can get anywhere near that kind of offensive production but it goes back to what Luke Lou told us earlier Hey if the other guys beat us were just going to lose We just cant allow it to be Caleb Wilson and Basar as Wilson continues to beat them in the painting applause and cheering area So its really been a combination of both for the Tar Hills Wilson had to adjust his shot midair Made it anyway Jones off the fake taking on Wilson oneonone Got a three but a jumper and that wont drop for the loop on a run out Trimble got to beat everybody and to draw a foul as he hits the deck and once again takes a pretty good hit right into the stansion Crowd didnt like it I tell you what I dont like and its difficult not to do but Seth of course recovering from that broken forearm on that left arm Every time hes gone to the floor which has been a lot throughout this day he has put that left arm down And so and Ive been over here just wincing as you watch him go in for the basket And again thats I dont think thats anything extra but watch him put that left arm down Thats cheering the scary part to me And then he did have surgery to repair the forearm the break So it has been officials are going to get together here with 553 to go Hubert Davis had come over and talked to Lee Cassell Lets see if they take a look as far as something extra Yeah Did Hubert challenge this Is this an appeal or did this conversation Okay Hes not going to challenge it No challenge Yeah theyre going to get everybody back on the floor Hes not going to challenge that I dont I dont think I I think like that decision I dont think that was anything extracurricular You know McCrae just got his hand in there trying to get the basketball away And when you jump off of one foot as a basketball player you cant balance yourself in the air So a tough fall by Seth but I dont think there was anything malicious on that play So Trimble to shoot two 12 points so far for the senior applause Still time here for the seinals to make a run and to climb back in this game Treble with a second foul shot and makes the pair applause So back up to 15 Ron McCrae the senior on the crossover thats strong and its going to be up and in by Maloo to follow the shot Nice play by Maloo Flashing the glass after the shot blockers go to get it Theres no one there to keep him from getting the second chance points Double up trying to get free Gets it to Wilson thought about it Been tremendous beyond a threepoint line and sitting 50 Evans off the dribble No 5 minutes to go here at the Smithson Is McGee to launch but no And Maluke over the back commits the foul And that bucket if McGee was able to knock that down would have made it 10point game And McGees really provided a lot of perimeter shooting for the some of those in this game made a couple at the end of the first half to make it a sixpoint game but a big one there that could have made it a 10point game and given the nose a little bit of life here under five minutes Now Robert McCrae the senior back to the bench the ACC assist leader and North Carolina has made life difficult for him tonight Has five turnovers for McCrae Taros defense has been stellar all season long This is one of the best defenses in the country Wilson gets a clean look but no Rebound tapped away Great effort by Pal trying to get offensive rebound but gives them those numbers and a foul on the deck with 423 remaining and North Carolina on top 69 56 Evans will take a seat and Dixon back on Its going to be two fouls on Ky Evans whos had a strong game here tonight He really has Five threes for him came in averaging six points and a foul cheering Angry himself Yeah And again with Maloo catching it that far away from the basket Trimble puts him at the free throw line and really gives the Simols a great chance to put points on the board without the clock having to run Yeah And still with over four minutes to go Yeah Se disappointing himself for not making Maluke have to work for points The sophomore only 58 at the foul line Tipp to the corner and saved by Somerville Wiggins will fire quickly Got it Now they live and die by the three and try to make their way back into game He has 13 and its a 10point game And thats that big shot they were looking for You can see the Florida State bench got a standing up and the basketball being mishandled by Dixon The crowd here still a little anxious after the turnover Unable to really get separation from the Sims And thats eight turnovers for H Daviss team And the Sims as you mentioned Obie they live and die by the three music And right now theres life on the Florida State bench after Chanty Wiggins makes it a 10point game Notre Dame and Stanford to come Couple of the better scorers in America will be on your TV screen Yeah Cory 228 per game And when you consider the fact that hes second so Cameron Boozer in the ACC in scoring Boozer actually leads division one in scoring as a freshman So weve got an elite class of freshman this season Again FSU trying to come back Thats been the theme of the night trying to make a comeback Wings and Wilson comes away with it And his defense throughout this game may be just as impressive as what hes done on the offensive end of the floor Weve shown a number of times where hes allowed defenders to get to that offensive players to get to their spot to only block their shot once they get comfortable and does not foul So 307 left This was a 16point lead not long ago for North Carolina Triple shot wont fall Besar back and two I love the way Bessar tries to dunk everything around the rim Theres no finesse cheering Hes not going to give his opponents an opportunity to block his shot and put it on the glass He goes and finishes strong with two hands cheering Knocked away from him Theft by Treble in transition No Scooped up by Jones Florida State not done yet Still firing up the threes and a scrap for the rebound and a tie up on the play possession hour will keep it on this end with 227 to go and Kobe McGee had a solid game Hes four for eight from threepoint land Hes back on now for the NLES Offensive possession Luke La going to look to see if he can get another quality look from three and find a way to make this a singledigit game as Jiren Stevenson checks back in for Vesar who now has joined Caleb Wilson Now the seventh game where both guys have racked up double doubles McCrae had a quick step to his left and knocks it down Once again North Carolina not going to leave shooters on the perimeter Theyll take their chances with McCrae finishing at the basket He does on the last possession Nine points Came in averaging 14 Dixon wiggles free The pass to Stevenson He cant bury it McCra for the rebound She again trying to make a run here The three wont drop for McGee The rebound tapped out of play Theyll stay right here 148 to go The time the enemy of the FSU seminals right now And Basar coming back on now for North Carolina Going to get Stevenson and Bessar We watched him get a hand on the basketball and underneath out of bounds play a deflection that led to a turnover So got to be very careful trying to make a pass over the sevenfooter Jones kicks it out The swing from McCrae Too strong Loose ball numbers here Twoon one Tremor finishes with the dunk He kept cheering his word Obie He told you back on the shoot around at about 200 cheering this afternoon he was going to have a dunk in this game and it was a pretty spectacular one Yuba Davis had to go hurry cheering Seth up make sure he got across before 20 hit the shot clock with another slam as he will draw the foul Seth Treble getting out in transition This has to feel great for him as hes still knocking off some of the rush trying to get back into playing shape but being able to get out in transition with the dunk But I can tell you what weve seen a number of highlights throughout this game Caleb Wilsons dunk still number one Number two might be Huba Davis sprinting from the out of the coachs box to hurry Seth Trumble up to make sure they dont get the the backourt violation I think you might be right Showing on some wheels there Yuba was joking with us today They just spent some time in the gym He said Look its not like Im doing a lot of squats with big weights laughter or not throwing a lot around in that gym But while working out I missed him in his workout Hubert comes in and he walks around the court for 20 minutes with his headphones in you know just trying to find his place of peace for a little while Did it before he goes to the weight room So normally Im in the gym when hes doing it Missed him today FSU will take a timeout 52 seconds to go and 75 the incoming freshman class for this year to the ACC has absolutely benefited the depth of this conference Well the big crowd here at the Smith Center certainly in a holiday mood and about ready to celebrate a victory against an ACC rival North Carolina trying to go to 65 and8 all time in home openers in the ACC and 46 seconds away from doing that in a foul right around midcourt Our ACC huddle crew has Miami covered tomorrow for the college football playoff quarterfinal matchup music at Ohio State Looking forward to that game tomorrow night to check that out I still think that we got to go to 16 games OB me college football playoff The numbers one through four seeds deserve to get a home game and I think the home game environment in the college football playoff thats been a tremendous addition but I think the first four seeds should also have an opportunity to play a home game Totally agree Trimble at the line 467 to go helping to ice this one for North Carolina Trimble with 18 points seven rebounds and a lot of gutsy plays Yes and has spent a lot of time in the stands laughter on both ends of the floor Is going to need ice after this game No longer the young guy Hes the vet on this team now Got the dunk in there McCrae moving to the left hand with a miss and rebounded away by North Carolina Kson 22 and 16 rebounds and six assists No question cheering he was the number one star for North Carolina And Basar got all 12 of his points in the second half He had a double double as well 12 points 12 rebounds A solid performance for the Tar Hills Yuba Davis made it very clear to us he feels like this team can be better applause but I believe winning game one in ACC action has really given them that opportunity to see what they can do as the season goes along And Treble getting a 20 Florida State getting a threepointer in the air as Wiggins will knock that down And that will do it The final score here tonight North Carolina 79 and Florida State 66 Strong performance by the Tar Hills opening up ACC action
