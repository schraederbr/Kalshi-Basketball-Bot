Music you can certainly put the ball on the floor and make plays Music heres Julian Reese really coming into his own as a sophomore but denied by Huntley hatsby he just sat right on that left hand and Im really interested to see Julian Reese tonight as the competition ramps up he has gotten off to a fantastic start this season though nice driving dish by L Ellis Jalen Withers though Off the Mark they are two of the three captains for the Cardinals this year along with Sydney Curry coming off the bench for the second straight game good footwork by Dante Scott looked like a totally different person lost 25 pounds in the off season and it has shown the work hes put in hes played like an allconference player putting defenders in the mix on that possession averaging 15 and a half points six and a half rebounds per game shooting lights out Alice on second effort the roll goes Mike James the redshirt freshman from Orlando draws Louisville back within a point a nice Cut initially by Mike James you get the dribble drive from Al Ellis and were going to see that all night foreign Applause numbers coming out of Marylands start to the season coming into this game the Terps as they still play from in front have trailed for just three minutes and 23 seconds thats through six games 240 game minutes and their largest deficit was the last time out against Coppin State they trailed by three for an instant I think thats why Kevin Willard when we talked to him at shoot around today was really looking forward to just seeing what this team is going to look like with a little bit of adversity they played so well at the Mohegan Sun against two quality opponents in St Louis and Miami but life on the road even with Louisville being 06 it can present different challenges and Im sure thats what coach Willard is looking forward to seeing here tonight and they were not challenged their last time out home on Friday against Coppin State where they had three players go for more than 20 off the bounce Jamir Youngs got five early points he is so good at getting back to that left hand and now just making a play thats just a really poor pass from Jalen Withers the guy whos turned the ball over at will this year uh Hart makes them pay Applause Ellis looking to go in Dan a little strong off the window not a high percentage look there youre going to the two Maryland Defenders long rebound off to James Miss comes to Don Kerry The Graduate transfer from Georgetown and a blocking foul called against the Cardinals well early Marylands defense turning into offense heads up play by Jamir Young making a play on the ball now the fight for it Hakeem young going through cotton went off and that that picture I mean its just its jarring to see him now today his body its its a complete transformation he is playing at the highest level of his career early on this season and not every new coach could come into a situation and say those things to a player and have it work out the right way but Kevin Willard did have a relationship with director Scott trying to recruit him to Seton Hall a few years ago and they have just picked up where they left on tough shot by Ellen side of bounds Louisville will keep well Kevin Willard spent the last 12 years with the Pirates five times to the NCAA likely was going to go in 2020 as well and have the opportunity to move on Maryland and so far he has been up to the challenge Applause bumped before the shot by The Freshman Kamari lands thats his first personal since coming off the Louisville bench the Louisville defense has not been great on the season but your defense cant be good if you are continuously giving the basketball away its a really nice steal by Hakeem Hart anticipating that pass but still just so casual from Kamari lands Music the line of Keem Hart you like that his usage rate is up this year well last year he was in the top 15 in terms of offensive rating in all of college basketball but he was on so low usage with bats Russell Eric Ayala those guys certainly dominated the offense but I just think that a kind of a change of scenery new head coach and look Kevin Willards gonna demand that you defend at the highest level but he is going to give you Freedom offensively to play hes always been like that just think Hakeem Harts a player thats pretty good at everything he has a lot of positive things on the floor rebounds defends and now this season has shown offensively what hes capable of well how many teams in the Big Ten or around the country have two six eight wings as versatile as these two guys with him and Dante Scott the way that they have played and then a young big and Julian Reese starting five is incredibly talented for Maryland I think the question is going to be how much production can you get off the bench well they are on a 100 run here to open up the 154 lead while Louisville has missed its last six shots from the floor 15 on the shot clock here is Ellis the senior from Durham North Carolina and he dribbled it off his leg out of bounds turnover number five in the first six and a half minutes last season LL Ellis really a scoring guard and thats what his game is and because of the roster makeup hes been forced to play the point I think it is important though that we keep noting with with the NCAA investigation still going on into this summer it was really difficult for Kenny Payne to convince anybody especially you think about grad transfers one and twoyear guys to come play they want to play in the NCAA tournament Music its a 13nothing run yeah no question about it Robbie and the feeling around here is that yes it is tough at the moment but now that that cloud has been lifted they are going to finally be able to turn the page you can just feel the energy and this building has been totally Zapped the Louisville Cardinal faithful looking for any type of positive play to get behind but it this has been all Maryland here so far Ian Martinez Off the Bench soaring in Dante Scott kept it alive but pulled away by Brandon Huntley Hatfield Ellis off the bounce that snaps the Maryland run tough shot by LL is coming off that ball screen just rising up Applause one of the key points shared by Kevin Willard at their shoot around today was that weve got to attack and go after Al Ellis and wear him out you just its every play hes got the ball on his hands here we go again hes just gonna play pick and roll and look to get to the basket big night for these Maryland guards in terms of their oneonone defense well committed on the region by Johari long that is his first Ian Martinez no more as being an athlete but Louisville is starting to go a little 23 Zone to get the dribble system you know he had a sixyear run as an assistant coach here at Louisville under Rick Pitino so coming back to Louisville even though when he was on staff they played at Freedom Hall asked him what its like for him to come back and he immediately thought about his young son Colin who was born here and thats what he thinks of first and uh from what he says Colin and brother Chase are back home with Kevins wife Julie watching the ball game tonight and watching their team off to a quick start also cool to see him reminisce about just how many good people that he got to to see on his return trip here another tough shot there this time by Jalen Withers but you could just tell that this has a special place in his heart you know being an assistant under Rick Pitino and the job that that staff did go to the 2005 Final Four on todays Scott will have a chance for a threepoint play theyd love to run this action for Dante Scott where it looks like its going to be a dribble handoff he keeps it instead and burns it right to the basket again on display Dante Scotts ability to make plays for himself was on Roosevelt and Wheeler selevin sophomore from Richmond Virginia into the game Noah bachelors come on for Maryland number 11 in Black Julian Reese the uh very good sophomore Center back on the floor as well for the Turks Withers runs into Reese goes around him but a whistle and a foul wow second foul line Julian Reese sophomore from Baltimore whos been on quite a role lately we talked about uh you know when youve got a coaching change Kevin Willard comes in and he assesses what the roster is and he very much wanted Julian Reese to stay and Pitch the fact that he would coach him up and cited his success at Seton Hall with a couple of other bigs in recent years between Angel Delgado and Sandro momokevili who now plays for the Milwaukee Bucks certainly Kevin Willards track record of developing big something that he could point to and I think from just from watching Julian Reeds play last year it was so apparent how much ability he has and he has shown that early on in the season coming off a careerhigh 24 points against Coppin State also has 11 offensive rebounds the last two hes shooting 80 percent from the field on the year hes been tremendous well coming up next over on ESPN and the ESPN app at 9 30 Eastern the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge rolls on with number three Virginia taking on Michigan in Ann Arbor and UVA seems to be back to UVA boy and not just their defense but their offense has been phenomenal theyre shooting the ball at such a high clip getting to the foul line they look like the real deal and you know their defense is going to bring it but their offense has been great too a rare Miss for Dante Scott long rebound comes to Martinez reset the shot clock to 20 then he threw it out of battles Hakeem Hart was going back door but the pass was behind him Music Don Kerry comes back in replacing Ian Martinez John Kerry is one of the DMB guys on Kevin Willards roster which theyve done a marvelous job cleaning up for next year in terms of their incoming recruits and that has been so important over the years and over the decades at the University of Maryland thats certainly been a point of emphasis and youre talking about one of the most Talent rich areas in all of the country in terms of high school basketball so Kevin Willard no surprise there for him to mind that pipeline I brought in a couple of assistant coaches who know that area well David Cox the former URI head coach is from Landover and Tony skin is from Tacoma Park so they know the ins and outs they know the high schools they know the aaus winding down to the midpoint of the first half here at the KFC Yum Center in the ACC Big Ten challenge Music five on the shot clock tough shot and apparently it was off the cylinder as Jamir young crashing the offensive glass now has nine points it was close but thats a heck of an effort from Jamir young your point guard crashing in and then on the flip side of that Mel Ellis leaving his feet to pass and throwing it to Kevin Willard look at the way he just flies in boy thats really close to being in that cylinder this will give us a pretty good look here I think he was off I do too thats a great play by Jamir Young and for somebody who has transferred from a mid major from Charlotte up to Maryland he has integrated very well and seems to be a natural leader where that could potentially be a difficult task its all about fifth Kevin Willard talked about that at shoot around today how he was going to take anybody that he thought couldnt help this team in terms of a chemistry perspective this is a a threetime allconference USA selection and a guy that scored the Rock at a high level Music Withers know and there is number one Jamir young dribbling up himself Hakeem Hart dump it off Scott and hell pull it back out young spotting up and the rebound comes to Jalen Withers thats the one thing for Maryland this year thats been a little hit or miss you know they have run hot and cold shooting the ball from the perimeter thats a wide open shot gotta knock those down if youre Maryland Terrapins L Ellis with his second basket Applause traveling violation and the folks who are here at the KFC Yum Center starting to come to life Louisville making some things happen you know its going to be a big game in terms of having to guard L Ellis off the bat I think Kenny Payne expects a lot from Jalen Withers Music but getting it all out of him so far has has been a challenge had a tough sophomore year and certainly just turn it over hasnt shot it great this season but hes got to be a guy that raises his game theres the former Louisville star from back in the 1980s back in his alma mater for his first years head coach recently turning 56 years old and its not like this Louisville roster does not have talent Robbie there are a number of former ESPN 100 recruits no doubt and LLS the number one Juco player in the country so that there is talent but the makeup of it is incredibly rare in any level of basketball where its just its almost all floors thats why they should be a better rebounding team because theyre huge but they get off to a rough start to the year losing three consecutive onepoint games trying to get win number one tonight cheers getting close already nine points three rebounds four of seven from the field the transfer from Charlotte really does some good things on the offensive end of the floor but you know hes always going to play hard and compete the steal here just an active first half for Jamir young certainly Kevin Willard gonna be pleased with his point guard and jamiro young as we mentioned from Upper Marlboro Maryland out of DeMatha Catholic High School which of course has produced all sorts of talent over the years but his teammates at DeMatha Catholic how about this Hunter Dickinson Justin Moore Earl Timberland I mean there is they could win some games never a shortage of talent thats coming out of the Mata they always are loaded and he is one of four Terrapins averaging 14 points or better on the year and as you mentioned he uh along with Reese and heart both went or all three went over 20 points in their win Friday over coffin state the schedule will get markedly more difficult going forward but if youre Maryland you cant do better than 60 no I mean you got to play whos on the schedule in front of you and were going to learn a lot about this Maryland Terrapin team as as conference play gets underway with games against Illinois they go to Wisconsin and then a couple more nonconference games that are really really tough ones Reese lost the handle and its a shot clock violation Music Applause Louisville down by 10 7 45 remaining Kenny Payne four years playing for Hall of Famer Denny krung scored over a thousand points a senior year all Metro conference remember the Metro conference he made second team and then was a first round pick and spent four years playing in the NBA and he most recently was in the NBA after a long stint as an assistant at Kentucky under John Calipari so a big challenge for him ahead as well Music Huntley Hatfield working on Reese now the team gets the ball out of his hands nice strong drive along the Baseline I loved what Kenny Payne told us about Mike James today if I had eight of him we wouldnt lose well he loves his competitive Spirit theyre a quality possession for the Louisville Cardinals you get a post touch you skip the basketball extra pass and James getting to the rack foreign to shoot they find the open man Dante Scott great ball Movement by the Terrapins Julian Reese so comfortable in that possession with that post double coming over it didnt phase him one bit through a bullet of a skip pass across the floor withered double team steps through it puts it up on the thats just classic Rim thats a terrible shot this is the good this is the good of the Louisville offense where you move the basketball you get a high quality drive a high quality look consistency has really been what has eluded Louisvilles offense youll see them do some good things but then they revert back to over dribbling taking bad shots turning the ball over and it just it kills you that certainly is the case although three games in Maui launched to Arkansas by 26 to Texas Tech by 32 and then to Cincinnati on Wednesday and the Cincinnati game they were in it and all of a sudden they cut it its a twopoint game at Halftime they cut it to 10 under four minutes in the second half but just the breakdown and there is a really smart play Withers has a size mismatch posts up throw it over the top but its got to be more possessions like that coach Willard calls timeout the lead is down to nine Kenny Payne try to pick up win number one here tonight calls time out try and regather as Louisvilles making a push under six minutes to go in the first half with Robbie Hummel Im Doug Sherman and the only thing that will satisfy the fans anywhere and especially here in this hot better college basketball is winning bowl games is strange coming here uh youre so accustomed to the fact that youre going to have 20 000 people in the building they draw huge television ratings and they are just off so far this year Applause again good ball movement finding carry wide open the one Terrapin who really hasnt gotten going offensively this year at only 26 percent career 38 threepoint shooter and Maryland has found success getting good looks when they play inside out this is a good Ball moving by Louisville a tough shot though by JJ trainer I mean if its not there move it Balls not on fire Applause Martinez hip checked by Withers who commits his first foul if that shot clock is is it two Im with that shot from JJ trainer but a good 1012 seconds remaining its not there you can move the ball and we have seen that exact decision multiple times already tonight Applause right now young attach dumps it off Reese gathers goes up and puts it in a really nice pass great decision there by Jamir young and Maryland so good at running that dribble handoff action drops it back to Julian Reese for an easy bucket to the night for Reese makes it 2817 offensive foul Withers second foul number 24 you got to be aware in these under out of bound situations that Maryland is going to look to run this dho action and another great pass this charge I thought this was a block I mean thats definitely a blocking foul right there Dante Scott clearly still sliding sideways Applause Carrie has a step on the Baseline working on James but he stepped on the Baseline the Maryland turnover gives it back to Louisville Applause Music back in Kamari lands The Freshman out of Hillcrest prep in Arizona he is from Indianapolis another one of the top recruits on the roster for Kenny Payne and hes only averaging about four points per game what have you seen from Kamari lands as he tries to get his footing in college hes still trying to find himself as a guy that can shoot it from the perimeter although he hasnt made shots yet at this level Mikes that little runner in the lane has a lot of ability still trying to figure out just what exactly it is that works at the college game the trainer Miss Here Comes Jameer Young right down the lane nobody there to stop him thats just thats Elementary transition defense and now youre trying to play fast hes going to get you for steps well take a break with Maryland back up 13 low start one of only three unbeatens in the Big Ten Conference only 20 unbeatens remaining around the country but uh Purdue at number five still has yet to lose have you seen the Boilermakers at all this year yeah Robin I saw him in Portland I have to say super impressive I mean we knew that Zach Edie was going to be a force down low but their freshman guards have been terrific a very deep front Court shoot the ball at a high level the Big Ten has gotten off to a terrific start through nonconference play now the deal is going to be youve got to prove it in the NCAA tournament right and its going to have to happen but so far so good for the for the whole league Applause James came up with a block shot on the drive so Purdue will play again at Florida State tomorrow 7 15 right here on ESPN2 and the other unbeaten still is Indiana the Hoosiers are number 10 in the country and they will play tomorrow in one of the big games in the ACC Big Ten challenge against North Carolina 915 on ESPN and youre right I mean coach behind Syracuse made very clear several weeks ago talking about the fact that yes the Big Ten was great in the regular season but until you do it in the postseason in his book it doesnt matter no thats what youre judged upon and the Big Ten for whatever reason has for the last couple years had great nonconference Seasons looked like the best league in the country and then just not lived up to the hive to come NCAA tournament time Im really interested to see Indiana take on a North Carolina team that has got to be just so hungry coming out of the Phil Knight invitation hey kind of gave the game away against Iowa State the turnovers late just totally did him in but a lot of talent and Final Four pedigree on that Carolina ball club and its going to be an insane atmosphere at Assembly Hall well have you got a theory as Huntley Hatfield makes pair of free throws have you got a theory on why the Big Ten when its gotten to the NCAA tournament in recent years has not performed as well as its done it during the regular season I think some of its matchup based some of its luck of course because its a its a oneoff its not a seven game series and I think that the Big Ten maybe last year this is not the case because the league had three lottery picks and and two other guys get drafted but I think a lot of the pro Talent has been in other leagues I think the ACC the Big 12 and the SEC have gotten more pros and those oneoff games and thats thats what wins Martinez had his shot blocked by Huntley Hatfield but then the whistle foul number two on Mike James and so Patrick million the grad transfer who played last year at St Francis of Brooklyn misses the first well the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge rolls on tomorrow with number 17 Duke hosting number 25 Ohio State at Cameron in our first game at 7 15 Eastern and then number 18 North Carolina taking on number 10 Indiana at Assembly Hall in Bloomington both Sonic Blockbusters are on ESPN and the app Music Albert Ellis III at the point Music Huntley Hatfield just barrels this way into the lane and scores Ill tell you what hes made things happen on the offensive end of the floor and having a nice little sequence here blocked a shot on the other end now off the bounce has a big hes more than capable of making plays off the dribble and youre right just runs over Dante Scott but under control enough to get a bucket locking foul the crowd wanted to travel before any contact Applause thank you Brandon Huntley Hatfield such a talented guy making his way to the basket Dante Scott goes down he finds a way to score it now heres the play that all right Im okay with the block but I might have been a travel before that happened I I think thats fair to say Applause Music Applause that is Bert Smith having a conversation with Kenny Payne Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Hundley Hatfield sets the screen now on the switch has Carrie trying to defend here comes the double team Applause Music but jamiro young not only nodding his head at LL is saying all right I see you on that one because thats a big time play and another tough shot but this time LL is just going and making something happen young dumps It Off a million on the reverse its a really mature play by Jamir Young looks like going oneonone against Dale Ellis instead finds his teammate drops it off could have easily taken a tough shot but instead made a play for someone else Applause traffic makes it in hes just willing himself to score the ball right here this is as tough of a bucket as you can get heres off the bounce making the perimeter jumper and then getting in the basket and making things happen for Louisville turns and hits thats his bread and butter and he can back you down and get to his right jump hook its going to be a long night just a real threelevel score Applause Music Applause just think if youre the Maryland defense here you have got to be in and make Ella score over the top Applause out of bounds Maryland basketball that was a great closeout by Young he certainly got back in and LL is going to take tough shots if youre Jamir young youre making him prove it over the top of you I think the the plays that will really bother Kevin Willard will be the drives for the basket because when you look at what the other guys on the floor for Louisville are shooting from three youd much rather have them shooting perimeter shots than LL Ellis at The Rim whos been thats been his best offense all year 61 percent from the field on shots around the basket thank you Applause they go back inside to Reese go into that left hand we got the shot that lucky to not turn it over six in the shot clock now Hart goes into the lane he finds an open man contact on the shot with just over one on the shot clock Reese comes away holding his head he heads to the line it looks like its going to be a quality defensive possession for the Louisville Cardinals but you have two guys just overrun the play thats Roosevelt wheeler and Kamari lands going to the same offensive player and youll leave Julian Reese wide open at The Rim and thats just communication just talking it out Applause Applause well Julian is a tremendous Prospect at Maryland but you know his older sister Angel was a McDonalds AllAmerican at Saint Francis Academy played a couple of years at Maryland where she earned 13 All American last year led the turf to the Sweet 16 but has since transferred to LSU playing for Hall of Famer Kim Mulkey and you think about some of the great brother sister combinations I I first go to the Millers Cheryl yes beating up being done on the response Angel Reese can really play well Julians a very good player in his own right I would have loved to have seen those battles at the Reese home Music Championship Saturday begins noon Eastern on ABC with a Dr Pepper Big 12 title game between Kansas State and TCU then number 22 UCF and number 19 Tulane square off for the AAC title and in Prime Time 8th ranked Clemson takes on number 17 North Carolina in the ACC Championship game and then on Sunday on ESPN noon Eastern the exclusive reveal of the final college football playoff rankings finding out also whos going to play in both the peach and Fiesta bowls Music what do you imagine that conversations about trying to think about maybe a defensive play that he was involved and looked like the official Tony Henderson was talking about getting an offarm around him but you never know players players always complain about any foul they committed so lets assume Im assuming that thats what Julian Reese was talking about a prior foul and here is Reese at the line the officials saying this is not the NBA turn the music off Im linking the NBA they allow music during opponent free throws so that would even be a rarity there Applause final five seconds of the half Ellis glances at the clock as he dribbles into the front Court two seconds one into the corner got a two to pass and that was one pass too many lands never had a chance to get that off off of the extra pass by Hershey Miller weve reached halftime here in Louisville Terps up 3726 we go back to the studio Seth lafonzo Applause and there you see Scott young nearly outscoring the Cardinals in the first 20 minutes all by themselves very efficient the two of them seen all season with this 60 Maryland team they have had good Music with the basketball first to begin the second half Brandon Huntley Hatfield gets the title team and Kerry swiped it away but Don Kerry just going down there and taking the ball its an isolation play for Brandon Huntley Hatfield and he just blew it up and that seems appropriate that the other end Carrie gets his first bucket of the night shooter that hasnt shot it well over the last two games one for his last ten from the threepoint line thats a big one right there to get his confidence going Al Ellis leads Louisville with nine points hes got the basketball and in a pile up along the lane weve got a foul off the ball Louisville out of halftime trying to go to Huntley Hatfield in the post and he turns his back on the help side defense Don Kerry sniffs it out just takes his ball and then poor transition defense by the Louisville Cardinals dont match up and Don Kerry makes you pay inbound and easy two for JJ Trainor I think every play every team in America runs that play its great for the screener back screen and you see it at the middle school level high school level college level it just seems to to always work so theres a good reason for teams running out Dante Scott for three well see if Maryland can heat up theyve had some good looks from the threepoint line and set in the first half they can run hot and cold from downtown but there Dantes gone getting a good look and knocking it down just like Don Kerry did by the way on that last foul it was against Julian Reese his third and he stays in the ball game this is the largest lead of the night so far Maryland up by 15 Kevin Willard shown a lot of trusted his sophomore big this Maryland team not deep and certainly not deep in his position Music to Withers Miss Scott brings it up for three transition Again Louisville not getting back and youre putting that defender in such a tough spot having to choose between two quality Shooters but Maryland getting it done from the threepoint line moving the basketball Dante Scott paying it off and then getting in transition Akeem hard Let it Fly 10 challenge and we want to Spotlight the nine teams from those two conferences six from the Big Ten three from the ACC currently in the top 25 one of them is underway as well as we speak 16th ranked Illinois leads Syracuse over on ESPN late in the first half 2823 but based on that it certainly seems like the Big Ten has the upper hand and should have the upper hand again this year as weve seen in recent years between these two leagues well rough week out in Portland for Duke and North Carolina and I agree the the depth of the Big Ten Conference certainly showing itself there and a pleasant surprise to see Maryland and Ohio State both sneak into the top 25 thats a thats a really nice set there drawn up by Kenny Payne simple duck in on that weak side from Brandon Huntley Hatfield and I think that its a good play to run more through him hes a talented guy theyre trying to get him to be more locked in every possession but he can make things happen foul on the drive against Louisville Music third on Jalen Withers I think also if you run things through Huntley Hatfield its just going to take some of the pressure off LLS to have to create every time down the floor Marylands had the hot hand in the second half now four for four as a team is Maryland from Beyond the threepoint line have been on fire and that was a tough look over the top of Huntley Hatfield but clearly out of halftime Maryland playing extremely confident in that hot cold its running hot from the threepoint line now Ellis pulls up a little too strong off the back iron Kerry comes away with it and Ellis says give it to me he goes right back to the basket and lays it in but he had the most energy today at shoot around for the Louisville Cardinals and that thats a pure effort play makes a drive doesnt finish it but his defense stays in the play stealing points Kenny Payne talked to us about his ability to step into a bigger leadership role he is one of the three try captains as the Terrapins remain hot this is Dante Scott with another triple thats going to drive Kenny Payne nuts because they walked through that role and replace action multiple times today they wanted to exit out from the weak side and just no communication Dante Scotts wide open for three Applause foreign just continues on Don Kerry now shooting it with a ton of confidence jabbing in pulling and here this should be a switch on that backside but no communication JJ trainer trying to get back into play thats as wide open as you will be in a college basketball game Carrie picked up his first personal he heads to the bench along with Julian Reese Martinez and a million back on for the Terrapins well you do have concerns about Marylands depth going forward Ellen for three right yeah I think thats fair to say and Ian Martinez played well against St Louis had 14 Big Time athletes and geek and helped the team Patrick a million come out here and play well on the road I Cornish not here and feeling under the weather no a bachelor of freshmen I think Jahari long will give good minutes but just its unproven whereas I think the starting five you know what youre getting with the three returners and then the two transfers have been phenomenal by Martinez anytime athlete the dunk last year believe against Illinois a windmill where he just went upstairs and he can hammer it showing it off right there with the back cut Music Applause Mike James along the Baseline left a little short gets it back denied by two terabins and here comes Maryland on the run to the rim Scott brings it down finds Hart on the wing a rare missed three for Maryland here in the second half foreign Applause and get him back on the radio as much and as soon as possible and today is giving Tuesday a global day of giving and its also the start of ESPNs V week when we continue Jim valvanos fight against cancer you can make a difference today by supporting cancer research which is needed now more than ever if you are able give now at vorg donate 100 of your donation goes to cancer research cancer a disease that doesnt discriminate all of us know someone whether its in your family or a friend group thats been affected by cancer and the bean Foundation has just been phenomenal and the job that both dick vitel and Jim Valvano have done raising money for cancer I lost my grandmother to the terrible disease I know you have family as well and every dollar that we raise goes to fight that terrible disease Applause and then the good news is from that research people like Bob balbano and Robin Roberts can beat cancer and my oldest brother Paul has twice beaten cancer and so again its very important if you can please donate to the B foundation and it is remarkable what theyve been able to do in the last 30 years tens of millions of dollars raised and I want to give a shout out to Dickey V because if you listen to him speak about cancer and pediatric cancer its more powerful than any game youll hear him call and hes been iconic at doing that so thanks dick for for doing all the work that you do and continue to do and I know the V Foundation is going to continue to do great things Louisville with the basketball down 20 second ranked team in the country Maryland has led throughout Louisville made a push late in the first half to keep it within reach but the Terps have come out firing and extended the lead here in the second half and again this is a Maryland team undefeated this year and they have trailed for less than three and a half minutes on the game clock the entire season thats hard to believe certainly with with Miami and St Louis and Mohegan Sun that schedule ratcheted up from what it was but still think about how many games a team comes out and just hits a three early or is it 52 or whatever you have been dominant this season honestly if they had shot the ball a little better at Mohegan I know you were there they could have beat Miami by 25 or 30 points I mean they they had good looks and just didnt make them here in the second half theyve had good looks and just made every one of them well whats your early feel in the season on Maryland in the Big Ten Conference I do worry a little bit about their depth at the center position I think Julian Reese is a great piece but if he gets in foul trouble guarding the hunter Dickinsons the zacchinis the trace Jackson Davis of the league thats certainly going to be a problem because youre going to play Dante Scott as an Underside five on the flip side of that theyve got to guard him too right and that that could be a problem for those bigs foul troubles concerning but I I think that Kevin Willard considering what he took over taking Jamir young and Don Kerry and keeping the core of Hakeem heart Dante Scott Julian Reese I mean he has done a phenomenal job to get those guys to buy in to understand what he wants I think bright days are ahead for basketball hell that was trying to throw it down on Julian Reese well both these programs went through midseason coaching changes and that throws off so many things I mean just the Player Development gets interrupted and youve got to say Kevin Willard and his staff has done a remarkable job to take that baton and run with it well think about what was thrown at Danny Manning last season I mean that thats not a situation thats fair in any way shape or form and I I thought he did a really nice job of keeping that thing afloat they were competitive late they won some games at the end of the year they were always in games and I just its so hard because your freshman year if youre Julian Reese your freshman year is so disjointed I just I cant imagine what its like to lose your head coach especially at the college level as a pro its different but when youre playing college basketball you look at your college coach differently theyre more of an authority figure and I just I think what this group went through last year was incredibly difficult and that guy right there knocked out of the park he did a great job and again Danny Manning was on Mark turgeons staff and took over on an interim basis for Maryland and then when the staff change was made complete at the end of the season he was hired by Kenny Payne and now is on the other bench for Louisville Music and there is the 1988 National player of the year for Kansas Jayhawk College Hall of Famer he seems much more professorial wearing those reading glasses down his nose even during shoot around today I was struck by the the idea that well now hes in his mid50s he looks more like a professor I love talking to him I mean just some of his stories as a player and what he went through blowing his knee out multiple times and still coming back and not just winning a national title for Kansas but also being a great NBA player he laughed in the league for a long time and its not an easy thing to do he fought through adversity and has come through not just be a great player but then go on to be a coach and it impact young players I think that is thats an incredible thing to do Music Ari lands didnt he Curry back on the floor for Louisville like James L Ellis who feeds the post big lock from behind as Dante Scott says no to Huntley Hatfield this is just a race by Dante Scott Huntley Hatfield has been really aggressive thinks hes got oneonone coverage but Dante Scott the second he turned his back on him just went and made a play on the ball well its been a bit puzzling the downturn for Sydney Curry this year as a junior last season he closed out so strong you thought well theres a building block for Kenny Payne and now hes coming off the bench it just hasnt worked as well so far this year talked about his conditioning he needs to probably get in a little bit better game shave but youre right the town is there and it just has not clicked for whatever reason this season Alice Way Off the Mark Scott and in transition other another wide open three ball buried by Martinez Johnson Scott had options there not a Miss like that its just youre starting to break its not giving your defense a chance I dont think that Louisvilles been great defensively tonight but if you turn the ball over and you take shots that are hitting off the top of the backboard I mean youre just youre letting Maryland get whatever they want this is contested that shot clock needs to be hitting one if youre taking a shot like that thats just thats a horse shot for Ian Martinez from the corner and Robbie we said it from the very first possession of the ball game thats not officially a turnover but it may as well might as well be yeah you might as well just be handing the ball to our team because theyre going down and scoring it will off shots like that and its worse than a traveling violation youd be better off kicking the ball out of bounds because at least then you can set your defense Huntley Hatfield misfires I dont think thats the shot that Kenny Payne is looking for not that he cant make it but again youve had a couple rough possessions just move the ball Applause Music air ball from Don Kerry Applause Louisville just needs to move the ball from side to side dont over dribble I think James making a play he was a medical red shirt last year after suffering a torn Achilles in his left leg and hes another one we can qualify as really playing his first year of college basketball five different Terrapins knocked one down from the perimeter and it has been in the half court has been in transition it really hasnt mattered just a threepoint barrage and has to make any tariff Advantage smile because at times theyve been a little bit hot and cold but the second half they have been scorching hot and theyve gotten a good boost off the bench for me and Martinez making two of those threepointers hes got eight points Patrick Millions got four Off the Bench and the starters as usual delivering Dante Scott Leading The Way with 18 points including three of six from distance Jamir Youngs got 14 points and three assists for Coach Kevin Willard former pit panther played there for his dad back in the mid 90s and his first foray into the Big Ten Conference after spending so much time in the Big East conference both as a player and then a short stint in the Mac three years as head coach at Iona and then the 12year run at Seton Hall and back in Louisville where he was an assistant under Rick Pitino for a number of years Music and you were right in talking to him this morning in this building you can you can tell how much the city of Louisville means to him it was nice to hear him open up about that the growth as a coach and to grow your family in this city and then win the way that they did its no surprise see kind of Kevin Willards career trajectory from a high major assistant to Iona to the winner he built at Seton Hall and now I just think the potential at Maryland but the players that come out of that area high school wise and the tradition its a its a great fit but Kevin Willard just wins Devin Reed The Freshman from Jackson Mississippi into the game with his first tune here come the Cardinals again James into the lane no Applause here is Martinez and one of the questions we asked Kevin Willard what did you learn from taking over at Iona and then at Seton Hall that you can use both good and bad at Maryland and he said its so important to make sure you lay your foundation with your very first roster having your kind of guys the dunk by a million and he said he didnt do as good a job at Seton Hall as he would have liked and he felt like hed set them back in rebuilding that program youre never going to go wrong with High character I think he hes certainly learned that lesson and Hes Got High character kids here it seems like he loves coaching him really likes this group likes to be around him just I think that there are good things ahead for Maryland as a program time to shoot Miller tough shot once again Dante Scott with another rebound and I think you know looking at that same topic for Louisville its been a really tough start but I think that Kenny Payne is going to have every opportunity and again you have to talk about the NCAA investigation because it totally limited them in terms of who they could go get to help this roster theyve got L Ellis and Hersey Miller whos a walkon that are guards that get any minutes on this team the rest of the group is is all forwards and they certainly are still learning what he wants and learning how to play but it its going to be a process for sure but Kenny Payne was not given a good hand of cards to play here front end of the one and one missed by Curry young feeds Reese working on Curry gets right to the rim Applause Music 6539 Maryland Ellis drive and Dish find the open man in the corner Huntley Hatfield has a go around and out Maryland though lost the basketball out of bounds and so Louisville gets it back well coming up next over on ESPN to the ESPN app 9 30 Eastern time the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge rolling on with number three Virginia taking on Michigan Chrysler Center weve talked in the first half about Virginia getting back to be in Virginia and having an offense that certainly seems sustainable along with that d ude off the transition easy like team heart what do you think about Michigan in the Big Ten this year Well Hunter Dickinson is a great place to start I do have questions about their guard play Jalen the Wellen is trying to make that step up from Princeton in the ivy league to now the Big Ten and Michigan has had kind of a mixed bag I guess you could say with some of these transfer point guards but theyre gonna have to get better guard play jet Howards an incredibly talented freshman youve got a great start with with Hunter but they need some people around him to make plays and going against that Virginia Defense it cannot just be the hunter Dickinson show I mean hes going to have a posttrap on him every time he touches the basketball there you see coming up within the hour 9 30 Eastern Time the Wolverines and the Cavaliers at the freethrow line Julian Reese top 50 recruit a couple of years ago out of Saint Francis Academy in Baltimore Fabio basily has come into the game for the first time for Louisville a freshman who didnt commit to the Cardinals until midaugust perhaps he can provide some relief going forward in that backcourt youre talking about I need bodies if Im Kenny Payne in Louisville I just I want to see my team play solid basketball move it run our sets defensively match up find our man dont turn the ball over and well live with the results but I think that thats where youve got to start right now they have had a hard time tonight executing the basics of both offense and defense Jahari long in the backcourt now for Maryland from the free throw line Noah Bachelor buries the jumper and draws the foul everybody for the Terrapins getting in to the mix Applause youre right everyone contributing in this Maryland Victory Noah Batchelor just flash into the high post against that front 22nd ranked Maryland trying to get the Big Ten Conference on the board with Robbie Hamill on Doug Sherman and as we mentioned off the top this is a series that is going away after 24 years and for you back in your playing Jason Purdue it was a big measuring stick for the Boilermakers absolutely because you understood that outside of the Big East which at the time was just an absolute monster the ACC was the conference that you really wanted to measure yourself against and it is sad to me that its going away I got to play in this event it was always such a good experience to get to go play people that you you didnt get to see normally you played in venues youd never been to and I remember the Big Ten had never won this event going into the ACC Big Ten challenge in 2009 and I remember talking to other guys from other teams at media day and we talked about how this has to be our year we were close last year and we got to get this done and it was a point of pride because it was so competitive and now its become more onesided to the Big Ten I would say over the last 10 or 11 years but the ACC dominated this thing for the first eight nine years in its existence so I I just think it is the end of an era and it is sad to me because theres been so many great games and good matchups and your life will go on and there will continue to be great games and good matchups out of conference but this has been a spectacular event for 24 years and the chirps have been on both sides of it they left the ACC for the Big Ten in 2014 and after doing very well as an ACC team theyve not done nearly as well in the Big Ten and I found it interesting you were sharing a story off Mike before the ball game in one of your Purdue games in the ACC Big Ten challenge you faced a Duke team that really lets you know how much better you guys needed to be yeah it was my sophomore year and it was the biggest game of the season both teams were in the top 10 in unbelievable environment at Mackie Arena and I Thanks a Lot Nolan Smith for coming in there and just whipping our butt it might have been the hardest practice that I ever had the next day the film session brutal but youre absolutely right it showed us what we needed to be to be an elite team and we werent there yet but it did help us the year after where I think that we you know until I hurt my knee we played at that level we were a top three or four team in the country and we dont win those games at Michigan State Ohio State you know beat Tennessee on a neutral floor or beat West Virginia on New Years Day if we dont have those types of games so it really helped us well you mentioned some of the venues you got to play in in this challenge that you might not otherwise theres Nolan did he mention by the way we saw the shoot around today we did not talk about that it was great to see him I I will say that but man the film session was individual reaming of each player who did not play well I mean it was crazy I called one of our assistants after after practice and needed to be talked up because it was a cop dealer kicked my butt theres no doubt about that but I was I was curious what are the two buildings that you got to play in in the ACC that you wouldnt have other ones we went to Virginia Tech and played them with Malcolm Delaney and that that group really tough team Castle coliseums a tough place to go in my first road game at Clemson and it was it was overwhelming it really was I dont even know if it was that great of an atmosphere for for what they normally have but they were ranked in the top 25 they had James Mayes uh yeah James Mays and I just remember and its your first road game so its always gonna be a little bit different it was it was it was chaos it really was well nothing chaotic for Kevin Willard and his tariffins so far this year well on their way to a 70 start for the season and again this is petty stuff no other coach has taken over a Maryland mens basketball program and started with six wins this was the first test here it was getting your first road win of the season you got the Illini coming in next and you go to Wisconsin theyre going to find out a lot about who they are and you have to say its grip to start this would be how you would script Kevin Willards first seven games right you based the test you could see on his face this morning just how elated he was and he said it multiple times the fact like I think hes shocked that for the past two weeks he has this program in the national rankings it means something to him to be number 22 right totally I mean the work that hes done and his staff has done terrific job and theres theres still work to be done theres no question about that but they put themselves in position to be in position absolutely you you win your games the nonconference you give yourself a chance to be in that large team in the NCAA tournament just the thing now is how do you keep improving how do you keep getting better and better and I think that he has done a terrific job and and I think also has done a nice job of stepping back and realizing hey we are doing a great job hes given credit to his assistants his players Music yeah we mentioned the first half uh David Cox Tony skin a couple of the assistants who have Roots deep roots in the DMV and they have come together in terms of reinforcing the roster holdovers that they have been bringing in new Talent coaching them up its been a good formula so far oh I promised former Maryland assistant coach I dont remember what he said his title is at Under Armor now but Jimmy pasos was here during shooter yeah always good to see Jimmy wanted to shout out and of course Jimmy was on the bench when Maryland won the National Championship under Gary Williams a couple of decades ago when was that team to watch wow guard play the big they had everything Applause Music Applause its a great audition for basily here to make a case for more minutes they need guards and so far impacting the game in a positive way Ellis to the corner some good looking basketball on the last couple of possessions Reed buries the three its all about being solid and you can hear the crowd they understand that solid plays are going to help them win games and they just havent done enough of it tonight still they need to just keep doing the little things Henrys another one he was a top 100 recruit who maybe isnt quite ready to contribute just yet but he has shown himself well so far here tonight in a couple of short versions Applause Friday our NBA doubleheader on ESPN and the app has LeBron and the Lakers in Milwaukee starting a sixgame road trip against Giannis in the Bucks 6 30 Central 4 30 Pacific with Stephen As telecast on ESPN2 and then its off to the chase Center for Steph and the Warriors hosting DeMar DeRozan and the Bulls our coverage tips off with NBA Countdown at seven on ESPN and the ads are the Warriors back what it looked like their their demise was so public right and all of a sudden the NBA is the ultimate drama right I mean its such a soap opera and it really is fascinating to see the way that story lines mold throughout the season and everybody was saying oh its over with as long as youve got Steph Curry its not over I mean he just has to me hes one of the top five players to ever play wow I just I think hes totally changed the game theres no question the way we think about it hes one of the highest level sure you can argue certain guys ahead of him but I think hes got to be in the conversation well theres no question he changed the game as much as anybody I mean you go back to Will and Bill Russell the way they change the game in a much different manner of course but youre right from the Grassroots all the way up to the highest level of professional basketball Steph Curry has changed everything hes also made us see so many bad shots but I cant blame him for that because he makes them but how many guys have we seen that now you know on a twoonone run to the threepoint line everybody does two ones dont end up in dunks anymore theyre just threes Applause its an eightnothing Louisville run you know what if you shoot 46 from three why not I dont know Miss Philly called for the foul but hes been at the center of the 80 Louisville run on the other end Music and so Jamir young will shoot a 11 hes had to go through a transition since leaving Charlottes for Maryland because they played a Princeton stock so hes had to learn new things or get reacclimated with new things and has done very very well a lot of responsibility on his plate for Kevin Willard you know what though if you run the Princeton offense it tells any coach you know how to play and youre a really good cutter and you can also pass because those things all are essential to run that offense and you come from the Princeton offense I have no doubt in most systems you will find your way because you just know how to play basketball under four minutes to go in regulation the same cannot be said for the reverse of that just because you play college basketball doesnt mean you could play in the Princeton system and its very unique in that way here is Jameer Young The Graduate transfer from Charlotte Applause and a blocking foul will send Don Kerry to the free throw line shooting a 11 when we come back Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college battle 3 41 remaining second ranked Maryland has very much looked apart with Robbie Hubble Im Doug Sherman 7448 and the Turks as we said the schedule is going to get tougher from here but this was a road test you go on the road in the ACC Big Ten challenge nothing is guaranteed and they have done what theyve needed to do the second half shooting has been so impressive six of 11 from downtown theyve gotten whatever they wanted but youre absolutely right you just never know until you go on the road the first time and thats thats a daunting schedule right there we are going to find out a lot about what Maryland is as the the competition ramps up to Illinois coming up over on ESPN right now the Illini ranked 16th in the country leads Syracuse 3830 with about 12 and a half to go in the second half Im really curious to see what the crowd will look like in College Park for that Illinois game youth game and last year certainly the fan supported slips um whereas seven eight years ago that was one of the I would say best venues in the Big Ten yeah and and I would say theyre going to have a great price I would I hope so I cant imagine see that because its going to be a big time game in the Big Ten Conference well College Park much like here in Louisville he is college basketball country absolutely and they know their basketball theyre passionate about it when things arent going well as we have seen here in Louisville this week and today to let you know but I dont think for a second that if Louisville as soon as they turn it back around whether its this year next year theyll come back exactly and I think foreign Music with the Turks about to go to 70 I would think they will be all ready to go facility makes his way into the lane it looked as though Callum Swanton Roger may have gotten a piece of it for a blocked shot thats one where youve gotten to the paint youve done your job but its got to be a play for someone else now youve drawn multiple Defenders Applause Kevin Willard gushed about him yeah you know not just as a player but as a person Kim comes over from Seton Hall my God its really played well as their backup point guard said he didnt help players he went out of his way not to recruit them but then when he saw Jahari go into the portal they did contact each other and uh you know Jahari has had injury troubles and uh about with Cove at his freshman year which kind of undermined things so this is kind of the start of his college career as a junior his first go round with Maryland Applause Percy Miller Applause first foul on Swanton Roger well we talked about the fact that uh Louisville lost its first three games of the Season by single points to Bellarmine to Wright State to App State and you just wonder if one or two or three of those go the other way how that might change things and how going to Maui feels different for this team they say winning is contagious and losing certainly is too and the way they lost those games multiple big comebacks the Appalachian State game is is pure heartbreak I mean you think you win the game youre celebrating like you did and then they go review it at the table and thats in the hands of L Ellis by a tenth of a second its just been one of those Seasons where nothing has gone right for the Louisville Cardinals and I agree with you if you get one or two of those you feel differently about yourself doesnt mean they would have necessarily won every game in Maui but you think youre just youre in a different mindset and its just it carries over and it has been a tough start to the Kenny Payne era here for Louisville and the only thing that reverses that is a win and then the second win right I mean theres no other way around Applause Carson dick comes into the game for Maryland Pablo zugu is also in a junior from Ukraine Music thank you Applause big Rose Roosevelt wheeler to the free throw line Music cancer research which is needed now more than ever if you are able give now at vorg donate 100 of your donation goes to cancer research and again uh we wish MVPs younger brother Bobby was able to join us here tonight that was the plan but hes dealing with the covid and so hopefully the next time through Louisville well have a chance to see Bobby V as he continues to be a huge part of the V foundation and raising those Millions Applause Ashton miles Devore into the game will walk on his father Ellis miles was the starting center on Louisvilles 2005 final 14 Applause Music oh years long the former Seton Hall pirate and he knocked it out of bounds out of the hands of Wheeler back to Louisville we also have Aiden McCool on the court for Louisville against Maryland he was with the turfs the last two years and transferred he is a walkon on the end of the bench for Kenny Payne now Fabio basily has earned a chance to get regular minutes I mean hes competed hes made some plays on both ends I bailed out right there I I think that with the guard situation he he just deserves a shot well he reclassified for this opportunity and so he arrived on the Louisville campus in August a relatively late start but I think youre right thank you Music pass kicked by Miles Devore and so theyll inbounded on the Baseline well it will be interesting throughout the rest of tonight Robbie and then tomorrow with the ACC Big Ten challenge to see which conference comes out on time again ACC got the head start with two wins last night but in recent years the Big Ten has had the upper hand for sure just love the event because really every night youve got quality basketball and we get spoiled with Feast week we saw last week in Portland Atlantis Maui but you always know the Big 10 ACC challenge was going to give you great matchups and thats but were gonna get the next night and a half final 10 seconds and Vasily at the direction of his head coach will dribble it out eyes Kevin Willards Terrapins now seven and oh with an impressive win in the ACC Big Ten challenge really start to finish for Maryland they just got it done the perimeter shooting in that second half just pushed it out but Kevin Willards ball Club locked in from the getgo tonight to get our final score 7954 Maryland Baron
