two meetings last season we told you about the tremendous game at home from Hunter Salis a careerhigh 33 points and that uh those two games last year really revolved around turnovers uh Wake Forest turned it over 18 times in Raleigh for the loss and took care of the ball better here only eight turnovers at the win and Kevin Keats told us just prior to the Ball Game those numbers that do not involve scoring will be important those are the winner stats at the other end its Eon Reed does start the scoring for wake you know hes a guy he right now hes at a little under eight points a game they need to get a little more scoring out of him Tom and hes got I think hes got to be around the 12 point mark maybe a little north of that as this season goes along Reed had nine points and six boards in the win on Tuesday on the road at Syracuse out of the corner Michael o gonnell for three hes a guy too that he hes capable we touched on him in the open very steady you great you know his assist to turnover ratio is crazy good um not shooting the three so far this season real well but he he can put some numbers up Salis got cut off the turnaround High degree of difficulty and he scores yeah really good midrange game and its the one thing wake is not although theyre threepoint shooting in conference games much better than they were in November December this year Roger SS Eric Lewis Tommy morrisy in charge of the action this afternoon long time ACC ACC Rivals Ben Middlebrooks is back in the lineup hes involved in the turnover Salis one on two pass oono and he lays it in and thats thats the one thing that uh one thing that Steve Forbes has really been happy with this team is their defense uh their numbers right around second in the league behind Dukes as far as field goal percentage very good around the ball B this is Middle Brooks attracted a triple Applause team that whistle goes against the Applause pack violation a three second violation gives the ball to wake heres a starting lineup Hill Taylor o Connell whos already got a three Huntley Hatfield and Ben Middlebrooks who did not play in the game at Virginia illness about 20 minutes before the game coach keis got the news and had to adjust the game plan it worked in the first half Mike it did not work in the second half against the Cavaliers now caught up with the I mean they were shooting incredibly well that first half and just wore down the second half you know its amazing time that this this climate we were playing in um you know this years in college basketball great back door cut and thats what you know hildr does well and gets inside they go they win the ACC Championship five games win the uh title go to the final four and there is absolutely no carryover whatsoever from last year NC State five new its eight new faces this year you know we talked to Kevin gats about that that thats really incredible and yet the expectations are always there regardless oh yeah yeah he went to the final four we going to do it again I dont know weve got eight new guys I got to learn their names first again this is just game one of CW Courtside Saturday a couple teams on seven game winning streaks on Deck with Duke number four of the nation and the only ranked team in the ACC going against SMU really tuning into that game as well that is going to be really good SMU has really made a strong statement early on and uh its going to its a critical game for SMU eighth season for Kevin Keats hes got 147 wins as the head coach of the pack they went 26 15 a season ago 9 and 11 in the ACC and they went all the way to the tournament title I mean we saw them at the trail end of the season Mike they had a bad loss at pit had no momentum and went all the way to Washington and took the title wake going the other way its Applause Salis hildr they try to work it inside and they connect with Spillers and its an 80 wake run you know I I really like his game he is so active very quick off his feet probably their best shot blocker Spillers is a transfer from appalachin State senior from Charleston South Carolina averages almost 10 points per game and the beaks have the ball back you always wonder how the guys are going to make the adjustment from the mid Majors up to this level head coach of the deakes in his fifth season its Steve Forbes after going 21 and 14 a season ago and making the NIT he is two and four in his career against NC State hildr in trouble with a fallway Middlebrooks altered that Music Applause shot the loss at Virginia on Tuesday 70 to 67 youc state 44 as a team struggled in the second half and allowed Virginia to make seven threepointers in the second half as the shot clock is inside of 10 tenacious defense and a traveling violation against Hunley Hatfield yeah thats something they worked on yesterday in practice really uh coming in a strong double team and that was this was you know great job by Eon coming in late and uh really in picking up the dribble there was nothing that Hunter Hatfield could do forc the turnover really solid defensive double team so Fon Reed combining on the defensive effort Kevin Keats is going to his bench Hunley Hatfield and oconnell have come out of the Music lineup Trey Parker number five is in for NC State its a wake Force team that turns over the opposition just under 15 times a game and thats ranks high in the in the NCAA stats middle Brooks with the block of hildr hes got the ball at the other end not surprisingly hes the leading shot blocker for NC State whistle stops play foul coming up will step aside Reed P January 7th 87 Central right here in the CW Hunter Salis and the deakes has a team four of seven shooting so far with Middlebrooks at the free throw line NC State only three field goal attempts so far in the game the three turnovers so uh not quite awake yet with the noon start you always talk about that early start Mike and yeah takes a little bit to get the engine revving up to full capacity one of two for Middlebrooks as a 68 free throw shooter well maybe that motorcycle in the in intros might have helped Wake Forest along the demon deak mascot comes in here in the uh Chopper and revs that engine or as Arnold Schwarz and would say Laughter Chopper an exciting leadup to this ball game fantastic Crowd by the way as well on an enormous Saturday in the ACC were happy to bring you two games on the schedule Duke SMU to follow us all 18 teams in action when you were playing at Duke Mike late 70s did you ever think you would say that 18 teams in the ACC well we all couldnt play cuz there was an odd number there were seven we need more team we need one more and we got we got Georgia Tech in 80 so we we rounded the field out to eight and here we are 18 teams strong and so free throws upcoming foul was on Parker for NC State yeah how about then talk about arrest the winner of the regular season got a into the semifinals of the ACC tournament not anymore I just asked Kevin Keats in the pack yeah I mean nobodys going to uh nobody will ever beat that record because three teams wont make it into the tournament this year but uh yeah I I I didnt think i Id ever see a team winning five games to win the title just an amazing run last season by the wolf pack the Louisville Syracuse Duke and Virginia in the semifinals in overtime the amazing shot for Michael oconnell to send that game to OT as NC State turns it over yeah fourth turnover and that uh you know you saw that uh you referenced that pit game we thought that wi put pit in to the tournament winds up they got they they got nixed and state makes the run in NC State Duke Clemson North Carolina and Virginia represented the ACC in the NCAA tournament a season ago NC State and Duke we in a regional final threp Applause pointer goes by Juke scored over 2000 points in his high school career had 10 points four rebounds made a couple of Threes in the win on the road at Syracuse first win in the dome for the Wake four his program Brion passes into the game number four for ncy state playing his 100th Collegiate game this afternoon hell step back couldnt get it away Juke was in his face Taylor on the drive against Salis Parris comes up with it well its early in the game Tom but really wake has kept NC State in the half court theyve had a grind for everything and another three we talked about their threepoint shooting not there early in the season but uh much better lately wake made nine threes on 19 tries and the win at Syracuse 47 from three that was a season High Middlebrooks shovels it to pass elevates yeah every every shot theyve got to grind for its been contested really has been tough offensively for NC State teams played in midFebruary last year here a win for the DS is that one almost fell 8379 was the final in the February game they also played in January of last season NC State won it at home 8376 and Taylor has the foul for NC State heres the look and you know they ran some things they like they like to work him into the post again we talked about his size at 67 hes going to if he gets a smaller Defender he can go in and and find his own jump shot 64 free throw shooter and you got four new faces coming in led by oconnell and I you know just the way theyre theyre off they theyve got to have oconnell on the floor and uh I I wouldnt be surprised at some point here its a little early on but maybe turn up the pressure a little bit if youre NC State they theyve got to start making baskets for that to happen its kind of what wake did at the Dome mik they jumped out to an early lead against Syracuse only led by two though though at halftime forced 18 Syracuse turnovers now and he stay needed that one from Huntley Hatfield to turn around hes still finding his way a little bit in this program uh they need him to find some consistency scored in double digits in the loss at Virginia Huntley Hatfield had 12 points in seven boards he averages just shy of 10 points per game Salis had nowhere to go Johnson trying to dribble past the double team Tommy morrisy was right on it calls a foul on the floor first on Applause hill Music to Parker frecks the introduction for Parker Frederickson as Tyler Johnson goes to the wake bench to say that Frederickson is a threepoint specialist might be a bit of an understat Mike yeah he uh he certainly is just a unforced error there so Frederickson has taken 209 career field goal attempts 189 have been for three so thats what coach Forbes expects from number seven so so quick math there were 20 Ventures inside the man thats some Duke addition and subraction right there in two years the degree at work thats thats funny I mean its its almost statistically impossible in two years so Fon Reed Mike just picked up a file thats his second so he has to trudge to the WG Forest bench so Reed is out of the lineup Huntley Hatfield trying to back his way down Spillers was defending a foul was called its interesting rather than going with a bass Wake Forest going smaller Spillers is actually guarding Hunter Hatfield and he tried to go in and did the right thing attacked the attack inside with the post but wake for is pretty small out there 77 from the strike for Huntley Hatfield arms folded in disbelief for Coach Forbes so they did assess that foul to hildr who thought it might have been on Spillers further clarification and hildr picks up the foul and a couple of free throws for Brandon Huntley Hatfield the senior from Clarksville Tennesse two years in the Louisville program a year at Tennessee prior to that lets see if he can take advantage of the matchups that he has on the floor right now cuz hes just under 80 from the free throw line so an advantage there Fon Reed out with the two fouls Salis has to slam on the brakes Frederickson gives up the three and sends it back to Salis that is offt Applause Target despite the Miss from Salis wake has won three of its last four games and four of its last six and with the win at the Dome on Tuesday Mike three in a row in the series with the orange for the deakes almost poked Away by Spillers quick hands OK Connell determined to get to the rim he got there couldnt finish pack kept it alive Parker had to give it back to Styles he hits the floor hard whistle and foul on the play on the Styles drive so far in the first half its wake out in front 1135 to go SMU can really score the basketball and their defense is improving thats one thing indianfield wants to improve and uh Duke really good at both ends of the floor so you know SMU has not had a win against the quad one team and this is a huge opportunity for them to get a win they get that win they would they should be ranked going into next next next week Cooper flag coming off a 24point effort against Virginia Tech and to keep the Blue Devils at 30 in conference play Lets see that that foul and Fon Reed leaving the game has opened the door a little bit here then NC States Tak advantage of now with these free throws they can pressure up the floor NC State a mini 60 run to cut the lead to nine here in the first half just over 11 minutes to go Tom for me Mike jinsky our outstanding ACC CW production crew hriff couldnt convert ball found its way back to Salis threads the pass to Harris double fisted for the rim vender remember those you we were in talking to Kevin Kat he was talking about winning plays those 5050 balls coming up with those and uh youre scrambled your defense isnt set and uh Harris com up with it styles on the drive follows against wake see know Spiller hes a shot blocker but with Reed out of there the lane just looks to be open and NC State really has done a nice job of attacking the rim so Salis picks up his first personal foul Styles at the free throw line 65 from the line this season transfer from Georgetown couple of years in the North Carolina program and a senior from Kinston North Carolina has made 12 starts this season was not in the starting lineup today for NC State in the first of two meetings with wake teams will play again in Raleigh on February 22nd 2 pm Applause start Dees lose it in the back Applause court just the second turnover of the half it will be W for his basketball well again thats thats the the added value again of attacking the rim getting fouls getting to the free throw line and setting pressure second turnover they forced it is NC State basketball Mike I thought that was the initial indication from the official along the Baseline and Hill Up and Under lead is eight for the deakes 10 and four on the season two one in conference play so it was a 1230 start for the pack hildr tried to save it on the sideline that is going to be NC State basketball according to Roger SS right on top of the Applause call Dennis Parker Jr comes back in for NC State Tyler Johnson number eight for Wake has joined the fry coach Keats had a whiteboard in the locker room said if your name is not on this whiteboard from the Virginia game for deflections steals tips offensive rebounds youre doing something wrong you need to get your name on this board had nothing to do with scoring oh spillard the rejection Johnson alop couple of players raced on by it Harris got it high off the square I really like what Ive seen from him early very active inside nice job on the putback Mike Harris has eight points in the first half thats above his average at 53 per game and oconnell missed five s Styles came over the top well you remember back I mean a lot of times for a freshman you come in Off the Bench and uh you hit a three right off the bat and that a lot of times that gets you right into the flow of the game which he did then you get the dunk and all of a sudden that picks up your defensive side of the ball so now Salis has to go to the bench as well Fon Reed is already there Mike and they both have two personal fouls so so Reed and Salis out of the lineup Harris is the leading scorer so far for Wake with eight Salis has Music seven Huntley Hatfield on the bench has four leads NC State tapped Away by Applause Johnson mcneel is in there number two fory State shot clock winding down and they beat it jumper from Hill Marcus Hill the senior in a transfer from Bowling Green good recognition of the clock too how about Hill last year Mike for Bowling Green 31 times double figures in scoring and 19 times he went for 20 or more front rim that leads to a run out up ahead and an easy Layin Parker Jr you know when you catch your teammates off guard with a shot like that its the first pass to a fast break and that was a terrific look ahead challenged the shot and then just broke out despite that Miss on the previous sequence wake shooting 57 from the floor in the first half 42 so far for NC State and the shot clock is a five Harris again drew the foul OK Connell is slow to get up assistance from his teammates boy you know and with Salis out you know with those two fouls that may be the Freshman whos going to carry him home in 8 minutes here in the first half Salis on the bench jeon Reed on the bench with the two personals hildr is going to have to show up in the last eight minutes here too only two points for him hildr is 0 for four from the floor as well his points G from the free throw line freshman 67 200 lb from Salsbury North Carol Carolina Juke Applause Harris hes feeling a little better about himself though you look at his three double figure games um Michigan and in two ACC games so hes hes hes played his best against the best competition and Michigan was a great home win against the Wolverines a Miss from NC State and Harris again hes into double digits with Applause 10 played 19 minutes off the bench against Syracuse Frederickson Tes up a Applause three well why the crowd may be reacting to that is uh this guy this guy is just a lights out shooter and hes at 19 percent for the year and theyre hoping that so well have it for you ACC womens basketball really looking at like double figure bids in the NCA tournament at least well they sent teams to the tournament last year women have been tearing it up and the NC State women by the way went to the final four as well so NC State had both programs in the final four and Elli avents Wolfpack baseball team went to the College World Series last year a banner season for the pack Down and Out Johnson with a Miss wow that was halfway down Mike Applause Music Applause threepointer right in front of the Wake for his bench from Jaden Music Taylor the lead is now eight try to put it up on the rim for Spillers Middlebrooks in the neighborhood yeah they uh Taylor needed to come alive for them his first points of the afternoon second foul on Middlebrooks transfer from the Clemson Pro program second year at NC State Middlebrooks playing in his 114th career game with Spillers at the line and this is you know up to this point neither one of these teams have really built their games around the threepoint shot and both of them have been pretty strong from behind the Applause Music arc I thought this was going to be more of a twopoint three free throw line more conventional game NC State only averages six made threes per game and the shock clock is deep down to three pass he wants another three big bounce to Harris couple times now especially in the half court States gone deep into the shot clock hildr once again they try to lay it up on the cylinder you know he makes plays but hes got a high number of turnovers as well and he he takes some Chances with the ball and that was Ill advised luckily you know they retain position possession that was going to be a tough lob to connect talked about hildr at the top of the broadcast fouryear player its only five players in all of the ACC that will start and end their career in the same program thats and hes one of them thats an amazing stat senior from Worthing England that one rolls to Hill hes determined to get to the rim and out leaps his Defender and lays it in timeout Steve Forbes and Wake Forest Mike its a sixpoint game yeah the The Freshman Harris just trying to do too much off the dribble that the car and get where I can got it and uh and the visions getting better every day right visions getting better and uh but you know its its been its going a little bit of a choppy schedule oh good time out good play coming right out of the timeout lets see how this so Frederickson had made a three just a couple of moments ago but that that attempt looked a little like he was kind of hoping it was going to go in rather than had some confidence with it wake averages 64 threes made per game so both of these teams right around six threes per game turnaround is money styles that was smooth Mike yeah I mean you look at hes hes a fabulous athlete you know well well traveled in his career you keep waiting for him to really explode wake so far three of seven on threepointers that is Frederickson walk the ballet danced to the rim and he traveled thats the fifth turnover of the half for weake well we referenced his 20 trips inside the threepoint line and its its really not his game getting stuff done off of the dve off of the dribble so itll be NC State basketball Hunter Salis is back into the lineup second year at wake after two years at gonzago for the senior from Omaha Nebraska 45 from the field this season for Salis back in with the two fouls open man inside Huntley Hatfield hes up to six points great look and again since uh Ean Reed out of the ball game the the paint has been wide open Spillers gathers and scores y nice look there Applause too Trayvon Spillers played 39 minutes in the dome and got a double double 11 points 10 boards on Tuesday in the Victorious effort for wake Hill thats slightly Off the Mark to hildr just the two points for hrth in the first half wake running Spiller is missing that one bounced off the edge of the rim as well for Johnson and then Huntley Hatfield hauls it in pass finds Hill carves his way to the Music rim yeah Ill State a couple of things theyve been able to get out and run uh playing a little bit more full court theyve gotten some turnovers gotting to the free throw line gotten inside and and really solace being in foul trouble being on the bench is has really opened the door for him as well NC St has made four of its last five field goal attempts at the other end the guy doing all the work is Juke Harris Mike hes got 12 yeah hes hes really saved the day for them in the first half as you mentioned hes gotten into double digits and two ACC games against BC and the Syracuse game and I really I really like him when they get him the ball in on the low Applause block also picked up a rebound there Johnson on the bounce Nifty Globe Trot her dribble into the lane couldnt finish it off Huntley Hatfield runs to the corner tried to save it and a foul was called Spillers was near him we got a fourpoint game ety stay and wake CW Courtside Applause Saturday specifically Juke Harris held them in has held him in this ball game 12 points for Harris with Huntley Hatfield at the free throw line for NC State both teams in the bonus 303 to go in the first half seven points now for Huntley Hatfield Fon Reed just trying to think things over in this first 20 minutes of Applause action one of two for Huntley Hatfield Reed has two points so far in the first half its only played five minutes and change because of the foul trouble its uh its interesting you know some some coaches wont play guys with uh with the two fouls wide open spillars and uh Steve forb is going to take a chance with with number 23 out there who has two fouls Salis that a great pass and theyre going to play by Tyler Johnson and theyre going to Zone try to hide him a little Applause bit shot clock is down to eight for Hill thats pass oh pass hes got the three ball well hes another fouryear guy whos out on the floor hes actually had his moments at NC State over the years and a little niche for himself this year this is his 100th game he yep has not started a game in an NC State uniform and hes the best threepoint shooter by percentage at 54 on the season his career game first game this year 14 points Salis well defended by Styles Johnson ended up with it 140 and rolling in the first half soles he cant drive hes he got to protect against a charge hildr ran into a double team Harris trying to bail him out great movement without the basketball for number two in old gold and black yeah pretty good find by H hildr too how about 14 points in the first half for Juke Harris Applause Hill flings it back over to Applause Styles hildr chisels his way to the basket well thats his game right there I mean hes so strong he wants to get into the pain area overpower you try to get the three Point play four points for a hildr they try the alleyoop Spillers deflects it away goes out of bounds on the save attempt by Salis what a crossover and he gets his shoulders pass you youre not going to be able to do a whole lot did he play to the camera at the very end of that mik he looked down at that Cameron says I got a lot more moves left hes got four points now senior who wear who wore number two Mike for three years and now hes changed to number six with the change in the rule on single digits Taylor deflected hildr hold for the last shot sixpoint wake Applause lead final second Harris Got It Away off the rim Des spite that Miss what a first half from Juke Harris with 14 points and so wake will go in the first half as they have the basketball as we crank up the second 20 minutes from Winston Salem North Carolina in the ACC on the CW Hill explosive to the rim and he spins it in Marcus Hill yeah and given that if Im NC State I mean their mindset changed in the second 10 minutes of the first half Id keep a attacking read you know see if you can get that early third foul thats now 10 points for marus Hill Jr 10th time this season to double digits hildr had it bounce off the edge of the backboard I think Hunley Hatfield got a piece of that yeah see I mean you look at re Reed just laid off that play he knows that he cannot attack anybody going to the rim Jaden Taylor was there to clean up the mess Jaden Taylor number eight in red is the leading scorer this season along with Marcus Hill Jr they both average 12 and 1 12 points per game for Kevin Keats its a twopoint Game hildr Pass in tight quarters What A Catch by Spillers good Applause hands that good find inside he was ready to catch thats eight points now for Trayvon Spillers the senior from Charleston South Carolina hildr got a piece of that one deflected it out of bounds itll stay with NC State and now hildr will Trot to the bench Juke Harris is in 14 points a season high in the first half for the Freshman Juke Harris hes certainly earned his court time in the second half quick release that was for two out of the corner from Taylor and the pack is going to get another chance again that was a twopoint attempt Applause NC State LED for about 20 seconds in the first half they LED three to2 okell on the drive Spillers may have gotten a piece of it oconnell Trails the play and thats where his value is going to be as a second guy in on the shot block here with that with Reed but you know just Reeds presence out there is going to be a key Hill hustles it up o Connell Catch and Release Fon Reed with the position falling out of bounds and he was able to send it to a Applause teammate Johnson looks over at the bench for some Music instruction Johnson crosscourt Salis money again not a strength of his and uh a tough way to get your scoring going from behind the threepoint line but much needed 22nd made three of the season for Hunter Salis double digits now for the 13th time this season Connell is open and he makes no mistake in front of his own bench well wake had wake had a couple of guys and key guys leave the program last year but they were really happy that Solas stayed couple of threepointers now for oconnell intense D on Salis denies him entry shot clock Mike is at six for Johnson the recognition from Salas Huntley Hatfield and Spillers went shouldertoshoulder and that is off of NC State well and with the clock where it was I mean salz has the size advantage over okono I would have liked to have seen him take him off the dribble try to get closer but he couldnt he had to settle for the shot theres only 910 of a second on the shot clock just enough for a tip you cant catch him Salis got rid of it that is going to be a shot clock violation so The Possession really never developed for Wake four is then its back to NC Music State wol pack three and two in their last five games that includes a win in early December at overtime at home against Florida State 8474 and that one sails into the Applause seats so wake will get it right back on Deck game two CW Courtside Saturday Duke and SMU for early season Supremacy in the ACC Johnson sheds his Defender with a Nifty behind the back dribble hours and hours in the gym Mike refining those Music Applause skills Connell on Harris shot clock at five Johnson in trouble second straight possession shot clock violation wake well and thats on your point guard and thats on Johnson hes got to have a sense of where the shot clock is he didnt NC State did a nice job of getting some size on him to cover him up its a couple now shot clock situations that wake has had in halfcourt possessions fourpoint lead for Wake Middlebrooks bounces it had it deflected Away by Spillers Johnson runs it up spin cycle Middlebrooks recovered deflected it out of bounds when we come back pack emotional piece of that just considering where Janetta had come from a year ago just an incredible story what a moment for that family Mike yeah Im you know just going through it last year and checking in checking in with Steve and uh following her progress and uh great great story you know it is it is a wonderful thing to have that type of motivation at the end to see yourself through something like that Christophers wife Ally also in attendance this afternoon as Styles hits the turn around son Christopher is the video coordinator sits right next to the wave Forest bench demon decks are 70 at home 10 and4 on the season one Tuesday at Syracuse theyre in a fourpoint tussle Mak it a sixpoint lead thanks to Salis right really nice job of w clearing that left side out there was really no opportunity for state to help on the drive 12 points now for Salis Styles not bashful at all the Miss Huntley half field over the top rips it away with one hand found Hill Spillers helping again knocked it away for a second time Taylor the shot it goes over the backboard but you cant still I mean they get the possession but too many opportunities for NC State that time wakes got to come up with the ball before Applause that early stages of the second half wake had a sixpoint lead as it does now after the first half Salas directs a little traffic thats the thing Salis is hes going to have a a height Advantage just about anybody whos guarding Applause him nice twoman game that time just this is a you know the game is can be pretty simple sometimes we make it a little more complicated than it should be twoman basketball left hand out of the court and you know Reeds not a guy whos going to play Above the Rim but you dont have to Styles picked up the foul to put Reed at the free throw line chance at the old school threepoint play dont you think that uh coach Forbes likes to see those two guys out doing the pick and roll rather than sitting on the bench with two fouls thats a way better view seeing them on the court here at Joel Coliseum fantastic catch on the pass by Reed as well and he completes the threepoint play Fon Reed the senior from Richmond Virginia transfer from Gonzaga and LSU second year in the Wake program 101st career game for Fon Reed denying the entry to Middlebrooks from Styles was Reed defensively shot clock winding down on pass cant calculate the angle Reed up ahead and now just off the fingertips of an anxious Spillers he was looking at The Rim rather than getting control of the ball pretty good look ahead watch he kind of right there he just was he wanted to get to the rim so badly but thats why you got to hustle back he sensed Middlebrooks was right over his shoulder yep so good Hustle by Middlebrooks to get back in the play Applause Styles shot clock at seven for o Connell trying to find some daylight pulls up on the Baseline bounce back to oconnell somehow and he converts hes got eight points yeah theyve got it again good really good solid defensive stand shot clock running down NC State gets a second chance in a basket Michael oconnell has a couple of threepointers to go along with that jumper just moments ago Salis easy little shot for Salis 14 points lead back up to nine for Wake 12 and A2 minutes to go in our second half whistle stops play from Tommy morrisy on the Baseline W foul charge to number two J haris that both second foul on Juke Harris so now Salis and Harris Mike with the leading scores for Wake both have 14 Juke had all his points in the first half you can tell from the crowd reaction which way this is going and thats another one on Harris Music Applause well and he you know freshman have to be real careful around referees you got you have to earn those calls to a certain degree get up say nice whistle sir and then and come back and play again middle Brooks against Reed held his ground wake wants to run Salis had it up on the rim was trying to jam it it comes back to Johnson and he hits its a three ball for Applause Johnson timeout NC State tyar Johnson with the three for the decks this ground he didnt the key thing there was he never brought his hands down Kevin Keats was saying he was got him with his body and that technical was called during the timeout Salis is at the free throw line for the technical you know and that well then the Wake bench was screaming for a a uh goal tending on the initial call there it got tapped back out and they hit a three right Salis was trying to dunk it and it spun off the rim and back out to Johnson for three and remember prior to all this it was styles on the drive and he ran into Harris thought he had position but the foul went against Harris his third personal for awake on the drive by styles on the Baseline back and forth we go 57 43 wa on a 122 run one of their last seven from the floor for NC State Styles the help from Johnson and he took it away looking for Applause Salis probably a good decision at that point Parker defending Salis wake slowing it down shot loock is inside of 10 Johnson travels so when we come back NC state has the basketball wake out in front 57 final four appearance they lost to Ohio State in the semifinals that was in Louisville Kentucky they played in a third place game Mike and they beat UCLA 8280 Cincinnati was the national champion Billy Packer on that team and Jerry Lucas John havich on the Ohio State team the third place game and uh Billy Packer or um bones McKinny they might have invented the three man in the booth um with Jim Packer and Billy Packer and Jim fcker they did that for a while didnt they that is old school we love it absolutely how old school it is they did my games in the late 70s to do all the way to the Final Four mik 1978 against Kentucky not to bring it up well thats when thats when thats when being on TV was a big deal and you know what its still a big deal right yes it is especially on CW Courtside Saturday yes it is by the way weve only got room for two people here at the table at Wake Forest so hildr coming back in for Wake Forest Spillers goes to the bench you know what and the thing that Im noticing is that Steve Forbes is doing some hes doing some substituting but he is keeping the Freshman Juke Harris out on the floor and hes playing with three personal fouls 14 points in the first half for Harris has not scored in the second half you know Id imagine we get into under the 8 Minute Mark that hell have his veterans out on the floor but the Freshman has played very well today lot of dribbling from Salis finally got the shot away and itll stay down down 18 points now for Music Applause Salis largest lead of the game in the first half by wake was 15 well one of the reasons that uh theyve been able to build up this lead too theyve been able to keep State off of the free throw line middle Brooks was maneuvering on the inside and a foul is called thatll be Fon Reed in his third hey call it both ways only the fourth team foul so both teams pretty far away from the bonus little body check by Eon Reed has to be careful here against Middlebrooks and that could be number four on number four and it is well and uh spillers bar barely enough time to get a gatorade over on the sideline hes back in the game number well and you know nice job by m he he understands the situation and goes right back at him and that was just basically the same play that wasnt called earlier and so maybe that technical by Kevin Keats paid some divid ends there so Fon Reed walking to the bench quick discussion evid he saying its the same thing I didnt get called on well its you know know he he did appear to kind of move into Middlebrooks just a little bit enough for the foul of course the folks here at Joel Coliseum didnt like it and neon Reed has to go to the bench and take a seat well this is the point in the first half where NC State started to take advantage of things Johnson the pass to Harris and he fumbled it out of bounds back to the pack 10 turnovers in the game now for Wake crucial possession right here with N9 and a half minutes to go for NC State you see this is I mean you talked about the Virginia game the second half look how many touches middle Brooks has gotten here in the second half this is the option they didnt have up in Charlottesville but lets see how many times he gets the ball here at least how many times the offense runs through him especially with SP guarding him and again Middlebrooks did not play in that game in Charlottesville because of an illness just prior to tip off he tried to go just couldnt do it wasnt available for the game Taylor that one rims out kind of an awkward falling down move to the rim heres hild On The Run he send it into the corner Harris strong move Dennis Parker picks up the foul on the drive by Harris who is still on the Applause floor Juke Harris with a confident drive out of that corner and now just kind of shake it off as he goes to the free throw line three of four from the line for Harris in the game dont forget Cooper flag and Duke part of our second game of the CW court side double header as they take on SMU both teams undefeated in conference play and on seven game winning streaks its coming up next Moody Coliseum is the site Brian Oliver Tom brenaman will take you through Duke and SMU I actually played in Moody Coliseum 19 1977 December that will be one of the five alltime meetings between those programs Hill somehow hanging and scoring good solid finish inside hes got 12 points what an addition he has been for Kevin Keats senior from Rockford Illinois and a transfer from Bowling Green first team allc conference selection in the Mac Johnson got caught in the air Spillers gathers it and lays it in he really bailed out his teammate that time Johnson getting caught up in the air 10 points now for Spillers double digits seventh time this season its also got four double doubles thats Middlebrooks a twisting attempt he hit the floor Johnson grabs it yeah Spillers got lucky that time when for the steel was caught out of position Music Johnson down the lane soft bounce and he really gets caught in some awkward positions in the air but somehow finds a way to get it done the lead is now 16 it is the largest of the day wake led by 15 Midway through the first half and a foul coming up on the decks theyve got the big lead with seven and A2 minutes to go thing to keep an eye on Tom Spillers we got Fon Reed on the bench with four Spillers has three still 7 and A2 minutes to go in this game he cannot pick up the fourth foul in the next one or two minutes or wakes going to be in some serious trouble Salis leads all scorers with 18 points that is right on his season average of 182 to lead waken scoring this season Music the careerhigh 33 points in February of last season against NC State on this floor for Salis Harris to the rim for the jam and hes just adding two career hives from here on out Juke Carris has 17 points on new season high scored 12 points in a home win against Boston College in December conell front rim yeah theyre going to go Zone and Spillers better not breathe on anybody for the foreseeable Applause future and uh he really shouldnt even be around the offensive boards Applause either wake up near 52 shooting in the first half they are way above that in the second half as well Middlebrooks picked up the foul thats Harris who is oh hes just tired hes not used to not used to playing these big minutes hes smiling at least look at hildr draw the defenders mic and find Harris yeah Defender got caught looking good uh you see everybodys really spread out midd Brooks really had no chance to recover Harris is favoring the left leg as he hops to the bench that may be just a cramp well hes smiling so Im hoping thats an indication of something not overly serious well keep an eye on that hes like hes like I cant believe this Im rolling out there and I got a cramp 17 points for Juke Harris he season I was 12 he shattered that in the first half with 14 points overall wake for the game Mike shooting Music 57 Frederickson is in there number seven prepoint specialist andri Spillers has the advantage over o Connell and utilizes it nice job on that sniffing that mismatch out and really a on a real positive note for Wake two five of 11 for three so their improved threepoint shooting continues 12 points for Spillers as pass loses it out of bounds unforced turnover well wake made nine threes Mike in the victory on Tuesday at the Dome yeah hes just saying Steve forb said yesterday that it just Novembers numbers were just really have driven them down steel oconnell beats Johnson to the rim and lays it in you know that was Johnson was looking in to try to set up the offense and thats just that was just great Hands by oconnell since the 2122 season wakes home record is 55 and7 Frederickson free ball Corner Pocket that was a tough shot too I mean you know to with the pump fake and his Defender still right there 71 51 in the second three for Frederickson Hill in traffic knocked away hildr up ahead frericks in the Applause catch Salis Baseline Applause 20 points now for Salis after that Baseline jumper seventh time this season Mike 20 points or more for Salis yeah again the the length of Salis and then this is the one thing that wake has really done well this game to look ahead you know you can advance the ball off the dribble or off the look ahead and you know hes so just so good in his midrange game I mean you know hes going to get his somehow some way and uh you know credit this I think were seeing a nice maturation of of the Freshman Juke Harris hes putting a string of games together at the right time for this team in uh early January thats four straight games now for Salis yep with 20 points or more in the last three games Mike hes gone for 23 points or more in all of those including a game high 23 at the Dome on Tuesday against Syracuse and the last four games for Juke Harris have been really good as Applause Music Applause well now if they could get number seven Fredrickson to show you what kind of what the stretch that hes been in this is only the fourth game this year where hes had multiple baskets made in a game hes just too good of a shooter Qui for f turns to 25 spers fourth on Spillers yep and and now youre in youre okay youre at the youre four minutes you got your two guys with four fouls so Reeds coming back in with four youre up by 22 as well yeah yeah so you youve youve massaged this into a you know youre youre not youre not popping Tums over there on the Sidelines just a sixpoint game at Halftime although I think it like hes grabbing he may have a little acid re still how does number one not have a single foul so Wake Forest again trying to stay perfect at home something they have done the last three seasons they have started 10 and0 at home for the last three years and theyre on their way to 8 and0 with the 20point lead right now against NC State teams will play again just the first meeting theyll play again late February in Raleigh NC State the defending AC tournament Champs all the way to the final four last year today however the second half especially belongs to Wake Forest and that guy hunter Salis all the way across to Applause hildr six made threes for wake in the game thats a foul against Wake On The Styles move hildr hits the court picks up the foul second on hildr elb there its a its really really hard to get a to get a charge call the emphasis is on the plant foot of the driver you must be in position prior to the driver planting the foot to jump to the rim its a very close call in most instances Styles at the free throw Applause line got his own Miss for a moment he was on the Baseline and might have stepped on it will be w ball good effort by styles to try to get it back so the trouble for NC State Mike is they have not won since de December 22nd at home against Ryder 8963 as they put the pressure in the back court Frederickson broken skillfully capable hands of Hunter Applause Salis mid December NC State went to Kansas and lost at Allen Fieldhouse shot CL clock down to two Johnson misses Styles the Music rebound middle Brooks tes up the three if W can make this lead stand up thatll be four wins in their last five games five wins in their last seven as Middlebrook SWAT at that one and got a piece of HRI 7354 just over 3 minutes to go in game one of Courts side Saturday game one on the C 20 points on the game may add to that in the last three eight of 13 shooting with hild at the free throw line eight of 13 for Salis couple of threepointers above a season average of 182 to lead the team Steve Forbes was was talking yesterday that you know beginning of the year with you know having to scramble you learn his team they played 10 games well everybody you know is playing they played 10 games in November with 16 practices to prepare and he just felt like his team was not ready and uh but he likes he likes where they are and I I tell you a couple of things with uh Juke Harris continues to improve like this thats going to be a big plus and if they can get Parker Frederickson right thats going to be another big bonus 177 points a season high in the game for Juke Harris Steel by Fon Reed cuz this team can defend um they they their defensive numbers are really strong so theyre on their way to Victory today they won earlier this week at Syracuse the other ACC games December 21st at Clemson that was a loss for wake 7362 and the win against BC at home 7266 that was early December theyre theyre really looking for for and now they they they played they had a week off they played today theyve got another week off and then they play and I know theyre theyre looking forward to getting into a regular rhythm to finish out the regular season Hustle by hildr to keep it alive and a foul Marcus Hill picked up the foul y the game at Miami next Saturday 515 Easter mik is on the CW they beat Miami At Home in overtime in their only meeting last season 8682 for with a new head coach down there another end of a Bill Courtney taking over for Jim Lena end of an era dont forget what coach Lena did over the last few years in El leite eight a final four W an ACC tournament Championship as well for that program fine man I mean just unbelievable always so good to us when we visit Hill I would keep my eye on number 10 as the season progresses for NC State L hes got 14 yeah Marcus Hill good again good Applause size I think again Hunter Hunter hat Hunley Hatfield is a a key for them to try to find some consistency Applause Music de basketball so the demon digs about a minute and a half away from winning their 11th game of the season theyre going to improve to 11 and four 3 and one in conference play NC State will drop to eight and six one and two in ACC play technically they have not won a road game theyll go to 0 and three in True Road game games spent the week on the road in Syracuse New York and Winston Salem North Carolina coming up empty for Kevin Music Applause Keats still hustling look at Middlebrooks and hildr Diving for that

finally gets a you know hes hes starting to get into the starting rle he been a backup for most of his career first game of the season hildr had 33 points against Elon for a career high Styles hanging
