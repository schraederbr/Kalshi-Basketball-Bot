we played on january 2nd and for us we have acc basketball we thought we left these issues behind in 2020 they carry over into 2021 roy williams said this game came together in just 30 minutes notre dame was supposed to fly to pittsburgh instead they fly to north carolina and we are set for basketball the tar heels in their home whites and notre dame with juwan durham jumping center its the tar heels who have the basketball first to get things underway here at the dean dome and you can see that number two caleb love is in the starting lineup at the point for the tar heels as coach williams corey continues to shuffle the deck right now he is looking for the best unit to be able to start this game defensively and thats really whats been the issue for north carolina over their past two losses theyve lost for their last six games and owe into an acc theyve got to find a defensive identity and they find one on the first possession armando baycott doing a great job playing threequarter front causing the turnover for juan durham there you see the hall of famer inducted into the nate smith memorial hall of fame 13 years ago a threetime national champion with the tar heels roy williams down to the low post they go and a foul call that will send deyron sharp to the freethrow line looking so casual making the trip in and we had to check the weather its 55 56 degrees in chapel hill its about 32 in south bend so it does feel springish maybe a little summers to mike gray 20 degree difference from where hes been corey i got a question for you think if they were playing in pittsburgh today as scheduled hed be wearing shorts i do not believe coach bray would have won the shorts in pittsburgh but really when you think about what has happened this year in college basketball the games being canceled making up you know games and creating games and on a 30minute phone call 48 hours before tipoff this is car for the course this is what youre supposed to do youre supposed to wear shorts this is like aau season right now doug nobody even had time to really scout each other on this but north carolina does a great job on backtoback defensive possessions carolina took it away and then gave it up here comes prentice hub two on one for the irish if they hurry and its an easy layup on the break by juwan durham Music we got a shot of roy williams earlier and who he was talking to was actually the acc preseason player of the year garrison brooks who is not in the starting lineup for the second straight game for the tar heels but you can see garrison brooks of course not holding any ill effects towards coach williams the two having a great conversation early and garrison brooks will be making an entry soon but deyron sharp getting a start coming off to a good start already four points for him to start the game last time out north carolina on wednesday lost in atlanta to georgia tech and brooks didnt start that game because of defense the previous game were not sure why hes coming off the bench here but i would think by the end of this one corey hes going to wind up playing starters minutes im sure he will be and right now we see notre dame in the zone defense because they are going to dare north carolina to beat them from the outside and most teams right now dont fear north carolinas outside shooting they fear those big guys up front and the best way to try to defend them is through that zone defense sharp stepped on the end line give it back to the fighting irish yeah these two teams very different in their makeup north carolina very deep going to see a lot of players coming in and very big inside notre dame is his custom for mike gray doesnt have a deep bench and were only going to see six or seven irish play in this one well weve already seen more production by cormac ryan and the entire notre dame backcourt in this game that we saw the entire first half for them against virginia they only had one point from their back court in the first half of that game ryans threepointer gives them a bigger lead over notre dame on wednesday dane goodwin with the basketball lazy pass love couldnt save it it goes out of bounds notre dame will keep with 15 seconds on the shot clock but great hustle by caleb love getting into the passing lane there love didnt start the game against georgia tech because of his defensive grade against nc state so he showed coach williams that he belonged back to that starting lineup in the georgia tech game where he did knock down two threepointers so right now caleb loved going back at the point guard position as rj davis will come off the bench for the tar heels certainly theres been a lot of discussion about the freshman backcourt for north carolina here in the early going this season what have you seen from them cory and what more needs to be done for unc from those guys well honestly right now were experiencing when you look at caleb love and rj davis both of them they are freshman point guards in the acc i did that doug it is not a easy task to be able to have now weve seen players make it look easy over the past few years however its not easy and these two guys who are great hospital players are figuring it out on the fly right now the problem is they dont have a tremendous amount of veteran leadership around them to show them the way as far as backcourt players oftentimes you have guys coming in and theyve got guys whove been in the system that can show them how its done they dont have that as far as the backcourt when you consider andrew playtech is the only god that has experience from north carolina that could show them the way but play tech not a point guard difficult for him to do so by for notre dame another pass deflected out of bounds that notre dame will keep with 15 on the shot clock you love the energy by caleb love getting out in the passing lane and now rj davis gets his turn coming in both these guys have started together for the majority of the season thus far but now davis will take over with the point guard position and that seems to be perhaps where coach williams is going off the turnover itll be carolina basketball that against georgia tech coach williams seemed to play the two freshman guards together less and thats what weve seen in the first four minutes here today and part of that was because he wanted to have playtek on the floor you know more and walton has really kind of carved a niche for himself in this lineup as well he has been their most consistent shooter from beyond the arc where north carolina has struggled hes been the one god they can depend on to knock down the shot and there is walton on cue on the nice kick out from brooks inside out the tar heels take a twopoint lead well you know thats the only reason i said that because i knew he was gonna catch it on that but yeah of course i knew he was gonna catch on that possession and knock down the three but when you look at walton three for four from beyond the threepoint are nine points for him versus georgia tech and hes the only guy thats been consistently giving them a threat from beyond that three point on now nine of 17 on the year from distance irish get those three right back to retake the lead at eight to seven off the triple by nicola jojo and kevin walton finding his spot on the floor for the tar heels happy to

notre dame they have to defend the three teams are shooting 393 against him from beyond the threepoint arc and mike bray always teaches play with confidence so hes going to make sure he gets that across to his team through the remainder this year for north carolina they have to take care of the basketball turnovers have been an issue for them 18 turnovers and backtoback losses to start out acc play and then they have to find a defensive identity hes having to rotate his lineups to trying to find a group that can get stops regardless of how good you are offensively where north carolina is not his best offensive team this year you still have to defend and they have not been able to do that at a high level which has cost them games early in this season cormac ryan guarded by leaky black goodwin gives it back to ryan hes already made one three good close out by black this has been a sloppy start to the game both ways that is the ninth shot attempt combined they both have four turnovers per team and thats not like notre dame basketball north carolina weve seen them turn the basketball over a lot in the past couple of seasons but notre dame takes care of the basketball thats one of their strengths and you see dane goodwin doing a tremendous job overpowered and really outmatched physically on the block versus daeron sharp but he did not give up on that battle does a great job coming up with the basketball and making the turnover for north carolina yeah giving up five inches and 65 pounds in that matchup but he still was able to take the ball away and well get the inbound Applause apprentice up the 63 junior point guard from upper marlboro maryland who is the unquestioned leader of this notre dame team one of four quad captains but hes the guy that makes notre dame go well and its the junior class when you consider hub goodwin as well as juscesky these are these guys are the core of this team as goodwin knocks down to three and now three threepointers made all ready for notre dame in this game and that is a staple of what they want to be able to do but when you look at those three guys in a junior class they have to have production from these three guys on a nightly basis to be successful in acc play notre dame leads the acc this season and threepointers made per game and in shooting percentage three more for north carolina at the other end on the triple by leaky black and thats thats really bonus basketball when you consider leaky black knocking down threes hes a capable scorer but really has not been able to be the guy that can roy williams can rely on consistently to put points on the board but coach williams really would prefer to see leaky black become a lockdown defender even more so than a knockdown shooter rj davis now at the point gives it to brooks inside they go playing big to big but deyron sharp missed it carolina continues the possession bring it back out front to black pull up from 14 well short but two offensive rebounds for north carolina on this possession alone and thats where the tar heels beat you normally it ends up being a threepointer and it does for kermit walton whos a recipient of a definite home court bounce well carolina has been so good again this year corey rebounding the basketball but what theyve not done this year that they usually do is turn those into points that time they did leshesky clean look nothing but net and thats one of the plays that honestly would drive coaches matt you know nate leschewski is shooting the basketball as well as anyone in the country leads to acc and field goal percentage but shoots over 55 percent from three he should never get an open look against your defense ron sharp on the block hes got six early points tar heels back in front notre dame players have already made threepoint shots in this ball game well thats been the kryptonite for north carolina in games that they have lost this year teams are averaging 11 made threepoint field goals against the tar heels so when they won games theyre holding teams to about six threepoint field goals a game so when you look at what theyre doing in a nice driving kick by jogo who finds the chesky and theyll tell you what when they dont even consider touching the rim thats when theyre pure dougie fresh everybodys been pure so far today notre dame is a team four for five on threepointers north carolina even better three for three so it combined seven for eight shooting from threepoint land now pop johnson off the bench misfires another opportunity for davis no and armando bacon who has arguably been the best tar heel this year will go to the freethrow line i agree and thats my boy doing a great job just kicks the first one out to a wide open shoe to rj davis you dont mind that but i really appreciate the fact that he went up strong with the second one drawing the foul and you talked about it we had a conversation with roy williams earlier today armando has really become their most consistent performer he leaves north carolina in scoring but get this duck his 19 points yeah i can i cant remember which game was but he had a 19 point game this year that is the highest scoring game for a tar heel this season the fact that not one north carolina tar heel has had a 20point game notre dame has had four separate players for a 20point game this season north carolina has not have one and youre talking about normally an offensive juggernaut that is the tar heels that is a surprising stat pop johnson with this stick back threepoint carolina lead and north carolina going to some full court pressure but when you beat the pressure all the time teams can find an advantage and theres the advantage wide open three for pretty soon unable to knock it down rj davis gives it back to brooks good shot fake and then the foul called against matt zona Music puff johnson off the bench for carolina with the put back heels up early no more hanging leg raises countless crunches and

guests today it all starts with a clean shave in the morning get yourself right wound up and ready to go Music our game summary shows some pretty good shooting for both the irish and the tar heels some sloppy play as well but uh two of the freshmen in the unc starting lineup deyron sharp and that man kerwin walton have combined for 12 points corey and you know whats so strange is kerwin walton is the only north carolina freshman that was not a top 100 in our espn 100 this year of course dayron sharp was the highest rated freshman for the tar heels but walton has really been a surprise for north carolina this year but his ability to shoot to three has been much needed and hes shown that in this game yeah he was a fairly late add to the recruiting class after brandon huffman transferred to jacksonville state and after jeremiah francis transferred to new mexico a scholarship was open walton was added and like you say he was almost an afterthought in terms certainly of what the fans were expecting coming into the year but not an afterthought for roy williams he has earned his way into the rotation and has become their reliable knockdown shooter but hes getting the job done defensively which allows him to stay on the floor to add on to have the opportunity to knock down those threes right now roy williams trying to find a defensive group a team that he can win with on the defensive end of the floor not just by outscoring opponents dane goodwin with the basketball ford notre dame 1105 remaining in the half goodwin puts it out now would that qualify in mike brays book as a bad shot but one of the shots coach wants him to go and take so hes aggressive well he wants him to be aggressive and often times but he would like for dan goodwin to find shots on a straight drive not having to make an individual move where hes spinning and doing that thats an opportunity to kick the basketball out when his teammates create shots for him he wants him to shoot over defenders if he has to because hes such a deadly shooter from beyond a threepoint off and what im alluding to is in practice for notre dame mike bray gets angry if goodwin within the first 10 minutes of every practice doesnt take what he thinks is a bad shot and that is an indication for coach of whether hes looking for his shot enough well hes actually asked nate liszeski to take some bad shots but im not sure there is a bad shot for leszewski when you consider the fact that he is shooting 662 percent from the field coming into this game leads the nation and this is a guy that knocks down threes hub all the way to the rim for his first two points comes averaging 15 per game yeah welcome sign princess hub has been inconsistent his last five games hes had two double figure games a game where he scored zero points and also a four point game versus virginia as armando bayco continues to dominate the offensive glass and notre dame as a team has only six collective rebounds being out rebounded as youd expect by notre dame or by north carolina rather here in this one andrew playtech with a rebound hell dribble up the senior from guilderland new york caleb love tough shot left it short fight for it comes to the fighting irish and it goes out of bounds back to north carolina in the kickout its the best time always to shoot the three offensive rebound kick out that has been the mo for north carolina notre dame paying north carolina back with a bit of its own medicine but when nate lachey catches the basketball just like lamar mundane back in the day dougie fresh lay up well you see the uh the shooting percentage as corey talked about with lazzewski he is top five acc in scoring and in rebounding and now hes not john mooney but he is a clearly changed player this year for notre dame and mike gray said that he knew it when they came off of their summer break he just looked different and carried himself with a different confidence than they had seen their first two years in south bend im going to go as far as to say john moon hes known nate leshesky either right because because john mooney was a heck of a player for mike brand notre dame but i can never remember john mooney shooting the basketball the way that leshesky does now if you had the two of them together playing like this notre dame would be having a one beside their the name because theyd be the top team in the country with mooney right now still a lot to replace off of last year losing 16 and a half and 12 and a half per game with mooney graduating how has notre dame done with that and how has leschewski been able to fill some of that void well one of the things that notre dame has done you know unlike many teams throughout the country they have played the toughest of tough schedules when you consider who they play and how mike bray has gone about this season he has basically said hey i dont care who we play or where we play them i want to make sure we get our games in so when ncaa has to make a selection as to who has played at least 13 games i want to be in the mix and they are doing a great job of going out and competing against this team but he does feel as though they need to start putting some more wins together notre dame the takeaway and on the drive to the bucket elijah morgan was fouled and will shoot free throws when we come back to the dean dome

the fighting irish north carolina though this is a telling stat with the with the tar heels this year corey it really has been when you consider the fact that in their losses they teams are averaging making 11 threes against them but only 64 in the games theyve won this season you know you talk about us being at home dougie fresh i just got a text from my guy rasheed wallace who i know is making brunch today for dinner and you know say hey come through afterwards i could have ate good if i was at the ding dong right now and all of a sudden now ive got to eat cereal because im not hanging out with she after ill tell you what my boy can cook he puts it down he sends videos of what hes doing with his chef she i cant do it like that i cant do it like that ducky fresh my boy gets it done well how far would the drive be for you now to get to chapel hill if cooking is that good get there for dinner its about an hour and a half from me from statesville to chapel hill about an hour and a half hour 45 to get there but uh you know my invitation only lasted for a particular amount of time hey theres a big part of leycheskys game that is so much better this year hes able to put it on the floor and with confidence absorb contact and finish but a lot of that has to do with the fact that mike gray told us how he came back physically he didnt see him for five months but when he came back he could tell he was a different player physically and that strength allows you the confidence to be able to take that basketball to the rim hes not only driving to score but also driving to set up his teammates and leshesky right now is doing everything he can to keep notre dame with the lead that little jump hook by walker kessler ended a long drought for carolina and he picks up the blocked shot at the rim here comes playtech the other way has it poked away i like zogo attacking kessler on that possession but he missed a wide open leshesky with one more pass and again leskis shooting it so well you can pretty much put it in the book as soon as he lines it up late for mac ryan fighting for it and its yet another offensive rebound for the tar heels theyre sixth already today and another one but this is one of the things that mike ray talked to us about earlier his team has to get better at sticking their nose in defensively and finishing possessions its one thing to make a team miss but its something completely different to be able to finish off the possession coming up with a defensive rebound ryan the stanford transfer misfires tar heels down four with a basketball five and a half minutes remaining in the half foul before the shot as caleb love looked to attack you see nate liszeski driving dave ron sharp and getting to the outside of rim avoiding the shot blocker and you see sharp helped earlier on that possession but walker kessler having no parts of jogo coming recruit coming out of high school and he may be the most improved player in the acc so far this year corey what do you think i believe so i mean right now when you look at the league i cant imagine anyone that has grown more as a player than has nate over the beginning of this season yeah the other guys we just saw baicot miss he certainly improved and i would say isaiah wong at miami and quincy gary at syracuse would also be in that conversation but i dont think any of them match up to the jump that leshestis made you know what and i i dont know why i fell for that because i knew that that was a way for you to get syracuse in i knew you had some type of syracuse isaiah wongs my guy okay i tell you whos the guy right now Applause who said i thought that was joko that was not joko knocking down the three that was morgan way back brooks fires away nothing but net give him three more the acc preseason player of the year draws the heels back to within four thats notre dame basketball drive and kick find the open man unable to finish it but mike bray loves that offensive possession right there apprentice hub touching the paint and contracting the defense allowing one of his teammates to be able to find an open shot and then the highlow basketball for north carolina is their staple and of course another opportunity offensive rebound they dont come away with but they challenge opponents on the offensive glass every time and you look at how much energy notre dame has to put into each and every defensive possession just to come up with the basketball offering north carolina miss side off the back iron one and done for notre dame davis nice look ryan gave black room and he didnt want to pull the trigger corey instead leaky black drives the bucket Applause well garrison brooks we talked about him not being a starter but he was going to find his way into the lineup and this time he finds three jake from state farm if you hear this must be a state farm from us sure is it also means its about to go down oh dont worry chris things are gonna go surprisingly great oh ive been

womens basketball triple header right here on acc network and the espn app we start with 81 clemson and miami noon eastern then number three nc state host bc at reynolds coliseum and we cap the afternoon with georgia tech taking on notre dame sunday womens basketball on acc network with corey alexander im doug sherman back inside the dean dome one of the places in the acc not allowing fans in and that is more than normal though some are allowing limited capacity this year during the pandemic quarry ive wondered about this i mean we we always talk about the importance of home court advantage especially in college athletics but this year to me its basically a moot point to talk about home court advantage because what advantage is gained here today for instance by the tar heels i would disagree with that and the reason that there is an advantage is because the tar heels shoot on this court every day and that is the advantage is knowing your own home gym and really the depth perception and the environment in which youre playing in so even though there are no fans cheering you on there is still an advantage to being at home because of familiarity of the gym so as we saw kansas at fog allen field house home against texas today lose by 25 weve seen duke lose twice at home at cameron as bacon gets his first points weve seen kentucky lose at home at rough arena by some fairly big numbers do you think those outcomes would have happened if cameron was cameron ruff was rough and fogg was five i think that the fact that i think they would have gotten a boost from the crowd but youre also talking about teams that struggle to shoot the basketball on a consistent basis and so texas is good whether theyre playing on the road or playing at home remember texas won the maui invitational beat this north carolina team coming into asheville doing so texas is good so they may not have beaten kansas as bad as they did at fog island but i believe they still would have won going into that building same thing for people going into kentucky because kentuckys struggling with their freshman this year on an 80 run sparked by the man at the free throw line armando baicot Music and baker doing a great job sealing on the interior we talked about nate liszeski and him getting stronger and more physical over the summer but not physical enough to deal with mondo on that block and thats the armando baycott i love watching when he goes to dunk everything on the interior finishing the basketball finishing off plays and doing the same at the freethrow line and corey he looks to me armando does like hes in better shape his body looks a little different than it did a year ago right i can tell you right now ive been around this young man now for a very very long time this is the best shape hes ever been in in his life and not only has he cut down the weight hes gained muscle and has become so much more physical on the floor i was going through my phone the other day looking and i probably should have sent this in to our producer lauren earlier clearing out photos and i had a picture of that his mom christy sent me when he went to a camp in the eighth grade and he was a little doughboy and to see that to what hes become now is amazing but was a very good basketball player then now hes a very good basketball player and a great athlete cormac ryan the terrific crossover the pullup for two notre dame is led by as many as six carolinas gotten its offense going here in the last three or four minutes although they come up empty on that trip ryan will walk it out long rebound he hustles after it you know one of the things that i am really enjoying in watching this game and being a part of this game both these teams are playing tremendously hard and you consider both teams coming in 02 in the acc right now trying to find their identity especially on the defensive end of the floor they know how important this game is you know doug it was roy williams who really told me the difference in todays game in comparison to the college basketball game that i played in and that difference is scouting and the fact that teams opposing teams know everything that the opponents are going to do but neither of these teams had a tremendous amount of time to scout we told you this game came together 48 hours ago and they immediately went from who they were supposed to play to a new scouting report so it hasnt been a lot of scouting in this one but yet they have come out with the same level of intensity and playing hard trying to get a win off the back tap prentice hup turns it into two for the fighting irish and weve got a 30second timeout well take a break and be right back here in chapel hill hi linda looks like youve got a prescription to film any idea how much thats going to cost in there the exact same drug thats ten dollars at this pharmacy is a hundred and fifty dollars at this one goodrx finds prices and discount coupons on every prescription just input the drug name and instantly find savings at virtually every pharmacy in america next what can i do for you heres my prescription and i have a coupon from goodrx nice price stop paying too much for your prescriptions with good rx when the acc schedule first came out mike brays notre dame fighting irish were expecting to be in pittsburgh today while north carolina was going to be hosting syracuse today instead because of covid pauses this is the matchup put together on 48 hours notice and weve got a good one notre dame leading by a point final possession of the half for the tar heels three seconds two brooks beats the buzzer but cant get the shot and its the fighting irish who head to the locker room led by nate liszeski with a one point lead over the tar heels the fighting irish hitting a lot of shots as expected early and 80 run brought the tar heels back we have reached the intermission at the dean dome with the irish on top by one for 175 years new york life has been helping people act on their life with corey alexander im doug sherman set for the start of the second half with notre dame holding on to a one point lead we had nine lead changes in that first half corey for notre dame when it was successful it was making shots from the perimeter well they made six three pointers in the first half and it was cormac ryan who got it started off for the fighting hours nick lejovo got involved in the threepoint shooting battle dane goodwin who you would expect knocked down a couple of threes and of course nate liszeski added a couple of threes in the mix as well but north carolina is simply about put it up on the glass and go get it offensive rebounding has been a strength of theirs and they have been able to use that to the tune of eight second chance points in this game thus far but right now only shooting 313 percent from the field carolina has out rebounded notre dame no surprise 2214 tar heels have only taken two free throws made them both turnovers have settled down we were a little sloppy off the start cory what do you see here in the second half well honestly when you look at it im thinking that notre dame will do a better job of trying to get nate liszeski moving in space to get him opportunities in north carolina i think theyre going to do more of the same throw the basketball inside allow their big guys to be able to try to take over this game scoring twos because right now they have not gotten the production from their freshman backcourt rj davis and caleb love combined zero points one assist one turnover dave is in the starting lineup for the second half sharp will have a chance for three and i i was taking notice there corey that roy williams has decided to use the same starting five for the second half as he did the first half actually i believe caleb love started this game and rj davis came off the bench so hes gone with davis to start the game with love on the bench but as you mentioned hes not playing those two guys together as much right now and so really one of those guys on the court at all times and hes going with davis to start the second half you are correct with that as usual corey well are you not going to mention the fact that i was correct about the fact that he got a shot on the first possession and then north carolina throws the ball in the paint on the first possession are you i mean you asked me and now youre not going to recognize i got that one right i dont get a lot of them right dougie fresh i dont know i dont know what youre talking about two straight possessions for sharp on the interior doesnt finish on that one but you see right now its a focus of north carolina get the ball inside theyre going to have an advantage over most teams when it comes to their interior and so instead of trying to shoot threes and battle notre dame from the exterior theyre going to wait a minute he did take it off the board no too good of a shooter to do that were not happy the score is actually tied 3232 that three does not count no mike rays not gonna take it off the board his team back in front hey ron sharp misses on the jump hook another offensive rebound pekot lost it able to get it back out to leaky black and the tar heels can reset but decod and sharp are working when you think about these two guys are getting the job done on the interior gaining extra possessions for north carolina another offensive rebound possibility baker unable to come away with that but they go after it every time and this is the reason why roy williams really has to have four quality condition big men because they play so hard that these guys are going to need a break in a couple of minutes and heres the big man for notre dame juwon durham who scored 19 in wednesdays loss to virginia hes got just four points in this one cory how does he need to get going well one he needs to stop trying to thread the needle in those passes he would have been much better served to allow dane goodman to finish his cut and then try to go to work scoring the basketball theres a reason why hes a center because he is not a passer not a playmaker go score juwan durham in comparison trying to make plays for your teammates garrison brooks off the bench quickly here in the second half the senior captain for the tar heels they dont name official captains usually until the end of the season but clearly he and andrew playtech would be the cocaptains tar heels inside now tie the score 35 a piece and he got a standing ovation rj davis knocking down the three gets a standing ovation from the bench especially roy williams and steve robinson both those guys up and cheering on the freshman point guard knocking down the three and rj davis is a very very good shooter right now he is trying to figure things out as far as what he needs to do to be a great point guard but when it comes to shooting and scoring to basketball hes exceptional and he will end up showing during his north carolina career rebecca ryan holds his pivot foot finds lewchesky the trail man and he drains the three thats the nate lecesca i know we dont go glass from the top of the key shooting the three ball barely touched the rim thats the nate liszeski but his fourth threepointer made in this game four for six from beyond the arc and again when you have a guy that shoots as many threes as leski does leading the acc in field goal percentage thats strong notre dame basketball and corey i got to ask you you wanted leski to give those three points back are you telling me you never banked in a jump shot in your college career at virginia or in the nba and if you did you didnt give those points back well let me ask you let me answer your question with the question do you have video of me doing it cause if not no i never did you mean no you never gave those points back no i never banked one in if you dont have video of me doing it i dont think you should ask nate to do something you wouldnt do yourself corey it was a nonshooting foul Music durham goes out replaced by matt zone of the freshman from rockland county new york he played his high school ball at bergen catholic in new jersey with his heels and right now has to recognize hes got a mismatch he needs to drive walker kepler to the rim to make a play for someone else tarheel just forced the turnover yeah bad spacing for notre dame on that possession but earlier and well well give it to him i mean again the guy shoots us so well we got to take it hes going glass from that angle im not a believer but rj davis i am a believer

winningest coach in the history of college basketball on the right the winningest coach in the history of notre dame basketball roy williams and mike gray in this game that was put together on the schedule in less than 48 hours less than 30 minutes 48 hours ago and weve got a good one the fighting irish with a threepoint lead early here in the second half walker kessler found the bottom of the rim and its notre dame basketball so weve seen in the first five minutes of this second half all four of north carolinas big men getting minutes and getting involved getting their hands on the basketball and thats been a focus for the tar heels coming out in the second half to get the ball inside they dont feel as though notre dame can guard them on the interior and roy williams is trying to exploit that apprentice hub around the rim out and then back in apprentice hub back to having a characteristic game for him not only knocking down a three but attacking the basket in this game but thats a defensive lapse you cannot go under the screen on walton he has shown that he is a knock down shooter he cannot have easy opportunities like that if youre a noted aim defensive he is now three of five tonight and 11 of 21 on the season here comes the streaking rj davis with hesitation driving on hub who knocked it out of bounds carolina will keep tonight at eight eastern were having another watch party right here on accn with number five texas a m and number 13 north carolina square off in the capital one orange bowl chris mark coach rick eric and some special tar heel guests were told well be joining you providing analysis and reactions throughout the game coach rick of course has been known to have a little bit of fun during these games and uh for all the north carolina tar heel basketball fans who will be tuning in to uh the football game tonight eight oclock eastern on espn weve got the watch party as well right here on accn ill be rooting for the heels tonight tough day for the league yesterday ill tell you what notre dame and crimson both taking it on the chin so we need our heels to come up with a win tonight especially considering theyre playing against jimbo fisher yeah scoring points shouldnt be a problem tonight for the tar heels but can they keep the aggies from outscoring it Applause durham gets the double team bring it back out hub from the short corner for two Music brooks from the foul line comfortable shot for the senior and garrison brooks is the perfect player to have in the middle of that zone because he can make that 15footer with ease but also is a very good passer to be able to play highlow basketball with whichever big whether sharp maycott or kessler in the game with him Applause the faceup jump shot rattles home for juwan durham now i did not know durham had that and he has been a much better offensive player this season but i wasnt aware of his face up game and ability to shoot it off to 17 was that a fluke or is that something he can do on a regular basis doug i dont know about fluke but hes not going to do it on a regular basis hes only taken one threepoint shot so far this year missed that one and youre right we dont see him take 17 18 footers very much good looking stroke but that one didnt fall for kerwin walton notre dame by four with the basketball attacking and i think were going to get a goaltend on sharp count the basket for the irish you like prentice hub attacking the basket trying to beat carolina down before they can get their defense set and he gets that on the glass great call by our officiating crew once it touches the glass above the square sorry above the rim you cannot go touch that basketball sharp showing off his athleticism though caleb love and andrew playtech have come into the backcourt for carolina this is love latex darren stands his ground and gets called for the foul Applause you have to love deron sharps activity he is a live body around the rim attacking the glass roy williams raves about him as a rebounder but you see with the basketball in his hands he can do things as well hes missed a couple easy ones to jump hooks earlier in this game but thats something that as a 19 year old hes only going to get better at but you cannot teach the effort and the energy that he plays with youre born with that and youve got to appreciate deyron sharp bringing it every time out yeah ca i dont know if i should admit this on national television i have a basketball crush on deyron sharp i love watching him play he could be on my team any day i agree hes one of those guys to where as a teammate you want to have to have him on your squad but as an opponent you dont want to play against that guy because he pushes you he never slows down foul called against

right from the start here today corey hes knocked down four threes already in this game and has eight rebounds to go along with his 14 points so when you think about nate liszeski he has had he has had success against the tar heels but one of the reasons for that is north carolina is one of the teams that traditionally plays two bigs oftentimes those big men are not used to guarding what is nate leschatz is a classic stretch for and lesheskys ability to shoot the three keeps north carolinas biggs out of the paint and he makes it such a dangerous option for notre dame simply because he shoots it so well but now with his ability to put the ball on the floor and make plays for a teammate he becomes even more dangerous back out to hub with seven to shoot folks out of bounds by sharp notre dame will keep it with five on the shot clock goodwin logs it in going to work on brooks a lot of contact no call north carolina basketball great job by sharp staying vertical on that possession and the contact did force mashevsky to lose the basketball but its a legal play sharp at the other end hes always able to absorb contact well i mean again you know hes having a great day i mean hes not shooting the best from the field four for ten but other than that you called him your man crush so therefore no no no i didnt say man crush i specifically didnt say band crush i thought i could sneak that one in no no no basketball crush theres my guy but right now hes roy williams basketball crush backtoback possessions throwing the basketball inside the dayrun sharp hes able to finish i thought i could sneak that one by you doug you were quick though you were quick ill give it to you you were on it i didnt think you listened to me that much to where you would have figured that one out what was that well i tell you whos not listening north carolina defensively in the scouting report i understand that you want a hedge but you cant hedge too far you got to stay close and stay attached to

of copper fit doug shermans basketball crush dave sharp has found his way around the rim over the last couple possessions and the thing that is most impressive about this dog hes not just going against an average joe hes playing against one of the best shot blockers in college basketball in juwan durham and right now davron sharp getting his body into durham is finding success around the rim and continues to impress 14 points for sharp in this one thus far and he doesnt look like hes slowing down anytime soon and then they go to number 11 again over the left shoulder left it short tips it up keeps it alive to himself huff johnson no sharp again no tar heels just playing volleyball with themselves and finally we get the whistle and again just going after it sharp bakehot garrison brooks kessler it doesnt matter the bigs for north carolina get involved in action they never concede that the basketball is going in and they keep fighting for it on every possession north carolina rebounds 40 percent of their misses you got to think about that as a lot and this team is not a very good shooting team so there are a lot more misses to go around and they are going to get them when you look at north carolina 12 offensive boards in this game and we still have 10 minutes remaining 15 points to lead all scores now for sharp and corey i know you know the answer to this question but im going to ask you anyhow what do florida state scotty barnes oklahoma states kate cunningham arkansas moses moody and carolinas deron sharp have in common they all told me no they were not coming to oak hill thats what they all have in common i recruited all four of those guys and they said yes to kevin boyle down at montberg what a dynamo last year absolutely if not the best high school team ever one of the best high school teams ever and you know and again and thats hard for me to say i mean much respect for kevin boyle my god ray miller who does a great job recruiting for my bird its hard for me to say that as a rival but what those guys were able to do a year ago not only by going undefeated and playing as well as they did but by having all of those personalities to mesh together and play to win the way that they did was impressive but when you look at a guy like davon sharp whos not going out trying to do things that he doesnt do well and is sticking to what he does do well which is played with energy offensive rebound and dominate you physically in the paint its easy to do that and you look at scottie barnes of course who is the consummate team player you know kate cunningham who is my favorite college player right now even though hes not in the acc and when you look at those guys i mean theres no reason no coincidence that they were able to have that type of success under nine minutes remaining ten to shoot caleb love feeds the post shark no one and done this time for the tar heels and sharp is getting great look theres been a number of great looks he has not finished you can see he still has a tremendous amount of development you know around the basket as far as his scoring is concerned Applause but here they come again leshesky just keeps knocking down shots in the lead once again for notre dame is six and that was called a kick ball im not sure if that was actually a kick it seems as though jogo i believe it was jogo defending that play did a great job of getting his hand im sorry that was ryan guarding that possession he did a great job of getting his hand on the basketball im not sure his foot ever hit that that stat was showing there the sixth first half turnovers really four or five of them came in the first four minutes so the tar heels really have tightened it up they get two back there to make it a fourpoint ball game okay the love was his first basket on the game and you know doug i talked about the first game that i did for north carolina this season in the maui invitational and talked about how i felt like caleb love would be back next year and i got a lot of backlash on that because he was ranked so high on the mod drafts going into the season and again i love caleb love big fan of his but i believe that he can use a couple years in college to develop into a really good point guard and then venture into the nba i dont think hes ready for him right now speaking of red he need lessens he might be ready because what hes doing in college as a junior is spectacular shooting the basketball which is a skill that the nba truly appreciates 25 points for leshesky tonight coming off of a high 28 versus virginia on wednesday love teased it up and hes got it and the second bucket for caleb love is hes picked up his offensive production and right now this is where love needs to lock in defensively picking up full court this is where he can really help this team with his size he can be a lockdown defender and as he does that i believe he can solidify himself as the point guard for north carolina and that leader that roy williams needs on the floor goodwin no leski had it trickle off his fingertips out of bounds Music im not sure if everyone can pronounce it but they will know nate liszeski becoming a household name three after three for 175 years new york life has been helping people act on their love okay so they can look back and say we did good when we started our business were paying like an arm and a leg

corey alexander since you are clearly the fashion expert at the acc network im going to let you talk fashion here for the next little bit about these two coaches what theyre bringing to the table here tonight well lets talk about my man roy williams rocking the low jordan tubes okay in carolina colors i actually have those but those were released about 20 years ago so mine are crushed right now im gonna need coach williams somebody send me a new pair cause those are fire and when you think about that that has to be a recruiting tool when you think about north carolina gets the best james and not only just the twos steve robson has on some of the toughest ones that ive seen the low ones ive never seen those thats that is exclusive only to north carolina has to be a recruiting tool and speaking of recruiting tool who would not want to play for a coach that wears shorts in the middle of winter how laid back does mike gray have to be to rock his shorts on the sidelines in the middle of winter yeah he has been ahead of the curve on fashion for years going with the mock turtleneck and going casual before it was more commonly accepted but going with shorts on january 2nd i dont think its ever been done before well mike bray became popular i mean he was always popular but it was big but he wore shorts at the maui invitational when his team won it a few years back when you think about it the maui invitational was in asheville north carolina this year maybe he was having hes entering his inner maui is coming out thinking about that and so he wears the shorts into the state of north carolina trying to come up with a win like they did in the maui classic back with bonzi coulson inquiring minds want to know you didnt think i was going to take it there but i did well i knew you were going to take it to how can you get yourself a new pair of nikes oh i need nothing i dont need a new pair i need a pair of ones theres steve robinson hazard i need a pair of the twos that coach williams has on and they got i saw them wearing the jubilee 11s the other day i need all that irish with the basketball under six minutes remaining four point lead five to shoot goodwins pass take it away here come the tar heels and there goes once again deron sharp for two more and you know one thing that weve seen davron sharp has probably played the last six to eight minutes consecutively you dont normally see that from these bigs with north carolina but right now thats who roy williams trusts most hes rotating baycod garrison brooks and kessler but deron sharp has been a mainstay on the court here in this second half and hes on the verge of becoming the first tar heel this season to reach the 20point plateau and there it is on the put back give him 21 and more importantly carolina draws even how will the irish respond skip past goodwin wide open three well short and he cant find the reign but notre dame has gotten the looks they just havent been able to knock them down here as of late but you have to think about how much energy theyre having to put in defensively especially on the defensive glass to try to keep north carolina from getting more and more opportunities on their offensive board on third effort no sharp will try again he cant score but hes fouled and well head back to the freethrow line im not certain as is i know its the system because roy williams has always taught this ever since hes been at north carolina theyve always been great rebounding teams but its also the talent youre talking about two mcdonalds allamerican bigs they caught a sophomore deron sharper freshman but two mcdonalds allamericans just flat out physically beating notre dame up on the interior nate liszeski is winning the battle on the perimeter but on inside is sharp and bacon getting the job done sharp now with 16 this half well weve got acc womens hoops better than ever coming up on sunday beginning noon eastern clemson in miami followed by boston college nc state and then the nightcap georgia tech at notre dame also streaming live on the espn app there goes the games leading scorer deron sharp out of the ball game career high for deyron in this game north carolina with a twopoint lead and theyve needed all the contribution from him but doug another when we talk about how much hes played one of the things hes been able to do is stay out of foul trouble thats one of the things thats hindered him throughout this season and juwan durham is now able to try to take the lead back for notre dame after finishing through the contact an opportunity at the freethrow line for the andone and that layup snapped a 90 carolina run and so the grad student from tampa florida juwan durham one of four captains this year for mike bray at the line to try and retake the lead Music rj davis at the point freshman out of archbishop stepanak high school just north of new york city gets it back from leaky black and right now the zone once again from notre dame but the difficulty of playing a zone especially gets in north carolina you do not have a box out responsibility which makes it difficult to keep the tar heels off the glass you see another offensive rebound for north carolina but davis ends up turning it over to the dismay of roy williams who was taking it out on the scorers table i saw at least four smacks of his open hand on that scores table off the court roy is about as easy going as they come on the court he is intense time out here in chapel hill davron sharp getting out in transition showing off his skill the big fella skill with the basketball and it has been his show here today bow time nope youre not seeing double bojangles is warming things up with thick hearty steak biscuits all day long and seeing that

shave in the morning get yourself right wound up and ready to go corey alexander weve been treated to a pretty good oneonone showdown our impact players nate leschewski and dayron sharp have really brought it here in chapel hill it really happened theyve done it in different fashions nate liszewski who leads the acc and field goal percentage getting most of his damage done from beyond the arc davron sharp getting it done in the painted area both these guys big time players and finding a way to help their team win big drive by prentiss hub finishing with the right hand to put notre dame back on top rj davis no leaky black on the offensive rebound that is the 20th offensive rebound for unc and that is you know that thats the system thats the culture of north carolina but you got to give sharp and bacon especially a lot of credit and its not just those two guys leaky black has two offensive rebounds on this possession alone so they know to go after the basketball and when youre numbing lets be honest with you youre not a good shooting team you know youve got to go back and get it this time it pays off once again for walton knocking down the three now four of eight from the field all long distance give him 12 points and the tar heels back in front under two minutes to go in regulation shovel pass to the cutter layup is good by jogo oh ive got to apologize to jawan durham i told him stop passing the ball and then he drops a dime i have to admit when im wrong great play by durham recognizing joe go cutting to the basket and the nice cut the beautiful find from durham and the easy finish for jogo and thats a problem for roy williams it cant be that simple with two minutes remaining in a game youre up one at this point you have to be able to lock in and get it stopped that was leaky black who got back cut on that possession he needs for leaky black to be a better defender hes talked about that a lot this season needs him to be one of those lockdown defenders getting beat like that is too easy tonight at eastern were having another watch party right here on accn when number five texas a m at number 13 north carolina square off in the capital one orange bowl chris mark coach eric and some special tar heel guests will be joining you providing analysis and reaction throughout the game thats eight eastern right here on acc network with corey alexander im doug sherman this game at the dean dome 48 hours ago was not on the schedule each of these two teams were slated to play different opponents the games fell apart because of covid reasons and so coach williams and coach bray got together and in 30 minutes two days ago on new years eve put this thing together and corey im sure glad they did i am too and again a very good game weve had a great matchup between these two teams exciting coming down the line to see who finishes this off but one of the most important things that you heard both coaches talk about was the word fair coach bray said it doesnt have to be fair and roy williams said he didnt feel like that either team had an advantage or disadvantage of playing this game sharp the dunk hes got 25 speaking of advantage deron sharp has an advantage over pretty much anyone he plays against on the block right now we talked about hes going against one of the leading shot blockers in noting history in durham and durham is almost not even there on this possession shark physically just gets great position im sorry that was lazzewski durham came in to try to block but when you have two bigs on the floor as carolina does youve got to pay attention to garrison brooks at their free throw line and durham going down trying to help out leski who is at a disadvantage on that block first shot the yukon transfer durham misses the first and get another chance to try and retie the ball game cant get the roll and its carolina basketball Applause Applause tries to take the handoff instead sharp keeps it under a minute now remaining Applause tough shot contact theres a blocked shot by durham play on great play by juwan durham we talked about his shot blocking prowess coming over getting a big block on that possession coast to coast fred is up with the layup 6564 notre dame love princess hub attacking the basket not settling for the jump shot on that possession timeout north carolina and mike graves talked about his team sticking their nose in defensively well deron sharp has been able to dominate in the post however is juwan durham coming over and making a huge play blocking the shot getting princess hub out in transition whos able to go high off the glass over the outstretched arm of deron sharp coming over for the block Music and so now for north carolina in that huddle coach williams im assuming hes going to try and go inside to deron sharp well i believe thats the case and right now garrison brooks on the floor spaces things a bit at the freethrow line so you cant leave him especially if youre playing the zone right in that middle but notre dame has been mantoman his last few possessions i wouldnt be shocked if mike bray came out this possession in a zone defense and switched things up a bit not to give north carolina the same look brooks takes the inbound hands it off to davis five seconds between shot clock and game clock now 10 seconds to shoot final 15 seconds of regulation leaky black for the lead he fakes it home nine seconds to go and you like the play about leaky block once again not settling but recognizing that he was going to the rim and no longer was juwan durham able to get down and contest that shot so he goes right to the chest of the chesky if durham does go over to try to contest that shot and he misses thats an easy cleanup of davron sharp but you like the aggressiveness by leaky black attacking the rim now where north carolina has struggled this year is getting a stop theyve got 91 seconds to see if they can come up with a stop finish the possession with the defensive rebound to win the game notre dame im sure looking to try to get the basketball in the hands of leski to be able to take the last shot but im sure mike bray is comfortable with whether or not his apprentice hub is dane goodwin or sliciesky taking the final shot to try to get his team a win leskis got a teamhigh 25 points apprentice hub has 14 points durhams had a good second half hes up to eight points meanwhile north carolina is led by a career high from the freshman day ron sharp and then the go ahead bucket by rayshawn malik black leaky black to make it 6665 with 91 seconds remaining in regulation if im not mistaken i believe he black did the same thing against stanford in the maui invitational earlier he had the winning bucket against him or at least the goahead bucket so leaky black although he hasnt had a great offensive game coming up big for carolina in clutch moments and right now you see who roy williams trusts most defensively at the end of the game getting andrew playtech back on the floor who started two games go against georgia tech because of his defensive problems Applause playtech comes in to double team cormac ryan to try and keep the ball out of his hands when the trigger man can run the baseline for notre dame they get it to ryan into the front court into the paint finds durham his shot no good ball kicks around out of bounds and the tar heels survive 6665 we saw juwan durham knock down the 17footer earlier in the game he has the ability to make that shot but im not sure hes the guy that you want the basketball in his hands taking the final shot of the game to try to get you a win it was the right play for notre dame however thats one where you would love to have nate leshesky who has a game
