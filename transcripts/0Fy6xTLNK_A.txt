to Garner respect they need those wins yeah this is a huge game and opportunity again for both of these teams but I think for the ACC some of the eight early numbers theyre going to have to have a good sewing top its Colin Murray boils thats a terrific pass by Jamari Thomas he was a huge portal pickup for Lamont Harris the BC starting five with Kelly Brown hand strong and venning up front Chad venning in the St Bonet are transfer so this big getting involved early yeah early on both teams trying to get the ball in the paint good execution and patience that time by Boston College Thomas was the Mak Player of the Year at North Folk State last year muray Bo is a cerebral player and he takes it Chaz Kelly BC back court thinning ranks for BC after they lost nearly 88 of their point production off of last years nit squad benting has the first four points of the game well he was a huge pickup though to St benter transfer again you talked about it some of the losses for Boston College Quinton post one of the better bigs to play at Boston College playing in the NBA venning though is a true back to the basket big again right here you can see the ball Movement by Boston College getting it into paint for Benning again nice little reverse pivot nice soft touch that time board to big fella yeah Vs a tough match up for anybody its 69 270 lbs South Carolina scouting report for Lamont Paris the reigning SEC Coach of the Year 80 points per game and four wins this year and good production they spread it around well Malcolm and you know its one of those teams still trying to find an identity well be saying that a lot tonight yeah both these coaches when we talk to them uh they talked about trying to find uh and figure out obviously the rotations but then obviously with some new faces and guys in different roles that they played last year theyre still TR that trying to figure it out mode hand the take to Kelly deep three and Bo has the rebound Kelly has to develop a better outside shot that was a good contest though that time South Carolina will look to hit the three as as well they were 11 for 32 from distance against Virginia Tech and their 10point win and LaMont Paris told us they had many open looks its funny how Paris said you know what there were 27 threes that I probably could have made and thats a key thing though theyve had good looks hes been pleased with the ball movement just unable to convert and Boston College though continues to feed Benning and he has delivered thats six straight buckets for Chad Benning the same bovit a transfer Murray Bo from distance hes got Applause it impressive shot by Colin Murray boils 17 for 24 from the field in his last three games thats his third three in his last four so not known to hit the threepoint shot and a foul our referees are Bert Smith AJ Desai and Kip Kissinger BC scouting are support for Earl Grant in his fourth year yeah theyre off to a terrific start also getting the line fifth in the ACC but not much respect in the preseason poll yeah but again both these teams you look at what South Carolina did last year they were picked uh dead last and they went on and made an NCAA tournament run so again preseason means nothing you have a chance to P prove folks wrong South Carolina dream run that was their longest run in the tournament since Frank Martins 2017 final four Squad Martin now the coach at umask Donald Han the fade away and Jamari Thomas secures Music it push against Dion Brown and he draws contact for brown the Maryland Baltimore County transfer and we see expected a lot out of him and this right here nice move by Thomas using his frame again it goes about 510 uh but he has got strong lower body that time a nice use getting to the free throw line and thats going to be key we talked to Earl Grant about that keeping Thomas out of the paint you talked about it the northfalk state transfer M player of the year and he means so much to this offense thats going to be a key theme we watch for Boston College can they keep him out of the Music paint yeah and hes definitely a St on the defensive end with 14 steals per game so he can pretty much do it all as he hits one out of two at the line and Fred Payne is inserted into the BC lineup number five in white hes been an influencer off their bench providing a dose of offense Elijah strong much improved offensive player but called for an offensive Applause foul questionable or no yeah this is his great job of sliding your feet right here again yeah hes there again thats a textbook theyre playing gaps thats what South Carolina wants to do and when we spoke with Earl Grant he said look we have to get a couple of ball reversals and we need to be patient offensively the South Carolina does a good job trying to keep you out of the paint and a terrific block on the weak side here come the Eagles good opportunity for South Carolina Applause venning the drive by by Applause hand Kelly for three and out of bounds that will bring us to our first media timeout BC with some sturdy defense in the post well early on weve seen shout out to uh Vicky V one of the Warriors in terms of raising money and awareness for cancer and I think the key thing is 100 of the proceeds money raise goes to cancer research Mari Bo trying to back in on venning who has all six Eagle points Jamari Thomas the look loose ball on the Baseline off of South Carolina its off of sty mil sty the Vander transfer and he can be lethal from three when he hits threepointers consistently they usually win yeah and he again thats going to be a key for Boston College in The Scouting Report they must find him and back to that previous three by thas skin but coach pis talked about that theyve had some good looks just unable to get the ball of droping and right here like a legal screen moving screen called on Chaz Kelly first on Kelly and the third on the team so both teams are feeling out Cress in the first four and a half minutes this pain eyes Thomas Eagles have been majority manto man in the earlyer going Davis for study and grabs the rebound well another pretty clean look you have to be pleased if youre coach Baris again thats a pretty a good look coming off ball movement and again just a missed opportunity vening aggressive just in front of the elbow and the active Larry Bo who plays the angles thats the thing that Lamont Paris told us he has natural ability but his instincts are off the charts textbook pick and then hit the roller oh that is beautiful basketball the help side was late by Boston College and my goodness fantastic thats why hes on the radar of many NBA teams screen and then roll and I think thats a under talked about thing right here oh my goodness colid Murray boils almost rips off the rim and again if youre Boston College you take a look at uh this young man leads the SEC hes so efficient uh you look at last year numbers First Team all freshman team and hes a guy again that is going to play for a very lik paycheck when he leaves so versatile can do so much and that right there though is what he is doing well he just goes and grabs the ball on the defensive and offensive glass first foul moments going Jamari Thomas study the Deep three and venning wins the rebound venning has been equally as impressive in the paint rebounding and then also establishing himself uh in the post offensively thats his third rebound three of the seven for BC Joshua Beetle Farland celti Louisiana transfer can hit and its out of bounds Chad venning has been sort of on both ends of the floor but the big number there is the 16 blocks Malcolm if you can give him that BCs in good step yeah again that was a question coming in how did replace Quinton post an all ACC type player for Boston College drafted last year and Chad venning has been the answer again uh he has been impressive for Boston College I think the big thing is hes different from how post played he was more a pick and pop venning is a true traditional big that gives him that press that presence in the post offensively South Carolina likes to go side to side theyll overload the floor on one side and then hit the other side for an open jumper ugas Su Off the Mark hes a good scorer off their bench he had four threes against Virginia Tech sty maneuvering in the paint but a foul its on Dion Brown and right here again Brown and it looks like o okay again now they got brown on that one Boston College bench and Earl Grant not happy with that call second on Brown easy path to the basket they had a breakdown on defense chobe right the beneficiary yeah thats just too easy nobody he was almost shocked that he was so open for that layup again great screening uh by South Carolina its a deliberate offense for the Gamecock as venning takes it again and boy is off to a fantastic start thats his eighth point and the previous uh two possessions South Carolina double that time they decide to stay home with Butler and again they may have to change that strategy again go double or at least dig offer some help when venning gets the ball into post Davis lefthanded bump but venning dominating the BC offense and theyre doing a great job again spacing if they dont come help thats a beautiful spin move of that time by venning again just felt the defender on him and then spun to the Baseline thats a quick moveis Davis at the line after the second foul on Elijah strong you look at ven in his career at St bonavent he was second Team all Atlantic 10 last year he scored over 1100 points in his career so his offense may be quiet but he still has it in his game as he goes to the bench for Earl Grant well this young man at the free throw line for South Carolina has been huge he was great Off the Bench in their win against Virginia Tech 12 points seven rebounds in 27 minutes and again excellent Defender as well too very versatile and and thats something coach Paris talked about he has gotten great bench production Zachary Davis also had eight against Mercer and theyll win November Applause 21st beetle with eight to shoot up a curl its McFarland Jaden Hastings they have right hopes for but he tops it up South Carolina doing an excellent job of being disruptive with Boston Colleges offense theyre playing in the gaps and then theyre not allowing Cutters and theyre doing a good job on any ball screens or pin Downs two strong with the three is Butler transfer from Missouri Beal directing Music traffic McFarland fade away and Hastings wins the 5050 and he tucks it Applause home thats a big time offensive rebound and put back and speaking with the staff hes made plays like that and hes benefited uh from going up against venning every day uh but ugas answers that one was deep he can do that ugas another one of those double digit scorers off of Lamont pariss bench so South Carolina with a fourpoint lead but Mari Bo knock H can be love this one then on the other end Jaden Hastings says yeah I could do that too did South Carolina with its largest lead of the game how have they made it happen well a couple of things again theyve set screens I know its under talk about things uh in basketball games but they have set some very good screens to free up guys for either open jumpers or screens and then rolls Boston College has got to do a better job with their helps side defense then on the other side Boston College its really been all Chad venning hes on the bench right now getting a rest but theyve done a nice job feeding him in post o gr o Grant told us it wasnt so much about South Carolina it was about BC the thing that he was concerned about as Elijah strong hits it triple and he doesnt know how this team deals with adversity yet theyre dealing with it in the aftermath of a Dartmouth loss yeah again a a game where dartman made 17 threes and and a little bit of a let down uh in that game after coming off the Cayman Islands Classics win the second annual SEC ACC basketball challenge continues tonight tomorrow and Thursday night mens and womens lineup right here on acc Network some terrific game going on right now Miami over Arkansas by three and Georgia with a sevenpoint lead over Notre Dame tringle at the line the Alabama transfer with a one and one last year it was a 77 tie and we talked a little bit about the implications of this in particular for the ACC uh the importance of this challenge again theres always been this narrative out there who has the best conference ACC with a a big opportunity to try to prove some of the narrative thats out there wrong need nine wins to clinch the SEC ACC mens Applause challenge important few nights of basketball for both conferences a month in for a long season Beetle The Hop skiping a jump but the rebound engulfed by Murray Bo but if youre Earl Grant again you like that thats too possessions now your guards have been able to get into the paint good ball movement as right hits the three the man who passed it to him was cam Scott who was a twotime South Carolina state Player of the Year scored over 2400 High School points yeah they are so high on them and thats a great read get rid of the ball make that reversal thats something coach Paris talked about we have to flip the court get the ball moving left to right excellent offense that time in the half court by South Carolina Jobe right averaging 12 points thats his fourth triple in the last four games here comes Mari Bo with a steal good defense in the post by strong to frustrate him Beetle behind the back three by strong bit over zealous but Tracked Down by Kelly well wonder the think South Carolina is doing a good job of is theyre not allowing many ball reversals for Boston colle or paint touches again vending on the C coming back into this game but thats what theyve done they played gaps and then theyve tried to confuse and keep Boston Collin out of the paint on the other end right here this is this great ball movement again ball went left to right you cant ask for better half court execution end result a wide open three and the fifth turnover on the other end for BC South Carolina averaging 12 turnovers per game BC at 12 TOS per game but thats an ugly number in the first 12 minutes for the Eagles a lot of that credit again to South Carolina Thomas Bos front strong double team by McFarland threw it into no mans land and thats the game Co turnover what happened on that play thats a beautiful uh double that time by mcar and again you talked about it when you double you need to double hard and come High hands high try to make that uh postentry pass or the post pass going out of the post harder that time Boston College executed excellent again right here balls going in they know theyre doubling Now watch how he comes with his hands high again make that pass a little bit higher good ball pressure end result turnover hey take him to work Benning going to work back in the ball game tringle on the fade away Bo he is confident thats a tough shot theyre going to have to double again they started off the game playing him straight up but this is just kind of a old school move right here take my time Im going to back you down get to my spot spin off and one uh early on Chad Benning uh has really been Unstoppable uh hes been able to get to his spots that time the little Fade Away jumper other times uh hes uh come off some actions and caught the ball two feet in the paint again right now that has been the best part of Boston Colleges offense second foul on fingalo he does not complete the threepoint play I think also impressively he works hard he was in the gym after the Dartmouth game Jaden Hastings and it was a venting school like setting he said hey Jaden heres what you have to do as a big man theyre in the game in the gym an hour and a half after that game as Pringle converts and hell have an N1 opportunity so Nick Pringle well done venting voices contention but we will take a timeout South Carolina up by six some instructions for McFarland but South Carolinas largest lead at six theyre moving the ball well arent they they really are theyre shooting a high clip uh from the floor but I think on the other end for Boston College theyre really contesting pressuring the ball for Boston College right now Boston College 105 from the threepoint line 20 Chad Benning though has been the bright spot for Boston College so Pringle completes the threepoint play Here Comes the Eagles across the timeline with Chaz Kelly Ronald Han and McFarland in the back court with him with venning and strong up front made away Off the Mark and out of bounds off of Applause pringle ugak checking back in for Lamont Paris and theres Earl Grant always Natalie attired well hes done an excellent job last season nit for Boston College trying to build off of that Music Applause good drive by Kelly and somehow got it to go and theyre going to need more of that right now again South Carolina not much allowing much ball reversal so theyre going to either have to get guys in high ball screens or guys are going to have to make individual plays like that now by Chaz Kelly first tour of the night for Kelly hes from Houston Ari Bo Jamari Thomas three off the Applause line good ball handing by Kelly with the fade away Pringle industrious off the Applause glass Thomas A C open for him didnt it yeah thats just poor transition D that time by Boston College guys were again you need to slide get over Earl Grant talked about that this afternoon with us at shoot around uh there needs to be a wall right there uh he needs to see bodies when he gets into the paint Thomas has three venning good track down by McFarland strong I just strong not shy on the offensive end yeah but thats a pretty good look again great hustle to come up with that loose ball but South Carolina continues to execute offensively again Ive been impressed with their spacing a ball movement and player movement also high low terrific pass by Pringle toari Bo and we have a timeout we will take a 30 second timeout largest lead for the Gamecock at nine in chestet Hill Music Music so South Carolina in command ninepoint lead with 544 L but great ball movement as well malol yeah right here cleaning up uh the defensive glass and then this right here again for Boston College a little rub screen but that cannot happen there needs to be better transition D for Boston College ear Grand not happy with that right there and early on right now credit South Carolina again their defense really with the exception of uh vening for Boston College theyve done a good job being disrupted Lamont Paris building an identity in his third year nine games over 500 and we were so impressed with his attitude his Outlook uh the way he can hold this team from a culture standpoint very optimistic about everything yeah absolutely again last year of the Run they went on pick not to do much in the SEC and all Z does is go on to be coach of the year in the SEC get to the NCAA tournament Id say plan ahead of schedule if youre a South Carolina fan three by Kelly beating the shot clock good position by Thomas who has the rebound Gamecocks shooting 47 but its travel and that and thats all set up though Chaz Kelly doing a great job denying that little dri dribble handoff again giving South Carolina a little dose of what theyve done to Boston College again trying to be disruptive with their offensive flow Eagles one for seven on threepointers graphic a moment ago tells the story seven assists on nine field goals for South Carolina Roger McFarland he was prolific at times at Southeast Louisiana too strong with the Play In Here Comes Murray Applause Bo Thomas UGA suck Baseline take oh man is he get off the glass Murray Bos just going to work as he picks up the foul and thats why we talked to Lamont Paris about his NBA draft prospects he is a lottery pick he says you know what its worth going well right here again look at that first step right there quick little up fake and then this is what he does so well a rebound of the ball coach Paris shared a funny story of when he got the job he did not have a offer from South Carolina went and saw him play and immediately fell in love and the rest is a history in terms of what this young man has done Applause SEC all freshman team led his team and rebounding as well too in the rugged secc and he overcame mono last year so it was a tough start for him coming back to his hometown to play after going to wasach Academy in Utah and youre right just flew under the radar and LaMont Paris said you know what come here and we will make you and standing player at least try to and certainly well on his way to that the Eagles regain possession well both these coaches do a great job in the uh Player Development we talked earlier about the job that Earl Grant did with Quinton post post again came here continue to get better each year that he got here and turned into a NBA draft pick so key in this environment now still to focus focus on a Player Development BC has missed its last six field goal attempts ugas suck nice speed to Mar Bo hes feasting on the post and its all set up though the South Carolina spacing theyre just spr spreading the floor out theyre moving the ball guys are cutting and then theyre getting excellent dribble drives uh to really just a create Havoc for the BC defense its a methodical offense but an effective one when its red up last year 351st in possessions per game and only 63 steel Davis in transition and a foul on Joshua Beetle so its been a struggle for be before this half court defense of South Carolina can get set up the Eagles caress with the ball with six turnovers also 10 fouls now on BC with Davis at the line Earl Grant is happy with the depth he has he says he can bring Five Guys in that probably wont miss a beat that happened to them in the Cayman Islands when they won that tournament every game they utilized the bench to their advantage they have but right now though the biggest issue theyre having is trying to break down this South Carolina D it starts right here Thomas ball pressure really has been uh problematic they sped BC up and then also when theyve gotten any Ball reversals but theyve done a nice job closing down gaps Boston College really struggling from the floor Beetle coming off a 19point night against Dartmouth in their loss that was a career high played 65 games at Clemson before going in the portal 31 in black is bosemans Veron hes a great story hes in his third year at Law School in Columbia and he already has a job at one of the most prestigious law firms in the country in Chicago and LaMont Paris says hes a renaissance man well hopefully uh again this young man uh is going to go on and do some great things as you take a look at his continued work right on Q he could not Rave more about what he has meant to this program has done everything right and as you said uh going to go on and do great things when hes done playing basketball yep and had the upper hand in the post for the Eagles in search of a spark Payne with Hastings playing his eighth college game red shirted last year deep three by Fred Payne and here come the Gamecocks Davis sty usually hits those you cant ask for a better look yeah pain transition too strong though sty going down hard Music wow and you heard that reverberate everywhere around the arena and again hope it he is okay that is a hard fall but the defense continues to be a issue or the uh story for South Carolina as hes able to get up and thats a good sign for South Carolina but again right here this is this great transition defense theyre getting down Boston College trying to set uh and push the pace before they can get set theres really nowhere to go BCs missed his last nine shots so Miles study the Vanderbilt transfer at the line 38 on threes last season also doubled figures in 13 games and he came into this season 227 career threes already and thats what he was bought here to do again hes a guy that will stretch the defense proven scorer and shooter foul was reviewed two shots for study so with a minute 40 remaining until halftime e going to dig down deep for them to claw back in this game and offensive production has been minimal well its I think starts with the screening as Earl Grant going to his bench uh but again I think it starts with the screening and then trying to get out in transition its hard to get out in transition when youre not getting stops and then when you do get into your half court Earl Grant talked about this theyre going to have to be more patient uh but uh make no mistake about it the South Carolina defense has been impressive thus far end this first half after the foul on pain in the two makes by study Luca Taves are high on him point guard lived in Tokyo for a while his brother was on the Japanese olympic team hes the cousin of Jonathan Taves the former Chicago Blackhawks star LED them to a Stanley Cup Chad Applause Penning unorthodox shot away from the ball contact South Carolina foul heres Saturday afternoons ACC Network mens basketball triple header BC takes on Wake Forest at noon Eastern number 20 North Carolina host Georgia Tech cap the afternoon with Stanford Cal rivalry game should be three excellent ones right here on accn always jamack with Saturday afternoon basketball foul on miles sty is second try to sort it out at the scorers table with a quick stoppage in play but the defense of South Carolina has been outstanding now it really has and theyve forced Boston College to run their offense really out on the perimeter but theyre making it difficult to for Boston College to even do dribble handoffs any pin Downs theyre doing an excellent job again not allowing Boston College to run their offense yeah consider over the last 6 and2 minutes theyve outscored the Eagles 142 Beetle was going to inbounds now it will be Taves High entry for Elijah strong Beetle runs into a double reverses the floor and off the bounce but before the bucket a foul they wave off the make its on Zachary Davis first on Davis and that might be their best possession probably in the last five minute stretch again nice pass that time excellent ball reversal and then I like what Han did there again you got to be aggressive playing through contact that hand has been consistent but not good good enough against Dart but their best players did not perform well thats why large reason why they lost by Five Points also their defense was pretty much not existent from the threepoint AR yeah that really probably was the uh story of that ball game again right now this is huge for Boston C it seems like theyve been stuck on 17 for a long time and this is their uh first point BC in six plus minutes so again uh Earl Grant looking for anything positive to try to go into the half and theres two for hand gcs leading scorer on the season but not this evening Chad Benning has 10 thats the first two for hand strong has three and Kelly has two and Hastings has two Thats All She Wrote Ari Bo Thomas blocked by venning but out of bounds with seven on the shot clock well thats something that venning has provided a RM protection for Boston College again right here great job sliding his feet and denying what looked like it was going to be an easy two AR Bos good body position and an N1 on Elijah strong the foul Mari Bo hes an angled player by that Alchemy knows exactly where to go on the floor and its all set up the screen again South Carolina has been excellent in screens look at this right here screen no communication though and that right there again needs to be taken over the inbounder probably needs to be more on the ball so that pass is not so easy but South Carolina continues to execute that time out of bounds underneath they build on their largest lead now 17 points Mari Bos in the first half a double double its been a walking double double he is 14 and 10 Applause and and a travel got ansy in the lane and South Carolina collapsed theyre just not allowing any dribble drives again and then their guys are playing their gaps theyre being disciplined and on the screens again theyre just really a being aggressive fighting over any ball screens dribble handoffs or pin Downs shot clock off Thomas waiting guarded by Beetle bosemans for Don reverses for Murray Bo and that will do it South Carolina dominant theyll keep the time on the floor now were back on operative systems all systems go did you press a button Malcolm I dont have those Powers well maybe it plugged it back in as our producer Russ Ken just Jed in whatever you did it was good Chaz Kelly at the elbow is deflected fouls on jacobe right his first so 21 seconds in were back into live action hes Malcolm Huck Im John me Perell thanks for joining us on accn hope youve enjoyed it thus far watch how aggressive South Carolina is going over ball screens and then how aggressive they are attacking of the ball lets see if they double vening is the Fade Away by the big fella weak side rebound strong almost had it pulled away by right Gamecock 4 and three record coming off a 10point win over Virginia Tech they hit 11 of 32 threes good drive by muray Bo what a take head up always and confident on the Baseline and spacing but then thats a matchup they wanted Bo versus venning they just isolated him on the wing let him go to work numbers are plentiful he has 16 points second double double of the Season already venning with the hook Applause shot snaps a string of 11 missed field goal attempts by The Eagles well it just seems like theyre working hard for every bucket and then on this end a South Carolina getting high percentage looks and really with less resistance pass gets away from study and adley lets it roll up bounce again right here again they just ISO the help is not there and then he just has a quick first step thats a tough matchup for venning out on the perimeter and again thats uh what Murray Bo does again for some opposing pigs uh he is going to POS a lot of matchup problems look out strong in the air and he Applause travels eight turnovers for BC they average 12 per game well again thats just really all set up because of South Carolinas defense again looked like they were going to have a easy bucket and South Carolina recovers comes up with a turnover swarming defense by The Eagles flck Jamari Thomas on the drive here comes strong but an offensive foul and this is just frustration right here again theyve done such a good job denying venning is just trying to Barrel his way down the lane and yep right in front of the ref really easy for them to call its three fouls on Chad Applause venning South Carolinas had the lead for more than 16 12 minutes but a steal by Chaz Kelly denying the L Kelly will take the three and Thomas there you love his aggressiveness dont you he really is a good rebounding guard hes been a huge pickup for South Carolina North State transfer and he has manned that point guard position hes defended I think his defense are at the point really has been a disruptive for Boston College and a acrobatic finish that time by Pringle high low post passing that time and he made that reverse look easy that was a tough finish Nifty big man great footwork thats 10 assists on 14 field goals for the game Applause and and sty comes away with it frustration continues to mount for for the Eagles offense theyve missed four out of five to start the second half theyre shooting 28 good pass on the post Thomas but blocked by Kelly and a foul well this right here again textbook balls moving left to right big on big screen and then dump it off the Finish again theyre just getting everything easy at the paint but theyre getting open looks on the other end theyre really again its just as simple as theyre making it difficult theyre giving Boston College nothing easy again it goes back to you got to set better screens try to get out and transition if you can get some stops but youre going to have to be a better executing if youre Boston College in your half court hand nice lefthanded take by Donald hand thats the blow by and hand has that in his arsal yeah and theyre going to need more of that but again South Carolina is going to continue to be patient and run their offense the volume scorer in the second half to start the year for Donald Han much better production for him and that air ball draws samay as hand 10 and 1 half per game in the second half compared to that three and a half the first half what is that just fluky well I I tell you you know right now again in this game in particular they spent so much time trying to get open offensively again they just wore them out South Carolina now theyre going to need more of offensive possessions like that trying to Chip Away now the lead by South Carolina down to 15 Dion Brown is first bucket of the night Thomas good pass to Pringle the Alabama a transfer and the n one opportunity thats on Chad venning and that will bring us to a timeout South Carolina having quite a night with a 17point lead in Chestnut Hill he was a part of a fraternity something a lot of folks may not have known about but theyve remained close and uh his team had a get chance to get over to the practice facility check that out and what an experience for them when they get a chance to get on the road to have an experience like that yeah to a man they all said it was fantastic we spoke to Kari boils about that he was just ODed by being around that atmosphere Brad Stevens and Mike Zaron the Celtics R see Brad in in in a fraternity he doesnt seem like a frat type guy you think hes Flounder from Animal House yes Donald H to fade away and I guarantee you theyre looking at Colin Mari Bo Im sure theyre looking at other players but thats a guy that really flashes yeah he is and again its really hes under control plays within himself does hes not flashy player and I think hes deceptively athletic in terms of again hes a guy that has a quick First Step certainly can finish uh but Ive been impressed with his rebounding Kelly on the drive and a foul thats on Jamar Thomas is third hes his Knight one for eight from the floor but hes a stabilizing presence on both ends isnt he he really is and again I think thats really been the theme that Ive seen with South Carolina but theyre just they really focus on the defensive end and then theyre anchored by a guy right now that has a double double and Murray Bole 16 points 10 rebounds in D we still have 14 over uh 14 minutes to play in the second half good pass to Dion Brown on the inbounds Deon Browns from great barington Massachusetts thats at the end of the turnpike took his talents to UNBC and a foul on Donald Han our ACC Network Cruise will be in Charlotte for the ACC championship game between Clemson and SMU our preview coverage begins Friday afternoon at 3 Eastern with inside axis followed by acpm and ACC huddle and on game day will have you covered before during and after the game Chaz Kelly Cross Court Elijah strong hes from Charlotte went to Myers Park High School Up and Under by Hastings nice move but could not convert thats a missed opportunity again one of the few looks they had clean at the basket bump on the drive by right again right here again nice move by strong not to settle for the jumper and then this right here this has got to be a finish just unable to convert and then South Carolina gets out in transition 14 foul on the Eagles that was on Hastings is first with jacobe Wright at the line Fred Payne replaces Donald hand Payne has been an instigator off their bench as an offensive player 18 points in their win against Missouri State the Cayman Islands and l Grant loves him because hes determined and he works hard and hes theres that word again hes reliable well I think the big thing theyre going to need right now is a boost off the bench right now nothing really has gone right for Boston College they need a spark from somebody of that gets into this game good pass but an errant tip by Hastings so the drive by pay good idea right well the play was set up again nice little set action just the pass was a little off another missed opportunity at The Rim he in the trouble converting to high percentage shots this year great pass but Murray Bo is a rare Miss Chaz Kelly pounded by jacobe Wright Kelly trying to back in and he picks up the foul on right fou foul Chad venning in foul trouble for BC thats problematic he has four he exits with a team High 12 points think about what BC lost Jaden Zachary playing at Clemson he was such a great influence on both ends of the floor Chaz Kelly trying to pick up the slack he knows he has to be a better offensive player as he misses the first but attacking the basket at The Rim is down 52 and they are getting the line more but thats down Malcolm on those high percentage shots well I think part of it is again when you lose a player like Quinton post guy that can stretch the floor a sevenfooter and some of the other guys they had you talked about Jaden Zachary clad aleris at Mississippi State Devon mlon at Vanderbilt uh I I think you lose 80 of your offense yeah uh you got to bring guys in uh to try to replace them I think the problem right now though for them defensively theyve been unable to stop South Carolina and then offensively really have struggled to get any offensive flow yeah cohesion is an issue on both ends of the floor punched away for a moment by strong in the waiting stages they give him the three for the moment Big Time shot by Zachary Davis and everything going right for South Carolina I think he got it off in real time going to take a look at it right here again Boston College gets them deep into shot clock think he got it off at to yeah from that angle again little blocked but from my vantage point watching it live it looked like he got it off in time again right here yeah that ball is out of his hands yes it is and I think that is a three so it is good for Zachary Daviss first three of the night thats the fourth for the Gamecocks in 12 attempts we asked darl Grant about all the exits who was the most influential in his mind outside of Quinton post and his answer was Devon mlon whos at vanderbild mton was developing into a supreme offensive player yeah well those days are out again with all this movement I think right now for Boston College again uh you got a huge mountain decline youre down 4628 again continue to be patient uh offensively again they need more ball reversals uh thats a tough shot contested in the lane Applause South Carolina is Liv for more than 22 minutes Boseman Veron maneuvering and fouled traveling violation before the contact they say BC ball and right here again looks like he just pulled the chair out again hes playing defense and and okay perplexed to say the least yeah and Leon Paris not happy with that call no lets see if Boston col can try to figure out of this South Carolina defense again look how aggressive they are on dribble handoffs Brown the fadeaway air ball pays got it five on the shot clock Beetle Applause doubled in and out strong industrious and we have a Timeout on the floor after a foul so the Eagles trailing by 18 its been all game coxic County form Music he has so many stories hes fighting his own fight here every day Malcolm about just some brutal stories but people just fighting and fighting and fighting yeah and prayers for uh Dicky V himself to fighting his own fight against cancer and look what hes done for the game of basketball yes Hall of Fame thats great but even more so what hes done for raising money and awareness of for cancer and cancer research and I think the key thing to that message is 100 of your proceeds go to cancer research uh just phenomenal what hes been able to do no question Fight Continues PC down by 16 see Old Miss and Louisville coming up next Wes Durham and Dan Bon standing by to bring you that one much improved Louisville Squad Pat Kelce in his first year good defense by The Eagles Scott the fade away beats the shot clock rebound for Elijah strong cam Scott fific High School scorer in South Carolina over 2400 career points strong too strong with study in the board well plenty of time 1051 again Earl Grant talked about this patience they got to get ball reversals get better screening but be patient still plenty of time again it s feels like theyre down 30 theyre only down now 19 uh but again they just got to do a better job defensively obviously thats too easy but then offensively you got to have more patience against this excellent South Carolina defense UGA suck with his second three of the game Eagles at 29 for the field beetle driving and a wild shot but effective for Joshua Beetle the Clemson transfer and an N1 Im not even sure he was hooking at the basket on this lets check and see right here again take the hit through contact that is great body control and his eyes I am corrected his eyes never left the rim that is a tough finish not sure how he got to get that one to go he was falling down flipped it up with nice touch look like Malcolm hak back I could never do that these rims were kind to you at County for Beetle after the foul was on ugu is first Beetles been a nice addition had trouble cracking the lineup at times for Brad Brown ell Clemson and more aggressiveness off the glass for Beetle the fouls on jacobe right or Z Davis rather thats his second how about the last two games for Beetle 74 that gamewinning three against Boise State the game in islands and I I think the spark he has provided uh his ability uh to break down defenses obviously can create his own shot and you talked about it hes already played in the ACC so its not like a guy coming from a different League obviously uh was behind Chase hunter in that situation Joe Gerard came in a year after so his limp minutes werere limited but right theyre expecting big things from him at Boston Applause College Thomas for Murray boils he sees this six of its last seven shots its been a recurring theme for them Gamecocks have capitalized ugas Su the threepointer hes got impressive range well he does and again uh thats a breakdown uh by Boston College again last season uh he was 29 for this season uh hes at 44 from the threepoint line you must find him thats just great execution but again poor recognition by Boston College thats too much airace Roger McFarland nice touch in the paint for the Southeast Louisiana Applause transfer and now Erol Grant changing up his defense there extending their pressure lets see if this uh can bother the South Carolina offense again right now its just been comfortable for them but theyve gotten anything theyve want wanted in the half court yeah ugas has seven threes his last two games three tonight four against Virginia Tech also at 18 points career best against Indiana on November 16th crosscourt for study the vendy transfer capitalizes South Carolina four of five on threepointers this half its their largest lead of the game at 20 you cannot ask for better half court ex to watch out for that back court of Clemson led by Chase Hunter one of the best in aasa Beetle though one of the few clean looks theyve had that time Beetle showing off the Hops a Blow by rattling the rim five for beetle Mari po Skips a pass that study cant handle and one of the few times uh miscommunication by South Carolina right here on the screen and then Beetles able to go down and get a uncontested dunp thats something we have not seen much of of this and this game Eagles much better on the offensive end in the second half thats not saying much I know but they are trilling 19 to 18 in the second half after getting out scored 36 to9 in the first Roger McFarland looking for Beetle just look where they have Boston College running their offense Yep theyre just keeping everything out of the paint McFarland ran into a road block and throws it away his hand cant track it down that brings us to another timeout South Carol BC wins that game by 15 points and Jackson one of the more explosive players to wear a BC uniform but how about those two guys the careers that they have had one going on to the NFL and Reggie Jackson as you said are still playing 2011 NBA draft he was the 24th overall pick by Oklahoma City and wow what a run he has had Ellington is coaching basketball and football in South Carolina since retiring from the NFL Mari Bo tries to go to the rack Here Comes Donald hand with a threepointer in transition and hes got it Donald hand BCs overall leing score but just seven this evening thats his first three the Eagles are a little bit more momentum in the second half study silences that every time Boston College has tried to cut this deficit and get closer to single digits South Carolina has answered again uh thats just too much airspace Duty May and play pay again Beetle Zips a pass for venning whos dealing with foul trouble after 12 First St points but he dealt with four fouls five for six on threes for the Gamecocks in the second half eight for 16 overall Kobe right back in the game for South Carolina and because South Carolina has been a great job breaking down again the help is overh helping study again hes the one guy in The Scouting Report uh you have to be there on the Music Applause catch studies hit seven threes in his last four games Davis inside Pringle the left hand shot Here Comes Donald Han his father was a star Virginia in the late 90s Beetle at the elbow Nifty move but frustrated by Davis here comes the Applause Gamecock well watch South Carolina they run a lot of side ball screen and Davis is fouled on Josh Beetle his second thats what Lamont Paris told us today were effective the side ball screens are working yeah and theyve moved the ball as well too again the reversal again theyve had the ball moving left or right uh their bigs have done an excellent job setting screens to free up the wings and guards and then theyve gotten high percentage chot pretty much all game you look at the numbers they are not lying for South Carolina close to 50 from the Applause floor theres Lamont Paris and hes wearing a quarter zip which is not unusual if you are watching this game in Columbia South Carolina you see Lamont Paris out and about in the community its 100° in the summer hes still wearing a quarter zip yeah I couldnt do that right there unless I was trying to drop some lbs but he has been a cool CL and collected his team really has executed theyre at 50 from the threepoint line as well too theyve made eight impressive that he just goes to the closet for more quarter Zips and endless supply venning an airball Mari Bo just exhorting confidence on both ends of the floor baade away right rattles in and out Shonda too strong for the Applause Freshman youc has a few of those that theyre high on in their Freshman Class good take by Davis that was too easy a one step in the gy yeah theyre right now playing fatigue Boston College and thats a main because of this defensive pressure its been Relentless by South Carolina look at it Thomas has been the key for this largest lead of the game for the Gamecock Kelly comes up Shy and you can see the fatigue definitely setting it and nobody on the offensive grass and then on this end right here it its really been a a clinic in terms of running your halfcourt sets and then getting high percentage shots at the Applause end Sunday afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Eastern with number 10 Notre Dame taking on Syracuse then SMU squares off against Florida State finish up with number eight Duke hosting Virginia Tech another fun day of basketball on AC Network long night for Earl Grant the fourthe BC coach upward trajectory for the Eagles going to the NIT last year upward trajectory for South Carolina winning 25 games going to the NCA tournament making a run the best since 2017 when they went to the final four but Earl Grant still says you know were still trying to build something here after losing so much last year he still doesnt know what he has no he doesnt and again hes trying to figure out rotations that work I can tell you one thing though again on the other side South Carolina uh Thomas to me has been key again he hasnt scored a bunch of points but his defensive pressure I really think set the tone in this game of keeping the BC guards out of the paint Dion Applause Brown so Brown has Applause six definitely a guy that BC needs to shine in ACC play and a block in the post but a foul on the Eagles so a 21point lead matching the largest of the game for the game Music gucks to see why he leads the SEC in field goal percentage hes just so efficient he had another efficient outing tonight on the road at Boston College and we asked him who he admired in the NBA he said you know what I dont really admire anybody specifically I just admire the Oklahoma City Thunder for the way they play you can appreciate that really and and you know appreciate how that young man also speak spending time with him very humble yeah talked about a lot about the impact that his brother had on him and again you can see why uh he is a guy that the coaching staff and Coach Paris but they know he is going to be a guy that play at the next level theres James and Colin Murray boils his brother has been someone hes looked up to his entire life and look at the Young boils daing the 23 Lakers jersey I love it and and that you love seeing those old school picture you can tell thats big bro looking out for a little brother you love seeing that type of story and again just an impressive performance and uh the ceiling for him and you can see the future very bright for that young man again does it on both ends and very rarely you talk about guys rebounding kind of a throwback yeah uh but he really enjoys defending and also rebounding Lamont Paris says hes drawing a lot of interest in NBA circles also making a good point though if youre going to the NBA now its not like the old days as he said when he was draft eligible as Butler hits his first three of the night only played a couple minutes but Butler transfer from Missouri adding to the threepoint parade theyre sixth in the second half in seven attempts Luca Taves for BCs harassed by Thomas and a foul largest lead of the game for the Gamecocks around the SEC ACC mens challenge presented by Continental TI good one with Miami and Arkansas what do you make of Syracuse struggling against one of the best teams in the country well I tell you what again you take a look at some of the numbers but the upcoming games as well too key moment critical uh Challen all for the ACC to try to put a dent in some of those selection Sunday uh voters theyre going to have eyes on this as well too and the net ratings have not been kind in the first month for the ACC teams so first to nine wins the SEC ACC challenge plethora of games for you coming up in the next couple days on the ESPN family of networks right the double team Taz takes it away DC playing with two point guards on the back cour Kelly and Taves and Kelly draws the foul South Carolina foul number zero J Butler thats his second first team 10 heres your top 25 involved in the challenge Auburn loaded between Auburn Tennessee Kentucky Duke and Alabama many felt like coming in the season was a national championship Contender a lot of good teams on that list yeah it really is and again it shows the strength of these conferences I I think the uh big thing for this challenge uh in particular again you look at we talked about it the success that the ACC has had in the postseason uh but its been proven again early on these games matter for the amount of teams that are put into the tournament I think thats the significance of this and why this challenge is so important an impressive group from Columbia South Carolina methodical very well coach extremely composed steal by Donald Han and the slam D so credit BC for playing throughout this ball game well again this is something coaches are looking for obviously game clearly in hand for South Carolina right but if youre Earl Grant youre looking at this tape whos going to continue to try to fight theyre fighting still Jamari Thomas with the three and I would give him almost a CO MVP and again its because of his pressure on the ball I think that set the tone in this game again his ability to get up and pressure and he created havoc on the Boston College offense he was a floor General hes only two for nine one for four from three but he has five assists jari Thomas the meak player of the year last year for Norfolk State thats an adjust you come to a power for school you know the level of play is different but he certainly looks like hes no worse for the wear no absolutely and I think again hes got a strong build coach Paris and staff talk about I think the biggest thing he brings uh his ability uh to apply pressure and set that defense really I think has been key in this game it set the tone early sh good job by Kenny Shonda freshman getting some valuable experience Scott ball movement impressive by the Gamecocks and continued Hustle the 5050 ball and a jump ball as Nick Pringle hit the deck and thats just pure effort possession towards South Carolina we have Old Miss and Louisville in our crosshairs with West Durham and Dan Bonner standing by the KFC Yum Center and I know you love what Louisvilles done in Pat Kels first year absolutely again huge game for Louisville to continue to try to bolster a their Applause resume and Applause Georgia is beaten Notre Dames so they have the first point on the board SEC one ZIP over the ACC they need eight more to clinch venning with his fifth foul he will Exit Zero second half points for Chad Benning it is 6 for 12 from the field six rebounds in 26 minutes and thats a guy thats going to be a main influence for BC if theyre going to have any success this year yeah he did he had it going in the first half did some really good things I think he got fatigu again credit South Carolina two things they did they put him in a lot of ball screens its talked about ball reversals they put him in side ball screams made him come out on the perimeter and then uh defensively they really forced him outside of the paint again he was uh catching the ball in that first half really in the first really five to 8 minutes of the game in the paint that changed in the second half where they were able to push him further away from the basket Austin hero checks in for South Carolina its put on scholarship out of the start of the summer workouts his brother Tyler Star at Kentucky playing for the heat 2022 NBA Sixth Man of the Year what a player he is Donald Han with the drive and and a foul thats on hero its only played 14 minutes this year but Tyler hero is a walking bucket Off the Bench and with the Miss Grant said for BC to have success tonight theyre going to have to out tough them theyre going to have to outwork them they had to be relentless South Carolina was fit to the cost yeah I think and and I think offensively uh patience again Earl Grant talked about it they needed to be good screeners in this game now that did not happen credit South Carolina uh and then on the other side Lamont Paris again uh besides the one hiccup early on uh their only uh two losses uh were to top 25 teams it was about as impressive defensive performance uh that Ive seen thus far uh they really start to finish dominated this game with their defense yep BC Trail by five with seven minutes left first half and a 142 run ended it theres the control that South Carolina
