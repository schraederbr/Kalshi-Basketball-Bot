students were here Jay an hour hour and a half before this thing started this place is going to be rocking the buzz is back in Coral Gables Miami trying to become ACC champions for the first time since a decade ago in 2013 and Pitt trying to do it for the first time its the Panthers who win the tip we are underway Pittsburgh with the basketball Applause defensive rebounding uh for Miami Anthony Walker comes up clutch hes making his first start today on Senior Day alongside fellow senior Harlan Beverly Nigel pack returns after he missed the Florida State game a week ago with a knee injury Wong step back three Off the Mark and then on the other side for a pit that right there defending the threepoint line in particular in screen and roll situations thats what Miami wants to do Pittsburgh all five starters or transfers and yet Jeff Capel has Blended this team beautifully now have a chance to make some history become ACC regular season Champions whats been the key to the turnaround this season Malcolm ball movement uh look how Pittsburgh spaces the floor and then their threepoint shooting ability uh that has been the key to go along with some really excellent defense Hinson lines up a three and drills it to open the scoring that right there theyre a team that averages close to 10 threes made per game when we spoke to coach Jim learonega of Miami he said we must defend the threepoint line against this Pittsburgh team theyre one of the better threepoint shooting teams in college basketball Jordan Miller on the Move tough assignment for Blake Kinston thats going to be a match up to watch all afternoon long five on the timer Anthony Walker decides to shoot left in short Beverly the offensive rebound he claims up this film Music called on Beverly Applause Music classy gesture game big implications of Jim larenegger still starting the two seniors Anthony Walker Harlan Beverly despite them not starting all season long Music he knows the implications obviously now a question is how long does he leave them in it looks like hes going to go to his normal starters now jamarius Burton knocks it down Pittsburgh playing with a ton of confidence to start this game for me this game is going to decide in my opinion whos the player of the year in the league jamarius Burton Isaiah Wong watch that match up I think those two guys right now Front Runners for Player of the Year ndacc Beverly scoop to the hoop he has all four for Miami Music Applause Burton so good at backing down a guard Beverly great defense though Harlan Beverly a terrific start to this contest great feed Walker rocks the rims thats all set up Jordan Miller hurt Pitt in their first game now he had 17 in that game in the second half see a little nice backdoor cut but Pitt decided to double team and Miller such a great pass right here he sees the double coming gives it up the rotations late on the other end and Walker rocks the rim beautiful offense by Miami so Beverly and Walker making their first start of the season because its senior night and they account for all six of the Hurricanes points Henson shooting into the Miami student section which is loud and proud its a black out there tonight they call themselves The Eye of the storm and its a category five in Coral Gables and what an atmosphere both these programs uh pit and Miami have created a legitimate home court advantage and Ill say it again these students have been here early in this game and they are allowed Applause Music Applause Music now into the game for Miami pack serves it up for omir and he lays it in when we spoke with Jeff Capel this afternoon and shoot around he said pick and roll defense is going to be key in this game the rotations on the back end must be there if not Miami will get lobs to the rim s improved contact omear almost lost it heres Juan too much on it Applause thats pretty good d by jamarius Burton and thats all you can ask for with Isaiah Wong make him shoot contested jumpers passing out of the double team finds Hinson misses this one but hell let it fly all night long Applause Applause ER on Federico Federico two guys up for ACC Defensive Player of the Year and thats why Federico got a piece of it omir turns and shoots Miss fires but an offensive rebound by Jordan Miller he is always in perfect position he is and you absolutely said it right though that matchup of Federico Federico verse North Chad OMeara that time Federico commits the foul Jordan Miller at the line when weve returned just getting started two teams battling atop the ACC Music Target one of the best stories in college basketball this season voted 14 of 15 in the ACC preseason poll now with a win would be the number one seed in the ACC tournament what a turnaround and whats interesting is we were speaking with ESPN bracketologist Joe Leonardi and he said that the Panthers are still on the bubble would need to either win today or get one win in that ACC tournament or they could be in trouble which I I cant believe well regardless of what it is I know Jeff Capel uh they want to take all the doubt out and get a win here on the road uh for me though its still clearcut who is the coach of the year and the ACC the job that he has done you talked about it preseason pick 14 not too many people thought Pitt would be in this position with a chance to beat regular season Champs of the ACC yeah Jeff Capel goes from maybe the hottest seat in college basketball to undoubtedly the ACC coach of the year which will be announced on Monday Applause s trailing by four on the road a terrific atmosphere here in Coral gamers early impressions as both teams are up for a heavyweight fight to decide whos can hang at ACC regular season Championship Banner so Bandy Off the Mark early on both teams doing an excellent job contesting jumpers not many open looks early on rolls around doesnt fall for Nigel pack Pittsburgh has missed fourth straight shots of scoring drought of the last two minutes and 30 seconds great feed inside awkward though Federico Federico didnt gather went right up with it to foul long went right there to call and thats why jamarius Burton is at the top of the list for me player of the year when you talk about complete players yes hes a guy that can score for you yes hes got good assist numbers but for me his defense in particular against some of the better guards not just in the ACC but in college basketball thats what you have in Isaiah Wong thats what makes him a special player thats a big time defensive play so for as good as Pittsburgh has been all season long and were heaping tons of Praise on them they did go to South Bend and lose 8881 on Wednesday and Mike Freys final home game thats a Bolton easy call North Chad OMeara blocking the cylinder so how do you bounce back quickly because its a tough turnaround youre going to another road game whats the recipe today for the Panthers well thats light and uh the ACC but its been the mantra for Jeff Gable lets go 10 and hes been consistent with that every year whether theyre coming off a win or a loss lets focus on whats in front of you right now and thats this game a lot at stake and I think again thats history for these guys right now they know whats on the line tonight on the move right to the rim start this game Applause 10 of their 12 points in the paint Applause Savannah lost the handle who was it off of last he said itll save Pittsburgh ball off Bensley Joseph last and this is just a great closeout by Joseph and then theyre very active both these teams I think underrated defensively and in particular theyre very active in the passing Lanes perfect position for the follow Nike sebandi Applause you got a double technical Joseph and Ann sabandi theyve been John and we got a veteran referee uh crew theyre not going to allow this to get out of hand theyre going to get it under control right away both guys were jarring the previous play before and now theyre going uh to clean it up so Bandy handed the ball right here again nice little shove and then afterwards he hands the ball hits him right in the face and Joseph throws it right here throws it right back and the refs Im telling you right now with this crew they are not playing around so any extracurricular stuff I can tell you right now I had a chance to speak with Teddy Valentine before this game Jamie lucky Teddy was doing games back when I was playing and yeah hes not going to allow anything to go on extra quickly so these guys both teams need to understand now its over so plated a whistle and thats it Tim clagerty and Jamie lucky at the monitor to review this so Savannah gives it to Joseph throws it right back and I think again Tech I dont think theres anything else after that theyre just going to clean it up no elbows were thrown no punches thrown so again I think theyre just gonna clean up all the extra crickler John and then obviously anytime the ball goes in just leave it alone either hand it to the rep or just let it bounce let them pick it up and I think this is what started it right here they started John so the refs Let It Go and then sabandi gets a bucket afterwards and let Joseph know Jamie lucky talking with Jeff Capel Josephs still fired up over on the Miami sideline Music Applause foreign Music class a technical foul offsetting technical so were not going to get any free throws itll just be Miami ball so unsportsmanlike Music technicals and we play on and I guarantee you right now both teams and coaches have been warned Applause Music pullup popped too much on it Music thats a great job of blocking out that time by Pitt thats a great team rebounding Hinson from the logo buries it two threes already for Blake Henson tonight you have to be there on the catch he is one of the better threepoint shooting players in college basketball and hes got a quick release if youre not there with him Blake Henson on the catch its too late and hes got unlimited range Music rolls off the rim of foul Falls Guillermo Diaz grammed The Freshman out of Spain and youll see this right here Blake Henson one of the better pick and Pops players in college again hes going to pick and hes going to relocate and again you have to be connected and thats why screen and roll defense is so important against this Pittsburgh team in particular when youre defending Blake Henson he will pick and then hes going to pop on either side so as one regular season comes to a close lacrosse is just hitting its Shrine here at the beginning of March a triple header next Saturday on acc Network it starts with Notre Dame and Syracuse and then over to Ohio State Notre Dame a top five matchup Towson the number one Virginia finishes it off a monster triple header next Saturday right here on acc Network Burton long reached in and Burton plowed right through jamarius Burton a man on a mission and both these teams will break off their offense and either post up agar or just go isolation situations if theres a matchup they like almost Pro style offense again theyre going to identify the matchup they like and see if your guy can stop Music Poplar lost the handle going Baseline still seven seconds on the shot clock fall underneath Miamis hoop eating on these out of bounds underneath they do a lot of screen to screener actions and then theyll run Wong off the screen that time really good the defense by jamarius Burton Beverly from the corner long there and hes fouled eight minutes into this game Isaiah Wong scoreless so far but can change that from the foul line good morning now is early on in this game its Miami with some Second Chance opportunities going back to the first matchup of these two teams Pittsburgh dominated the offensive glass had 17 Second Chance points and when we spoke with Coach Jim larenaga he said that was going to be key in this game akande key Pittsburgh off the offensive glass three offensive rebounds all ready for the hurricanes Wong makes them both fires Miami back in front you just get the feeling this is going to be a back and forth game I have a feeling its probably going to come down to like their first meeting uh one or two possessions at the end of the game Applause Greg alley at his first shot Off the Mark you mentioned that first matchup Malcolm Miami LED for most of that game in Pittsburgh they were up eight 6860 with 205 left it ended on an 110 run to win by three North Chad omear adds to the Miami advantage Applause so Bandy on the drive into traffic and it rolls in Nike sabandi put just enough on it body control off the charts my goodness that is degree of difficulty 10 take the hit float in the air and then adjust eyes on the rim the entire time thats a big time movein finish by Nike Savannah heres Hanson all the way to the rim he missed it everything but the finish for Blake Henson long in transition air ball Beverly saves it and it bounces right to Miller Applause Music early in this game Arlen Beverly has been huge for Miami that time loose ball heads up play to throw it right back to Jordan Miller inside counted plus the foul Federico Federico oh a chance to tie it at 20 when we come back the big men starting the battle here in South Florida this is an awesome back and forth game in the ACC Music in a game thatll decide who is the number one seed in the ACC tournament next week a win would also serve as a huge resume win when you talk about the NCAA tournament yeah I think both these teams again I I in my opinion are locked in I think for Miami its about positioning and and what seed they will get you look at their net and then the wins versus quad one uh for me uh theyre a team that could potentially go on another deep NCAA tournament run Music tied at 20 Pittsburgh and Miami going punch for punch you can feel the intensity from both teams they know what is on the line atop the ACC Music Midway through this first half Isaiah Wongs been quiet risky Cross Court pass and its intercepted Music Applause Hinson Miller all over him spins through a double team rolls off the rim no good transition three Beverly made it but wave off the three a travel called first and thats a break for a pit really good transition offense by Miami heads up play pratter that Isaiah Wong tipped it out knew he couldnt rebound it but tipped it out and started the break Applause so Bandy lines it up and hits it fires Pittsburgh back in front Applause Pittsburgh does a great job spacing the floor and again all their guys you must be there on the catch so Bandy another guy with a quick release off the catch Pittsburgh on a sixnothing run Juan spins into the lane another air ball thats two for him today Applause credit that time sabandi uh theyre making it really difficult for him and those are just individual battles right there again theyre not given much help Applause some bandies have the hot hand now caught in a double team five seconds to shoot Elliott in trouble so Mandy has to go up with it one on the shot clock he got it away but it didnt hit Rim thats a shot clock violation were seeing great defense by both of these teams and both these teams do a great job spacing but then also a ball screen so youll see a lot of actions with both these teams so the rotations need to be really good out of those Hedges or double teams Ill tell you what we just showed NCAA tournament seating according to ESPNs Joe linardi you do not want to see these two teams in your region on selection Sunday very very difficult to match up against in particular because their ability to shoot the ball but thats twice now a really unforced turnovers travels uh by Miami and those are just missed opportunities missed possessions now obviously the only good thing with that its not a live ball turnover so you dont allow Pittsburgh to get out in transition but you certainly want to cut down on those turnovers five turnovers in this first half but four of them have come in the last three minutes its allowed Pittsburgh to nose in front six nothing Run for the Panthers looking for more Applause heres Nelly Cummings finds Burton long on Burton and Burton wins that match up again jamarius Burton Music he makes the difficult look easy Music the ball screen defensive by Pittsburgh theyre doing a great job hedging hard on the ball screens and then recovering Bensley Joseph waving through traffic these two teams making acrobatic shot after after batting shot oh there are going to be no open looks in this game to both the way these teams are playing defense right now active in the passing Lanes Applause great feed inside omir and misses the layoff regatherers one Music Jim Blair and basketball and his ability to finish around the basket is a reason why hes shooting close to 60 percent uh from the field uh on the season and thats just a big time grown man move right there he is so strong early on he is impacting this game with his rebounding and an ability to finish around the basket eight points five rebounds both lead Miami so far tonight and hell have a chance to try and complete the and one and tied this game at 25 Music youll hear us remind you throughout the game so much on the line of this regular season finale winner of this game gets a share of the ACC regular season title with Virginia but both teams have the tiebreaker over the Cavaliers so the winner of this game is your one seed in Greensboro in next weeks ACC tournament post defense for the guards is going to be huge for Miami again theyre going to post up uh jamarius Burton if they think he has an advantage and thats what theyre doing right now are just breaking onto offense and then letting him go to work Burton thats big time move and again theyre going to have to make a decision uh do we go double because right now they think uh he has a size advantage on Joseph theyre going to let him break off and do what he just did could very well end up as your ACC Player of the Year jamarius Burton thats it here finds Elliott transition three too much on it omir grabs the rebound Pax with the double team Miami has numbers Applause Naylors foul Miami missing a lot of layups of this first half I mean that one was was a foul uncharacteristic but thats got to be a and one back to the previous play again Miami stays home and again this is why Pitt is very difficult to match up against because they have threepoint Shooters all around if you go double jamarius Burton wanted to better assist guys in the ACC hell find him oh thanks Music and Burtons just playing with an energy and a confidence thats contagious for this Pittsburgh team not just today but all season long and hes been the leader uh defensively and offensively he does a little bit of everything for this team my opinion and Michael he is right at the top of the list of four players a year in the ACC Applause Burton again finds a Bandy step back three well short Applause Music Applause Music Applause Burton reaches in Poplar open and drills it from the corner Music Applause foreign trying to answer Miller all over him forces the miss packed for three no good Juan saves it thats now six offensive rebounds for Miami and they continue to cash in with Second Chance points Applause wide open Poplar hits it again Applause Music timeout Pittsburgh back to back three From fluga Poplar ball movement unselfish play omir the first time dribble Drive kick to popular and then this time Nigel path with the beautiful fine Miami on the run up six Music its bow time a sandwich this good speaks for itself but when youre talking handbreaded boldly seasoned chicken with thick cut pickles on a buttery Toasted Bun well well say it again and again both chicken sandwich only at Bojangles and its bow time Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen oh my God Mom no keeping my eyes on the road is paying off with driveways the driveways from Allstate save for avoiding Mayhem a sold out crowd here at Coral Gables Miami on a 132 run everybody on their feet uh this environment here I said it at the beginning of what Jim Lear has created here uh these students were here early this place is rocking and this is why we love March Madness largest lead of the game for either team Miami with all the momentum and they forced a turnover coming out of the Jeff Capel timeout over the last three minutes hurricanes on a 132 run and what Miami is doing uh really well now they are blitzing the ball screen so The Bigs are stepping out uh trapping and then the rotation on the back end has been very good and theyre very active in the passing Lanes long quiet first half misses that layup missed all five shots hes taken tonight and thats really been the theme you said it uh Jay theyve missed a lot of layups and opportunities that they normally make Casey called for an off ball foul Music Applause sabandi had space decided not to shoot how about Jorge Diaz Graham the seven foot freshman from Spain thats a big time three to cut the lead in half and thats what he brings different from Federico Federico he has the ability to step out Beyond The Ark and spread the defense cut the passing Lane pack regathers 10 seconds to shoot Isaiah Wong has a mismatch calling for the clear out spins his way in Diaz Graham thought he got all ball a foul was a call Isaiah Wong is so Shifty just when you think you have them uh but right now Miamis still up three Music theyre all to Terry Holland from Jim larenaga friend Mentor Holland obviously a legend in the ACC and if Virginia died six days ago at age 80 you know Jim larenega obviously a lot of people know was the assistant coach on those final four teams in Virginia with Ralph Samson I did not know that he was at Davidson as a 21 year old first head or assistant coaching job was because of Terry Holland I could have sat in his office yesterday for hours had a chance to spend a considerable time with Coach L and of the stories and some of the great things that he talked about with Coach Holland really what a great tribute to a legendary not only coach but human being well there would certainly be something beautiful if Miami were to win today theyd share an ACC title with Terry Hollands beloved Virginia Cavaliers Pittsburgh trying to play spoiler as georgetowner goes up top to rock the rim but go check the screws on that one that Rim is hurting right now what a beautiful lob and find uh by Isaiah Wong big play after big play Nelly Cummings trying to answer with a three and it rimmed out Doppler in transition Applause dials it in from Deep for the third time in this first half and theyre just not finding him in transition theres taken three shots theyve all been from three and hes made them all as Pittsburgh turns it over well in transition Miamis doing a great job pushing the pace and then Poplar hes just laying back on the threepoint line and pit the rotation and transition D has not been there with him on the catch and hes made them pay and alleyoop followed up by a three gets the crowd in it forces the turnover and Wong gives it right back Music this has been a first half to forget for Isaiah Wong three turnovers no made shots is three points have all come from the foul line and a credit Pitt theyre doing a great job with that pack line D again when hes driving theres bodies there or guys that are active with their hands and trying to slow him down the Bandy calling for it gets it goes Baseline scoop to the hoop Nike seband he much needed answer for Pittsburgh his ability to adjust mid ear has been impressive thats twice now in this game hes been able to get in the ear adjust and get around the defender and finish Wong draws the contact will head to the foul line is what Im talking about beautiful skip court and then the adjustment in the air this one right here degree of difficulty off the charts hiki sabandi again with the adjustment Music with the ACC tournament starting on Tuesday a reminder until all fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life to help benefit the local Boys and Girls

Greensboro is Going to Be Wild the regular season is any indication this league is wide open headed into Champion I would not be surprised if any of the teams that go down there goes on a run in the ACC tournament really theres that much parity in this league Applause two threes for the freshman hey Diaz Graham delivering on a huge stage and what thats going to do hes hit two now thats going to pull Omer away from the basket and thats going to open up a driving Lanes even more for the pit guards this is twice now again Graham they break off they go to help out in the post and Graham now has hit two threes neither one of them has hit the rim Pat quick trigger off the inbound in Miami back up by four Applause Brown comes to its feet in the watchco center awesome atmosphere all first half long Cummings on the drive finds Diaz Graham goes up with it tough take it he missed it Miami has a timeout use it or lose it and they elect to use it with 18 seconds left and what has been an eventful and really fun first half exactly what we thought was going to be in this game I think the big thing Miami uh Jay the difference Miami with 16 Second Chance points uh in this first half remember we go back to that first matchup at Pittsburgh it was the team that dominated the second chance points they had 17 Second Chance points uh in that first matchup uh at Pittsburgh right now in the first half Miami dominating the offensive glass coming up at halftime awesome that the nothing but neck crew has come to Coral Gables we got live studio for a game thatll decide whos the number one seed in the ACC tournament next week Music and Jay you almost feel like theres a typo and these stats total rebounds Miami has 22 Pittsburgh only eight thats a difference in this game Applause Miami has used seven offensive rebounds to score 16 Second Chance points in this first half Jordan Miller kick to pack beats the buzzer but it didnt Rim in his bird gets a stop at the end of the first half but its Miami that takes a fourpoint lead into halftime well you couldnt ask for a better look to close out the half that time but Pittsburgh I think the adjustment rebounding but right now Miami goes into the half up four waddle and the lead this has been back and forth since the opening tip winner gets the number one seed in the ACC tournament in a couple of days in Greensboro Miller going Baseline finds Poplar he had the hot hand only took three shots and he made him all from Deep inside omir calling for it gets it swatted away Federico Federico to the rescue for me uh he is at the top of the list for d hat right there theres hard on the ball scream got back and recovered and then blocked the shot in the key thing Jay he kept it in play kept possession for his team Big Time defensive play by Federico Federico Burton going right into Wong finishes strong jamarius Burton hes up to 10 to lead Payton scoring Im going right back to that matchup if on Pittsburgh if Isaiah Wong is guarding him hell let him use his size Advantage jamarius Burton isolate him into post and make Miami make a decision do we come and double all mirror through contact perfect position to clean up his own spill you know in that first matchup we were just talking about where pit one it was jamarius Burton dominating that matchup with Wong down the stretch that won the Panthers that game here he is with the ball in his hands again this time Poplar the matchup passing off at a hard foul Blake Hinson will head to the line and thats all set up again jamarius Burton they just break their playoff they they match up with him uh in the post uh break off your play let him isolate on the wing work his way down to the post and then you go to double or you turn your head uh he is such a good passer again right here you turn your head nice Cut Right Here by Blake Benson foul shooting has been a strength for this pit Team all season 77 percent from the line which is a program best and yet a shocking performance from the charity stripe on Wednesday night they were 20 of 36 in the loss to Notre Dame that cost them the game but spoke to Jeff Capel about it today he said I trust our guys from the foul line thats a big part of our success this season and he felt like there was a little Leprechaun sitting up on top of the basket knocking off all he said look I dont think well ever shoot that bat again from the freethrow line and certainly on the road that is a recipe for disaster missing that many Miller hits it from three Applause Music foreign s final home game The Invisible leprechaun whatever it was in Pittsburgh battling back still a chance to win the ACC regular season down five on the road Cummings hes been quiet Applause fading away thats a tough take and it rims out what a block out by omir keeping Federico Federico off the glass both these teams really are doing a great job defensively and their screen and roll coverage Music intercepted by Henson up the floor to Elliott rejected North Shadow near says get that out of here and a foul called on Cummins as Miami looked to break the other way and Jeff people is hot he felt like there was a foul well on this yeah it looks like again from that angle tough to see if there was not any contact on his arm going up but from that angle he looked like he hacked yeah it definitely did look like there was a lot of arm on that but no call and missed opportunity in transition off the turnover for Pitt step back up the game Miller keeps it alive Second Chance points the name of the game Miami already has 16 Poplar no good Miller still scrapping for it and finally Federico down is it for Pittsburgh Jay I dont know the count but Miamis probably missed about eight layups in this game Applause Sid spinning into a double team and he traveled wave off the basket Applause Music Pittsburgh started to get a little frustrated at the start of the second half credit uh Miamis defense again theyve done a great job in their pick and roll coverage and then theyre active in the passing Lanes Applause foreign lead for the hurricanes and yet Isaiah Wong yet to make a basket Poplar from three hes ready Applause Jay I said it uh at half the adjustment you have to be there on the catch with Luke apocalypse so Danny rides rise lamb send it in Savannah what an answer to quiet this crowd down his ability attack the rim and then take flight that time showing off the Hops again my goodness thats a big time finish by Nike sabandi Naylor got two to jump good recovery by Diaz Graham and then a foul comes in so my popping plays right now well Im nicknaming him right now but this one will go Poplar all name team and then Air Nike Savannah and take life we got a great game here take a look at our updated ACC standings Virginia beating Louisville earlier today to finish the season 155 at ACC play gives Cavaliers a share of the regular season title theyll share it with the winner of Pittsburgh and Miami and both hit in Miami own that tiebreaker beat Virginia headtohead in the regular season so the winner of our game right here right now will be your number one seed in the ACC tournament and I think thats key obviously though I think more so a four pit Jeff Capo we spoke with him this afternoon they talked about going 10 uh what a huge a boost this would be for them resume a booster being on the road the closeout of the ACC regular season you know what a season it has been for Jeff Capel in Pittsburgh this week ranked number 25 in the AP poll first ranking since the 20152016 season this fan base has been through a lot since then a lot of losing and they finally found the magic bottle it up trailing by eight now remember they came back in the final two minutes of this first meeting they trailed by eight went on an 11nothing run to win so no matter how much this team is down they are never out Applause seven seconds to shoot Cummings in attack mode gets the foul call Nelly Cummings a really quiet game for him particularly how hes been playing as of late five points and four assists his last five games five straight games and double figures averaging seven assists hes been a real X Factor for this Panthers team and I think the big thing too shooting 40 percent from the threepoint line in that five game stretch uh but credit Miami theyve done a nice job Championship Sunday tomorrow nothing but Nat gets you started nude Eastern Time three Eastern times keep it after the game for the nothing but neck crew theyll have you covered what has been a wild ACC womens basketball tournament champ week underway somebody gonna hoist some Hardware tomorrow Naylor the spin cycle down the lane flips it in Jordan Miller hes got 13 and thats a heads up play he faked the dribble hand off and then went right down the middle of the lane Miami cranking up the defensive intensity just as the momentum was reaching a fever pitch North Shadow mere travels yeah and thats twice now though hes gotten a rebound and tried to bring it up and run the break lets see if he shuffled if he yeah he shuffled his feet again it was ever so subtle but that quick replay right there looked like a travel and as you said uh momentum really shifted hit capitalized great feed inside an easy finish for Diaz Graham thats a great pass by Blake Henson almost like a quarterback throwing it to a receiver before theyre open he saw him coming off that screen through it in anticipation he was going to come off clean and he did oh Mir lost his footing Here Comes Savannah Pittsburgh three on two Cummings didnt pull the trigger and he travels Music weve seen more travels today than weve seen all season and I think he passed up Nelly Cummings he passed up a pretty good look against the Bandy in transition off that uh Miss uh by omir again right here I think hes open hes got to let that one fly he doesnt and thats a pretty good closeout by Jordan Miller stays down and forces a turnover but I think Nelly Cummins pass one up right there hes going to let that fly Applause largest lead of the game for Miami Pittsburgh in the danger zone and Henson almost rolled in for an and one opportunity hell get two Nigel pack I call him logo range this time uh just a hedge on the ball screen they dont slow him down the recovery is late and Nigel pack is a guy that you must be there uh with him hes got unlimited range great threepoint shooter 41 on the season and whats so impressive is hes not just to catch and shoot guy its the ability to create that three off the dribble and I think the adjustment now for Pitt they were doing it in the first half they were hedging hard and slowing the ball down that time there was more a show and then get back trying to give the guard a chance to get back underneath but you must slow the ball down first Applause Tim just hits the first point lead for Miami they have certainly grabbed control of this game in the second half Applause heres back from the logo connected Act hits the shot clock pit ball and thats a better recovery that time by Nike sabandi again youll live with that as long as youre there with him if he hits a contested deep logo three and nothing you can do about it you just dont want him coming off clean better pick and roll defense that time by Pittsburgh Applause he has Graham floater Falls he has eight points three of four for the Freshman out of Spain hes providing a big boost off the bench talented uh thats a seven footer right there again he showed off the threepoint shooting range that time head fake and then a floater and that is a once skilled sevenfooter tough take and Nigel pack buries it he is really starting to heat up Applause sabandi attacking pack gets omir in the air two foul shots coming Jay for me its a lot for six men of the year I I think youve almost just handed to this guy right here Nike sabandi his ability to come in Off the Bench for Jeff Capel really has been huge hes embraced that role and he has had some huge gains he would start for pretty much a lot of teams in the ACC but hes embraced that role Off the Bench around does not drop sounds like youre gonna have a lot of Pittsburgh in Miami on your ACC balance and I put a premium on where teams finish again well theres other guys I think with some impressive stats but these two teams right here I think theyre guys that have put up some really good numbers that have translated to winning and being at the top of the ACC Standing 28 minutes into this game Isaiah Wong doesnt have a single made basket and yet Miami leads by seven Applause foreign comes in Jorge Diaz Graham fighting for it and a timeout call Music s for with the basketball trailing by seven the ACC on the line between these two teams Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting Im locked into that number two seed and the one thing we could agree on is anybody if you go in string together some wins win it all we saw that a year ago with Virginia Tech absolutely I would not be surprised to see the same thing happen again this year you are absolutely right I think a wide open ACC tournament as we take a look though Blake Henson continues to shoot at a high clip his third made three he leads Pittsburgh and scoring on the season and so far does today 13 points brings the Panthers back within four Isaiah 1 hasnt made a basketball game puts one up finally connects Applause six Applause Music Diaz Graham twins getting extended playing time off the bench Federico Federico usually the the big man for Pittsburgh hes only played 16 minutes three points and three fouls aside again Pittsburghs made three in a row trying to battle back down six on the road against Miami Music when its tournament time we dont go big Miami a sixpoint lead and Hawk looked no further than Second Chance points yeah you can look at a lot of things in this game but that pretty much sums up the difference in this game uh really difficult uh to be ahead Im actually surprised theyre only trailing six uh the rebounding numbers really are glaring uh 29 total rebounds for Miami only 13 for Pitt and whats so ironic is in the first matchup in Pittsburgh which the Panthers won Pittsburgh dominated Miami on the glass Jim larenegger told us that was the reason Miami lost that game was the rebounding margin clearly a point of emphasis and Miami has stepped up big coming out of the timeout Joseph rips it away defensive intensity two for Miami is certainly ratcheted up and both teams though really doing a great job team defense The Bigs have really hedged hard on ball screens and then the recoveries really have been impressive by both teams Bensley Joseph who got the steal now can he cash in on the other end leaves it up for Beverly and hell get two of the line Joseph has played really a solid game again maybe not a lot of points but his defense and an ability to make plays like that have been huge in this game this right here again draw two and then kick but I think the biggest contribution is it been his defense on jamarius Burton of that last play coming up with the Steal Music again both these teams very deep and when they go to their events they really do not lose much Everly Cashes in both free throws Miami showing pressure really for the first time today in the final 10 minutes you get the feeling jamarius Burton will have the game on his back for Pittsburgh like many games this season and he has delivered Applause this time sabandi working on Wong Hinson from the corner misfires he had made three threes whos looking for a fourth Burton steals it away Race To The Hoop Applause pendants around kicks out to Cummings Burton working on omir Henson tries it again cant connect again Miamis defense All Over Pittsburgh right now and the crowd loves it that might have been their best defensive possession of the game individually North at OMeara his individual defense that time on jamarius Burton was the key they didnt have to help off of him and they forced a contested three Applause pack trapped in the corner and its a turnover and thats a great job of knowing The Scouting Report by pit of the first jamarius Burton knew Beverly was going to try to reject the ball screen to double ball screen and beat him Baseline he didnt bite for it and then the Locking Trail by Nelly Cummings to force packed into a turnover thats just really understanding what they were trying to do on that play So Bandy he missed fires Burton offensive rebound puts it in that ends a threeminute scoring drought for Pittsburgh jamarius Burton on the offensive glass Applause Pittsburgh riding Hinson and Burton down the stretch in a game thatll decide whos the one seed in next weeks ACC tournament Wong fouled shooting three three critical foul shots coming for Isaiah long and thats all set up because his shiftiness again hes setting you up through the legs and now he thinks oh hes pulling up for the jumper little has he is such a tough matchup oneonone Applause next Saturday afternoon as ACC basketball is in champ week Watson ACC lacrosse it starts with a terrific womens game Notre Dame Syracuse at noon and double header to follow top five matchup Ohio State Notre Dame and then Towson and Virginia and Jay with those three free throws Isaiah Wong said a program record for single season ACC only free throws made with A7 largest lead of the game for Miami Pittsburgh with their backs against the wall couldnt even hear the whistle thats how loud it is here at the watsco center Ted Valentine blew his whistle and people kept playing because you could not hear him a deafening crowd thats trying to will Miami to the Finish Line get the Keynes to hang a banner here the watsco center next year if they could hold on to this lead at Papa Johns well Miami leads by nine which is the largest lead of the game remember in the first meeting back in Pittsburgh Miami led by eight with two minutes and five seconds left pit end of the game on an 11nothing run you know Jeff capels reminding his guys down the stretch that theyve been capable of comebacks all season long they have but I think with this team right here in particular uh this Miami team theyve really done a great job of contesting but then uh on the defensive glass they have not allowed Pitt any second chance opportunities that they have shut down Hinson and Burton those are the two leading scorers for Pittsburgh and in this second half they nothings coming easy right on cue Burton rejected at The Rim by North Chad omear and the key thing again kept possession for his team on the other end cant get it to go tons of contact no call incidental near still Tangled Up they are still down so four on four of Cummings Cashes in Pittsburgh takes advantage of the four on four opportunity and just like that its a two possession game wow Applause more contact Burton and Wong nothing called pack Fades away most of the action happening off ball right now but theyve been consistent I think thats the key word these recipes theyve had been consistent its been a physical game you know going to the hole theres going to be contact so you better be strong with the ball Cummings wasnt strong there lost it gets it back thought about a three shot clock did not reset five seconds to shoot and Burton called for an offensive foul Jamar is burning cant believing I believe he lowered his shoulder into Nigel pack lets see right here yeah again thats thats easy again he kind of threw his body into him its one thing if they were already together but he went and initiated the contact and I think thats why the call was Bob Music his team leading by six will step aside as well this is going to be a fun finish Music at Buffalo Wild Wings the deals dont stop buy one get one half off Wing Tuesdays buy one get one free boneless Thursdays and Wing bundles from 999 only at Buffalo Wild Wings Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen oh my God Mom no keeping my eyes on the road is paying off with driveways boring DriveWise from Allstate and save for avoiding Mayhem this game means so much winner gets to hang a banner regular season ACC Champions the number one seed in the ACC tournament even if you didnt know those things just watch how these two teams are playing the intensity the physicality you know that they are leaving it all out on the floor long rejected from behind itll be pitfall two wellcoached teams and two teams executing at a high level on the defensive end again we talked a lot about their offense Ive been impressed with this in this game both teams defensively have been silent Hinson thats a deep three got it Blake Henson from the parking lot cuts the lead in half uh theres logo range and then theres half court range that one was almost at the half court mark my goodness one possession game CC on the line Juan wants it he gets it lines up a three cant connect offensive rebound Poplar oh Applause Poplar is red hot five for five from three missed play up on the other end Miami popper that would have taken the roof off you could not ask for a better look what a beautiful play Wong with the pass uh to pack and then the extra one the crowd has been standing for the last 10 possessions savandy trying to quiet the crowd draws the foul its on the floor Applause and this right here that is a deep three by Blake Henson and then on the other side Poplar uh he really I think has been of the story of this game he has provided a nice offensive boost for this Miami Club hit shooting one and one in the bonus the rest of the way Applause Music Poplar five for five from three before that recent miss all 15 points have come from Deep and Jay thats why both these teams are so dangerous its not just one guy they have great balance in particular when they go to their bench for some of their complimentary players uh their ability to score and make plays when the stars are not having a great game Applause Hinson all over Miller dangerous Lefty trying to muscle it got it to pack who misses zeleia bounces out to Wong Poplar wide open again hes missed two in a row but North attack Applause Poplar steals it away no foul so Pitt will get the basketball Applause the fans right behind us are livid but there was no foul call after Poplar had stolen it away I think theyre calling it incidental contact again yeah he just again from that angle there it looked like they were just both going for the ball and he left stepped on Hensons foot originally I thought he got a little hip Tech but in that instance there it looked like he stepped on his foot and lost his footing so Bandy way too much on it thats an airball pack in attack mode foul called that was Pitts last foul to give Big Time Players show up in Big Time games door Chad omear doing just that hes got his case up by six for a couple of these nor Chad OMeara has impacted this game on both ends of the court in particular uh on the defensive and offensive blast hes got a double double 15 points 12 boards three of them offensive and Jim Lear calls him uh one of the best rebounders he has ever seen and hes seen a lot of basketball Coachella thats High Praise battle for the ball so Dandy has it all the way to the rim misses the layup itll stake its way Applause 34 to go six point game finishing up on omir in Arkansas State transfer who has proven hes a power five player this season coach Al Compares him to Kenneth Fareed I love that comment absolutely spot on with that one but this right here also spot on Blake Henson he is willing Pittsburgh back into this game thats his fifth three and he is so tough to match up with because of his quick release and hes been on his threes out of bounds underneath beautifully executed by hit one possession game Poplar the answer its good foreign Applause Music Applause Music again if hes standing still that fine but hes throwing his body in uh to the defensive player toppler getting it done on both ends a star being born on the final day of the regular season Ruger Poplar 18 points on six main threes hes been a handful for Burton on the defensive end and theyre going to take a look at this now again I dont think theres much there he basically is trying to get position of what jamarius Burton needs to do is Seal in that situation again Poplar is fronting him thats fine you dont get the initial postentry pass reverse it to the top of the key and then youll have a seal but hes trying to create space by throwing his body into them but is there anything flagrant I dont think so I think hes just trying to get establish post position video Music common foul Miami up six 245 to go when these two teams met at the end of January they led by eight with two minutes to go it ended on an 11nothing run they would have to find similar magic here yeah and I think its going to start obviously on this end right here the rebounding continues to be an issue uh for Pittsburgh and this game Applause Abby 13 off rebounds Applause created 25 Second Chance points Burton not giving Doppler an inch 10 seconds to shoot heres Wong hes been really quiet today only nine points fading away off the window no good Amir an offensive rebound but he could not tiptoe and stay in bounds hit ball well when I asked Jim learonega what makes a norchado mirror such a good rebounder he said he is Relentless in his pursuit of the ball almost came up with another offensive rebound right there foul Falls Music reach in on Nigel pack and he knew right away thats not a good foul obviously uh Pittsburgh very good freethrow shooting team uh you do not want to put them on the line in that situation one and one Pittsburgh 10 and 13 from the line today Applause Burton an 84 foul shooter on the season he has been clutched time and time again for this pit team Applause missed it still a fivepoint game with two minutes to play the ACC on the line Applause look at this matchup right here Burton uh verse Wong thrown away miscommunication for Miami a costly turnover ball back to pit and thats all set up again Jay Federico Federico does a great job hedging on ball screens able to stop and slow down uh the person coming off the screen and then recover Burton in attack mode kicks it out Savannah three short Juan rips it away but Burton gets it back Jamie lucky says Burton had his foot on the end line so its Miami ball you cant ask for a better look again jamarius Burton dribble Drive kick out to sabandi hes wide open Applause again if youre Jeff Capel in that situation youll live with that offensive possession thats a wide open look each team with two timeouts it certainly doesnt have to foul here they can play this possession out and Jay we saw Miami and shooter Im working on this scenario right here uh being prepared for a pit to go full court pressure shot clock under 10 Miller on the move splits the double team and draws the foul with a minute and three seconds left in regulations its Jordan Miller headed to the foul line against Miami ISO uh theyre just break off their offense they like that match up with Jordan Miller matched up against Henson uh they go ice put him on the wing let him go one on one 78 percent foul shooter on the season nothing but the bottom of the net Jay I think he is a guy Jordan Miller uh yes Isaiah Wong Nigel pack omir those guys have been really good but I think hes kind of The X Factor guy before this Miami team Applause timeout Pittsburgh with exactly one minute remaining trailing by seven Jeff tables team has not made a basket in two minutes and 32 seconds and its allowed Miami to separate themselves at the end of this game well the balance that they have uh Isaiah Wong not a great game today to his standards nine points one to nine from the floor but back to my earlier point about Jordan Miller 15 points eight boards three assists and we it feels like we dont talk about him as much as we probably should no youre right and he is a very good he does a little bit of everything for this Miami team but uh well go Poplar yeah his threepoint shooting ability in this game I think that was the difference thus far made threes for the sophomore out of Philadelphia only a 38 threepoint shooter on the season he made the first five he took Music and sometimes when a game plan is all right we gotta stop long pack Miller and omir okay well let Wooga Poplar beat you and he did and thats why again I think Miami is a team that I would not be surprised to see them deep in the NCAA tournament the balance that they have uh yes they have long yes they have a Nigel pack but what do you do with guys like Jordan Miller I think also Joseph and Beverly were huge in this game uh Off the Bench uh for a Jim liranega so again they have beef a roster uh still though plenty left in this game a minute uh theyre up seven now I think for Pittsburgh you have plenty of time you dont necessarily need a three in this situation right away but you got to get into your offense quick and you do need the score cant take too much time off the clock Burton almost traveled there 10 seconds has already come off the clock so Dandy much needed bucket Nike sabandi delivers full court pressure on double team Miller in trouble and thats a pushoff Jordan Miller called for an offensive foul its Pit Boss a easy call to make again he just loaded the shoulder great job of trapping in the corner thats the last place you want to go if youre Miami yeah you go to the dead corner right there Pitt does a great job of trapping and yeah thats easy I mean thats an easy call to make he extended his arm and pushed off uh you must know in that situation you cannot catch the ball that deep in the corner Jim larenega has taken a timeout so each team with one timeout remaining in the final 44 seconds of Regulation Miami leads by five but its pit basketball the Hurricanes team that has had such an impressive season 236 could very well be the number one seed in the ACC tournament if they hold on to this lead but in the games theyve lost they bled in every single second half and its surprising again with their experience uh thats really a surprising number to have that many games where theyve LED and theyve given up leads so again right now plenty of ball left same thing I like Pittsburghs last possession you dont necessarily need to settle for a three you got to get into your offense quick Hinson fires the three too much on it one to rebound Applause Miami inches closer to the ACC regular season title Vincent down the lane cuts it to five Music Jeff Capel uses his final timeout 273 left fivepoint game well a couple things but if youre Pittsburgh you must have somebody back playing safety of that previous play for Miami uh they beat them up the court with the long pass nobody back playing safety so they got a wide open dunk Miami on the other end you cannot catch the ball in the dead corner but you must give yourself some space to operate and then when you catch it you must be strong with the ball either step through or find somebody cutting because you know Pittsburghs going to trap and trying to force another turnover now the balance scoring for Miami has been impressive today but all season long theyre one of only two teams in the country with four players averaging at least 13 and a half points per game and today Doppler Miller omear theyve led the way in pack and Wong have chipped in with nine balanced scoring and again thats what you want as a coach its not just one guy on any given night uh they can have somebody whether its somebody coming off the bench or one of their starters go off and have really good games confused who do you want at the foul line here if youre the Hurricanes well and thats one of the good things about this Miami Team all their wings and guards are really good free throw shooters if youre pit if omir is out on the court hes the one guy I think you want to try to get the ball in his hands and file him immediately Music lets see how Pittsburgh winds up again you have to be mindful of any Home Run play if Miami tries to throw it over the top and get somebody going down the other end Miami trying to cling to a win that would make them the number one seed in the ACC tournament theyd get to hang a banner here at the watsco center for being the regular season cochampions with Virginia 273 seconds separates them from history Juan the inbounder ONeill in trouble bounces it off Federico Federico smartly Jeff Capel all over Tim Fogarty puts his arm around him and they will take a review I thought omir cleanly got it off Federico Federico but lets take another look yeah that right there it looks like it went off Federico Federico lets take another look from a different angle again you cannot catch the ball that dead in the corner yeah that but again that right there looks like it hits Federico and then bounces back on the line again Music cant tell if his foot was out yeah that right there again from that angle and Lester calling him out of bounds where his foot came out of bounds but it doesnt look like it gets there and then it bounces off Federico Federico I think its going to stay Miami ball and you need indisputable evidence to overturn the call on the floor the call on the floor was Miami ball yeah and I think Isaiah Wong missed somebody running long again there was nobody back playing safety its there you just got to throw it with conviction make sure okay that it goes out there so only your guy can go and get it I think theyll have it a chance if Pittsburgh winds up in that same alignment I think Miami will have a chance to run somebody long and see if you can get either a layup or run a little bit more clock Miami ball its burned no timeouts remaining Miami has one and they also have a fivepoint lead Applause Applause so everybody up for a pit into Nigel pack and he stepped on the line its Pitbull that time pack did step on the line hes saying he was pushed take another look yeah thats two great defensive plays of Ford Pitt this time resulting in a turnover the Panthers have life now can they cash in 20 seconds left down five Henson hes a big shot taker oh and hes a big shot maker twopoint game 13 seconds ago this ACC regular season title is coming down to the final seconds you cant play better defense Isaiah Wong is there hes fading away Im not even sure he started off looking at the basket again hes connected with him he just turns and fires and knocks down a three now on the replay was his foot on the line yeah because they rolled it a three hard to tell from that angle I think we were blocked from Isaiah Walker heres a good look yeah yeah so instead of a twopoint game this would be a threepoint game and if youre Miami youll take any cushion you can get remember the Hurricanes lost at the buzzer exactly a week ago to Florida State they have led for this entire second half the key thing is inbounding the ball theyve had issues of the last two possessions uh inbounding the ball theyre trying to run a Nigel pack on a little wheel cut to get him the ball I think they got to try to get somebody running either over the top or get him till hes coming to the basket or coming back to the ball thing is you must inbound the ball and you cannot turn it over if youre Miami in this situation on the other end a pit again theyre not face guarding theyre actually playing on the side key thing is you just dont want to get beat long and give up an uncontested layup Miami used its final timeout so both teams with no timeouts remaining for the remainder of regulations the scoreboard still says 7876 but I thought Jamie lucky was over at the monitor they should have overturned that two and two Music it was clear as day that his foot was on the line and yet our scoreboard still says 7876 yeah thats actually huge long the inbounder no timeouts in trouble finally gets it into omear costly seconds ticking off this clock finally the foul comes in with 93 I cannot believe they let that three stands yeah I mean his foot was clearly I mean thats not even a debate well his foot was clearly on the line and Im not sure how they did not uh overturn that unless theres an issue with the scorekeeper but that clearly was a two wow Applause oh near misses the front end Pittsburgh with a chance to tie Or Win It no timeouts Hinson no good Miami heads on the Miami Hurricane
