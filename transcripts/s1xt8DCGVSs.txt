toughen things out here I think he seems to be a quick healer he absolutely does Hubert Davis told us he has responded from ankle injuries unlike anyone that hes ever seen in the past especially for a guy that wears a size 18 shoe just an 18 at 6 11 the senior now we are set to get things underway here inside the KFC Yum Center which when it gets rocking and rolling as it has in some amazing games over the years its one of the loudest buildings in all of college basketball it absolutely has a name white out for the cards here today but a lot of Carolina blue sprinkled in this area Ellis on a tough Drive gets the first basket the senior he is missed her goto averaging 17 and a half and Ellis had a career high year ago with 25 points against North Carolina in the same game on this court so hes looking to be aggressive today those guys picked off by trainer in transition right back loved with the theft and this is Caleb love he has to attack the basket this is one of the things that Hubert Davis has talked to Caleb love about that Dennis love has talked to Caleb love about and frankly Ive talked to Caleb love about go to the basket get to the free throw line see the ball go through dont rely solely on your jump shot in the entire game this is a building filled with love it is filled with love theres a lot out of love in the building today at least 20 plus friends and family members for Caleb love in the building Applause was 78 foul shooter theres Dad Dennis who mom Alicia went over and talked with them early today and first thing Dennis said was hes going to the basket today true to the word he did right away this is a homecoming for Caleb the Junior from St Louis if you look at the starting five there for Louisville that does not include Brandon Huntley Hatfield the 610 sophomore hes out with an injury today yeah David Withers getting into the lane do you see the second attack in the basket James unable to finish but David Withers getting back into the starting lineup after coming off the bench the last three games Carolina also going with puff Johnson his second career start heres El Mondo with the touch in the paint strong the tip wont go off the fingertips to Puff Johnson Obi the first thing youd look at to see does he have that explosion and the answer is no on that first jump rope for bacon on the drive Ellison will draw the foul hit by RJ Davis and so Ellis the senior from Durham North Carolina will go to the line well chat with Hubert Davis North Carolina head coach today and I said whats your state of mind right now at this point in the season 116 are unranked hes set up ticked off thats what I am thats exactly what he is and Hubert is a fiery competitor has been that way his entire career as a player as a coach the one the best people to ever meet off the floor but once he steps between those four lines he is a fiery competitor he wants that same level competitiveness in the guys in light blue tonight so hes not a coach alive who doesnt still burn deep inside the way they did is a plate well oftentimes its even worse as a coach and one one because its part of your livelihood your job depends upon it thats one thing but also because you cant control what your guys do on the floor love Zips the pass in the corner long and on the way by black that wont fall and the rebound picked off by Ellis whos the only double figure scorer for Louisville so as he goes they go Curry pounding inside all that Supreme rule by the big guy not necessarily the tallest player at 6A thats a big body though although hes slimming down it absolutely is a big body and hes skilled big body youre talking about a young man who averaged 23 points and 10 rebounds his last three games the regular season a year ago starting to find that production once again he can really be explosive straight on Johnson that wont drop Louisville not a good shooting team typically well when you tune 15 I guess it goes without saying 06 in the conference they dont make many threes but if they get to the line theyll make their foul shots second effort third effort here that was not a penetration cant finish it and a rebound ripped down by puck Johnson Obi I can tell you right now Huber Davis has fired up as RJ Davis knocks down the three in transition Hubert Davis was fired up about the fact that North Carolina gave up that offensive Rebound in that last possession Im not sure whos coming out but he immediately went to Seth Trumbull to get somebody out of the game Louisville began the season by dropping their first nine in a row right now theyre on a sixgame losing skin but as Corey mentioned at the top theyve been better here at home last time you and I were here they barely lost to Syracuse long jumper wont drop here for trainer you can see Armando baycott with a visible limp running up and down the floor interesting to see how that ankle holds up as this game wears on Sydney Curry will have no empathy whatsoever up top wide open its love hes going to drive it hes been settling for a lot of long jumpers but that time going strong and once again and he wouldnt have been wrong for taking that three but in my opinion its more important for him to see the ball go through the basket early staying aggressive and allowing the defense to know he is going to be in attack mode certainly can 34 points against Alabama Rangers score overtime game oh downtown Applause that is exactly you know Ive got a Ive got a degree in lip reading thats exactly what he said when he looked up the best Ive ever heard ever seen when it comes to reading lips you should work for the FBI oh no love with a triple no one too strong and Ellis with the board Ellis from North Carolina going to be super aggressive and you see him getting out of transition theyll be guys that grow up in the state of North Carolina when they see Carolina blue it brings out the best of them and weve seen that early but L Ellis the three ball and hes letting Dave OBrien know Im him meanwhile LL is the senior for Louisville have scored eight of their ten and adds another one there as an assist on the basket to Curry as well so hes been the offense hes been the guy early and you see now Louisville with the full court pressure Kenny Payne told us pregame that one of the things theyre doing a lot more of is mixing up their defense is trying to keep opponents off balance and we see the pressure right now theyre also trapping ball Springs much better dribble swings for the corner freshman out of Wisconsin getting some early minutes had a chance to shoot there didnt take it love looking in bacon has been gimpy early on spinning here and hes going to get blocked found a shot clock rolls down to zero OB we got a Richmond on Richmond battle down there Roosevelt wheeler out of John Marshall High School in Richmond going up against the Big Brother Armando baycott both these guys know each other well work out together in the summertime and seeing them go at it here on the ACC Hardwood now wheeler at 6 11 same height as Armando the AllAmerican candidate so on the turnover Louisville gets it back on top 117 Ellis with a quick step no bake off with a rebound Armando averaging 11 a game and thats a nice kick ahead its a simple thing but its a nice kick ahead to allow leaky black to get in a good spot unable to knock it down but Caleb love a underrated passer is being more aggressive in this game but also looking to facilitate Louisville coming off an 8370 loss at Clemson the accs number one James with the Stop and right now certainly the Cardinals at 215 it looked like a much sharper team Kenny Payne also told us one of the ways that theyve been able to utilize Mike James in the post we see him with a big bucket there and right now Louisville operating very well on both ends of the floor Johnson got a pretty good look rebound coming straight Ellis hes going to push it theyre on a seven nothing run knocked Away by black and so the Cardinals will maintain possession Kenny Payne year number one fair to say that he knew it was going to be tough under the circumstances its been even tougher here it has been even tougher and a lot of that simply because Kenny Payne could not go out and really get the transfers he couldnt get the recruits necessary based upon the fact that there still was an NCAA investigation looming over the program that by the way took five years to be figured out but now that that is clear Kenny Payne his staff of course if you talk about players one of the best apps youre going to find youre talking about National Champion Danny Manny Nolan Smith it doesnt get any better than this group and they are going to hit the recruiting Trail very hard this spring now the city coaching staff has some rings just an understatement yes Ellis nice feed and heavy traffic Withers could not connect I should say it was wheeler could not get it to go and I like this lineup for North Carolina especially if youve got a healthy baycot put moving leaky black to the Floor position the three guards on the floor he carried it and a turnover on Armando just does not look like he has his Agame for obvious reasons but the question becomes for North Carolina are you better with a 50 Armando than you are without having him at all I believe the decision was were better with 50 but it was a Mondo bacon that made this decision Huber Davis gave him the option it was all that Mondo making his decision to play here today Applause Ellis right past black who tried to recover and a foul the thing about the point guard for Louisville they have a lot of problems as a team you know youre not 215 for nothing but he is one quick point guard he absolutely is and El Ellis was born to score he has really been in a completely different role this year when you look at his numbers the way that he started off nine points already for him only four for the remainder of the team but he has been aggressively attacking the painted area knocked down the 13 but you see he keeps both feet in the paint and thats where hes best when hes being aggressive also times he can find and facilitate to his teammates leaky black with the second foul DeMarco Don the sophomore on a Tucson will make an appearance here done a guy missed the first five games or missed five games with a broken bone in his left hand but he played a lot of minutes against Virginia the other night played 22 minutes yeah you know Huber Davis really looking for more defensive lineups and again you talk about this lineup now with the four guards on the floor around Bangkok they should really be able to get after defensively Music love got a lot of attention trimbled and a push here wheeler trying to contain bacon and hell pick up his first personal 1308 to go in the half and OB you know we talked about about him on the bay cop but we also have to mention that North Carolina playing without another start of Pete Nance not available now really for what would be his third game only played the first couple of minutes against wake four so hes been out dealing with the back issue its not healing as quickly as theyd like thats a travel RG Davis so theyll give it up again and four turnovers for the Tar Heels theres Pete Nance transfer from Northwestern has not played over the last couple of games 116 rebounds so they miss him too they absolutely miss him now Jalen Washington gave them great minutes against Virginia looking forward to seeing the young guy get his opportunities here with this is almost like a homecoming game for Washington as well from Gary Indiana so again hes hes got a few fans here Im sure today as well good to see the young man getting a chance that was a breakout performance against Virginia 13 Music back to lands forcing the issue and throws it away Love Will Lead it hes got done on a wing cant get it to go bacon does though with the slam now I can see that out of bay caught some explosion right there to be able to get up off the floor and finish that if he lays that up most likely gets blocked knowing that hes got to dunk that to get the bucket nine double doubles for Armando Ellis gives up the dribble James and stripped with a foul well the youngster tremble will pick up number one back to that transition a moment ago hey Caleb love with the steal attacking James James does a good job defensively standing his ground but Armando baycott continues to be aggressive his first bucket but hes done a great job on the glass already in this game the really good sign for North Carolina even though his play has been choppy is he has not come out of the game in about eight minutes well and when youre dealing with the injury Obi the problem is when you come out of the game thats when it stiffens up thats when it gets tight so youve got to put a lot of time and work in to be able to keep the ankle loose and Bay County picks up another rebound as long as he stays out of foul trouble I believe Huber Davis will continue to allow him to go the problem then becomes what do you do at halftime how do you keep it warm he comes out High love off for Davis back underneath to the big guy in the slam and thats classic for Carolina it absolutely is and the reason why is because Kevin Love accepted the Trap and once he gets rid of the basketball now at that point Louisville is in scramble mode they forgot about the best score in the ACC Curry to the paint had it knocked away for a second he retained possession and its going to stay on the sound yeah so 11 36 to go here in the first half Louisville playing pretty good basketball early on they have a 1511 advantage on the North Carolina Tar Heels so a timeout North Carolina averaging 80 points a game that is number one in the ACC didnt get anywhere near that against Virginia the other day they were held to 58 had four turnovers than they did assists in that game yeah for the first time in eight games for North Carolina doing that theyve been a team thats gotten better with having the basketball but again rarely do teams get their scoring average against Virginia anyways that part of it not that character on the characteristic but Armando baycott went into that game as the accs leading scorer but only played a minute in 18 seconds so when you take him out of the lineup you talking about a guy thats you know going to give you big time offensive production so North Carolina trying to cut into this Louisville lead here in a timeout at the KFC Yum Center good crowd here today A lot of North Carolina fans have made the trip from Chapel Hill as well and the big story of course is Armando baycat is in the lineup continue to be pretty well supported here when the fans do get here they make a lot of noise here in Louisville outside Dan Jay thank you very much we welcome you to the KFC Young Center here in Louisville Kentucky Dave OBrien Corey Alexander Angel gray with you North Carolina trying to make a run at Louisville who opened up a pretty good lead early on 1511 the Cardinals and of course the major Story coming into this game certainly for Carolina fans would Armando baycot who turned an ankle against Virginia the other night would he play would he start he started the game he started the game hes playing well early in his game and hes already got two buckets two dunks but Armando Bay cop playing with that sore ankle has been a little bit gimpy to start this one off he said he was going to push it hard in warmups to see how it felt was able to do some rehab early this morning said he felt good with no pain while he had no medicine and so you see Bangkok getting out in transition the offensive rebounds and the finish and then another dump so Armando baycott being productive regardless of the injury the AllAmerican candidate and North Carolinas number one alltime rebounder has six rebounds already and you made the point while we were waiting for the game in front of us to come to an end that you know hes not coming out of the game because thats when that angle will stiffen up a little bit and so Amando and Jeff Martin is having a quick conversation Wanda was a little bit demonstrative after the call didnt go his way last time but love to see the officials and the players sharing a laugh and get a chance to have a quick conversation well meanwhile the senior for Louisville is off to a very quick start Al Ellis who averages 17 and a half points a game he has 11 already hes taking charge yeah Ellis had a big time performance against North Carolina a year ago in this game and hes looking to top that exactly was a career high for him at the time Louisville at two and 15 and trying to snap a sixgame skit they opened the season with a nine game losing streak North Carolina unranked at 116 they were number one when the season got underway Curry nice give there for James and he cant dunk it boy right down the lane easy as it gets and quickly on the other end Davis will knock in two you know and its a small thing but by him missing the dunk and caught his teammates off guard and now theres no defensive balance getting back end up giving up a transition bucket so you know everything went bad on that possession for the cars so I dont know if Ive ever come in here to do a Carolina Louisville game and both teams were unranked and youve been here a lot to do Carolina Louisville game so thats saying a lot for you where theres nice follow after his own Miss bucket to make it 1713 mens has played much better basketball as of late we talked about Joshua from the state of North Carolina and whipped his life when they play against the University of North Carolina weathers from Charlotte wants to have a big performance as well Davis tried the window but came up empty caleblanc the sixth board Junior for North Carolina the guard is a native of the spine City Applause done with the swing Trimble will kick it out Davis gets a long look and it announced and a followup and in nicely done by DeMarco Don the sophomore getting some minutes early thats North Carolina basketball offensive rebounding right now three for both teams but North Carolina doing a better job of capitalizing what they get those opportunities turn them into Second Chance points sorry gives up the dribble up top for Ellis under 10 minutes to go here in the first half long jumper way downtown wont drop for Withers Amanda Bakers gonna have double figure rebounds here in his first half OB grabbing everything coming off the rim love tough angle yeah another one there has it knocked out of play all right Ive got a big time womens basketball doubleheader coming your way tomorrow on ESPN number one South Carolina hosting Missouri at one Eastern followed by a showdown in the triangle between NC State North Carolina both games on ESPN and the ESPN app you know what I love so much about the womens matchup between North Carolina and North Carolina State whats that in North Carolina they play at Carmichael and at NC State they play at rentals they play in the real traditional Arenas that these two programs built their tradition on whistle here with nine 20 to go in the first half wait a minute arent you doing that game tomorrow so you know even better than I do thats a great basketball place I love Floyd Music he cant connect thank you leading by two fellas to the Baseline trainer heavy traffic but two but L Ellis attacked the basket and keeping his eyes up looking to find ways to help his teammates it was him being a scorer early now becoming much more facilitated Applause Davis thought about the three bacon on the high post Applause Armando in a touch shot clock at five out of the double move the ball very well and the youngster drives it made the shot on a tough tough Drive but its going to be an offensive great ball Movement by the Tar Heels however even better defensive positioning by Jalen weathers to get outside of the restricted area get his body set Our God Roger Ayers right on top of it the right call and of course Kenny Payne loves it who was standing right beside Ayers making the call alongside so Louisville by four and the ball hello series taking about double the shots of any teammate on the Cardinal roster lands that wont fall in and tipped out by Louisville Kobe as you mentioned L Ellis and his field goal attempts one thing that you have to also throw in Elvis rarely comes out of the game hes a guy that you know Kenny Payne most likely as long as theres no no foul trouble and this one hell probably go 40 on this on this floor and for more on Ellis lets bring an angel foreign Applause gets that one and hell be at the line as he draws the foul stayed right with it curry with foul number two and the timeout just under eight minutes to go in the half Team 17 the bill Music Nuts schedule is for me to go to that museum it was unbelievable it literally blowed it was I was mind blown and you can just see him oozing with confidence a true champion of change but my favorite area guys was where you can get in the ring and box a little bit my right hook is not the same as his but it was very cool to see how much he impacted not just his community but for everyone around the world uh oh angel I got to go back a third time because see I I was here coaching the Louisville Kentucky Derby Festival back in 2017 and we went with the group and I didnt have enough time to spend so I went back afterwards but I didnt know I could get in the ring in box with was it virtual no its not a virtual you can get in have to take your shoes off of course to get in honestly it was more of a photo shoot for me I had the boxing gloves on I was able to take a couple of dabs but it was really cool to just see so many different types of footage from him and his fights and you get the pictures too oh absolutely Bob Johnson will pick up the foul here it was 7 36 to go in the half Armando baycott has been able to play here in the first half starting the game that was very much in doubt and Obi if youll notice Jalen Washington who would be the guy to replace Armando Baker in the lineup on the floor alongside bacon oh Baker length of the floor at that time for two but you notice the lefthand layup now baycott is a guy who jumps better off of his right foot if hes going one foot off his right foot dunking with his left hand then he would be at the traditional way for a righthander but the right foot that right ankle is the one that hes spraying against Virginia and you notice they lay up not a dunk on the break Ellis will acquire and theyre going to say no that is going to be an offensive foul on Ellis Roger Ayers waving off the bucket kicking out yes and Alice is in a State of Shock and I think Kenny Payne wonders about it too but they wave it off well weve got one the best in the business and hes rarely wrong and I can tell you right now watch this left leg well with the right leg actually both of them kicking out and it is Ellis that initiates that contact and again not a popular call here at the KFC Yum Center with a nice Town underneath to get forgive me make Austin have a double double in the first year of this game a great sign for the Tar Heels and they have surged into the lead 2219 Ellis has passed does make it out for James heres Withers he cant stick it Washington with the rebound much more traditional North Carolina lineup on the floor now as Washington who is capable of shooting that three nice sweeping Movement by Buck Johnson like puff made aggressive attacking the basket not just solely reliant on his threepoint shooting as well but Hubert Davis is animated on the sidelines you can tell hes coaching with that chip on his shoulder that hes talking about meanwhile bacon already with that DoubleDouble 11 to 10 Applause the game just about how he seems to be Bionic Man when it comes to bouncing back after injuries and she told me she knew very early on that he was built different when he was four years old he taught himself how to ride his bike he came in the house with a bloody lip he rinsed his mouth and went back out to ride again she said hes better than me but he got it from me and we could tell why now Corey because shes rehabbing right along with him absolutely shes tough as Nails as well Washington straight on to get paid God for that one got it for me I love that William respond there are just some athletes swim up high tolerance for pain you know higher than most and hes been through some things this season I mean his shoulder now the ankle continues to play through it yeah and again I can tell you you know from perfect personal experience she was not the mom to Baby her son of course Armando has worked out with me and not trained him since he was in the seventh grade but he I would get those phone calls from Christy saying your boy is not going to make it today and Im like whats going on he didnt do his homework and so and she was always about the academics first first and foremost and again she was never babying him even though she does call him buggy and you know say thats personal information hes not going to be happy that Ive been out there but good hes hes too big to be called booger though were not doing that like how youre getting yourself in a deep hole here thats wonderful well the thing is she wont know about it until after were gone here today I have to deal with it later you can make your Escape explain it later 5 36 to go and Armando of course had such a great career number one alltime rebounder at Carolina Applause love back into the game and it went cast out of play by Carolina went back to that injury just a minute 18 into the game on Tuesday in the loss to Virginia and he left this game on crutches yeah you see him going after then left ankle coming down on Reese beekmans foot and Huber Davis said himself after seeing him after that game walking out of the Arena on crutches he felt like there would be no participation for bacon in this game while here at 508 it was the right angle remember that he hurt the four overtime lost Alabama thats the same one he rolled in the final four yeah it was and this was the left one but now you see baycott picking up that second foul so we talked about him continuing to play throughout this first half and now hes going to have to take his seat and Wheeler to the line good opportunity to look at the numbers 17 and half points per game and thats with having a zero at Virginia he was leading the ACC in scoring going into that game at well over 18 points per game but now were going to have to set the remainder of this one going to be interesting to watch how much attention they give that ankle even over this four minutes on the five minutes remaining on the bench Davis on the move bouncing underneath Washington got three for two nice five for Davis to Washington and Washington recognizing he had a lane going quickly to the basket instead of trying to gather at Duncan getting it on the glass before it can get blocked Carolina with their starting backward back in there Caleb love whos out of St Louis theres a lot of friends and family here Lance will swing for trainer wheeler pounding his way inside but left it short rebound batted free to Carolina Applause nice five wide open love got a great look big rebound by Don UN strong inside and knocked Away by Louisville yeah but I love the fact that Caleb love RJ Davis both walking to each other dapping each other up that was a great find from Davis to love love who missed the shot went to RJ said my bad but Id like to see these two guys doing that this is a great find to recognize the teammate behind you thats one that Caleb love would love to have back once again North Carolina A little sloppy on the inbounds love was looking to cut one way and a pass went the other way Obi this is an important stretch right here without baycott on the floor finishing this half will be important and those two guys in our screen right there love and Davis will be the guys that they have to rely on to try to get them into this halftime lock room maintaining a lead Applause train went to hand off got it to land under four minutes to go in the half Applause is James to lock one up there cant stick it Applause love strong and knocked away but a whistle too again lands for that personal North Carolina now on top by five 2621 here the first half at the KFC yup Center it really does it really does work that way 2721 glove off the iron North Carolina trying to pick up their 12th Victory theyve really been one of the great mysteries of this college basketball season Carolina fans would probably use a different phrase than that well and we also have to think about the fact that you know North Carolina on the road they have not been good this year they had a lead at Virginia last time out the nine point lead in the first half but unable to really finish that first half off itll show us something that coach Davis has talked about has done comes up with a big block right there on the three DeMarco done some good minutes he really is four rebounds one Witnesses a career high already in this oh Davis yeah plenty of contact there as he hits the deck and it draws the foul hey we have a double header on super Tuesday starting with sunflower showdown in Manhattan Kansas taking a KState and then Georgia visiting Kentucky all starts in Tuesday 7 Easton on ESPN and the ESPN app and technique coming off an impressive victory at Tennessee very impressive victory at Tennessee after losing at home to South Carolina so Kentucky playing a little Jacqueline Hyde right now of course tensions a little high in Lexington going to be interesting to see with that game how that game is but Georgia comes to town and what type of you know reception that the Wildcats get on their home floor if Georgia could be tough the good 12 wins Applause so Davis smooth at the line thats a 142 run now for the Tar Heels Who start to open up a bit and more importantly theyre doing it with baycott on the bench and trying to finish off this first half this is where things faulted for them earlier in the week Huber playing a lot of guys trainer nowhere to go there shot clock inside 10 wither is spinning heavy traffic and hell go tomorrow that was an impressive move Obi Kenny Payne told us previously when you watch Jalen Withers make certain plays the only thing you can ask is why dont you do this all the time youre talking about six foot nine the ball handling ability to be able to go against a very good defender in Caleb love and the strip to finish at The Rim finishes off the threepoint play do it more consistently David with us we know you have that ability the average is eight points per game hes 43 Beyond a threepoint line on that topic that one wont go for love analysts will bring it across now for the Cardinals were going to stay attached here down by five only two threepoint field goals made in this game this game both these teams struggling from Beyond The Arc pullup shot thatll roll in nice feathery tucks there by Lands Louisville not going away here not at all and this is the issue for North Carolina can you finish this half can he pay going to the zone wheeler with the foul and brown was looking for a clean block on that play Music 156 to go in the half Styles will be at the line RJ Davis does the right thing getting inside the painted area as Styles goes up and great call there that is all across the arm no basketball on that one Jeff hardness right under the basket with a great look Applause really good crew here led by Roger Ayers of course all right nice and Jamel Spearman as well and on the floor officiating here at the KFC Yum Center and styles who did not play against Virginia Music getting minutes here makes it 3026 thats one of the areas where Huber Davis is trying to be able to get this team to develop is having some guys coming off the bench getting them production and right now you got three reserves on the floor thats going to be a travel as Elvis goes down on his rear end could have made it 43 showing in the half and you never want to turn the basketball over but in comparison to L Ellis on his way down throwing the basketball trying to get rid of it and leading to a five on four in the other direction for North Carolina he holds on to it you take a travel but youre allowed to set your defense set up this Zone and try to have a strong defensive stand Washington and a whistle crowd howling put another foul here against the Cardinals Applause some one of the traveling violations this one goes against lands and well put Washington to the line for North Carolina played 27 minutes in the Virginia game on Tuesday his previous high was six minutes its the first nine games of the knee injury and all sorts of knee problems in high school a couple of different surgeries one to correct the surgery they didnt go well the first time up here in North Carolina is still one of the top recruits in the country and Hubert Davis let it be known a year ago he felt like he was the best shooting big man available in high school basketball and hes happy that hes wearing the Carolina blue here for the Tar Heels as you mentioned a breakout performance for him against Virginia 13 points five and eleven from the field and starting to grow that confidence Gary Indiana unless stopped at the top shot clock down to seven tip pass stolen away by the Tar Heels they want to make a run at it middle of the stop remember the difference in turnovers Music thats the turnover you dont want the ones that lead to pick sixes on the other end of the floor styles on the other round with a slam so 45 seconds to go in the first half Ellis gives it up here for lands no whistle there well outside its trainer with a misfire will be Carolina ball here and Obi with a 2926 game Global was making a run one possession game but just like that North Carolinas been able to go on a 50 run and now an opportunity here to get a quality shot at the end of this half to extend that lead possibly to double figures the hills will take their time everybody Applause North Carolina fell behind early but they made a couple of long runs to take control here Applause Davis lost one up there and sticks it from threepoint land time for a he for Ellis gets it up there to well short and thats the end of the first half North Carolina opening it up a bit 3726 and Kenny Payne will not be happy with this team with that last possession when they get in the locker room you know the shot clocks going down RJ Davis has to let it fly still no defensive pressure thats by the cards but as you mentioned North Carolina was able to finish the half the right way with baycott on the bench with those two fouls Im sure thats something that Coach Dave was pleased about RJ Davis has the ball here to open up the second half he had 10 points in the first half and heres love trying to hit a long three Ellis with the push tiptoeing in and a bottle too the foul on Davis will send him to the line for threepoint play Ellis the senior once L Ellis got into transition and saw it was just RJ Davis back he knew exactly what was going to happen he was going to attack RJ Davis at his Mercy on that one reaching in and giving up the foul Angel you talked to Hubert Davis coming out at halftime yes and the first question that I asked him was about Armando baycotts production he said hey his heart his toughness his leadership were just lucky to have him but most importantly hes very impressed with their team defense you mentioned how they were able to limit Ellison his touches down the stretch he said we have to continue to continue to do that offensively cleaning it up and making the easy play not thrilled with the seven turnovers to start and of course Angel you were a point guard so you recognize how difficult it is to limit the touches of a guy who has the basketball on his hands did Coach Davis say exactly how they were planning to do that or any type of strategy he didnt he said it started with Team defense I was specifically asking who was going to have that matchup he said it all comes down to what all five players are doing on the floor Applause Johnson with the Finish although when you said turnover she visibly flinched as any point guard does right what are you talking about turnover I dont turn the ball over 3931 Carolina see Angel now with different type of swingers she was the point guard that was looking to get others involved I was the point guard that got others involved because I had a double team but it was a difference yes theres two different stories you know and thats why everyone loved me on the team you know everyone invited me over was a team player but you know what you also have your your name in the Raptors if you did something on your legacy I have no name in the Raptors but my teammates did love me because they all thought I was going to buy the mopeds when I went to the NBA but that never happened either Withers with the foul I love how both of you are totally convinced all of your teammates loved and adore me I didnt say that I think some of mine Im not going to go at all Im sure Im gonna get some text like I didnt love you hey Im sure all ageless teammates did love her though well of course naturally 4031 Music North Carolina at the line trying to pick up a road win a true Road victory here in Louisville today Louisville Owen six in the conference Bell is trying to get heated up you know he scored those 11 points with the first eight minutes or so and then they shut him down after that well a lot of attention play pay two well Ellison this is one of the issues for World well as Ellis comes up with the steal curry got it I love Sydney Curry being aggressive thats the thing and again he knows okay Im playing against the best big man in the ACC this is my opportunity for me to come out here and have a big time performance and again doing it against the best of the best The Wing by John Johnson remember what a strong game he had against Kansas in the national championship at 116 rebounds in that one you know be the only only the third threepoint field goal made for North Carolina in this game on the other side Louisville only made one so has it been a perimeter game for either of these teams and theyre shut down by Davis and stolen away on the sticky D laying that up man in and a nice drive there by leaky black and they open up the 4633 advantage largest lead today this is when this North Carolina team can become dangerous when youve got leaky black in the passing lanes turning defense into offense they become really scared Applause Music Davis draws the double Johnson again yes swishes that one in club starting to feel it right now RJ Dave was looking out for a teammate and UC with so much pressure being paid to Armando bake out on the interior someones going to get easy looks for North Carolina on the outside and its been about tough on the last couple of possessions RJ Davis finding Buck Johnson shooting it like his brother cam over there on the wing Music thoughts there by Louisville Cardinal players about Dr King in his incredible Legacy we celebrate MLK weekend Louisville on the attack no basket there Withers thought he had a hoop as well but hell be at the line foreign will be a nonshooting Armando baycott giving the thumbs up to Huber Dave was letting him know I have three fouls but Im okay keep me on the floor Sydney Curry gonna look to be in attack mode as he looks like Gabe caught a little bit of a shot curry in that time a foul to the line 618 to Fort Wayne Indiana but baycott was not okay as he picks up his fourth foul with new Curry would be aggressive thats the first thing benches tell you is you see a little bit of a shot there but Curry just as strong attacking baycott able to finish through the contact in the swipe now against bacon his fourth foul and hes going to have to have a seat not only for a very long time but also remember that ankle could stiffen up having sit down this long so a bit of an opening here for Louisville trailing 4935 Carolina with the ball Davis in for Washington and another whistle 1552 to go in this contest mod go to the bench 4935 North Carolina Music okay so were ducated citizen in America takes precedence over his identity as a basketball star and you can see that just across America how people are using their platform to do just that angel thank you very much North Carolina opens up the lead here on a couple of free throws from Jalen Washington The Freshman to make it 5135 North Carolina finding some separation right now this is the part of the game where Kenny Payne has talked to his team about continuing to fight his little miscommunication in the offensive in the floor ends up with another leaky black steel and a slam to boots we talk about North Carolina and win their most dangerous is when theyre up pressuring you can see 94 feet leaky black has the ability to change games on defensive end of floor but Caleb love also has that ability not allowing James to get to get get the basketball Withers taking the paint and hes denied and all the momentum belongs to North Carolina Davis and a whistle and I believe they got Jalen Washington for that foul I thought that was going to be foreigners in the ACC great denied position got the proper hand out and more importantly turning defense into offense and when North Carolinas getting easy baskets like that it builds with the momentum both sides of the floor you see guys where theyre getting after full court on the Pennsylvania a little hand check foul there for Davis and itll be his third Applause the Carolina really taking control of this one 5335 you need this guy the Cardinals do to really get hot again Ellis on the drive got it to go oh this is at his best leads to playing in taclo getting into the painted area not only looking for himself but can also find teammates as well love difficult angle and another whistle Applause Music so 14 44 to go hey Marquee events are the highlights of January on ABC Sunday the Spanish super Cup Final between Real Madrid and Barcelona then the conclusion of NFL Wild Card Weekend Cowboys and a Buccaneers on Monday and UFC 283 and Saturday the 21st all on ABC ESPN and the ESPN app what time is our game Monday we tip at seven you and I on acc Network Syracuse and Miami danger will be with us on this boat correct I hope so so a thumbs up from Angel yeah okay so just for the record I may not be available the second half because the Cowboys and Buccaneers are playing of course Im a diehard Cowboys fan so if you say something to me and I dont respond just go to Angel because uh they may be watching the football game so angel will make her endless debut in the second half I think thats worth staying right there on acc Network for it oh yeah Ill be there Ellis thats a difficult drive time youll be there in spirit theyll do their Spirit yeah Applause 5439 Carolina Applause Bay cop with a foul trouble remaining on the bench the playing through that ankle injury very bravely today Applause shot clock inside 10 glove with a pullup midrange shot and nothing but now Carl price under control and again once you make that initial move and you see Defenders waiting for you thats the best play in the game pull up through the midrange jumper knock it down in comparison to going over penetrating and picking up the charge Ellis again jumping into that lane rebound is up man and Roosevelt wheeler for two has shaken that hand afterwards well we got a lot of action going on that play Jalen Washington getting hit going down Ellis falls into the cameras but Ellis nice enough to help a young lady over there well you see the elbow from Ellis connecting with Washington in the forehead as Ellis goes into the cameras Washington goes down but L does get up and the young lady over there he was actually readjusted the focus I think oh yeah you know oh yeah you think else had that type of skill hes got some Talent man we might need to hire him as a camera then Applause itll be Cardinal ball and then Bangkok continues to get a rest here foul trouble is mentioned playing with Ford so OB no here comes the next question if North Carolina is able to maintain this lead theyre able to stay at 15 and you get to you know under eight under four minutes is Chuck Johnson is out of bounds so the basketball will go back from Louisville on this possession thank you to under eight you get to under four and you still got a 15 point lead but you just sit they caught the remainder of the game thats a great question you know why wouldnt you if youre in control at that point and youve got a game coming up next with Boston College to be a tougher opponent James slicing into the paint got his own missile in there I havent talked much about Mike James coming in with three straight games with 17 or more points and only three points in this one two for seven its like four points in this one two for seven from the field but again thats North Carolina paying attention to him as Caleb love unable to connect with the three but another offensive board with whos grabbing the rebound you hear the crowd trying to urge the Cardinals to climb back into this game is James again and stolen away by love Applause and its going to go the other way get out his credit getting back defensively getting his body in the right position to draw the offensive foul recognizing Kevin Love going to go to the euro absorb the contact squarely in the chest maintains possession for his team in his first foul love averaging 17 a game coming in to the KFC Yum Center you could tell that its been a conservative effort by the Tar Heels to wear down L Ellis theyre picking him up every time he gets the basketball making him extend a lot of energy throughout this game stripped again right back over to Carolina leaky black once again with great hands coming up with the Steal love wants to make a move done yes from threepoint land how about that trailer Club thats the guy I want to see for North Carolina being aggressive attacking and not always for hims opportunities to score to find his teammates as well finding done in the corner Applause were seeing an opening and a foul 11 51 to play here in the second half North Carolina by 16 Kevin Love off the balance a nice move but finding DeMarco done in the corner showing just a little love to a secret AAU program as one Caleb love and so many other superstars throughout the game right now and you know Brandon Miller at six foot eight handles the basketball like hes six foot can really shoot it as grown as a shooter improved in that part of the game but its playing great basketball for Nate Oates down in Tuscaloosa gave us out a double team in the backcourt North Carolina with a 5944 Advantage here in Louisville this is the scramble defensively that Kenny Payne has talked to us about and now going into a Zone trying to take some time away from North Carolina not allowing them to get a good look but RJ Davis having none of that yeah got a pretty good look all on his own didnt he he really did again get the basketball up and then relocating getting it back just tough individual defense trying to keep him in front Applause North Carolina has turned up the Jets as far as turnovers into points here about eight minutes into the game from that point theyve been dominating that 194 advantage of points off turnovers and thats the ninth steal for North Carolina in this game cable love has more leaky black has three in the seams and every time North Carolina gets one of those steals they take it to the other end of the floor so again these are the pick six turnovers that you dont like to have in basketball cant get your defense back cant get your defense set and give up an easy look to the opponents just picked up the foul number four so he will have to sit James at the line James has really been a hot hand in recent games coming up 17 against Clemson give me your thoughts on the Tigers so far I am looking forward to seeing the Tigers havent seen him in person but I know that Hunter Tyson is balling right now 2811 against Louisville last week and Hunter Tyson is tied with Armando baycott while coming into this game the bacon already got a double dope in the first half but both had nine double doubles on the season and again when you look at guys like Hunter Tyson like Kihei Clark the 50th leaky black the 50year guys making a impact for their teams Im sure so many coaches throughout this league happy that the NCAA granted that fifth covered year for some of these guys will be available long launching and a foul in the paint that will go against Washington 6346 only number three on Jalen Washington so the ACC preseason poll and the present top ten look at this comes in Miami Virginia to Miami losing earlier today Applause the Clemson the team that has always played great defense now to Brad Brunell they could really score it too Brad Brownell does not get the credit he deserves as a coach right now the front runner for ACC coach of the year but has been a great coach in this league for a very long time and as you mentioned known for always having a great defense but with the front court that they have with Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall may have the best front Court in the ACC right now Chase Hunter all the guards getting involved into action and again offensively theyre getting it done as well black with a dish on the Baseline Washington nearly threw it away another shot clock at 10 important minutes right now pavement glove at the point guard position as baycott gets set to come back in the game he has hit the scores table black gives it up heres done yes we have the shot clock one two thats the way you execute to Perfection at the end of the shot clock knowing that you have more than enough time to be able to get a quality look Ellis tried to answer couldnt do it again bacon ready to check back in DeMarco Dunn by the way with a career high 10 points previous high was seven against Notre Dame the ball now not to go the other way as Ellis hits the deck Music coming on so Washington picks up number four and Louisville have the basketball 9 28 to go Washington getting 15 minutes before fouls into the bench for Huber Davis oh a little bit of foul trouble for North Carolina Music RJ Davis also with those four fouls so North Carolinas been piling up the fouls and give backup back from the floor but only one for him see how aggressive he is Applause Johnson terrific pass underneath leads to a foul puff Johnson finding the open man lands will pick up foul number two and you never mind that pass from Puck Johnson as you see him catch but heres my problem whos guarding puff Johnson whos already made two threepointers in this second half from Beyond the threepoint line you get an opportunity to get the basketball into the hands of your best player at baycott who missed the first free throw so this most likely if anything becomes a one point possession where you pass up a wide open three now if you havent been making threes thats one thing but you made two of those old people you gotta let that fly sure the point shot has not been a big factor in this contest on either side as big Cod makes one of two okay the love coming up with his fifth steal in the game and an official whistle here at 8 56 to go yeah thats about the shot clock shot clock was at 18 seconds catching that off the Steal ing it back to 27 giving North Carolina more time to be able to find this the right look here on this offensive set love on the dribble nice off the window I like this game of Love or should I say I love this game of love 6948 on the drive the reverse no for Withers well bring it up now and bounce here for love and North Carolina in complete Command on the road here in Louisville loves jumper and it comes free here to Withers he wants to take his time with it Ellis senior denied and fouled however itll go against Dunn number one on DeMarco Dunn the sophomore from Tucson Arizona Shooters 75 percent Applause to Big Time recruiting job by Huber Davis you know how many Big Time universities and college basketball programs passed up on the way from Tucson North Carolina it not only the ones you pass up along the way but the one that you leave right at home to not go to Arizona thats no lie make a crosscountry trip Ill tell you what with Cuba Davis and the staff a lot of credit because DeMarco done as a guy that will be really good in this Carolina blue uniform for a long time okay Ellis with 20 well its been the case all season long for Louisville they cant find another scorer who could break into double figures on a regular basis hes all by himself yeah that score has been Mike James over the past few games but not here today big Cod sweet began draws to foul by Miller so North Carolina looking good 6950 here on the road today with DirecTV I can get live TV and ondemand together you take away Big 12 teams you take away ACC teams to put in Big Ten teams that all play the same style and go lose in the first round of the NCAA tournament you would think youll want more competitive games right sure I think they need to look at the ACC the big the big 12 and the SEC has stronger conferences simply because of the styles of play and what these teams do once they get to the tournament thats right look at recent ACC teams in the NCAA tournament that maybe werent anticipated to go all that deep in the NCAA tournament they do Bangkok grabs another rebound foreign job you wanted so badly after that comment but yeah that one Im applying for but uh and again I mean a lot of great college basketball programs in the Big Ten I dont fight that but to say 10 programs right now with the dish for John said is that sweet Applause sharing the basketball very well you mentioned in the open that this was a team that had more turnovers in the system that lost to Virginia where they right at the ship as far as handling the basketball in this well Louisvilles gone about seven minutes in between field goals Ellis usually the guy will stop a drought like that his Withers and he cant theyre gonna keep it alive whether its from the corner wont shoot it uh two foot dollar OB you got that look you got to take Music it swap play by Elvis knowing baycott has four fouls he cant foul that attacking the big guy and getting the easy bucket 7352 approaching the six minute Mark here at KFC Yum Center in a quiet Gathering here for Louisville fans did their best to try and close the gap but it was not to be thats going to be an offensive it can get a love for that one Music number two pop Johnson by the way is season I 12 points for Hubert Daviss team its a number of guys like Don did very well Styles has had some really nice minutes yeah Caleb loves numbers dont look great as far as you know hes shooting but outside of that hes had a big time impact on his game defensively five steals for him leaky black of course has been his great defensive self as always Curry pushes one up there but a misfire even if youre not here in the first half Armando Baker not only played but started the game and it felt like about seven minutes in he had a doubledouble yeah he really did and got off to a slow start but even with that was able to pick it up and a couple of dunks got him going and you could tell that he was going to be able to play on that ankle and not only just play but be very effective as well now lets lost the handle done out front of the pack and he will finish it with style now Im not sure who gets that steal if it was love who was defending Ellis or if it was leaky black Carolina these two guys are going to go over right now having a conversation Calebs gonna say thats mine leaky lake is going to disagree though Music B and Daisy Kelly playing great basketball and ending in you know for me Im not gonna say the same for Angel Graven we got to be careful because Daisy Kelly as soon as she sounds basketball shes picking up a microphone is built for this business right here I would definitely have to Curry has it poked away but a foul against Carolina it was with eight on the shot clock Music and number three on puff Johnson new Curry to the line hes the only Cardinal who shoots 50 percent or better from the field but only 58 percent at the foul line Applause foreign game against Florida a m at 19 he makes one of two Armando baycott with another rebound up Im Huber Davis right now and of course Im not hes a much better Coach than I but I would think about getting bacon off the floor at this point hes done his job takes a timeout so a timeout North Carolina 422 to go and well take the break as well North Carolina sailing here at Louisville 7553 Subway keeps up in the game with the Subways Alabama number four Tennessee number five then Arkansas Missouri and Auburn to 21 Arkansas off to a slow start in SEC play however but that just shows you the depth of the conference youve got great teams playing against Great teams and oftentimes in my opinion that iron sharpens iron thats what prepares you when you get to March love lost that one up there threepointer tipped out and controlled by Johnson theyll get another crack at it OB now let me just tell you this what weve got riding Caleb love is over six over seven now from the threepoint line Caleb love has a 45 game consecutive threepoint streak so which is a UNC record as baycott lines up to three unable to knock it down but if cable love does not make a three here soon it will be a streak coming to an end and that record will be 45 scoop shot a foul well silly will head to the line the ACC Network mens basketball comes away next week Wednesday at 7 its pin taken on Louisville Pittsburghs been a big surprise that a big rivalry matchup between NC State North Carolina its Saturday at five oclock Eastern both games are on acc Network getting out NC State with a big win today over Miami in overtime towards Pittsburgh Jeff Capel another one of the Prime candidates for ACC coach of the year a big cot hitting the bench had 16 rebounds in the game 20th time hes had 15 or more in his great career and Caleb love has checked out the game so the streak will come to an end here today with 20 plus family and friends in the building love does not make it three Applause but I still love the way that he played in this game well North Carolina really took command of the game in the last seven or eight minutes of the first half and have maintained the silly short rebound controlled by Johnson so under three to play of Johnsonville to pull up in and out Kenny Payne has gone to his bench as well in the late stages of the contest to give some of his kids some more playing time against North Carolina as the Tar Heels are about to improve to 126 thats going to be an offensive foul Applause it is going to be five on Sydney Curry indeed that is the case Applause Curry is done well theres a lot of talent there in Sydney Curry he had a 28point game against Wake Forest in February mentioned the 19 rebounding game he can do some things he really can and again are you talking about a young man who was battled with trying to get in better shape throughout this season has a deal with his coach Kenny Payne Kenny Payne makes a call to Sydney Curry almost every night just making sure hes sticking to the diet plan the nutrition plan has been laid out for he said uh Sydney are you are you cheat are you staying on this diet we need you to stay there my friend he said yeah just about every time hes been really good but one time you know all of a sudden that scale popped up about four pounds it went the wrong direction the wrong direction and Coach Payne was like wait a minute wait a minute that just doesnt happen but they seem to have a great relationship I have that same relationship with the scale I just call it water weight yeah you would be both get away with that nice spit move by wheeler Applause 7556 guys you were talking about how Kenny Payne talked about the ever evolving role of Curry he did say that fast metabolism diet was a big part of him continuing to get better and even more Mobile on the pick and roll at the top of the key he said that is very important for us to be efficient in our offense but he did say the target weight hes won some around 260 but he did mention each night before he goes to bed I give him the call dont cheat on me and so well see if that continues through the year Obi let me tell you who has no issue with that angel gray I saw her in the workout room this morning she made me look so bad I wanted to get off the treadmill is my God the valley boy Tyler Nichols steps up and knocks down the three ball out of Harrisonburg Virginia and I Whistle at a minute and 19 to go I built a freshman triple another freshman hes from Wisconsin getting minutes here Miller to the line Tyler Nichol from the Shenandoah Valley probably about a four hour drive east of here in Harrisonburg where I believe Angel did his religious sister who played basketball at Harrisonburg at JMU Applause yes yes indeed I cant confirm she played at James Madison one of the standouts of her uh Squad and she also spent 14 years coaching one at James Madison went on to coach at IU and then 13 years at Purdue so spent some time yes harrisonburgs beautiful the Rolling Hills I enjoyed that right that little road trip we used to make up to Harrisonburg well you know thats thats my hood thats around my way so thats why you went in yeah Tyler Nichol and of course your sister recognizing the Bell well approaching the one minute Mark here in Louisville nickel lining up another one North Carolina is going to win this one going away meanwhile Louisville will lose their seventh consecutive game and remain winless in the conference that will follow oh and seven in the ACC 2 and 16 overall so the rebuild of this great program will continue as Kenny Payne tries to bring the Cardinals back to their Glory Days and there has been you know incremental progress for Kenny Payne this is a setback today Im sure Kenny Payne did not come in here thinking that this game would go the way that it has as his son Zan is able to come up with a steal in the putback of course then Alexander first name Gotta Love It at least I do Applause so North Carolina bouncing back from the Virginia game Armando baycat healthy enough to put up a doubledouble just a few minutes into the game it felt like a lot of 16 rebounds so he certainly looked healthy enough today didnt he absolutely did and you know good to see him back on the floor after missing the majority of that Virginia game a game that he was excited about of course had a careerhigh performance against Virginia a year ago 29 Points and 22 rebounds so going back to the home state but only playing 78 seconds of that game and the team walking away with the loss of where North Carolina and Huber Davis who were who was you know visibly upset about the way that his team performed on the road happy to get their first ACC Road Victory leaves their first row victory of the season Applause 8059 and the final seconds will be dribbled away and North Carolina sails to a win here today Rachel gray Corey Alexander Im Dave OBrien saying goodbye from Louisville thats your final score 8059 with Carolina LSU and Alabama coming up
