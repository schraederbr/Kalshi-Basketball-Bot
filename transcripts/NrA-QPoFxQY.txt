floor Virginia coming in at 13 and 13 69 in the ACC they fell to number three duke on Monday 8062 and we are underway as the heels win the opening Applause tip Luben with an early touch Withers will swing it and itll go the other way here in the opening seconds great job by Andrew roie getting over otherwise that would have been a game breaking dunk for Vin Allen Luben great execution by the tar Hills but give Ro a lot of credit so Virginia pretty good beyond the threepoint line at 38 itll be about volume maybe today inside for Buchanan and could not get the short one to goo running the point 61 sophomore try to stay out of foul trouble today its been a real issue for him tip to wither tried for the quick dish down low but it didnt get there Elijah Saunders back in the starting lineup for Virginia missed four games in which Virginia won three of those as he watched the young players continue to develop they getting back on the floor in the starting unit today heres Ros first one Beyond The Arc cant hit that and a rebound to Withers at 69 Davis on the drive going to that left hand the follow thatll roll in by Luben but thats an area where the tar Hills were able to exploit the wolf pack on Wednesday by going and crashing the offensive glass getting back to where Carolina basketball was built on B nearly dangerous beyond that threepoint line Saunders will try one didnt look good coming off the hand a rebound picked off by Withers hes only getting about Five Points a game four rebounds as well but a guy who can attempt to three2 round the back Kone lost it took a funny bounce on him and Saunders collects it Saunders on Davis trying to Tip Toe Through and RJ stayed home did a great job defensively you called it my friend great job defensively by RJ Davis anticipating that Saunders was going to try to sweep over the top stays back away from in great hands to knock it off of Saunders getting the basketball back for the tar Hills r j the grad out of White Plains New York leading away with 18 points a game you and I have seen many of the best games he has had in what is really an illustrious career around the back he goes hes also one of the great foul Shooters in the history of the ACC thats saying a lot give it up for pal shock clock winding down to two and good ball movement as Luben got it to go and a nice play by Drake pal penetrating but dropping it off for luin to be able to lay it up easily and a strong start offensively for the tarel Virginia still sitting on Applause Zero D ases who can be explosive trying to get it to soer shot clock to 10 mcney will Catching Fire got a pretty good look but he missed it Davis wants to push it looking to blow by and willll draw the foul RJ Davis looking for the rack early Drake pal attacking the Baseline but watch Van Allen Luen get to the available spot pal drops it off Len able to finish it up but when youre think North Carolina basketball youve always considering that they score points in the paint still first in the ACC close to 40 points in the paint but had a spectacular night last time out at NC State I mean against NC State 52 points in the paint yeah 29 minutes power played the 66 freshman North Carolina with a little more side and liking this lineup this particular mix here this afternoon and and thats really been something for Drake pow OB hes played out of position pretty much the entire season hes been playing at the power forward spot before and hes not that hes a small forward and now you see a wrinkle that Hubert Davis has added as of late the pressure the one 1211 Diamond press which of course Virginias always had issues with handling pressure got this one free up ahead for Buchanan hell attack and lay it in Applause and for Hubert Davis even though you dont want to give up a layup youll take your chances with the 610 Blake mchanon having to make plays in comparison to the guard for Virginia with a kick out and switched in by Withers as we mentioned he can make the three only 43 attempts this year but hes sitting 42 and made a number of big threes in that Syracuse win but when you think about what WIS brings he brings some more size to that front line started the first seven games and then came off the bench jber Davis has gotten it back into the starting lineup T Murray the 65 senior from New Zealand Into The Fray trying to back down on Davis Ro to the corner and cant stick it battle for the rebound it will be North Carolina Ball but Obie you go throw the ball into the post to tame Murray and without a double team he kicks it out hes got an advantage sizewise against RJ Davis when they call your number Ron Sanchez finding an opportunity for Tame Murray you have to take advantage of it when you got a six foot God garding youre in your six5 hes almost half a foot as you mentioned Trimble into the game now for North Carolina Tar Hills can score theyve done it consistently all year tip somehow got underneath the Luben Im not sure how it made it to him but itll lay it in but that happens because you have to pay so much attention to RJ Davis coming off the screen he immediately gets rid of the basketball opening up VIN Allen Len in the freshman Jackson about to check in for the Tar Heels as well hes their number two scorer at 14 a game muray with shot clock down to nine nothing new Virginia whittling down that shot clock before they get one in the air Saunders and a block great job by Withers got a couple of terrific stops here by the Tar Heels early Davis with the swing D was so far quiet offensively trying to heat up right here off the back of the iron but offensive rebound Drake pal had three of those against NC State and they talked about him being a catalyst attack attack look out look out below well he is some impressive athletes he absolutely is that sports information director Steve ker talked about the athletic plays he made last time out and just showing off another example of that on the last offensive possession its the crowd on their feet Murray with the drive and they stop him again he kicks out for Davis and RJ waits for some help North Carolina on top 132 RJ had a mismatch he had Saunders ging Im surprised he didnt take him to the Rack or create something for one of his teammates last years ACC Player of the Year directing some traffic shot clock to seven oh hell cross over and drive quick stop and sticks it and again its a lot Virginia switching defensively its a lot to ask Blake UK Canon to go out and as you mentioned defend last years ACC Player of the Year 25 ft away from the basket so much so Ron Sanchez needs a timeout as the tar Hills have gone on a 130 run noina of doing the job on both the FL defensively Withers with the rejection and Drake pal with the injection of energy here in the lineup have all the points for the tarell through this game but when you consider what theyre able to do defensively and rebounding right now it is a 10 to zero Advantage North Carolinas favor Virginia does not have a rebound unccs only missed three shots and theyve gotten the offensive rebound on every Miss now Virginia 13 and 13 for North Carolina it is a giant game they all are the rest of the way for the Tar Heels if theyre going to be dancing in the month of March Virginia with the ball mcne coming off and air mailed that one out of Play It goes back over to North Carolina quick thoughts on Wake Forest what a damaging defeat absolutely damaging defeat for the Demon Deacons losing at NC State and when you consider where they were as the fourth team that Joe lardi had in the mix that makes it very difficult but it does open the door for the tar Hills who have to pretty much win out and then H themselves opportunity here on their home floor against the Duke Blue Devils to try to get in the mix Davis year number four his team still with a path to the NCAA tournament Virginia FSU Miami and Virginia Tech on the schedule before the Duke game here on March 8 630 on ESPN Virginia just 6 and N in conference play Isaac mcne a dangerous threepoint man shot clock down to six here for the Cavaliers Roy shot clock down to one hes going to drive it and did not get the shot in the air will not count thats a shot clock violation and give the Tar Heels a tremendous amount of credit defensively with 6 seconds on the shot clock and I only knew that because the notorious do told me they had pushed Andrew Ro all the way out to the hash the 28t hash mark and so with Kopi making that shot call the floor as a shot clock violation it will be under review whenever the shot is made you can stop play to go over and see if he got it out of his hands in time but in live action it didnt look as though Kofi got that one off as we have an opportunity to see going into a shot the basketball still in his hands call on the floor is confirmed around the basket confirmed that will not be a good buck another great defensive stand by the tar here well hu Davis was telling his team through practice this week dont get frustrated when they get that shot clock down to six and five and four even if they make the shot dont get frustrated because youve done your job youve absolutely done your job and the tar Hills have been locked in for guarding for if 30 seconds or if its necessary they havent had to guard for more because Virginia hasnt had any chance at all in the offensive B Jackson bouncing here for Elliot K the 61 sophomore those battle foul trouble running the point for Carolina trouble with the drive Slams on the brakes left it Applause short now Virginia has been handled by the top 25 teams they have faced this year Tennessee got him by 22 thatll be a traveling violation St Johns beat him by 25 Louisville by 20 Duke by 18 Florida by 18 thats among the teams ranked its been a struggle for Virginia especially against high level competition throughout this year this is a young team when you consider the guys you have on the floor Anthony Robinson of course a red shirt Junior D Ames a sophomore but theres really not much experience outside of T Murray whos been in the program for four years but he has a played much in his 10 in Charles and on the drive try to dump it downstairs in a foul on the floor with 1205 to go here in a first half thus far dominated by nor North Carolina coming off their best win of the year 9773 over rival NC State D will pick up his second foul he heads to the bench for Ron Sanchez and OB the last time you and I saw North Carolina it was a game where we felt like they needed to have against Crimson on the road as Drake Pals able to get the a run opportunity at The Rim on the underneath out of bounds play but they didnt come out with the sense of urgency we fought with necessary for them to win there they have absolutely approached this game with the sense of urgency knowing that every game is a must win Drake pow continues to perform very well as a starter for the Tar Hill goofi with the foul and piled at line at 62 The Freshman from Pittsboro North Carolina play 29 minutes against NC State getting the start this week and based on the NC State result what we seen so far today here at Chapel Hill they seem rejuvenated by the line of changing really do and this is a team thats averaged 92 and 1 12 points per game over their last two games if you go back to the Syracuse game it was the other freshman Ian Jackson with 23 points so right now Hubert Davis has a number of his guys playing very confident on the offensive end we watched them in shootter on today we covered him a bunch of times this season that was the liveliest and the loudest they have been this season in their morning shoot around mcely on the drive and kick Robinson went for the slam and hes denied by Washington and the loose ball comes back to the Tar Heels North Carolina already with two or three outstanding blocks Jackson launches gets it from threepoint land 15 nothing run 212 a hand off for mcney mcney with a Fall Away got that one and mcne is going to have to do more of that for Virginia to be successful in the offensive end at times hes just going to have to go make a great individual Play Because against North Carolina defensively what theyre doing right now running the offense isnt going to make it happen Washington kicks it out at a traveling violation the Jackson shot by the way in the corner if youre going to switch defensively that means youre going to put a smaller player on a bigger guy every Big Man including our producer Kim Belton was taught to basically get wide when you go post up Jaylen w Washington did nothing other than what he was taught one of the reasons why the great Shawn may was over talking with the officials and again he didnt swing the arm he simply is trying to post up and keep post position there but he does make contact its not the officials fault they have to call the game the way that theyre supposed to but that really takes a lot of physicality out of the game not even being a post up bothers you bothers Kim Belton it absolutely bothers Kim belon because he would have got he would got tossed he would got multiple flagrants in each game 21 to6 North Carolina with the hot start Ian Jackson will pick up his first foul Lee Cassell Tim clockery and Trey SES are officials and Tim and Trey second generation referees absolutely of course our officials wearing the RS heart badges for Treys father Ry steinan who we lost this summer as mcil knocks down that one so a 219 Advantage North Carolina try to get in deep and the corner jumper will go down big time by Withers and you can hear fans saying no yes lets take a look he also did a little chirping yeah most likely going to get a technical foul they taunting technical foul after looking back having something to say to the Virginia bench this is where the fans were saying no when he didnt catch it right and then they say yes and then once again say no as he turns right in front of Lea cell and has a conversation with the Virginia bench warranting two free throws for Isaac mcney on the other end Withers with foul number one mcney back to the line at 77 probably not the best idea to bark at the opposing bench dont do it anyway but when youre 4T away from the lead official maybe dont do that no you you dont need it and the reason why you dont need it is because you have such a huge lead but more importantly youre just coming off of a flagrant one foul you gave points to Virginia whos struggling to score against you you dont do anything to give them easier Applause opportunity T Murr with Jackson on him try to get free always keep an eye on that shot clock with Virginia inside 10 Ro over the top and a slam by Kofi but look at that that little bit of momentum you think about the flagrant free throws and then you get Isaac mcney going also so you cant help off of him because he just made two free throws hes so dangerous from Beyond The Arc makes it easy to throw it up top of Kofi for the dunp running the point on the spin denied by roie trying to get free Kofi nice job to get to it he need everybody to the 5050 six turnovers now suddenly for the Tar Heels and straight on Virginia launching the three Kofi swishes that one home the big freshman lets think back all right youre talking about ninepoint score for Virginia fre throws the dunp and now the three what we were looking at it was a huge run in Carolinas favor now 14 to3 run in Virginias favor think back to the flagrant and the technical its an airb great looking Blow by there for two thats a way to break it though if youre Ian Jackson find a way to get to the rim show off your athleticism and get the easy bucket somewhat out of the spotlight because of where North Carolinas been a big chunk of the season but hes quietly enjoyed a really fine rookie year and the third leading scoring freshman in ACC play when you consider Ian Jackson who put together a string of five straight 20point games Midway through the season not sure how MC got that one up off the iron but he misfired Jackson again shredding to D got it up there that wont drop but a whistle now a foul here against Virginia with 833 to go and the first half of Chapel Hill Kofi with a second foul and Saunders will check back in now for Virginia Huber Davis with three tar Hills waiting at the scores table Im not a betting man OB but if I were I can imagine one person thats going to be coming out yes itll be Withers at the line the 69ine grad out of Charlotte and coming up at 6 Easton on ESPN number 17 Kentucky squaring off against number four Alabama a Sonic Blockbuster and number 15 Missouri taking on Arkansas we cap the night with number 19 Arizona hosting BYU at 1000 Eastern 700 Pacific and indeed as predicted Mr Washington is sitting and Withers will drain that and hes the other one that I would have been on coming out after the technical foul it would have been Jaylen Withers so Drake pow stepping back into the lineup now a little smaller lineup which weve seen a lot of from North Carolina throughout this season but Drake pal going back to that small forward position with K Tyson at the four so a couple technical fouls against North Carolina here in the first half change things for a while well see if that continues Murray on the drive kept on going with that left hand and he has his first bucket Obie think about how tough a Time Virginia was having scoring before the flagrant in the technical foul now you see Virginia finding a way to be able to operate on the offensive end the problem has they havent been able to guard Carolina as Drake Pals able to touch the paint once again big deal with his first foul there were only 34 seconds between the flagrant and the straight up Technical and Virginia made four free throws all Isaac mcney during that stretch who had been struggling from the four doesnt have didnt have a field goal but when you consider you allow Virginias best player to see the basketball go through you give him confidence but you also give the other guys confidence because now youve broken that scoring drout that they had been in because of North Carolinas defense The Touch by pow a freshman who averages about seven points a game he has six already in the first half here today and a 2918 lead for the heels yanan a catch and a shot here by Sharma that wont drop Jackson averaging 14 a game hes 39 beyond the threepoint line Davis around on the back and picked off by mcney great effort by mcney getting back in and really baiting RJ Davis into that turnover Saunders got it got a good clean look and a threepointer Virginias now made six of their last eight field goal attempts including two threes in the mix to make this an eightpoint game so far RJ Davis who comes in at 18 points a game has not done a whole lot of scoring hes done a lot more of this with the distribution and that one worked out beautifully as K Tyson drills one and thats a welcome sign K Tyson came in out of the portal expected to be a floor spacer for these tar Hills hadnt shot the basketball very well all throughout this year so a welcome sign to see him knock down the F under seven minutes here the first half at Chapel Hill the back door cut laid up and in by Sharma wellrun play by Virginia yeah great recognition by Blake mananan to see RJ Davis get caught up on the screen in the easy layup is Jackson steps back and launches got it well 23 is Syracuse 23 against Alabama 23 against Louisville has eight in the first half today he had back to back games where he truly struggled didnt score against the Blue Devils didnt score I mean only score six points late in garbage time against Crimson but when you consider what Ian Jackson has been able to do we talked about 23 two games ago and now getting in his bag the pull back the step back the three ball in Captain Jack is number one seeds in the NCAA tournament the only time its ever happened me the second time has ever happened biggies did it prior but the difference was the ACC won the national championship and Tony Bennett and Virginia winning it that year so used to this matchup not only that game but many other times being a massive game at this point in the year and then you think about the ACC tournament championships that these two teams have been involved in and so when you look at the the tradition and the Rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in basketball and in college sports oh thats easy pull up pull up oh he got fouled you can see that one coming from here OB and not only does a 42 threepoint shooter who we mentioned got to see the ball go through four times with free throws he walks into a wide open three only contested at the end when Ian Jackson fouls him and now gives him an opportunity for a fourpoint play OB at 1132 remaining in this first halfar Hills had a 19point lead and then when you consider 33 seconds later they get the flagrant one foul 34 seconds after that they get the technical foul and here we are now they hold on to an eightpoint lead because they gave Virginia a chance this is where they really need a step up guy North Carolina and RJ Davis averaging 18 heres treble back to Davis shot clock to 10 trible trying to make a move finds the lane got it up there and missed it his own rebound right back to him and they take it away again and a good save on the Baseline there by Robinson as he tumbled out of play and Virginia started 1 for 10 theyve gone 8 for 10 since and you made the point I think very very well now that flagrant and then the technical that flipped this game it it really did with the game and again when you got a team struggling the way that Virginia was struggling on the offensive end you mentioned one 10 you dont do anything to give them hook and again Jayla Washingtons flavorant foul again I mean it is what it is we cant we cant criticize the officials for that theyre calling the game that has to be called but the technical foul in my opinion really gave Virginia some life allowed them to have a fourpoint possession and then subsequently knocked down to three right after both of those guys now spending a lot of time on the bench RO with the drive and an offensive foul thatll go against Virginia with 444 on the clock and this is the time where you have to have someone from the tar Hills step up not only from an example but vocally get your team together this team has struggled during times of adversity throughout this year they dont have that one vocal leader but this lat season and how important this game is they got to find someone to have a voice Hubert says its a very tight Nick group he said Im really that guy that voice comes from him and it cant be the head coach OB because the head coachs voice you get tired of hearing him throughout the entire season you got to remember these guys have been practicing since June so the head coachs voice cant be the one that you hear all the time its got to come directly from one of the players or a couple of the players who step up and become that vocal leader Robinson with the foul thatll put Davis at the line for a one and one here and as mentioned great foul shooter 88 one of the best in the history of the ACC and hes a great example but hes not a vocal guy again you know when you look back to the success that the tar Hills had a season ago youve got cor M Ryan youve got Armando Bott youve got Harrison Ingram you all those three guys are leaders and theyre vocal theyll get on their teammates theyll talk right now the tar Hills dont have that voice and in all honesty I think its Ian Jackson but as a freshman I think its difficult to be able to go in and step up and be that guy also talking about a McDonalds AllAmerican and guy whos used to speaking up for himself hes one of Seven Brothers Choice Sharma brings it out coming up in the fourminute Mark here at Chapel Hill in the first half heres Saunders with an open look and around and out it Applause goes Los back in outside the threepoint line for Trimble and now North Carolina will set it up looking with their 17th win trying to go to 10 and six in the conference Davis around the back fires and no and a whistle 339 to go theyre going to get T Murray I believe trying to keep Vin Allen Luben off of the offensive glass which thats one of the areas with North Carolina that really was a changing point in the game because North Carolina was getting ready to run Virginia off the floor they at one point had a 19 point lead OB but when you consider then when we go back to the fler foul Im going to agree now that this was a fler foul and the reason being he got hit twice the first one was a flagrant foul we didnt have a good look at that on the but the officials absolutely did so Im siding with the officials now Im taking back all my comments regarding you cant post up anymore because that was absolutely a flagro foul the double hit to the face and Jayla Washington hasnt spent much time on the court since yes for hu so Virginia with it under three and a half left they get it down deep for roie in an easy two couple of times Virginia with quick strikes underneath the basket and lets see if RJ Davis heats up in these last three minutes before the break at Chapel Hill Drake Powell freshman working his way into the starting lineup back for Davis RJ On the move keeps on trucking but cant connect Virginia able to get a stop the lead at 10 once again opportunity to get down to eight thats about as close as theyve been able to get it since nor Gada took that 19point lead but if you continue now just to operate offensively theres time you found some Rhythm on the offensive end to be able to get the shots that you want MC curling and firing got it he loves that shot thats the shot you want Obie he shot an air ball on that exact same play earlier but now the free throws hes made a couple buckets and now hes up Tod up to 12 points in this game starting to catch five as youve told me many times Shooters shoot keep on shooting withs Airborne got it back tapped right back to him tremble will drive it and scoop it in plus a foul oh as we go back to the previous possession look at the left elbow to the face of Isaac mcney the first one is the flagrant foul this one hes trying to post however the two shots to the face you got to get free throws in the basketball from that one and then Jaylen Withers right in front of Lee Cel having some commentary for the Virginia bench just like that giving Virginia life but the first field goal in over four minutes for North Carolina SE tro at the free throw line now trying to make it a threepoint play but the first field goal in over four minutes for the Tar Heels Seth Trum will give them a little L 82 foul shooter and Hikes it back up to 10 Virginia trying to pull off an upset here today in North Carolina knocked away pow collects it Withers downstairs no Applause Mar on the feet for Saunders a double treding to wiggle fre and somehow got it up there and made the shot but he is traveling with it they turn it over for the eighth time great job defensely by the heels trapping him under the basket we got our NBA Saturday Prime Time game coming up on ABC and ESPN plus and coverage tipping off an NBA Countdown at 800 Eastern five Applause Pacific Davis calling for movement wants a long one and a rebound taken in by Withers second effort here comes got it he has 11 here in the first half hes averaging five and an offensive rebounding playing with effort you know one of the things you got to live with with jayen withs and to a basketball ter is hes going to make a couple bone head plays but you can see the benefit it is of having him on the floor hes knocked down two threes already in this game good feed downstairs for Robinson whos really emerging for Virginia they could use a whole lot more of that his first bucket here today and forgive me witherss has three threes hes three for three from Beyond The Arc look at this second chance points thats the difference in the game OB 11point lead the second T Points 11 O B Davis draw some contact he takes the hit with 27 seconds before halftime now well have time to talk about this a little bit more in the second half you know RJ Davis certainly has his critics this season here in Chapel Hill and in North Carolina a lot of people are say well there 16811 has been a disappointing season hes been underwhelming at times you know as far as scoring the way he did a year ago take a really close look at this kids career and just how good he has been and the things hes been able to do as hes gone up the scoring chart at North Carolina and in the ACC hes number two scorer all time at this school and OB when you talk about the jersey number hes the fourth leading score in the history of the ACC I dont care how many games you play how long your career has been lets lets talk about the fact that hes a fifth year but he spent all five years at North Carolina which is a rarity in todays game he stayed the course stayed home this young man played in a national championship game in 2022 hes the ACC player of the year last season and when you look at where he is right now the names that he will be at beside throughout his when his career is over is legendary well you take the thir 30000 ft view of his career impressive Big Time RJ Davis final seconds of the first half RO with a high dribble up against P put the shoulder down they traveled with it so 44 seconds to go and and thats just an absolute defensive Wizardry by Drake pal sliding his feet he gets through the screen from half court that everybody works on every shoot around yes they do that got it in for Luben Canó with an opportunity to get it Airborne keeps on driving keeps on moving did he get it up in time theyre going to wave it off they will have to take a look theyre going to the way forgive me 11 Miss shots for the tar Hills theyre getting over 50 of their misses so underway here in the second half Carolina love the way the first half began you cant getting it deep and cant get Applause to Carolinas been a team that could score all season long averaging 81 a game and given up 77 thats been a bigger problem for the heels Davis getting it downstairs here for Luben but he cant connect now these two played a year ago at Charlottesville Carolina won a game 54 to 44 it was an absolute snoozer 5444 this has not been that so were very grateful I believe it was the least points that Carolina has scored may win since like the 40s right so again yeah two completely different teams this year Virginia of course defensively nowhere near as Stout as they were a season ago and unable to stop the Tar Heels from being able to put points on the board although Elliot gdau misses a point blank opportunity at The Rim he only played eight or nine minutes in the first half it was not because of foul trouble it was because of turnovers and hes been led the ACC and turnovers in ACC play and when you consider giving the basketball away when your team is scoring at such a high clip when theyre getting shots U Davis going with RJ Davis more at the point guard position a going to pull up pop and nails that one his first points theres a guy came in averaging eight points a game but can very explosive he had 26 earlier against pit yeah in the orange uniform so very familiar territory for data as is almost another turnover RJ DAV was able to pick it up RJ pretty quiet scoring first half with seven points shot clocked down to seven Canó with a kick out pow wants to heave it and hits it from threepoint territory and he has nine to match his number this is the Drake pal that was a projected lottery pick to start the season and now as you see him in his traditional spot playing at the small forward more so in the perimeter you see why hes so highly taled amongst NBA people a rare second chance here for Virginia mcne will drive and kick heres ases again and thats going to be a foul against Virginia and a man down and that is Withers who hit the deck Saunders was caught with two hands in the back of Withers but Withers holding his face Im not sure if he got a little friendly fire on that one if it was a teammate that caught him under the basket you see the two hands of Saunders in the back the push boom but its Blake Buchanan who actually runs into Withers and thats just incidental contact after the play 611 sophomore Buchanon you would not want to run in him either no I would not so 1720 with with 11 points and seven rebounds North Carolina seven out of nine from three point distance over the top and a slam for Luben a thunderous Music Applause dun he has Applause 10 OB we got to show that again that is execution to Perfection from North Carolina hbert Davis is going to have that on every recruiting tape for four different players touch the basketball on the offensive end and they were able to get a quality look with probably about 5 Seconds going off the clock Davis Airborne no hes said difficulty finishing those shots today in transition McNeal hes 42 beyond the threepoint line but those are the shot mcne is going to have to take because when he has to play against a set defense is often times too difficult another beautiful fly for pal yes and a nice job by then to follow up and he has 12 and this has a chance to really get away in a hurry here for Virginia but we saw North Carolina build a 19point lead in the first half the tar Hills let Virginia back in the game with a couple of mental Maps Saunders takes the bump and a foul good exactly 16 minutes to go o matched up against the fighting arms of no today B with a pull up drains it and a two FL and 15 for Isaac and one thing about Virginia theyre not going to stop this team has been fighting all year long we saw them fight back to make it a sevenpoint game in the first half after getting down 19 early theyre going to continue to fight thats one of the things that Ron Sanchez loves most about this team especially when things arent going their way power with a missfire from The Applause Corner Virginia dropping one earlier this week to the Duke Blue Devils 80 to to 62 and theres a three On Target by Roy and Roy who can stick that at 41 very a clean look yeah you got a number of guys who are leak from Beyond the threepoint arc when you consider McNeely and roie as well as DayDay ases all three cars shoot the basketball extremely well and the block shot allows Virginia to get out in transition by Robinson downstairs Saunders cant finish but a Applause foul 5 341 and the foul on Luben his first talking about change coming for North Carolina and the guys and a reshuffle lineup you know rjd is not doing a lot of scoring today a lot more Distributing but OB think about this North Carolina is shooting 70 from three theyre seven of 10 and the alltime leading threepoint field goal leader at the University of North Carolina hasnt made one hes got 331 on the career but he has not made one today but everyone else getting involved in the action and just like that Huber Davis who recognized what you were talking about before hes been more of a distributor today Elliot CAD back out of the game RJ moves over to the point guard position and you get Ian Jackson on the floor no RJs actually taking two fewer shots per game this year than last year his shooting percentages have been down 40 overall just 31 from three he corrected did a couple of things that were off early in the Applause year and again hes done whatever he can do to help his team win hadnt shot the basketball extremely well but its a different defense being played on RJ Daviss Day Day Ames gets a hand in the passing Lane and we talked about Virginias not going to give up theyve got opportunity now to get this down to eight or even seven North Carolina with a number of Mis similar to what we saw in the first half allowing Virginia to get back in the game Davis with his second personal on the reach Applause Ro on the Move leans in cant connect rebound tipped around and it will be North Carolina ball and Hubert Davis back to the bench and he will bring Withers back on well and the change was to get Withers back on and now you put Drake pal back on on the perimeter Drake pal for the last possessions played at that four spot and which weve seen him with the majority of the year but that may not be the best lineup for the tar Hills with the four guards on the floor so now hu Davis going back with Drake po a bigger lineup allowing the Tar Heels to get Withers and V luin back on the front court so Davis to bring it across for North Carolina about to pick up their 11th win of the Season at home theyre 10 and two on this court a Blow by and Davis will roll it in and that time able to get his shoulders past the shot blocker and Robinson and get it on the glass quickly allowing him to get the bucket RJ Davis now up to nine points but hes really done a good job commanding the offense for the car heels throughout this game thats a big moments he 29 against Florida 26 against SMU 21 against NC State on the slam its Kofi going airborne and thats the way you have to finish for Virginia we watched them earlier this week against Duke miss a number of layups at The Rim I talked to associate head coach Jason willford after the game and he just recounted time and time again where they missed those chippies that didnt allow them to get back into it Davis got hit in the face as he went back to take a seat M on the drive will lay it up and in and RJ took a pop in the face but appears to be okay mcne by the way was 17 if McNeils parents are not here right now which Im sure they are and theyre listening they understand why Isaac and I are going to have a personal conversation after this he is supposed to dunk the basketball OB and he lays it up on the break is that a promise no it was a promise he told me he was going to do it switched in and a threepointer Jackson well see if he hits up hes got 11 5847 a freshman with 11 points and three for three from three ases making a move sticks in and they call it a two but you see how dangerous Virginia can actually be on the perimeter when youve got roie mcney as well as DayDay Ames going offensively they can be a problem to handle pal will swing it Davis thought about a triple hell drive it instead and made it and hes off to the line looking for a threepoint play backto back successful drive for RJ Davis previously we saw him get his shoulders past Robinson and when youre switching defensively youre asking a lot of big guys to be able to guard one of the best players in the game you see him keeping his eyes on the rim gets it on the glass is able to convert and then driving into the middle of the floor able to finish going across his body putting Robinson in a tough spot as my guy Robert checks out the action seeing his son who did score 2000 points in just four years just like pops did back in the Music day RJ 88 at the line we mentioned this in the first half we have seen so many of his games we saw him score 42 against Miami the Smith Center record exploding for that one among many others yeah we watch him go up with 36 it gets wake Force as well along the way to becoming the 2024 ACC Player of the Year just a magical season for him a year ago yeah won the West award as well and up by Sharma coming off the bench again North Carolina a couple of times has had Virginia backing up big time in this thing only to see the Cavaliers make a comeback and a foul 11 52 to go particularly up on the Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln Frederick doulas a great American and a rock star when he got to the podium and was amazing a public as a public speaker as good as it ever got and the history of this country incredible so I know of course anytime you need any type of History you go to my man CIS do he has it all lined up for you yeah too much time on our hands I think back up here and a foul will shoot a three as Jackson launched it and charma trying to alert the offici that Jackson kicked his leg out on that one to get contact leasel right on top of it is not fold by it and will not go over and look to see if that were the case but weve seen Ian Jackson knocked down a number of Step backs already in this game as he continues to show shows off his shooting time so he will take three shots 73 at the line he has 11 points so far today and the Freshman drops that one in and so if there is a kick out it has to be out outside of your normal shooting action and that may have very well been outside of his normal shooting routine kicking that right leg out getting some contact from Sharma but as my boy who I talked to earlier today right down the street is watching has said ball dont lie thats the reason why es Jackson missed the free throw we be talking about the course North Carolina great rashed Wallace makes two out three and Jackson the host of the captain jackp podcast have you been a guest yet I have not but I dont do podcast but if I did I would probably join my guy Ian Jackson or the other one I would go on would be former North Carolina great and National Champion Theo penson he and Justin Jackson do a great job with their podcast buan with a spin move in close he has four came in averaging 66 rebounds for Virginia Willers one of the Baseline steps back fires a line driver caugh a lot of iron but wouldnt fall great job by Kofi keeping Washington off the glass you can a nice catch as checking his feet hell swing it to the top and roie who can brain it but not this time front of the iron and a foul will go against Virginia so the Cavaliers continue to hang in close enough but they cant get over the hump theyve gotten it to seven youve seen him get to single digits here in this second half but just unable to get over that hump and talking LeBron s earlier today we went back through you know you look at the SMU game if they win that game where they have a eightpoint lead late end up losing by one allowing to score nine points in the final seconds of that one then you think about the Memphis game where they hold a lead you look at a number of this this could have been a completely different season for Virginia it was just a couple of plays that he F really inexperience has costed this team well the back court played particularly well for a long stretch against do as you and I saw on Monday night he didnt get any rebounding R yeah that was the struggle the interior really cost him against the Blue Devils but this cost a lot of teams against the blis get creative cant roll it in with that left hand and now well see if Ro and Company can creep a little bit closer here with 10 minutes to go MC thely with it 42 beond that line a starting to heat up a little bit a starting to get going OB SAR to what we saw from him at Pittsburgh on the road day a seems to love these orange uniforms especially when they get away from home on the cut trouble lays it in a wellrun play by Carolina now this is whats uncharacteristic about Virginia once we we used to always talk about defense first and thats really been the struggle for the who they havent been able to get those timely stops when theyve been able to get Buckets on the offensive end to cut into the lead G with a push off no call there and sinks the jumper the crowd here wants a foul however if the arm does not extend its a legal play youre okay to dislodge players with your shoulder with the basketball off the bounce you cannot push off with your arm Tribble will drive it kicks it downstairs for the Slam by Washington thats the way you have to take advantage of the mismatch jayen Washington guard by DayDay AES almost a foot shorter on the interior and believe it or not OB thats a Mean Streets of Chicago versus m Irving fire thats a ebo rivalry battle between those two guys the catch and Fire by roie that wont drop and a foul again against Virginia and hell get Buchanan for pushing off his first Seth trol getting Blake Buchanan in the air and then just dropping it off the inside position from Washington and Trimble putting it just where his guy can catch and finish Jay Washington going up strong finishing getting the two and then Carolina getting the stop on the other end the day Ames will step out for the Cavaliers for a moment and Buchanon as well 845 to go here at Chapel Hill North Carolina if you missed the early part of the game got off to a big time start they up 212 at one point we had a flagrant foul and a technical foul and that allowed Virginia get to the line and get back in the game and they made some shots too to their credit Jackson with a follow away left it short a battle for the rebound came to Washington Robinson with a stop but a great follow and a foul or a no foul on the play Withers made the basket and he has 13 and Another Second Chance opportunity made good by the tar a block shot the defensive stand but unable to finish the play Virginia gives up two more Second Chance points and offt Target by Kopi underneath but hell be headed to the line to shoot with exactly 8 minutes to go Virginia getting the initial stop offensive rebound a block shot by Kofi but effort by Jaya Withers those people would considered the greatest point guard in the accs history had opportunity to come sit down and do a feature with Phil a couple summers ago as you see your guy Joe V Obie Joe one of the great cameramen in the history of Television actually in sports TV and did uh what 35 40 ACC tournaments just amazing yeah and Joe was doing the ACC tournament I believe he said his first one was 1975 Phil Ford finished in 1978 which means that Joe V did the ACC tournament when Phil Fort was a player weve got royalty in the building alongside of course the great notorious do K with the shot clock down to seven kicks it for Withers and he hits it and got foued on the play a threepointer jayen Withers in this game OB four of five from Beyond the threepoint Arc again of times hell make some plays that are head scratchers but then you look at what he gives you when hes doing well when hes in Rhythm knocks down the three ball with the contact and then the great sportsmanship by day day Ames the true Virginia gentleman as he is helping Withers up that foul really hurt him because he was number four that puts Withers at the line after nailing the three he came in averaging Five Points a game and he is six speed in this Applause Music one 7257 and back in the starting lineup wither started the first seven games of the season for the tar Hills and then started coming off the bench but Davis getting him back in the starting lineup has been beneficial especially over the last three games where theyve been able to dominate on the on the glass Kopi shot clock a problem down to two didnt get there thats a tough shot thats not the shot Ron Sanchez wants to get even with the shot clock going down Virginia rarely panics at that point of the game but just unable to get organized on that Applause possession K coming around the screen and draws a foul that was with 13 on the shot clock and time for a one and one changing up his lineup its had a very positive effect with L 16 Luben with a dozen and RJ Davis the guys been at lineup of course for years now not the biggest scorer today with 12 points but doing a lot more running the point Drake PO with the energy and effort plays has really helped North Carolina and their energy theyve taken advantage of a great home Crow this evening to try to push them in one of the oldest rivalries in the history of College athletics you consider these two teams have gotten together a number of times OB throughout our history North Carolina their 115th season of basketball they won seven national titles and played in a record 21 file fors incredible success here at Chapel Hill as I walk into the building of course everyone looks at me and says call it fair Cory and then the gentleman in the parking lot always talks about hey listen people dont understand how big of a rivalry this is let me tell you who its absolute rivalry for it will be one Renee Grisham who is of course a huge Virginia basketball fan but an Alum of the University of North Carolina we saw her Monday OB and she watches Ian Jackson finish at the rim and theres Renee on her feet she had on her orange Championship scarf on Monday OB but she said Cory I will not be wearing that Saturday in Chapel Hill Im going back to my roots as she reacts to in Jackson as he reacts shwing off his muscles and that fabulous smile with an opportunity for the n Applause one and thats going to drop in and Carolina has their biggest lead of the day its up to 20 John and Renee Grisham we see the all the time at Virginia and Rene is going to get here for North Carolina she is absolutely going to be and she makes no bones but she loves Virginia but when theyre playing the tar Hills she is all tar Hills and I give her credit for that I completely understand this is where she went to school undergrad she is going to root her Alma Ma and her Alma ma is sitting pretty here with under six minutes to go t Murray with the drive and a Follow by Robinson but theres a lot to like about Anthony Robinson the 610 freshman from the state of Georgia he had his signature moment of the season this week on Monday when Cooper flag went for the poster dunk and Robinson said no and again youd love the effort by Robinson there are a lot of guys right now especially when you go back and watch what Cooper flag has done to certain players that may just get out the way and let them have the dunk but I love that Anthony Robson contested him and ended up winning that battle on the cut laid up and in by Murray and a timeout with 516 to go and again Virginia trying to creep a little bit closer here at Chapel Hill 7761 one in this league and so if were going to see a repeat of what we saw last year a team that plays on Tuesday having a chance to win the ACC title I think it would be the pit P I think Georgia Tech can make some noise I believe they absolutely can theyve already shown that they can beat two of the better team in the league when you talk about wins over Clemson as well as Louisville so they can absolutely make some news in charotte but theres feeling it hes had a big day 16 points nine rebounds for jayen Applause Withers so Carolina as we approach the 4minute mark pretty comfortable at 7761 and Obi we also have to mention for the first time in the history of the ACC you will have three teams that dont make the AC tournament you cant going for the slam denied by Luben who commits the foul with 427 to go and coming up at 6 Eastern and ESPN number 17 Kentucky battling number four Alabama a Sonic Blockbuster then we have number 15 Missouri in Arkansas we cap the night with Arizona they number 19 and BYU at 1000 Eastern 7 Pacific number of great matchups think about what BYU did against Kansas earlier this week the largest loss for Bill self and when you consider with the the matchup tonight Kentucky at Alabama Alabama lost backto back conference games and but when you consider the cson tide still one of the top teams nationally you think about what they did in this building coming to Carolina and getting a win in the so in the second SEC ACC challenge earlier this year B number four Davis on the drive took a little bump couldnt finish it hes missed a few today but OB go back you reference that play Davis with the bump of the shoulder right it was the exact same thing that D am did on this end but there was the IR of the crowd was drawn when it was the guy in Orange do it no one said a word when it was the one in the white and Carolina blue was palpable ases will knock it down 10 points for him all in the second half and its a 13point game again Virginia not going to go away they continue to fight Ron Sanchez has talked about his team doing this all year Oh What a Beautiful pass by Davis Lin with 14 Applause now youve got to give tar Hills a lot of credit for the way theyve shared the basketball throughout this game 13 assists but it seems to be as though theyre always putting it in the right spot to help the teammate be successful Davis I mean with all the scoring hes done 2600 points he has had a better year passing it than ever this year and look at the lineup right now yeah I mean again youve got Elliot cadoo on the floor but youre trying to play through RJ Davis allow him to be the decision maker under three to go here at Chapel Hill pow got it up with that left hand it wont drop for him thats great job if you can to staying vertical not fouling Ro looking inside driving on Withers back for Buchanan two dribbles off the window now North Carolina you can say has been in control really since the opening tip here today theyve been a couple of runs by Virginia as you said no quit in them to their credit but if they lose this game Virginia goes under 500 at 13 and 14 L with Buchanan coming in to help hell turn and Fire you can it with the board Obi Withers is wide open in the corner he stood there for probably about 5 Seconds wide open you got a guy whos already knocked down four threes if youve been out of luing you got to get that one out there especially after it gets blocked the first time J A taking Ono and no with a whistle with a minute 46 to go as he takes the foul RJ Davis dropping to Don Ben Allen Luben dropping the hammer OB I had an opportunity to sit in on game day last week I saw the great L Duncan hold on to a Gamecock as the Gamecock continued to smack her in the face time and time again she couldnt get the bird out of her hand fast enough but she was a brave soul and handled it as a the pro that she is as I was laughing almost tears coming out of my face but great to see BU as well as my little sis Andrea Carter do their thing at South Carolina and I know its going to be jumping at Reynolds Coliseum tomorrow morning doubt about that 7966 North Carolina women NCAA tournament should be a blast again under 90 seconds left here before North Carolina will salt away the win as they try to go wire to wire for three consecutive games now RJ off the fake not had a great shooting day today but a number of his teammates have hes been the Catalyst offensively sharing the basketball making plays to set his team up for Success power coming off the bench and missfires on a three so the fans begin to celebrate here at Chapel Hill North Carolina got off to an aborus start got out in front 212 and then we had a flagrant foul a technical foul Virginia was able to get closer but never could as you said get over the hump today on the Drive Davis and hung on the iron rebound tapped and North Carolina will have it now one of the great traditions of North Carolina has been the JV team I mean loaded with history and thats coming to an end here at Chapel Hill yes with the new rules that could be in place in division one sports next year this could very well be the last year of the JV team which this year was coached by Marcus pige recently in the past coached by Hubert Davis and also coached by the Hall of Famer Roy Williams and so when you think about a tradition that is like none other in North Carolina they kept the JB going much longer than anyone else has but once again going back to 1973 North Carolina getting to their season average today 81 usually saying something against Virginia and the last couple of seconds here at Chapel Hill the Tar Heels in a game they could not afford to slip up and let get away well they didnt let that happen and they sail to the win 8166 and a strong performance for the
