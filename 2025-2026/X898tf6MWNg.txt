Once that shot goes in it makes everything a lot more simpler for this basketball team and Trey Donaldson himself Underway on this Tuesday night here in Miami The Hurricanes are 9 and2 FIU 5 and three under the direction of their eighth year head coach Jeremy Ballard Miami is led by firstear head coach Jay Lucas Miami in all WHITE FIU IN OH navy blue and we get started with an alleyoop to Ernest Udet Jr Thats the second game in a row Miami has started a basketball game with the alley finished by Ud Miami 9 and two coming off a 104 to 79 victory over the weekend against the University of Louisiana Monroe Meanwhile FIUs won three games for the first time in three in a row for the first time in three seasons I know Jay is not happy about that first bucket for FIU is a straight line drive by the point guard A little bought up and finish That is not how you want to start the game Theres Malik Reu having a fabulous season Starting his 12th game averaging 20 points and six rebounds per contest There you see the starting five for FIU Jackson Stevenson Williamson along with Debbie Look for Stevenson to be very very aggressive early Hes coming off a pair of the week Supremely confident Want to see him be aggressive early Stevenson had it knocked away Shelton Henderson was fouled Good to see Shelton Henderson back from Miami He rolled his ankle over the weekend Theres Cory Stevenson Jack look this kid not just one of the best players in the Conference USA Hes really one of the best players to start the season in all of college basketball but hes coming off of being named the Conference USA player of the week He averaged 16 points 6 and a half rebounds last week It was the first time in two years the Panthers had a player of the week Heres a three for Drew Washington A bit too strong couldnt fetch his own rebound and here comes Jackson Yeah you know talking about Stevenson look at him Hes averaging 175 points Hes shooting 47 from the field Hes almost making every other shot and hes shooting 409 from three Those are high level percentages for a guy thats shooting a lot of baskets Hmed Ola Inca the senior out of Los Angeles California ties this game at four for the Panthers Baseline drive for TR Washington Trey Donald flips it into the corner for Malik Renu High arcing three is no good Down with the rebound Dami Eric Dami the freshman out of Miami Prep having a great season If you watch FIU if you watch this FIU team they like to get the ball and they like to get the ball out early Theyre very very fast in transition This will be a good test for Miami There is a lot of teams in ACC Theyre going to play with a lot of speed very fast in transition Heres the head coach Jeremy Ballard Eight season at FIU 103 victories 127 losses Very difficult job when he took on the assignment Jack but hes a very very solid head coach Very solid head coach very relatable head coach And thats what youre starting to see A lot of these programs are getting younger and younger Well Trey Donaldson missed the layup but the followup was good for True Washington This is the 15th alltime meeting between FIU and Miami The 13th where both teams are affiliates and under the division 1 umbrella Baseline drive for Malik Rayu Tries to bully his way to the cup Had it taken away Heres Williamson up and under with the left hand is good FIU ties it at six right away FIU gets it going in transition Theyre playing with a lot of speed If you look at them theyre not that big but when youre that big you got to play quick and you got to play fast And thats what were seeing right now from this FIU basketball team They also according to Jeremy Ballard the one thing he has been most pleased by his team gives him extreme effort Very similar to what Jay Lucas talks about is that three is too short for Donaldson Offensive rebound is collected And whose basketball is it Its going to stay with Miami you know energy and effort You dont need to have skill You dont need to be able to shoot an entirely fresh roster Accountability is key especially in the new age of NIL These guys making so much money you still have to hold them accountable what they do on and off the court 93 of eight from the field to start this one for a team shooting over 50 on the season Shock misses Ray New with an offensive rebound Hes fouled Hell go to the free throw line A major difference from this FIU basketball team and UL womens basketball team FIU plays great helpside defense If one man gets blown by theres always someone there to help that guy and theres someone there to help the other guy Thats what they call help to helper Thats the significance that you see of a very good basketball team FIU mentioned theyve won three in a row for the first time in three seasons coming off victories against Florida GF Coast University in Jacksonville You might recall Miami also beat the Jacksonville Dolphins earlier in the season You know FIU was 40 against Florida teams Ibrahim Elijahan checks in for the Panthers The red shirt junior in the 610 forward out of Nigeria a transfer from southeastern Iowa into the game for FIU And that one rattled out but Sali Altunas the freshman for Miami tips it back up and in A fortuitous bounce there for Sali Alunas Jackson with a drive Floats it up with the right hand No good Ray New with the rebound for Miami Flips it to SHELTON HENDERSON THE SUPERSTAR FRESHMAN WHOA BABY If you look at that pass by Trey Donaldson a lot of times you say Look let me get my guy the ball heading to the basket He caught the ball at half court One dribble dunk Thats Supreme talent right there Look where he caught this basketball Offensive foul called on him And for that fivestar freshman 12th game 12th start at the college level in the Atlantic Coast Conference Miami had a scare on Saturday with Shelton Anderson Suffered a sprained ankle Could not leave the floor under his own power Got quiet here Hes playing here tonight Said hell be okay Here goes Malik Rayu Once again as easy it comes for Rayu Hes got five early points I dont know if you could hear it during the broadcast or watching at home but coach Jay Lucas was screaming to hit Malik a lot earlier Thats his point guard coming out of him as a coach 136 Miami leads by seven Keep an eye on FIUs threepoint shooting They have not yet attempted a three here tonight but theyre coming off a victory against Jacksonville Took them down by over 20 points in that contest Jack 16 attempts from three 11 makes I mean thats extremely efficient very very efficient Look at them to get the ball at the basket sooner than later Theres Harris being guarded by Teemo Malovitz and he turned it over Its great defense great active hands And Malovitz tried to force it down low Thats off of Ola Inca Itll remain Miami basketball Teimo Malovitz Boy the last couple of games he has buried a team high four threes in each contest that Jay Lucas has even set himself not really a great shooting team and in particular were trying to make nine to 11 threes a game but Teemos played a huge part in that at played a huge part and you can see that Miamis taken a lot more threes you got to take threes to make threes and Im looking at this Miami lineup this this lineup is very very big huge lineup you have Teemo at the three hes standing at 69 huge lineup Never mind There goes Britt Harris Beautiful little find down low in the bucket is good for Ola Inca The transfer from Sanford leads the conference with nearly two blocks per game Strong finish right there and one You know those type of plays if youre not going to be able to take the charge you want to give him a hard foul so he cant get the end Ola Inca averaging nearly 11 points and seven rebounds per game couple of games ago had 10 points in a pair of blocks against Florida GF Coast Senior out of Los Angeles California Yeah we see the young kid come in uh Thiago Saksky Miami prep guy played for Pen Alvarez FUs got a pair of Miami prep kids as well as Dami and Ru was fouled Theyll go back to the free throw line for the second time here in the early going Thought it was interesting when taking a look at this matchup tonight Uh you take a look at the coaching tree Both Jay Lucas and Jeremy Ballard fell underneath the Shaka Smart branch Assistants under Shaka at one point in their careers Shout out to Shaka Smart Shaka Smart actually recruited me when hes at the University of Acura Really Yes Could have been a zip Could have been a zip but I zipped my way down to Miami laughter Well Shaga Smart an amazing coach very personal very relatable Thats why he had so much success Jack if you were like 15 to 20 years younger in the NIL era the way you could shoot the three my friend man you would have had no worries for the rest of your life coming out of college I might not be doing broadcasting right now right laughter No its a beautiful time Im glad these young guys can get paid They deserve it Theyve done a wonderful job of offensive rebound for Ernest Uday on the way up Thought he was fouled Harris nearly had it poked away And heres a turnover Here comes Trey Donaldson bullying his way into the paint A finish with a dunk Foul was way before with the flush You know Trey you know one thing about Trey he going to get hyped Good bump Good dunk Picked this pocket I I I thought maybe that could have been a little offensive right there Yeah but theyre both in space Its not like you know the space was tight so he was able to get impeded him off his track So it could have caught it but you know he didnt really extend his arm He just used the shoulder stepped in with his body Great basketball play by Trey Miami leads by seven nearly six minutes into the contest Drew Washington lays it up top for U but he missed badly with the pass Now coast to coast Coast to coast from the Miami prep kid I know Pelina is happy to see that Thiago Shukaki the freshman out of Argentina goes at 5 10 in tall and 190 lbs averaging a little over three points per game A beautiful finish though taking it right down the floor Malovich the knuckle ball three is good I dont think Ive ever seen in my life someone that doesnt have that much rotation knock down as many shots as Teemo I dont I as a shooter I dont I cant think of a person that shoots the ball as well as Teemo that has a knuckle ball Can you name one I I think it reminds Miami fans a lot of Sam Wardenberg during those final four years Did he have rotational in the book Not not a whole lot as Shukakis got another point pair of points I should say He had seven and knocked down to three and dished four assists against Jacksonville And Shukaki the freshmans come off the bench Hes got four points as that is good for Ernest Hudday Well theyre getting into it The young freshman is not backing down from Trey One thing about Ill say about Trey Donaldson he is not ducking any smoke cheering And Shukaki turns this one over numbers for Miami And Henderson another dunk 2313 Miami Now 12 minutes left to play An easy bucket on the other end for Cory Stevenson again averaging 17 and a half points per game Hes into the box score for the first time tonight One thing about a guy thats a scorer when he sees that ball go in the basket look for it to be keep being aggressive for the next shot or next attempt that he has FIU again they shot the three ball so well the last time out against Jacksonville They have yet to attempt one here this evening True Washington thought about it cheering High above the left wing Malovitz bombs away No good Brett Harris down with the rebound The transfer from USC Upstate and a senior guard 2315 Miami leads 11 And they keep shooting the way theyre shooting This could be a close game Theyve made their last four shots from the field Jay Luke is probably I would imagine a little bit more pleased with his teams defensive effort here early You know I I I love how Jay sometimes out of a timeout notice he likes to switch his defense up right out of timeouts Big block there by Uday 6 seconds on the shot clock Panthers have got to go Theyve got to go Heres Mackey Throws one up It clipped the rim and a foul is going to be called on the baseline on Ola Inca Great great coaching tactic Im sure FIU drew a play up for offense against a manto man Jay comes out in his own You got to be able to switch it up FIU looked very very stagnant on his play They came out with a mantoman set Jay switches up the zone Great coaching by J Inca Some early defensive pressure Fullourt pressure here for Jeremy Ballard 2315 Miami by eight Drew Washington works off a high screen Tried to find Rayu down low Threw it away Now in transition here comes Williamson Coast to coast layup Good Ashton Williamson averaging seven points and three rebounds a game the sophomore out of Gary Indiana See some of the effort that Jeremy Ballard talks about here from the Panthers early Hanging around trailing by six And another turnover This one by Trey Donaldson And on the other end good patience there by Mackey And Jay Lucas calls a timeout You know one one thing about this FIU basketball team they have very very active over FIU is getting easy baskets FIUs back in the game Turnovers limit your turnover Thats how you stay in the game Thats how you win a game So four quick paint points for FIU And again theyll continue to bring a little bit of pressure here defensively Now trailing by four They made their last six of their last eight shots from the field Washington slips it down low to Ray New sticks his shoulder down but he missed Ernest Uday Jr with the offensive rebound missed the followup but hell go to the free throw line You know one thing you can say about Ernest he is always on the glass always getting these boards He needs to be more effective about when hes getting fouled and getting these layups hes got to make his free throws Thats been a problem this season for Ernest U Jr the transfer from TCU Just a 30 free throw shooter on the season Thats what you want to see As a big man youre going to get fouled a lot The best big man make their free throws This guy has high level pro potential but he must knock his free throws down Chelton Henderson checks back in for Miami Ibrahim Elijahan will do the same for FIU Free throw good there for Ernest Uday Jr after he missed the first So Miamiys lead is five 1012 left to play here in the first half as Sali Altunas goes back to the scorers table Hell check in Mackey to Stephvenson and a nice find by Stevenson down low for Elijah Juan Great basketball play You can hear the coach Ballard saying use the ball screen You want to get the ball to the other side of the court to rotate the defense Once the defense rotate you can get that pick and roll Shelton Henderson bullies his way into the paint floats it off the glass Soft touch from such a strong guy Great take by Shelton Henderson Remember this guy is only a freshman Hes playing like hes been here before Foul on the floor is Andrew Washington You know an underestim underestimated trait with Shelton is that bump That first initial bump is what gets him open A lot of times like how do you how does he get to the lane How does he get there so easily He has that first initial bump He makes the contact first making it a lot easier to finish the basket Thats the one thing Jay Lucas talked to e even in the preeason coming into the year Look we we dont know how well were going to shoot the ball We may not be a great threepoint shooting team but well bully you a little bit We we well get into a war Its going to be physical and thats what you see from a lot of these guys is Williamsons three is no good Now Tunas comes down to the rebound Bully ball Thats how Jay Lucas wants his team to play And right on command Anderson makes it and hell go to the free throw line Once again bully ball At some point when theyre playing that type of bully ball you got to roll up and maybe commit a hard foul He has a tendency and ability to create enough separation or he draws the foul and just a high percentage look right at the rim And the thing is you know you he does that to every position from a point guard to a center You know the last guy was a point guard He bumped him a little smaller guy but hes doing that to you know 68 69 centers Hes got 10 early points His best game of the season was at Miss a couple of weeks ago when he registered Again just a freshman but a careerhigh 18 points You know going on the road against a big time basketball team like that having 18 points as a freshman Thats huge for himself Its huge confidence building And you want to see that from a guy thats a fivestar thats a freshman on your basketball team He just doesnt look like a freshman Doesnt play like one as he gets his fingertips on that pass Thats not what freshman bodies are supposed to look like Jack Not at all Not at all I mean this guys naturally strong naturally gifted Williamson inbounds it to Jackson Works off a high screen from Elijah Wan Brown lobs one back up top and a fadeaway shot at the buzzer Bank didnt bank open for Stevenson Hes got four Thats what your top player is supposed to do Offense gets broke down late in the shot clock Give it to your best player Go get a bucket And thats what he did Sh Henderson handling the point guard duties here for Miami OH RAY KNEW ONEONONE A ONE HAND FLUSH Thats a play that coach B is going to go at halftime and show no easy straight line drives You got to make Miami work for their baskets is that its such an easy basket And a block by Altunas Half the miss by Brown Third chance here for FIU Will they convert with a three They will Three good for Stevenson So hes got seven now FIU trails by five Once again when you let your top scorer see the ball go in hes going to continue to be very very confident and very very aggressive on the offensive end And you know hes going to get his This is a kid averaging 17 and a half points per game Miami asserting their physicality here early Shot clock at five That swung into the corner for Noam Dorvette and thats a turnover by Miami So back and forth we go here tonight 724 left to play in the first half And Jack Shelton Henderson averaging 11 and a half points this season Hes got 11 points tonight after he missed his first shot He hasnt missed since You look at Shelton you know hes a guy that loves to get downhill Every shot hes taking hes going downhill Hes finishing right If Im FIU they have to initiate the contact first and maybe bump him off his line Guy like Shelton gets going Hes five for six When you shoot that type of percentage Im coming down Im shooting again again and again cheering 66 240lb freshman built more like a tight end cheering Kennedy to Stevenson for three Its good Cory Stevenson is red hot He was quiet the first couple of minutes but now he cant miss Wow great help defense by FIU These guys are supremely active Donaldson shake and bake Might have missed everything and a foul on the floor Great move by Trey Look at that jump shot You know you want to see him release on the way up He kind of held that a little bit which is why he was short a little bit Great setup right to left cross to get to the basket love for him to come back and be aggressive Hes come off the bench He was on the bench for a little bit Hell come back strong ULM last Saturday You know Rayu Uday and Trey Donaldson who Jay Lucas really needs to be the catalyst of this team combined for those three combined for nearly half their points on Saturday You know right now you know Uday you know he has six Renu has eight Donaldson had zero So that shows you right now you know your trifecta your triple your your threeheaded monster But when you got five stars like Sheldon Henderson coming in hes kind of taking a little bit of load with 11 points And an offensive rebound for Ray New had it swatted away after the miss by Uday Williamson very quick with the basketball being defended by Donaldson Tries to work off that high screen Works off another Jackson to Harris high game three is good FIU didnt shoot a three the first what six or seven minutes of this game Now theyre three of four from deep and we are tied with 612 left to go You know the one thing that I like to see for defense from Miami is that these threes are almost wide open shots Theyre not having anybody in the vicinity of the shooter cheering You know Shelton Henderson hes already got 11 points in this game Shot clock at three Malovitz trying to find somebody and the shot clock expires much to the delight of that Panthers bench You know this is great defense by FIU on the bench Their bench is loud and if you look at this team theyre not the tallest team so they can switch one through five One through five has active hands and it kind of has Miami a little bit dismantled right now FUs made their last three shots from the floor Miami hasnt scored in two and a half minutes Drew Washington set to check back in 11 points off of turnovers for FIU A chance to take the lead and it rattles home Stevenson hes got 12 You know this is the first time Ive ever seen this University Miami basketball team look a little bit discombobulated Theyre usually running their sets Theyre usually doing a lot of things but it seems theyre going a lot of oneonone right now Great pick and roll Great survival bucket by Malik Hope they can get a stop right now to get the momentum back in their favor Snaps a stretch for Miami They hadnt scored in three minutes and 111 run Comes to an end for FIU Harris to Jackson for three Looks good but missed off to the right And Hendersons got the rebound Nearly threw it away Thats a great stop and a great finish Miami in a good stop right now screaming Little intensity here in the building Here goes Henderson again He gets fouled Hell go to the free throw line You know Miami is getting broken on offense and theyre giving the balls to the freshman Go make a play young fella And hes answering the call Ring ring ring Shelton get me a bucket Hello I got you And hes doing that I got that Shout out Cat Henderson with 11 points Second trip to the free throw line Henderson this season a 51 free throw shooting team Jay Lucas even said after their win on Saturday he wants to see his team get to the free throw line more In fact earlier in the season he wants to see them get to the free throw line more than the opponents makes Yeah he hasnt been the best free throw shooting team Theyre 16th in ACC right now They got to step that up if they want to win games late in March Henderson made the first so hes got 12 Its already more than his season average missed the second Miami leads by one Four and a half left to go Another three on the way Oh cheering yes Mackey Julian Mackey the senior out of Grayson Georgia The transfer from Houston Christian shooting 38 from threepoint land this season has given the Panthers a twopoint advantage You know coach B has done a great job this FIU basketball team They basically have four guards out there You know you can play very very fast and theres a lot of mismatches offensively and defensively Drew Washington threw it away Second pass Hes trying to make that wraparound pass Transition three No good Offensive rebound down to the smallest guy on the floor in Shukaki Another miss All of a sudden though Panthers starting to feel it from beyond the arc Feeling it And you get to see the energy level of that bench If you look at FIUs bench you look at Miamis bench theres so much latter Like theyre playing at home Miami needs to pick it up on all ends Another offensive rebound for Miami They miss a pair of threes An uptick in tempo WILLIAMSON FOR THREE GOOD HE buried it Ashton Williamson averaging seven points per game Hes got seven FIU by five Three minutes to go Henderson for three Hasnt shot too many of them this season Now you feel like Miami starting to force things a little bit for sure Thats what happens Facing a little bit of adversity Look at the ball movement here by FIU And theres a trip by Donaldson He tripped up Mackey Three uh 249 left to go here in the half FIUs made five threes They lead by five Look at this FIU team Theyre playing with a lot of passion a lot of fun And music thats energetically contagious For Jacksonville five of nine compared to one for eight Jay Lucas really not happy with this teams defense right now but that might perk him up a little bit Its a 5second violation on the Panthers Out of the timeout you want to see a play like that to get your team going Look at this lineup Jay Lucas has went small I believe that against this FIU basketball team they play with a lot of guards Smart play by Jay you know put a smaller lineup in Put a lot Theyre all pretty much guards on the court right now Noomat handling the ball duties here for Miami 239 left to play in the half Another little mini 6 run here for the Panthers They lead by five A lot of dribbling and a whole lot going on Shot clock at eight Here goes Shelton Henderson and a foul is called double bonus here And Shelton Henderson will go back to the free throw line where hes two of three tonight Miami six of 11 in total from there You know if you look at that play it took Miami a long time to get in their offensive set Obviously you know Sheldon had to make a play with nine seconds on the shot clock You want to see Miami get into their offense a lot earlier to give him a little bit more options on the offensive end where you dont have to try to go downhill to make a layup Another factor right now I was just going to say Cory Stevenson not in the game He checks back in along with Ibraham for FIU Ballard has smashed the lineup He went small CJ Lucas gets small he goes small Well its very tact This is where you see the coaches take full responsibility in their team He sees Jay make a move he makes a move This is a chess match in a very good basketball game here in Florida 14 first half points for Shelton Henderson Miami trailing by three 220 left to go cheering And Shukaki was blocked and Malik Reu was standing out of bounds Great defense You want to see him get in that paint and look to kick the ball out Hes got two guys on him but its not great spacing by Stevenson Ibrahim Theyre too close to him Give a little bit more space and kick out or layup or three Shut lobs it into Mackey Good pump fake Harris for three Way off the mark See thats what you want to see You want to see him catch a three have to make a move Pump fake and then shoot a left Shoot a shot Not going straight into it for open shot Malik Rayu with another pair of points Hes got 12 So Henderson and Rayu have combined for 26 of Miamis 39 points Harris not shy to shoot it He missed again Jeremy Ballard employing his team to get back on defense Trey Donaldson a chance to give Miami the lead but a block FIU came into the game 17th in the nation in blocks per game with five and a half Big time block right there by Ibrahim Im not surprised that they one of the top teams in the nation in block because they have amazing helpside defense If its not the first helpside guy he could be the second helpside guys Im sure that their coach says protect the rim at all cost and thats what this FIU basketball team does 135 to play in the half 20 seconds on the shot clock Rayu double teamed in a foul call Got to stay down Miamis already in the bonus You got to stay down You want to make a league go through you To leave his star in for the final minute and 32 seconds with two personal fouls You know if you look at him hes like hes my best player I trust my best player Hes going to give us the best opportunity to actually compete and potentially win this basketball And Malik Reu ties this game at 40 FIU really its been a first 19 minutes and change of huge swings for FIU Started ice cold got scorching hot Now theyre one of their last seven from the floor You know basketball is a game of runs You get hot you get cold The key is you want to stay warm You always want to you dont want to get too hot You dont want to get too cold You want to stay warm Ibrahim out and Kennedy Brown the fifthear senior and the 68 forward out of Chicago Illinois is into the game for the final minute and 30 seconds for FIU Look for him to get Stevenson the ball right now Hes got 12 Can fill up the stat sheet Mackey picks up his dribble Here goes Jackson The left hand to Brown Andre New floats one up No good Trey Donaldson comes down with the rebound Great rebound for Trey Its his first of the game And here is Noom Drap for three No good Now Miami one of nine from three Transition opportunity here for FIU with numbers STEVENSON FADE AWAY OH COME ON NOW A fadeaway jumper on the baseline is good for Cory Stevenson Thats a big time shot Look at his release He is a super super high release Making that shot look a little more difficult than what it is When you have a high release you can kind of get that shot over top of the defender Miami cant buy a three right now Stevenson dishes it off out of the left wing Comes Harris Hell utilize a high screen Mackey working on DOA Oh he fouled him Door gets called for the foul with 208 seconds left Jay Lucas not happy Lets start with Stevensons shot How do you make that Thats so impressive John High high release over top of his head is how he made that shot You look at his threepoint shot Hes shooting the ball above his head on that fadeaway He was able to get that off because hes athletic Hes tall Beautiful shot Great footwork by Stevenson You want to see Mackey knock these free throws down and Julian Mackey such a heads up play on the wing to get Draat off the floor like that Give him a little hip check Get himself to the free throw line Great great play When all else fails shoulder pump fake draw the foul but you got to make your free throws Hes a 73 free throw shooter this season too And hes missed the first two Ibrahim Elijah on back into the game for FIU So 208 seconds left Miami trailing by one and Mackey makes one of three Ashton Williamson will check back in Julian Mackey not happy as he walks back to that FIU bench And Jay Lucas is thinking to himself I told everybody on Saturday that this game tonight was going to be a war They have firmly found themselves in a war here in the first 20 Definitely a war on the short with a chance to tie it or take the lead Clock looking down at six Down to five down to four Shelton Henderson ties it Great play That play only had because Trey Donaldson is able to get two feet in the paint Thats a great point guard You get feet in the paint you suck the defense in and you make it play for your team These guys that I can play at the highest level I see a guy like Stevens he might not be around long for this FIU basketball team All right second half underway Little housekeeping Keep an eye on Eric Dami for FIU Had a careerhigh 14 points and five rebounds in FIUs victory in their last affair over Jacksonville He had three first half personal fouls We did not see a whole lot of them And hes in there to start the next 20 Tied at 43 Shot clock winding down spinning and twisting Heres Debbie He was blocked by Uday And the shot clock expires Second half begins with a Miami takeaway You want to come off with the strong defensive presence to set the tone for the second half And Miami did that with that defensive possession right there Look for them to repeat that as this game keeps moving forward Miami shot 47 from the field in the first half This is a team shooting 517 from the floor which is the best in the ACC to start THE SEASON OH WOW DONALDSON to Ude That is a crazy pass Hes almost like he had he just knew where the ball was going to go That was a perfect pass in traffic Stevensons corner three No good A scramble for a loose ball and a foul is called Stevenson came away with that I mean the fact that he just felt confident enough to just throw that pass with three two two to three people right there Nobody jumped Thats a sign of a true true PG And the way that Uday kind of contorts his body there at the last second Really great pass Great pass Great finish FIU moving that basketball Three no good for Stevenson 0 for two to start the second half as Cory Stevenson Another chance here though off the offensive rebound and a flush there Thats what happens when you dont get defensive rebounds You allow a team to get an offensive rebound screaming Gives them confidence to make the next basket Second chance opportunity and a dunk for Ola Inca the senior Three is good Miami now two of 11 from three You know thats a great make for True You want to see him get the see the ball go in the basket You know hes the type of guy that once he sees one goes in he gets it going Ernest Duday wants Miami to challenge this call Little slip knew to Washington Wide open through Washington with five points tonight 20 on the shot clock Heres Ola Inca and El Stevenson Hes not scared to shoot it Baseline wide open Jackson corner three Good You know one thing about this FIU team theyre very very resilient Miami can come down score the basketball FIU is coming right back down supremely confident thinking they can win this basketball game True Washington again no good Malik Ray knew had the offensive rebound swatted out of his hands Heres Williamson flying down the floor Couldnt finish And a foul is called Thats on Ola Inca Thats his third personal foul So now Debbie and Ola Inca number five and number nine here on the floor for FIU Both with three personal fouls and weve got 1741 left to go You know I I see that Debi is in this game I think FIU was a better basketball team when they played small Theyre getting the ball up and down You have more weapons offensively Look to FIU to go back to the small lineup sooner than later Ray knew thought about a three Double team cheering and he finds Washington Bucket is good Washington was fouled Its a great finish by TR Nice basket cut Very simple play Just like I said right on time Look for FIU Potentially go small right now And that theyre doing What a fun physical battle so far The entirety of this game Debbie out Mackey in You know this is the lineup where they FIU got it going early And just like that Jays playing chess Hes getting his guy in the game as well Teimo Malovitz will check in for Malik Reu Might be a short breather A minute and 24 seconds away from our first TV timeout here in the second half Great play You know you get the TV timeout Get your guys some rest Renews got 14 but he checks out Shelton Henderson on the floor pacing away for Miami They lead by three Jackson dribbling all over the place Heres Williamson FIUs attempted 14 threepointers Nice back door find and a travel That was a nice find to get the ball to Mackie down low on the block but he looked up and he saw the Eiffel Tower there in Malovitz and said Uhoh Then he panicked and he walked with it Itll make you think Thats great defense by Miami Great help side Its the ninth turnover of the night for FIU Miamis got 12 points off of nine FIU turnovers Oh my goodness Another ali alioop excuse me to Ernest Hudday You know the offense is flowing a lot more organically right now First half they were overthinking thinking about what play to make Right now theyre letting the offensive run through Shelton That was a play for Shelton to get the ball and he made the right play Jackson being tightly guarded by Shelton Henderson Williamson dribbling beyond the arc for three That was halfway down and popped out Miami leading by five Smelling a little blood in the water Malovitz trying to bury him Yes Jeremy Ballard will take a timeout Little run here for Miami Opening things up in the first three minutes And touches the ball around the basket A lot of times it goes in very dynamic player I love Ernest for this Miami basketball team Hes got 10 points and six rebounds Miami leads by eight Theyre on an 80 run Jeremy Ballard had to call the timeout after the Teeo Molovic three in the corner Here goes Mackey now down low and the flush was rejected by Shel Henderson They are playing this game above the rim Trey Donaldson looking for a foul No whistle Whistle on the floor Timeout Well take it with as well big fella All right back here in Miami with 1552 left to play in the half Referees getting together Jeremy Ballard challenging the last call The dead ball initiated the TV timeout The ruling on the dead ball was that it was off of FIU FIU has challenged this They believe its off of Miami It took him the entirety of the TV timeout We saw a multitude of different looks Really hard to tell If I look at it it looks like its off big fella Alunis at the end Last Is there enough there to overturn That finger look like it bent a little bit The fing bent a little bit This is going to be overturned They saw enough to overturn it Its going to be FIU basketball Great coaches challenge This could be a momentum switch for this FIU basketball team You go maybe potentially go down 10 but now you could go down six or five with a three or two right now So if FIU challenged that and lost Jeremy Ballard would have lost another timeout Uh but he will retain his timeout and his challenge Hes only got two timeouts left That was a bit of a risky challenge there They lose it Hes only got one left in a close game with over 15 minutes to play The out of bounds play was challenged by FIU The challenge is successful Itll be FIU ball on the baseline 30 seconds and they will retain the timeout And one more challenge The officials tonight AJ Desai Mark Schneer and Trey Stion Yeah you know very very risky challenge but to win this basketball game you got to play risky You have to do certain things that you know you may look back and say I may have not should have done that but the fact that he did it and he won this could be a total momentum switch if theyre able to score and get a basket right now on this play So FIU basketball trailing by eight Time to chip away if youre Jeremy Ballards bunch Stevenson creates some separation pulls back and he buries a jumper Elbow jumper Good for Stevenson and hes got 16 FIUs within six You know one thing you look about Stevenson he plays with his body very well Doesnt overdri gets to his spots elevates and shoots over the defense This was a fun matchup here too with Shelton Henderson guarding and and playing with Stevenson And Henderson got the better of him that time Hes got 18 Its tied at careerhigh Great great matchup Two strong athletic basketball players going at it Mackey dribbling underneath the bucket Harris deep three High arcing D3 No good Alunas down with the rebound for Miami Havent seen him a whole lot tonight Right around 5 minutes Malovitz wide open three in the corner Thats a great great pass by Trey That play happened because Alu just ran the lane They had to help and he hits the man right in the corner for his three Trey Donaldson is probably one of the best passing point guards in college basketball right now He is Jack Tied for first in the NCAA Hes got three games with 10 plus points and assists Tied for first in the nation Nobody can fill it up and dish it as well as Trey Donaldson Ton of experience coming over from Michigan And and and one thing about Trey he has zero points right now Yeah Hes not thinking about himself and scoring Hes trying to get his teammates involved And thats how you build winning lifestyle cheering That is not a winning lifestyle Giving up an and one after giving up a three Elijah finishes Alutas called for the foul Wait to see the mismatch They had a smaller true Washington only got the ball in the air You want to see faster help side but great offensive execution by FIU A very evenly matched game so far And free throw no good And the scramble for the loose ball Weve got a tie up and itll be Miami basketball Noam Dovra checking in for Alunas Oh boy Jay Lucas not happy He is as animated as they come isnt he Very animated but he hes super passionate about what what he wants from his players You know True needs to get down and get that bow You know he didnt get on the ground He didnt really box out Missed the box out Jeremy Ballard is going to crank up the defense here And theyve done a good job with it all night long Harris tried to take that away from Dovat They get it across the timeline and 20 seconds on the shot clock for Miami to set something up offensively Leading by nine their largest lead of the night moments ago when they have an 11point advantage Donaldson double team wide open in the corner True Washington for three and its good What a pass by Trey Donaldson Hes got eyes in the back of his head It looks like hes getting trapped Throws a crosscourt hook pass to a wideopen shooter Now Shukaki picked up his dribble in the corner Offense a long way away from the basket here for FIU But that bucket good for Mackey What a strong beautiful drivein finish Hell go to the free throw line for an additional Its a great find Youre right Wide open true Washington and hes got 11 Two of four from three And a heck of a finish here on the other end for Julian Mackey whos got eight points but just right up against the big man there Terrific body control to finish That one rolls in Miami much better from the free throw line tonight shooting 69 11 of 16 This is the sixth attempt from the free throw line for FIU the takeaway this time Its a tough pass trying to be unselfish cheering applause That potentially will be an and one You know today they have the continuation of college basketball Now the sideline out of bounds here for FIU No continuation that time 1330 left to go Miami leading by nine Foul was on Washington his second Here goes Mackey again Throws it up there Got fouled again Back to the free throw line he goes Mack is being very very aggressive You know he gets and one and hes continued to going downhill being super aggressive Heres that foul on Reu Uh no they called that on Draat Second foul on Noom Dovat the freshman transfer And from Israel Mackey back to the free throw line Remember he had three critical free throws in the first half after he was fouled on a three attempt Only made one Kind of kept Miami lingering there in the first half We went to the break tied at 43 Could have been a flurry here offensively in the first six minutes and change of the second half Mackey makes it first from the free throw line where hes above a 70 free throw shooter this season Makes them both Way to respond Missed some big free throws early on Now hes knocking them down keeping his team in the basketball game Lead back down to seven for Miami Their largest lead of the night just a couple of minutes ago when they led by 11 Donaldson works off a screen from Ray New A little pick and roll game Elmos not scared to shoot Missed it too short That was a line drive three Came up short You know one thing you see about Malovic hes always shot ready Soon as the ball hits his hand hes already ready to shoot the basketball Ill tell you what too Jack After a miss FIU loves to get down the floor and they converted into a pair of points You know thats their offense Their offense is get out in the transition get a shot for yourself or get a shot for your teammate It looked like Trey Donaldson might have had that one swiped away A foul was called Thats on Shukaki a freshman out of Argentina Hes having a nice year Is having a good year 5 10 in tall 190 lbs Plays bigger than that Hes got four points tonight Two of four from the field Three points three assists Its not bad at all More impressed by the assist part Yeah On the season Absolutely As a freshman Do shakes Shukachi Trey Donaldson squares one up from three No good And an offensive rebound to Henderson Donaldson will fire away again Missed another one Missed twice Second time came up short Its not bad I mean look he had zero points He could have easily caught that ball and pass it away Hes confident Let it fly Over the back on Elijah Wan And with 12 minutes and 12 seconds left to play here in the game Miamis lead starting to shrink a little bit Back down to five FIU on a 70 run Jeremy Ballard looking up at the scoreboard to see where things are at Ashton Williamson checks back in So too does Ernest Uday for Malik Reu for Miami Interesting night right for Trey Donaldson 0 for four from three 0 for eight from the field Hes got 10 assists though Its 10 assists two turnovers Amazing assist to turnover ratio Hes controlling this basketball game Timo Malovitz hes got three threes And now they go up top for U again Its his fifth dunk of the night Amazing movement to the dribble handoff with the sneak pick and roll Great play No helpside defense for FIU in the first half FIU had a man in the back ready for helpside So now not a single point for Trey Donaldson but 11 assists Uday with 12 and six And now spinning away and missing is Elijah Boy it felt like he made that a little bit more difficult than it needed to be Yeah he was thinking about Hakee Elijah He should have just went up with that Do being pestered by Mackey Heres Malovic Thought about a three cheering Just want it back out to Donaldson High off the wing Henderson Shot clock down to eight Henderson had it blocked Oh foul call on Ibrahim Elijahan 1109 left to go Miamiys lead is seven Shel Henderson to the charity stripe where hes hit four of five attempts this evening And that one rolls on home 19 points a new career high for Shelton Henderson screaming And I think uh if he hangs around for more than a year this will be more the norm I would say So I mean chalk him up for 20 Might be the norm the remainder of the year I mean this kid is superb One of the highest ranked recruits ever to the University of Miami Theres been some good ones lately the Isaiah Wongs Tesan George starting for the Washington Wizards Step back three on the way No good Off the back of the iron that time for Williamson You know being down nine you want to try to get a a b uh a shot at the basket getting in the paint drawing a foul trying to get the foul limit up But great defensive play Thats offensive team foul number six 16 foul here on Miami The foul was on Uday Lets see Watch UD I guess he gave a little something extra with that left leg Second personal foul on Ernest Uday Donaldsons got him bottled up down low Here cheering goes Williamson driving on Doorat Shot clock down to three STEVENSONS GOT TO FIRE HE DOES AND HE HITS IT You know one thing about teams like FIU you cant allow them to get those 5050 balls and offensive rebounds Every time that Miami doesnt get a rebound or doesnt get the 5050 ball FIU always comes down and makes a big shot Cory Stevenson has 21 on the other end Trey Donaldsons on the score sheet His first points of the night now One of nine from the field Its a huge three after the make at the buzzer by Stevenson Trey Donaldson showed the praying hands after that three Thanking the Lord for making the three Thats what you want to see Well that was that one was at the buzzer I mean Stevenson hes been incredible Hes got 21 And then uh right time here for Trey Donaldson to make his first shot of the night I love the fact that hes not nervous to shoot the next shot He hasnt made a basket all day Comes in steps right in knocks on a big three That was a huge shot for Miami And I think Jack to your point earlier like he he hes being relied upon this season as one of the leaders for this team Theres the turnover He cant be scared He if hes 0 for eight hes got to think the next ones going in Thats just how Miami is going to win games Thats the only way Miami is going to win games If youre not hitting your shots keep letting it fly The lead back to nine and Movitz nearly turns it over This is a jump ball Its FIU basketball FIU is still lingering around Yeah Ninepoint game And one thing Im seeing thats a little bit different from Jay hes on a lot of subs frequently right now So theres a lot of different lineups You want to see guys be ready to play when they get into the basketball game He he mentioned that after their win on Saturdays And look the effort within reason was fine but weve just got to weve got to get more Im not playing guys for 15 minutes at a time Were giving them enough of a breather where hey when youre in youve got to play hard for as long as you can FIUs moved the basketball really well tonight Here goes Stevenson working on Malovitz Gets it up top 10 on the shot clock Little slip pass Deep three for the big guy Shelton Henderson with the rebound Miami with numbers and Movitz with a bounce pass down low intended for Rayu And a foul on the floor I believe theyre going to get Harris They will Thats his first See Malik Ray knew there He was telling He was telling Teemo Throw it to me in the air You know the the air pass is a lot faster than hitting the ball hitting the ground And also he had a smaller gun He want to get that ball quicker Ru spinning lays it up and in Hes got 16 Great move by Malik What an incredible season hes having He had 22 his last time out and now a fouron two Ray knew is going to do it all himself Malik said its time for me to take over this basketball game and hes doing just that Being your top scorer being your most confident guy on the floor right now you got to continue to be aggressive And Sukaki lays one up and in to stop a seven nothing run for Miami Malik Renu 20 points six rebounds per game Hes got 18 and five tonight Henderson double team Hes got a careerhigh 20 Malovitz in the corner Too strong Man thats a great shot if you make it A tough shot if you miss And Jackson was fouled on his way up 754 left to go Drew Washington on the deck Malik Reu still very very even but Miami has been much better in the second half Jack Theyre shooting 66 from the field in the second half after shooting 47 in the first You know the one of the biggest thing on that list that stood out to me was the bench points You know FIU has 24 bench points compared to minus 11 One thing about basketball team and playing defensive basketball got let you can let the people score thats supposed to score Yeah Dont allow the people that are not supposed to score Thats going to be something that Jays going to talk to his team about after this game Zadi Jackson comes out of the timeout makes a pair of free throws Hes averaging 10 points a game Hes got eight or hes got seven now That was a quick foul there And that was a long long way from the basket for Jackson Its going to send Miami to the other end for a oneonone opportunity Now Miami should be thinking lets get downhill Lets try to draw fouls for the rest of this basketball game You have a ninepoint lead Put pressure on the defense Make them foul you But you got to knock down your free throws Donaldson one of nine from the field one of five from three to the free throw line for the first time tonight Shooters touch Shooters touch That thing was rolling rolling roll Donaldson a 73 free throw shooter this season He and Malik renew some of the very best on the team Throw true Washington into the mix as well 20th free throw the night Kevin up for Miami Its missed and Ud might have gone over the back of Dami And he did Now Dami whos on the floor hes got the four personal fouls Hes played eight minutes tonight Hes got four personal fouls for a guy thats coming off a careerhigh 14point performance you want to stay out of foul trouble so you can stay on the court Now its a very interesting game as both teams are in the bonus If Im a coach Im telling my kids especially FIU get downhill draw the foul cuz not only do you get free throws the clock stops and allows you to stay in the basketball game cheering Line drive free throw no good for Debbani Uday hit the floor Well coming off that 14point performance against Jacksonville Debbani doesnt have a point tonight Hes only attempted one shot Suspended far too much foul trouble The lead is 10 Largest lead of the night for Miami 13 Malik Ray News got 18 Malovitz wide open three trying for his fourth No good And thats a travel Bombi travel Well hes having an awful night after coming off a career night You know sometimes its like that But you know if if youre not affecting the game scoring wise you got to be aggressive on rebounds You got to block shots You got to have active hands His energy is a little low right now as you see that hes not maybe scoring the basketball You want to see him to be a lot more alive finishing off this basketball game His second turnover of the night Another chance here for Miami for a new double team Here goes Donald A little shimmy shake and he hits it Its a tough shot Little razledazzle Bing bing bop bop in and out Cross across Jump shot Quick Quick Such a good athlete Play a little football in high school Hes very good Yeah High school athlete recruit Yeah Mario Crystal Ball meets somebody on Saturday in College Station Call Trey Donaldson Jay Lucas might excuse him for a minute That three was no good Wide open was Cory Stevenson Big shot there for FIU Doesnt fall Henderson lays it up and in 22 points for Shelton Henderson Now he just makes it a difficult play look very simple You know he dribbled that ball between two or three defenders Didnt switch hands able to lay the ball up with style and grace Team Movitz is going to get called for a foul and Shaki will go to the free throw line Thats the last thing you want is the clock to stop and give up three shots So strong Sh Anderson so so strong once he gets in the paint And look this is not a conference game Miami physically a little bit bigger than FIU Im just not so sure once they get into conference play that that physicality will phase Shelton Henderson Theres there not going to be too many guys he comes across in the ACC where he feels like boy I I I cant go get mine close to the rim Yeah I dont I dont you know its not just about the physical strength Its about the balance Once he makes the contact hes not normally knocked off balance He has very strong legs where he can make the contact He may not bump you but his core and his legs are very strong Youre not going to knock him off his marker hits both Hes got eight points tonight Julian Mackey checks back in for FIU More heat from the defense here from the Panthers trying desperately to not let Miami get their half court offense set up and Donaldson was fouled If its on Deb Bami it is not Its on Olena Thats his fourth though Found the two big guys are in some serious trouble here Five and nine Both have four fouls And itll leave Jeremy Ballard scratching his head Thats why you always got to have your hands up Dont allow the ref to see your hands down because if you dont foul he see hands down hes going to call foul Hard to believe that at least one maybe both of them will foul out of this game Malik Reu just got hit in the midsection after that free throw miss Shot no good Its Miami basketball Malik Reu struggling to get down the floor Trey Donaldson strong to the rack He misses Alunas misses Shan Henderson misses but he was fouled Now whos it on It is on Oola Inca Thats his fifth and hes fouled out of the game Foul number five Hola Inca is fouled out of the game And Shukaki is going to check back in for FIU Jeremy Ballard having a conversation with his big man Ahmed Ole Inca Tough night for him Senior out of Los Angeles California Transferred from Sanford Fouls out of this game with 540 left to go Seven points three rebounds And now Elutas misses In order to close basketball games out you got to make your free throws And Miami now 14 of 22 from the free throw line shooting 63 and Altunas misses both cheering And its Miami basketball though FIU couldnt corral it So the miss by Sali Alunas by the way now shooting just 55 from the free throw line this season That was just his eighth and ninth attempt Now Henderson with 22 530 left to go Miami slow playing things a little bit as Donaldson misses Got his defender to leave his feet and 27 left to play and Trey Donaldson free throw is good Seven points for Trey Donaldson along with 11 assists 14point lead now as Shukaki spins and his layup is good Hes a hes a fun freshman to watch I tell you Yeah hes hes very wiry very confident You know those are the type of guys that you want to have on the court for your team because they bring energy out of everybody Man now Donaldson with a floater All of a sudden Jack hes got 10 points Hes got a double double 10 points and 11 assists for Trey Donaldson for the fourth time this season He might very well be standing alone at top the NCAA after tonight I like this young kid man I I think he needs to play a little bit more Hes able to make plays for his team He stays composed He brings energy on defense Julian Mackey with 13 He had a careerhigh 24 at LSU on November 13th Sukachi Stevenson and Mackey All the scoring for the Panthers tonight on the floor right now is Shelton Henderson with a strong finish Man oh man Shelton Henderson now a careerhigh 24 points tonight It was 72 hours ago this building went dead silent when he hit the floor Couldnt get off on his own power Snacky finishes you know but the thing is theyre just traded baskets You know at the end of the day to pull away you got as well again one of the most highly touted freshman ever to play for the Miami Hurricanes music Thiago getting under two washing his skin A little bump little elbow You need that Fullourt pressure here from FIU Jeremy Ballard called the timeout after the Julian Mackey layup 12point lead for Miami Under four left to play FIU has one timeout last Jay Lucas has three And a big second half for the Canes Theres a foul and Miamis in the double bonus And back to the free throw line goes Shelton Henderson You know one thing I like about that play by Shelton he didnt pick his dribble up You know you get to the baseline youre almost in the corner Youre almost hes trapped but also the baselines are also trapped He didnt pick up his dribble kept going made the rep make a play make a call Nice at the free throw line for his you know 25th or 26th point Six of seven from the free throw line tonight is Shelton Henderson Talk about a guy thats gotten to the free throw line with some regularity this season That was the 57th free throw hes tempted this year 57 free throws Thats what happens when you put pressure on the defense and youre going downhill You either got to foul him or hes going to score Hes there five six times a night and he makes a pair huge for a freshman to get to the free throw line that much Ill tell you one other thing to keep an eye on Miami has reached the century mark three times this season for the first time since 1988 1989 as true Washington lays it up and in on the other end They might be headed towards 100 points again Now the lead is 16 Starting to balloon Miami starting to put the hay in the barn here tonight And spinning and firing and making it is Stevenson You know Stevenson hasnt really been active in this second half You know here and there hes getting some shots but he hasnt been active cheering So FIU basketball after the turnover by Miami looking for one last desperation push push and now trying to go all the way that time was Elijah He got fouled on his way up Still a lot of time left in this game Another down 14 but theyre getting shots at the basket and the clock is stopped Time is on their side Yes it is Supposed to follow up with that but next time we do that Thats good too You got to keep the clock running Thats the thing Got to keep the clock running cheering applause First free throw is good and Elijah Ws got five Jay Lucas was over there pleading his case after that foul Ru was called for the foul Hes only got two True Washington on the floor Hes got three And it was Washington who just came down with that rebound after the free throw miss Miami going to try to burn some clock here Molovitz passes up on a three True Washington driving spinning He was blocked Shot clock at five Henderson just now realizing it Donaldson logo three on the way Rolled off the front of the rim Foul on the floor and it is on Elijah one Thats his fifth Thats the third FIU Panther to foul out here tonight Wow Its the 24th foul called on FIU tonight Miles Smith call for 15 And Randy makes the first Hes got 19 and give him 20 Another 20point performance for Malik Reu Those are some of the toughest free throws You got 18 youre trying to get that 20 mark You got two shots to win it all I know that feels good Fuse getting a little bit shorter now for FIU Shukaki pestering Trey Donaldson Be careful Hes going to get called for a foul Wow What Look at that find Look at the find in the corner The three was missed by Malovitz Its just an incredible find by Trey Donaldson The foul calls bell number is second Its the second foul on the moment cheering It is 15 with 147 to play as Jackson makes the first Nice night for Zadi Jackson averaging 10 points a game this season Hes got eight right now cheering Old school there He practices his free throw before he puts it up Throwback Little Vincent Jackson going off for action Jack Look at that little inbounds there by Trey Donaldson So smooth Miamiys got numbers but theyre going to let the shot clock wind down about as far as they can until Malik Gray throws it up for Shelton Anderson who puts it home Thats a great play You know late in the game you do want to hold the ball but you also dont want to take your foot off the gas High high efficient shot Another foul call You know Jack just uh as we start to wind this one down with 118 left to go Theres the find by the way from Ray New Beautiful beautiful assist Easy finish for Henderson I say I I would imagine Jeremy Ballards bunch is going to be very good in the Conference USA I mean they hung around for the first 30 minutes of this one Uh ultimately Miami a little bit too much but I think Jeremy Ballards crew has got to be very very pleased with the way things could finish this year Yeah its got to be happy how his team performed They didnt back down Obviously this game was a game of runs Sometimes theyre on top of the run sometimes theyre behind the run but they kept the game close this whole entire game Its only a 14point game And Mike what we talked about in the first half you limit those turnovers youre actually in this basketball game 17 points for Julian Mackey Tonights good night They keep trying to double team Trey Donaldson He gets out of everything They knew holding it Oh he was holding it And now he got he just got triple teamed and he slid through the whole thing No thats a great play He stopped played off two was able to pivot and turn and get an easy layup Great great offensive skill set by Malik Renu That type of footwork is how you play at the next level If he continue to develop that jump shot play the type of footwork he has hes gonna be an amazing player Less than a minute to go Miami leading 96 to 81 cheering And on the shot clock 35 on the game clock Donaldson gets all the way to the basket but a big time block right there A little like a little goender right there Well maybe Little three is short Oh Henderson just got knocked in the midsection Oh its a foul Correct Panther foul Number 10 Julian Mackey His second substitution number 15 Ronaldo Ruiz Big night for Shelton Henderson These are two very critical points Hes got 28 points A chance to make it 30 And I I am sure he is well aware how many points he has right now I thought that 18 to 20 is tough That 28 to 30 is even tougher Hes got 29 Got 29 And I I promise you he knows hes got 29 too Its a big shot He locked in I wish we could zoom in on his face right now to see See what we got Thats Wow What a huge night for Shelton Henderson 30 points for the true fivestar freshman Incredible Another foul call with 9 seconds left Dragging this one out a little bit arent they Dragging it out Miamiys next game against North Florida this weekend 400 start and uh we have offsetting technical fouls on 25 and five cheering So Ray New and Brown cheering dont need the testiness with 9 seconds to play as he misses a pair of free throws and thatll do it Jack your parting thoughts here tonight my friend You know I like the way that Miami responded in the second half The first half they lacked a little bit of energy in the first half You saw FIU had amazing energy FU came out the second half
