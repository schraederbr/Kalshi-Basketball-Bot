all like hes on the rugby pitch Hes physical hes strong hes fast hes powerful and Pit music has been really good on the glass over the last two games Well Jeff Cable very excited about C Olympa since the start of the year And we are recently seeing why Eight offensive boards for Caleppa in each of the last two games for the Panthers And there is Roman Cppa showcasing his rugby skills back in Australia You said it Tio he is built like a rugby player He absolutely is and defensively is kind of where hes having to catch up a little bit Learning to play a little less physical in the college game Struggled a little bit with foul trouble Wake Forest is going to try to isolate him in some pick and roll situations See if he can guard on the perimeter Double doubles in each of the last two for the Panther freshman Sepa First possession Wake Forest converts from Calmese on the drive to get him up to 0 Nate Cal me This team goes somewhat how Nate Calmese plays Hes a guy whos got extreme quickness Didnt play all that well against Duke Trying to get back on the right track Played really well against North Carolina Had some big games Need him to play well here Mentioned Cappa joined by two other newcomers in the starting five for pit Demarco Miner and Barry Dunning Jr Brandon Cummings and Cameron Corhan return from last year Talked about J Carris Miles Kovven comes in from Purdue We got Calmese Trayvon Spillers and Cooper Schwagger coming off one of his best games on the inside for Wake Forest He had 12 at Cameron Indoor over the weekend Miner surveying back to his other guard Cummings off the back iron Brandon Cummings was playing really well off the bench for Pit got back in the starting lineup While he still played pretty well not having those 30point explosions like he was having coming off the pine but you have to reward these guys for when theyre playing well And for Cummings its been as a guy who scored the basketball He can get in a rhythm but after playing well they moved him back to the starting lineup And you see the numbers his best games this year have come when he comes off the bench The last four times he scored 15 or more all came in games where he did not start So the trend with Cummings but he does get back in the starting five for this one Demon Deakons lead four nothing Nice set for Wake Forest Stay on Spillers coming wide open on the baseline Able to finish here Hes coming searching kicks out to Corin 12 on the timer for the Panthers Looking for their first bucket of the ball game Seo a three too strong hit active on the defensive end here early screaming Harris no good on three Schweer offensive rebound now a three ball for Cali as he hits Second chance points for Wake Forest They got to rebound if they want to win tonight Tio thats been Pits strength Turn the tables a little bit Wake off to a 70 start Calm me going to be a big part of the offensive solution for Wake who struggled against Duke who struggled against SMU trying to get right today against a pit team Also trying to get ahead of the eightball so to speak Yeah Cal Me has had some really big games this season but you said it struggled the last couple Good to see him hot early for Steve Forss team And theres a three for Barry Dunning Jr to get the Panthers on the board cheering Spillers drive cheering is denied but it will goending there and basket counts for Spillers I I love that matchup Trayvon Spillers Roman Creeppa Uh two active four men that are really strong in their body Look at the athleticism here for Caleppa to catch up to make a play on this ball Terrific job Spillers though seeing the defense leaning a little bit Take your eye off the ball handler You can forget it has that athletic ability to attack the rim Trayvon Spillers veteran guy for Wake Forest Another three that wont go for the Panthers Pit one for four from deep early Coven has it stripped away and its less off the Demon Deacons Coleman does not agree but itll be Panther basketball I like the aggressiveness in the open floor but good hands by Pit Maybe Huh Yeah thats close I thought CPA he was definitely in the play Didnt have the angle there Veteran officiating crew though Im sure is Clarence Armstrong Jeffrey Clark KBett Jr The crew for tonights game Heres Cummings Dishes off to Corin Shoulder into Schwagger and gets the strong two Thats where I think Pits going to have an offensive advantage And Cooper Schwer look at the speed that Cummings plays with Thats out of bounds a little too fast Unfortunately yeah a little too fast for his own good But if you look at Wake Forest wheres kind of the weak link in the defense I think Cam Corins a really nice player Hes going to have chances to attack Cooper Schwagger today who played well against Duke but on the defensive end of the floor can struggle laterally at times Cam Corin if hes aggressive early could see some opportunity Nice play See you in the post Good defensive play by Spillers And Caleppa gets the second chance basket off his own board Thats his game Attack reattack and attack again Caleppa terrific job Comes off a little rip screen to get the the Oakland campus of the University of Pittsburgh Its been brutal I I mean really cold Yeah Reminds me of when I was playing in the Arctic Circle in Sweden way up north Of course little bit more sunlight here than there was there We have about 30 minutes of dusk Freezing cold temperature wise temperature doesnt come close It was No it was very close today It was very close If youre hovering around zero around the negatives it hurts Hurts all the same Demon Deakons with the 98 lead here Thanks for being with us on ACC Network And they just bounce off Roman C1 dont they Hes got a different energy about him the past couple of games and the whole teams feeding off it Hey nice drive Noitis Like this is a guy that has struggled Its been sporadic his scoring but getting an easy one early Speaking of easy that was too easy for Nate Calm So the help side needs to either communicate a little bit better Got to put some resistance on the ball handler Too easy of a drive Calm has been the goto guy for Wake early Seven points Hes perfect Three for three from the floor and Dying cant answer Panthers already their fifth threepoint attempt of the ball game Theyve made just one No substitutions for Wake Forest at the immediate timeout And Harris has his first basket of the game Hey theres your bucket Right Like just so composed this season You want to talk about a jump from a freshman year to a sophomore year It happens with your composure whenever the game starts to slow down Did you see it Jump stop at the end of the play cheering Oh wow Jump stop at the end of the play Takes his time Shot fake and shoots it right over the defense Just such a talented player You see here come through challenge He retains the challenge and retains the timeout Only one more challenge for the rest of the game Thanks to KB Berdat Jr for coming over explaining that to us Oh you got to take the shot when its open And he takes the second one but that one swirls out And And thats the thing that drives you nuts as a coach You set up a nice out of bounds play You have to take the first best look Sometimes guys try to make too much happen Its right there in front of you Take a bucket Kise has had the hot hand This time he kicks outside to Harris Coven faint the screen and cut to the hole and draws a foul in the process Youre going to see coming off a baseline out of bounds You come wide open That shots got to go up there Yeah And youre allowing a terrific athlete Miles Kovven to catch up You pass up a good shot for an equally tough shot on the other side of the spectrum And Demarco Miner can score it But you have to take what the defense gives you And the defense gave you that open three Need to knock it through And remember we have another mens basketball quadruple header Saturday here on ACC Network in the ESPN app starting at noon Eastern with these two matchups Number 22 Clemson hosting pit at Little John Coliseum Caleb Wilson and number 16 North Carolina will be in Atlanta squaring off against Georgia Tech What a job the freshman has done for the Tar Hills this year Caleb Wilsons not bad huh Hell do Hell do laughter One of many great freshman in the ACC this season And pass intercepted by Kovvin whos been everywhere the past couple possessions That was a really good show by Beloo coming over on the help side just taking away Corins vision as a passer Demon Deacons have made four of the last five from the floor Calmise this time kicks out Harris defended by Witherspoon Steps back hands off Cali Zois at three and two short Terrific defensive possession and it all starts with Omari Witherspoon the freshman number eight Just a terrific play by him staying in a stance late switch on Calmese This is a young player This is my third pit game so far and you know this obviously being usually the producer here Stepping in an allstar type of way here But Witherspoon every time Ive been here hes gotten his own work in by himself with some of the assistant coaches This is a kid whose work is going to start to show Hes got all those intangibles as far as your height your wingspan your body size Its going to happen for him The coaches rave about his work ethic and his character that keeps going Pit fans are going to really like this young man as it continues to go Clear improvement from both Panther freshman contributors We talked about Seal Up and theyre spot on with Witherspoon as well Number eight in white for the Panthers Heres Schwagger trying to drive on Corin Oneonone in the post Good defense again by Ken Corhin for bit to prevent uh prevent the basket Interesting to see Isaac Carr number seven in the ball game for Wake Forest Steve Forbes giving somebody new an opportunity This is a guy coming cross country from the state of Oregon to play his freshman season at Wake Forest Top 150 recruit was a number one player in the state of Oregon last season in high school Hes got some talent just needed some opportunity Lets see how he does Gets a chance here in a big ACC road game for Wake Forest coming off a couple straight losses 9069 at Cameron Indoor on Saturday Wake Forest has had a very tough schedule so far but still top 75 in the net Lot to play for for them the rest of the way Dunning fouled on the three He will head to the line for three shots Thats head scratching stuff Like I understand you want to get out to the shooter and Barry Dunning Jr hit one in the corner If youre going to contest go to the outside of the shooter Why even take the chance right here of being that close Youre already late coming out Those are the things that drive Steve Forbes crazy And that was Omaha Belaloo on the foul for Wake Forest Steve Forbes not happy with the decision from his junior forward guy that struggled with injuries over the last two seasons both at Wake Forest and the year before that at Iowa State This is a guy that was a McDonalds allAmerican highly recruited individual uh part of a really good moan team that won the Nike Peach Jam and it just hasnt come together for him because quite frankly he hasnt had a summer since he got to college to where he can improve and develop a shot Hes dealt with injuries the whole time but you you see the natural tools and ability shoots a good ball youre just kind of waiting for it to happen 58 points a game this year for Belaloo And youre exactly right Steve Forbes knows if he can get him going can be a major factor for this Wake Forest team down the stretch Harris gets Dunning in the air and draws content Such a good play Juke Harris will be at the line when we come back Demon Deakons up by four 1158 first half finish out defensive possessions Steve Forbes 2022 ACC Coach of the Year has yet to win at Pit hoping he can check that off the list here tonight Duke Harris at the line And you certainly cant blame Harris for the rebounding struggles throughout the year He leads the team as a guard in rebounding with 62 a game And Ill tell you the craziest thing too After watching Juke Harris this year and I was serious about this when we first opened up this game every time I see him I feel like he grows another ranch Yeah And and this is a guy who played sparingly last year but for some reason during the off season Nice move during the offseason everything clicked And playing with this new group of guys hes showing his patience The added inches in height have only helped his game because you see how patient he is with that extra height Its changed how hes able to attack What a drive How did he sneak that through off the window and in for Harris Change of speed right Defense gets there he takes the bump hesitates for a second all the way through And you see on the bottom those two right there Kim Boozer and J Harris the only players in the ACC averaging 20 or more and five or more rebounds per game Thats good company Kim and Boozer hes good and J Harris losers had a pretty good year Yeah hes not bad Very impressive performance from him in Duke last night at home against Louisville as well Blue Devils remain unbeaten in conference play And now Wake Forest on a 101 run of their own Theyve got a 10point lead Sebastian Akens with an easy two turnaround knockdown Its a guy who transferred from Denver Set the Denver freshman record for points in a season with over 400 points Hes had to adjust to a different role in Winston Salem but has some talent at the lead guard spot from Concord Came closer to home A nice job at point guard for Wake Forest midway through this first half Concord North Carolina that is But you see him how hes able to attack Nice job Spillers getting rid of it You have bodies come your way Good patience back pivot Good looking stroke from this Impressive move Spillers checks out England Deacons have been much more efficient from the floor than Pit Panthers have missed their last five They dont have a field goal in over five minutes Cummings bounce pass CPA fading away Cant get it to drop Schwigger the board Pretty crowded paint there Wake Forest They swarm to the ball when theyre playing their best defense And see Aleppa you get to that spot use the glass baby Make that shot easier for yourself And use the body too right Instead of fading away Juke Harris is a dude My goodness how good is this young man The rest of these guys on the list not so bad themselves Harris we talked about the improvement from last year to this year Terrence and he truly has become an NBA level prospect What do you see as the biggest differences in his game since a season ago Well hes like 4 in taller That helps Uh but I I think its the patience as he continues to play Hes good offensive playing quick Belaloo thats one you need him to knock down But I think its the overall composure You see every catch J Caris has even this one where the shot was contested theres a certain amount of calmness to how hes attacking you on the defensive end of the floor You know a lot of times you want your leader to be your best player Hes putting that effort forward but its kind of hard when you have all these transfers come in Theyre all seniors red shirt seniors and 23 24 years old But from a scoring perspective hes been outstanding 206 points per game And if he finishes the year averaging over 20 a game he would be the first Wake Forest player to do that since Tim Duncan Theres been a lot of really good players that wait for us But how about a good player Barry Dunning Jr you want to talk about an athlete whos been well traveled right Good attack of the rim Quick ghost screen gets out and hes able to use his elite athleticism And I mean what I say he is a big time leaper around the rim Dunning Jr can create some highlight plays Jeff Cable talks about him as the best athlete on the team You said it started at Arkansas then UAB on to South Alabama where he was first team all sunb belt and had some trouble at first adjusting to being in the ACC Struggled at the start of the season but has really come on for big Been a key player I think his ability to knock down shots shot 35 from three this entire season but 40 over the last three So his game opening up a little bit You want him to shoot better from the line being a guard and quote unquote a shooter But I mean he brings so much to your team as far as defensive athleticism the ability to contest And Im telling you this though Wake Forest right now on the offensive end of the floor looks really good Theyre sharing the ball Theyre playing side to side Theyre playing early in the shot clock Not bad Yeah And they havent been overly efficient from three Thats just their second made threepointer of the game on seven attempts Who who do we give this to Who who who gets that point right there Steve Forbes looks like he wants it looked at again He wanted offensive interference I think it was an attempted pass Yeah for now theyre giving it to Cameron Coren for Pit Theres a three from Schweer Wont go Rebound to Dun lead is nine for Wake Forest Leading score is KME now with 10 for the Demon Deakons Cummings with 10 drives past Kovvin and draws the foul I got to take another look at that alleyoop slass slashdunk slash I dont know what it was Lets take a gander to Marco And Im telling you theres a big difference between driving the lane pump faking when youre 64 and when youre 67 Yeah So you can work as hard as you want to But at the same time those three inches in height or whatever they ended up being I mean thats massive And its also massive for his next level abilities too which Ill be honest with you Jason I I think he has the chance Yeah To be at that level He has the look Theres no doubt guy who has Wake Forest ties since his childhood Played for Chris Pauls AAOU team Family is from the area They were excited about choice at Wake Forest Absolutely not laughter You know its not No Jaylen Cross a freshman out of Greensboro North Carolina and this is a guy who you just go up and shoot it Youre there But hes an athlete and he plays incredibly hard He boards well for a guard He was originally committed to Charlotte and hes an effort guy a culture piece that youre going to rely on throughout his sophomore junior and senior seasons The longer hes at Wake just plays incredibly hard but needs to clean up some of the habits Young guy a lot of things to work on Jaylen Cross but absolute workhorse You need a rebound you need someone to go get it Jaylen Cross will be that guy for Steve Forbes and the Demon Deacons But dont they always say dont leave your feet when youre going to make a pass Right Try and stay planted Well thats what they control Well I think thats the biggest thing too with older players You see J Carris hes always playing off too right Those that that twofoot jump stop then he figures out his decision And the biggest thing is is not making decisions in a hurry And this is not beautiful basketball right now Shaking for a moment there Good to see him get back up tied that shoot up Shoe up tight Looks like he an ankle YO YO WHO HERE WHO HERE Hopefully hes okay Were going to take another look at it here Calmese number one at the bottom Yep there it is That is not comfortable This is a guy who struggled with an ankle injury That did not look comfortable No did not look good Tell me hes being tended to now Hes been so good for Wake Forest in this game 10 points four of five from the field Cummings trying to work on Akens Turnaround jumper is good Hey good defense better offense Thats all that was Brandon Cummings has that ability A oneonone dynamo Whenever he gets going hes dangerous for Pit Turns Pit into a different team when he is on Absolutely Four points tonight for the sophomore Cummings Now Akens struggling in the paint Defended by Corin Ball lands with Mari Moore up ahead Dunning Jr Spillers gets back Great defensive play but a foul called applause Good effort to get back by Trayvon Spillers Just a second too late This was about to be showtime Good defense by Pit Playing aggressively in the hit ahead but theres no quit with Spillers Good job getting back in the play And now youre going to make Pit the worst free throw shooting team in the ACC earn it at the line Corin misses the first Remember the Nothing But Neck Crew has you covered tonight at 8 Eastern and Thursday night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header Theyll break down the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and a look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend and early next week We have you covered all season right here on HCC Network and the ESPN app So Corin makes the second and Calise with the shoe off Already had a lot of tape on that foot too Yeah its going to come down to Sebastian Aens Can he run your team for the next 25 plus minutes Going to be a huge part of this game Spillers backs down Corin Strong basket for the Wake Forest forward Trayvon Spiller is an alleffort guy right Somebody whos going to consistently bring it Having to play a little bit undersized at the five spot a lot this season when Swagger goes to the bench but nice shot connects on a three His first threepointer of the night Hasnt been pretty tonight for Pit but they are down five with five minutes to go here in the first half Tweer looking for a cunning Harris Cant find him Back door instead Kovven met at the rim Dunning Jr sends it back Roman Caleppas continuing to expand his game Nice job out on the perimeter Corhand finds the open shooter and Caleeppa with pops in the stands able to knock one through Talked a lot about Caleppa improving his body for ACC play much tougher on the boards but he has become a bit of a threepoint shooter as well for the Panthers And he puts it on display there And were told Nate Calse is in fact headed back to the locker room And you said it that is a huge loss for this Wake Forest team He has been excellent tonight for the Demon Deakons And now they will rely on Sebastian Akins off the bench just hate to see it Yeah And I think the big thing is over the last two games he sprained his ankle initially against SMU You see the difference in his performance since that ankle sprain Its been different Now the same ankle thats been giving him problems sending him to the locker room We hope hes going to be okay And you see what hes capable of doing over the last few weeks Like you said hope for a quick recovery for Nate Calise Rake Forest going to have to play without him here Up by five late in the first half cheering Feet inside Schwever is denied See Aleppa tried to keep it in bounds but it will stay on this end So mentioned KMise headed to the locker room Here is a look at that game last week against SMU Oh wow So it was a different So that was the left Correct me if Im wrong I I think he twisted his right one here Yeah And it it did look like he was holding the left last week Hey and this is where its going to get interesting right Because now Sebastian Akens who who just turned that ball over is going to be relied on big time So what do you do if youre Wake Forest and youre the coaching staff And in my mind this is what happens a lot more set plays right You cant rely on so much slow motion If youre going to get a defensive stop get out and run and try to find something early Thats fine If the game slows down you need to have definite in your play call sheet right now Wake Forest with five turnovers to pits one And not the time you want to lose your starting point guard in Cal Me Heres Cummings Five on the timer Cant connect on the three that rims out cheering and applause Its tough Akins trying to box out the bigger players Hes got his hands full too If its going to be Barry Dunning Jr attacking the offensive glass You need to hit and go get that ball because I mean this is a guy who can put his chin at the rim if youre not careful Need to meet him about 8 to 10 feet out You cant beat him when he gets in there close Dunning Jr cannot connect on the free throw Just three for six Barry Dunning Jr You mentioned pits free throw struggles as of late Got to be more efficient in that area Five for nine tonight as a team Rebound here from Witherspoon Heres McCari Moore Has been getting a little bit more time lately for the Panthers Almost threw it away there Now he drives on Harris Spinning in the lane Has it ripped away Jump ball called and the arrow points to Wake Forest So a fivepoint position but NBA roots you see it in their flow motion type of offenses But I would venture to guess with Nate CM out of the game youre going to go to more set pieces and more of a structured offensive type of flow for Wake Forest coming out of the break cheering Here they have Harris at the logo Now to Carr Covens going to look baseline Denning Jr pokes it away for a moment Corbin trying to get to his spot and cant hit the tough jumper has been a catalyst for this Wake Forest offense tonight They have not scored in the past three minutes and see with a response for bit That was a rugby type take right there Yes it was Put it right in your gut and run straight through the defense So strong physical CPA up to eight leads all Panthers in the game Demon Deakons have missed their last five from the floor Harris working on CPA now and its Carr beats Witherspoon kicks out Harris corner three Yes thats composure You catch it man flying at you Not bothered at all And the high release points Thats big time But even better play by Isaac Carr Freshman coming into the game Hasnt gotten a whole lot of tick coming into this game tonight And then an excellent play attacking the middle of the floor getting the defense to commit finding an open shoot And Harris shoots it up and over the outstretched arm of Roman Seal But Juke Harris has now scored in double figures in all 21 games this season for Wake Forest one of the best players in the conference And now another basket there for Aikens whos going to see heavy playing time the rest of the way You see the ball change sides of the floor twice right You got the defense to adjust and instead of Sebastian Aken sitting and looking at the player in front of him hes able to catch and then drive immediately and it changes how effective he can be off the bounce Warhend turnaround in and out CPA offensive rebound and the put back He draws a foul Ab Brahma pull in the form of the Aussie Roman Seal How strong I mean he might have gotten away with a push here Youre going to see him at the bottom of your screen He absolutely got away with a push Yeah Drew came underneath But like they said in blue chips if the whistle aint blown there is no foul Thats right Sometimes he drew the foul Thats right And sometimes its better to air on the side of aggressive And remember were looking ahead at February 5th the womens basketball right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app for our play for K double header North Carolina hosting Clemson at 6 Eastern and then Florida State will be in Raleigh to take on NC State Well you mentioned youve done pit throughout the year Terrence You did that Ohio State game back in November How much growth have you seen from the freshman Caleppa in just about two months Well hes in much better shape And that was the thing that coach Jeff Cable talked about more than anything else You know he was late getting to the States He played with the under 19 Australian national team And then as soon as the World Championships were over in Switzerland he basically took some time off in order to try to get his visa and everything in order Well what happens He gets a little bit out of shape Not terribly but you can see it in how hes playing now I mean he just has more wind He can play harder Hes more comfortable with his jump shot and really becoming more comfortable within the flow of Cables offense Former Pit Panther Lamar Patterson a key piece in the recruiting process He played with CPA in Australia right He he played in Australia and that was a big portion of the whole thing A guy who played terrific ball in Switzerland at defeat the United now running the offense for the Demon Deacons Driving and kicking cross in the corner buries a three Thats just good basketball And why does that happen Guys are getting rid of it Youre not passing and holding moving the ball around Isaac Carr number seven for Wake has made an impact by making quick decisions Even if its not for him just getting rid of it White Forest leaning on some guys off the bench and stepping up to get the lead to nine Look at the activity defensively Really good Cappa very strong on the inside Gets his own rebound Has it denied Pauls in the board again Kovven loses control Minor kick out Indraitis Hes got a three Rumbling bumbling stumbling into three That looked like a rugby game My goodness Unbelievably physical playing incredibly hard That Australian team was really really good He was a big piece of it Demon Deakons can hold for the last possession here of the first half They have the sixpoint lead Sebastian Akens taking over at point guard Schweger driving against Corin Kick out with two to shoot Akens has to get it off turn all around well defended by the Panthers of a very important ACC road game for Steve Forbess team Coming in at 11 and N on the year two and five in ACC play Looking to get back on track in this second half after backtoback losses coming in Brandon Cummings with it Four points for him in the first half Starts off the second half with the triple If youre going to get things going if youre Pit Randy Cummings is going to be a big part of that Hes the one player for Pit Demarco Miner to an extent sure but good defense See nearly gets the takeaway Instead its the corner three for Schweer off the mark And last off Wake Forest Brandon Cummings is the guy that needs to get going And you cant leave him open on the first possession of the second half Do you switch Do you not whos jumping up to the ball Little miscommunication is going to kill you against a scorer like Cummings who can get hot in a hurry Wake Forest needs to know where hes at Air on the side of being aggressive against a player like him When we talk about the loss of Calise on the offensive side have to adjust defensively Dunning a big time slam Nice play Barry Dunning Jr going baseline and you see the athleticism and just like that Panthers have cut it to one Harris responds and quiets the crowd So composed right Thats the thing that just continues to stand out when you put the work in You can rely on the work and not worry about getting too sped up Jude Harris has been outstanding not only tonight but this season 13 now for Harris Stunning coming off the big dunk Misses the three Offensive rebound Cupa kicks out Miner too strong Rebounder Nice play from Spillers on the sling Just a nice twoman action on an open side Short roll Quick finish Trayvon Spillers applause Fivepoint lead for the Demon Deacons Spillers now with eight And a strip and a takeaway from Aikens Foul called against Cummings Akens stepping up offensively and defensively the last two trips down the floor How about Barry Dunning Fake middle Go baseline Thats an athlete right there Jason on the other side Nice twoman action Little pocket pass Wheres helpside Nobody knows We do know its too late Trayvon Spillers gets an easy flush Akens settling into the game We will not see him leave the floor much the rest of the way Harris off the heel on the three Rebound hauled in by Corin surprised when Juke Harris doesnt make shots Yeah thats what its concerned That shows you how good he is with his talent level cheering Harris is five for nine from the floor tonight 206 points per game on the season Cummings another three Hes a microwave type scorer Cummings up to 10 He can get hot in a hurry Heres Caleppa off the takeaway Drives into contact Dunning Jr gets the board and he has it taken away by Akens underneath Kovvin transition ball for the Demon Deakons and he draws a foul Itll go on Demarco Miner And one thing you dont want to see if youre Wake Forest fans is Brandon Cummings starting to get hot and seeing a big basket One quick jab step You have to have a hand up Hand down man down Thats what a wise man once said Got to get up and contest That guys a scorer Got to know your scouting report Well we said early in the game hes actually had his best performances off the bench Jeff Cable using him as a starter tonight And hes played well 10 points four of eight from the field especially getting hot here early in the second half had some big time scoring performances this year and that is not good And that certainly would give you the indication that Kise is not going to return here tonight for Wake Forest cheering And down with just under seven minutes remaining in the first half Dean Deakons have turned to Sebastian Aikens at point guard Cummings has been feeling it this time Well defended by Carr Hand off to Miner Eight to shoot Back to Miner Crossover on Carr Fading away and nearly got it to go Good rebound hauled in by Schwagger That is his sixth board of the night for Wake Forest That was a fantastic defensive possession by Isaac Carr I thought Marco Miner got away with a travel on the catch Theyre not calling a lot of travels this season Pretty much a forgotten call Nice move cheering on the penetration Puts Wake Forest up by five Trending more towards the NBA game then huh No travel calls in college hoops anymore Well I think its getting to that point Yeah The problem is it puts you in such a bind as a defender It gives the offense such an advantage if youre not going to call it off the catch Now that might be three for three Nope The the big thing is if youre a defensive player nice shot in the corner Demarco Miner If youre a defensive player like youre just hoping to lead the guy to where you think the health is at if youre not going to call Travis I mean thats the biggest part Yeah Twopoint lead for Wake Forest Brandon Cummings getting hot in the second half as his demon Deacons will go the rest of the way without their starting point guard Nate Cam as Harris comes out of the timeout and drills a three And thats just a perfect example right there of a guy whos comfortable in the system hes playing in He takes the first best shot We saw a possession in the first half where a guy doesnt take the first look He over dribbles No you come off youre ready to shoot You take the play the defense gives you It makes it that much easier Both teams have been good offensively early in this second half Up to 16 for Wake Forest Nice baseline out of bounds set You see Juke Harris setting the first one He peels off Dunning Jr goes the wrong way You go under against Juke Harris you can forget about it Hes going to make you pay Absolutely Theres Meyer Penetrates and kicks Dunning too strong Fight for the rebound and a foul in the process Im just think itll go against Wake Forest Im going to go out on a limb and say if CLF was on the ground a foul did occur laughter Well by the way he does now officially have his third straight double double 10 points and 11 rebounds for the Australian And you see his preparation for the rebound when the shot goes up immediately starts working to get position Third straight double double A lot of those on the offensive end of the floor but hes a guy who could just move people out of the way Thirds with a baseline inbound themselves Cummings came around to get it A lot of passing and holding if youre P I understand what youre trying to do but sometimes setting everybody up and letting the defense sit in your lap its tough Nice finish But if youre going to pop that ball around dont catch and hold Make something happen quick Pass cut get out of the way set a ghost screen something Thats I think thats the biggest difference when you play some of this open motion offense at the college level as compared to the NBA game In college guys tend to hang on to the ball a little bit too long But its all made better if Omari Witherspoon is able to play off the catch and finish So I say all that to say this He still scored laughter but I would like to if Im pit I want to see that ball pop a little bit more a little bit faster to where youre attacking closeouts as as opposed to sizing up the defender right in front of you You dont want a contested shot like that Would like to get something better I mean a straight line drive you have to live with those things Foul before the inbound going to go against DeMarco Miner And now another foul this time called against Wake Forest Got to get a hook called on J Harris there in the corner C Forbes does not agree And that is four fouls on Juke Harris who has a game high 16 points I didnt get a good enough look on that last replay but I mean this is a big blow for Wake Forest Hes the guy they run their offense through Going to have to have somebody for Wake Step up Calme out for the rest of the game Lower body injury or lower extremity We all know it was a rolled ankle Miner left wide open for three Cant hit And look for Miles Coven to get going Maybe the guy with the ball right here Isaac Carr to be a little bit more aggressive Wheres your offense come from right now if youre wait Demon Deakons are without two of their offensive top players for the foreseeable future in this game Schweger kick out Kovvin too strong on the three Seal up against the board His 12th Miner pulls up off the heel Gets his own rebound Draws the foul on Kovven applause So this is a big foul here Tio on Juke Harris His fourth Absolutely And were going to take a look Theres not a ton of contact but he does reach around to gain the advantage And thats a big blow for Wake Forest Frustrating way to pick up your fourth foul Wake Forest at this point clinging on to that threepoint lead A beat inside Corin draws the foul And the fourth team foul against Wake Forest in this second half Cooper Schwiger is getting caught in no mans land Are you helping Are you switching Like communication has to be better If youre Schwiger whos an older player need to do a better job of communicating with your guard what youre going to do in ball screen coverage We have another mens basketball quadruple header Saturday right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Starts at noon Eastern with these two matchups Number 22 Clemson hosting pit at Little John Coliseum and Caleb Wilson in number 16 North Carolina will be in Atlanta squaring off against Georgia Tech cheering Panthers have certainly trimmed that margin However they have not led since the 1529 mark of the first half Three too strong there from Belaloo Caleppa with yet another rebound Witherspoon spinning in the lane Just cant get the finish and cars there Coven working on Cummings Oh big time rim rocker Miles Kovven And Brandon Cummings is down for pit Im not quite sure what happened here Take a look Its his left knee that hes grabbing at maybe a cramp Yeah seemed to be reaching like you said towards the lower part of that left leg and good to see him up and back to the bench Now both teams in this game at least temporarily losing a key player The question will be if Brandon Cummings can return for the Panthers Witherspoon drives kicks more corner three Got it cheering Mari Moore seldom used showing up here in this contest cheering from Yipsilani Michigan cheering Little baseline drive Isaac Isaac Carr say Hey go get it No problem for Roman C1 He is happy to chase down any shot attempt from his team or the opponent Hes been so big for the Panthers the past few games Coven out of the timeout misfires on the three Mari Moore is giving Pit big minutes Couldnt quite save that one But Tio this is a guy who had big minutes last week Demarco Miner went out on the road with a flagrant two and they were forced to rely on Mari Moore the freshman and he earned his way into more minutes with that performance Coven working on Witherspoon That thats just such a bad drive by Miles Coven Witherspoon up to Moore Lays it up and in Panthers have their first lead since 10 to9 at the 1529 mark in the first half I mean but whats the thought process here You get the ball on the right wing theres a guy posting up Why are you driving right into him And secondly if Beloo sees that why is he not getting out of the way That thats just bad offensive basketball And if youre Miles Coleman either push him out either push him out or do a better do a better job of kind of getting the ball in The guys right there You got to get out of the way here And then you force a shot up trying to get a foul its your own guy This leads to an opportunity for Pit to get out and run And the freshman for Pit tonight have played well And when youre playing against a team that struggles offensively without DeMarco Miner in the game without Brandon Cummings in the game cheering they have to play fast to find some offense They take the lead of what is effectively a turnover Yeah Fourpoint swing Coven headed into heavy traffic on offense Nothing doing turns into the pit basket and Mari Moore checks out Good minutes for Mari Moore to come in give you some value some physicality off the off the bench Moore with a big impact and Roman sepa greets him on the bench Hes going to be frustrated with that last foul he picked up but he no doubt helped the Panthers get that lead for a moment Now right back in Wake Forest favor 5049 11 minutes to go Been a very good game here at the peak Anditis kick out Witherspoon burries the three Officials hesitated Looked like it might have been a long two but it is three for Amari Witherspoon cheering Just such a good drive by Andrew Sidus Attacking the middle of the floor Offensive foul goes against the Demon Deakons It will take him right back Good drive Left to right cross for Andrew Sidus Miles Coven gets beat to the middle And Spillers youre supposed to show and get back to the strong side of the floor If youre going through the right hand hes coming at you You need to get back to the shooter Ksides coming from the other direction Panthers have hit their last three from the floor And for Sonus drills a three me And as we said earlier it hurts a lot on the offensive side but defensively as well And Pit has taken advantage Not only that Juke Harris going out with his fourth foul a little too early in the second half Hes a killer And the Panthers have seized the opportunity to take back the lead Panthers outscoring Wake Forest is 124 since Juke Harris went out with that fourth foul So now for Steve Forbes you wonder just how long can you wait Yeah exactly right And Demarco Miner begging to stay in the ball game He two of his four fouls have been reachins late to positioning Like leave it alone like youre a good enough player to where these steals are going to happen organically because instinctively you could be fine Dont dont take a tough risk when your teammates are playing good position defense Pits been good here in this second half Miner does pick up his fourth So now he will have a seat as well Panthers up three Witherspoon finds injuritis 10 minutes to go Second half Witherspoon finds room on the baseline draws contact Thats a good call Having to clear it up here The call is going to be on Carr whos getting rooted out by Andrew Sidus Theyre going to call it on the floor Baseline out of bounds for Pit And take a look at number seven to the left of your screen Hes going to try to get around little screen Hes just on two hands shoving Yep into the offensive player It looked like he pushed Andrew Situs who ended up making contact with Witherspoon Foul before the shot because he fouls Andrew Situs who was not the shooter And thats exactly right Youre welcome world laughter You were all over it Situs goes the same way No foul that time and Wake Forest takes over Akens had it poked away and a foul called again This time on Roman Cppa Were going to take a look at it here I thought Akens might have gotten away with a double dribble I thought he picked the ball up Nonetheless if youre seea let that ball go youre not going to steal that ball And a guy who struggled with foul trouble that thats one that you cant have because youre going to get a foul or two underneath the rim rebound but you cant have these silly reachin fouls where quite frankly you dont really have a shot at getting the ball They handle it too well at the ACC level for that to be the case especially at that angle coming from behind trying to take it away from Aikings In doing so Caleppa picks up his third Panthers maintain a onepoint lead Remember Miner off the floor with those four fouls So Witherspoon brings the ball up the court for bit Witherspoon working on Spillers separation and gets the roll Thats where the potential sets in right Good body size about 66 67 Bumps off the bigger player cheering Terrific step back and shot Now Spillers on the other end backing down Witherspoon cant get the shot to fall Rebound CPA is his 14th of the night See cunning injuritus went up for the slam Well defended by the Demon Deakons I like the aggressiveness but you need a bucket right there Schweagger goes baseline muscles his way through cheering Schweagger What a moment for his first field goal of the game Demon Deakons needed a basket He has been good Rebounding the basketball with seven Witherspoon carving his way through the lane and he draws the foul Pit aggressive to the rim so far A nice cut off the ball Caleeppa terrific pass Just blocked at the rim You have to appreciate on the other side Schwagger Quick spin move to the baseline Then youre able to make something happen Youve got a considerable height advantage Way to be patient on the interior Nice finish Seems like we havent seen too many instances tonight of Schweer winning the physicality battle over CPA but he does earn the basket there Wake Forest Panthers free throw Os continue They are eight for 14 in the game Wake Forest nearly perfect at 11 of 12 And thats a difference right now Panthers still with that onepoint lead despite the free throw struggles Thats something thats going to show up over the last four minutes of this ball game When its closeout time at home you got to knock down your free throws That hasnt been a strong point as you know especially as of late Pittsburgh unable to convert at the line not taking advantage Akins feed down low Schweer defended by Witherspoon Bit of a mismatch Schwigger off the window and in Big time basket and hell head to the line And thats tough Strong move Cooper Schwiger whos been up and down in his half here They trailed early by as many as 12 cheering And now a foul on the rebound We talk about the offensive boards for the Panthers That time its Wake Forest fighting to get the rebound off their own free throw and it draws a foul That is four on CPA Thats not good Thats where it comes back to cheering that reach and foul right Right Earlier in the second half where you dont have a chance to really get the ball and youre just taking a stab at it those things cant happen Youre so vitally important to this Pit team 14 rebounds Yeah Tio were going to be shooting a lot of free throws the rest of the way Wake Forest in the double bonus Panthers in the bonus Not good for Pit No this turns into a free throw shooting c campaign for both Its going to be hard So three guys in the game with four fouls for Pit Demarco Miner and Roman C Olympa and Juke Harris for Wake Forest I like it Flex cut to a skip pass and an uphill DHO Nice offensive action And if and heres the deal like this will drive me nuts and Im not even a coach anymore but like the offensive glass has been a huge issue for Wake Forest all season long Why arent you meeting your box out earlier Youre youre waiting too long to get too close to the rim and before youre hitting and theyre getting all that momentum forward You have to hit them before they enter their sprint to the rim or else youre in trouble Close the door Car misses everything Its windy outside laughter Its Cummings working on Carr Crossover gets past him cheering and offensive foul Good call And were going to be able to take another look at it Cummings hooks the leg of of Carr on the defensive end Im thinking Isaac Carr is playing pretty good defense Look at the left hand right here Wrap around to pull This is a good call cheering by this veteran officiating crew cheering So good eye there and it is going to give Brandon Cummings his third Foul trouble becoming an issue for the Panthers now Of course it was Harris who picked up four early in the second half but now an answer from Miles Kovven Wake Forest up three What causes that play is you have Juke Harris back in the ball game with four fouls commanding so much attention on the backside that help isnt in the correct position Miles Coleman now has enough room Thats the drive Thats the better decision compared to the earlier possession we talked about So Forbes reinserts Harris with the threepoint lead Dunning soaring up and in Wait quickly the other way Carr working on Cummings Theyll reset Akins drives No good with the left hand Offensive rebound Harris finds Carr Kick out Kovvin all the way crosscourt And Aens loses the handle Was looking for a teammate Couldnt find one And Cummings comes up with it Just under six minutes to go Been a back andforth game especially here in the second half Two teams playing really hard This hasnt been the Mona Lisa basketball games but these teams are really going at it They understand whats at stake and that would be a big one But neither team cheering really able to get anything going on the offensive end of the floor especially over the last five to six minutes But it continues to be after the shot goes up After the shot goes up you have to finish possessions But this is an athlete right here You wanted to dunk it right Yeah Well thats how you have to approach it Every single time you attack the rim Dunning needs to be thinking Im going to dunk this ball And he jumps so high that if he cant dunk it he has enough time to make a decision This is one and one coming up before finally shooting Yeah Im not jealous at all I dont know if you can tell Hanging in the air all the time in the world I mean an incredible athlete Incredible athlete You said it The offense has slowed a little bit Remember we showed the graphic Panthers have 25 second half points right around the 10minute mark Right now they have 31 points in the second half Corin makes the first free throw there to level the score at 61 This is gets the lead right back Yeah And this is the game that coach Jeff Gable likes Slug it out grind it out Physical type of game Its been his MO ever since he took the job here at Pit These teams play hard and theyre physical Nice play Good defense by Moore on the baseline and now three in the air wont go car ends up within Nobody in front of him Hey you know what Hes done Hes done a lot of nice things today Hes guarded Hes been a ball reversal guy a connective piece Wasnt able to knock down a corner three where it didnt even draw iron But for the most part hes done a nice job Good defensive possession by Wakeer has it and a jump ball called Arrow points to Wake Forest But Schwagger with the wherewithal to keep his legs up Im going to take a look Cory Moore driving He gets on the floor I think hes going to get out of bounds You better not put your feet down It looked like he was looking around Should I call a timeout And he gets a jump ball Thats all the Pilates Steve Forbes has his teams laughter doing Thats what that is Well hey Schwagger has stepped up for them tonight Only two rebounds a game on the season He has nine in this one and theyve needed his physicality 100 agree And they need him to be that guy This is a team that struggled with size all season They need Schwagger to be a force on the glass And were told its a shot clock issue thats being discussed there by Clarence Armstrong Kerd Jr Since Wake Forest had possession for two seconds prior to the jump ball they end up taking two seconds off the shot clock So thats where the confusion is at So they start the possession with 28 on the timer now into their half court Spillers patient Hands off to Harris driving on Miner Gets him in the air and that is going to be five on the Panther starting point guard This is good patience And heres the thing too Is he hunting for the ball a little bit too much Sure But he also knows its winning time and Duke Harris needs the ball in winning time Going all the way back Schwagger coming and looking around to set him a staggered dribble handoff up at the top Or some people call it a zoo Some people theres a million different ways to call this action But to get your best player open when you need it the most he gets on top of a smaller defender gets him in the air And if youre Demarco Miner and you get stuck like that just square up cheering Youre not blocking that Especially with four Yeah Youre not blocking that shot Block shots the majority of the time and I dont know what the percentage is Its from the secondary defender coming over the never primary guy Stay on the floor Harris goes one of two Demon Deakons with the twopoint lead Miner is done for the night Itll be a night that he wants to forget One of seven from the floor fouled out and Witherspoon will look to take over point guard duties for the Panthers cheering Neither team now with their starting point guard with Cal me out with injury Now Demarco Miner out for the game with five fouls Who gets you in your offense and who makes plays here at the end of the game Six to shoot Inger Situs cant hit the three Akins corrals it for the Demon Deakons You know whats interesting about this Its like Akin sets it up but everybody calms down when Carr gets the ball Yeah Like I I dont know if thats been readily evident for those watching at home but its like when Carr gets it everybody kind of takes a deep breath and then they get into their offense and they flow in there easier And on a ball reversal Coven gets an open shot So its like theres a calming effect to having a guy that the rest of the players trust on the floor And I know hes young but Isaac Carr has been that guy Would have been a really big three there from Kovven that swirled out And you said it Carr Only two points but has had such an impact on this game step back three wont go And Kovvens there for Wake Forest Still waiting for that under four media timeout You wonder if Jeff Cables waiting to insert Roman Caleeppa until that next timeout Now Aikens beats Witherspoon off the window and in Just a really good offensive possession You come up you fake the ball screen and you get out of the way Using Akens athleticism to get downhill Not a whole lot of thinking a whole lot of going Dunning drives contact no call Wake Forest takes over again a road ACC game that they really need without their starting point guard Akens slowing things down with that fourpoint lead cheering Downing Jr tips it up Pick gets it back but theyve hit just one of their last eight field goal attempts Clock continues to tick down Going to be a backcourt violation Thats killer And then when youre Wake Forest you want your younger guards to get downhill in a hurry And Sebastian A its been a fun game and it hasnt been the prettiest but its been fun Panthers did bring Roman Cappa back in Hes been best player tonight and in the last couple games 10 points 14 rebounds They need him here down the stretch Six to shoot for Wake Forest Harris drives bending his way through Cant get the basket Good defense by Kit Whether Spoon kick out to Dunning Bid on it Dunning drives Acrobatic finish for Barry Dunning Jr You cant go for that steal right there Youre up four points Play solid defense and stay in front Allow Dunning to get past Kovven for the two Hes got 12 points Car out the controls for Wake Forest Defended by Andra Sites and a timeout used by Steve Fors Thats a good call I I think you need to reorganize your group find a way to get Juke Harris the Rock but Coleman because hes had a couple of plays here in a row but like he hes done some good things today But when it comes down to crunch time you got to take care Wow screaming Robin Sebar a gamechanging dunk that levels the score Soon as I try to build him up turnover off the inbounds play These are things towards the end cheering Got to have winning basketball plays But what a finish by Roman Cup cheering Buckle up We are tied with 40 seconds to go Harris into contact No foul called Donan comes up with it for pit Well get a timeout But what a play by Roman Caleeppa to blow up the sideline inbounds PL pass here tonight Hit one against Florida State late as well and he is out with injury for the rest of this game Its a huge loss right now but heres Pit How do you find an angle Nice play Kick out to Witherspoon Squares up for three Too strong Rebound to Wake Forest Harris can hold for the last shot in this tied game cheering Witherspoon on him Harris into contact No whistle To overtime we go Hes been such a good shooter shooting over the top right at his size his ability to create space cheering Its been a battle Hey Steve Forbes had a timeout in his pocket What do you think of just letting him play there I Im okay with that You have J Carris you have the best player on the floor Let him rock out Im living with it So to OT we go And a great play out of the break for Wake Forest to start the scoring in overtime How do you approach this with speed I like the aggressive play off the ball screen defensively How can you create something here Kick out CPA GOT A THREE WHO else but Roman Caleeppa He has been the guy for the Pit Panthers cheering Doing a little bit of everything for the Blue and Gold tonight Corin swipes it away from Schwagger Its one of those things too like I held my breath a little bit seeing Caleppa come towards the ball Four fouls He is a massive piece to this Pittsburgh puzzle Thats five applause and cheering And a fifth foul against J Carris just about a minute into the overtime period A huge loss for Wake Forest That is a killer And another one of those unnecessary ones right Tio Yeah I mean that you have four fouls Thats one you just play position defense and make sure that you stay in front He knew it too No argument coming I mean such a talented player Youre on the road in ACC play And to be honest with you too like he wasnt terrific in the second half and had to sit a large portion of that second half with foul trouble but got to have him on the floor Barry Dunham Jr applause makes the first for Pit Thats the ninth team foul on Wake Forest So next one means Pit will be shooting two the rest of the way And Denning goes two for two when it counts More set pieces now Wake Forest without their starting point guard without their superstar Juke Harris on the bench with five fouls Where do you find your offense here Thats a good one Down and open Schwagger who knocks down a three to tie the game Just really good action You have to respect the roller Some miscommunication You have the pop guy whos finally able to get a three to fall Seven points 10 rebounds for Schwigger Witherspoon goes down to sele kick it back out Witherspoon setting up his offense trying to beat Kovvin initis goes baseline on Aens and cant finish Thats a killer injury side is such a strong move Just rolls out Here we go It looks like its the same set and Coleman has the mismatch and Corin not in legal guarding position Nice drive against your mismatch But this is the exact same set they just ran But Schwigger you see the dribble handoff coming You have to respect Trayvon Spillers as a roller And then Schwigger able to get one to fall and on the game Schwigger one of four from three Finally able to find a range So heres Kovven at the line A blue transfer cheering 83 from the strike on the season and he has been very good there tonight as well Kovven eight for nine from the line in this game Big reason why Wake Forest Hes able to regain the lead cheering screaming and Kovvin goes two for two nine for 10 Make it on the night If Im Forest Im running that play over and over again Find a way to make Pitts stop it or wait till they stop it rather Forhand just picked up his second on the other end One of the few Panthers not in foul trouble here in overtime Cummings on the wing Big time three He got it Big time shot Big time pass too from Omari Witherspoon And just like that Panthers take the lead right back cheering Onepoint game Coven driving spinning no foul Good defense by Corin Loose ball taken by Carr and Akins comes up with it Shot clock does not reset Throws good for Coven What a game Sometimes its better to be lucky than good laughter Bodies flying babies crying Miles Kovven limping Who needs a Mona Lisa And knocking down shots Sea sat on the rim Nearly got the roll and Akins will slow things down cheering What a game Same set cheering Tom Schweer cant get free Kovven with 10 on the timer Has it stripped by Witherspoon Foul called I say this Pits coaching staff not named Jeff Cable needs to get their behinds back to the bench There have been times they have ran out on the floor Like so flagrant ones been called deemed unnecessary Yep Pit will get two free throws which is not necessarily a given Thats correct And then they will get a spot throwin closest to the foul call So over in front of Steve Forbes So Witherspoon cheering makes the back half cuts it to one but thats the key part is that the Panthers get the ball as well due to the flagrant one on Koving Fresh shot clock And heres a big piece and this is a great graphic to describe the pit season so far They have struggled from the free throw line in games that have been close Witherspoon kicks to Cummings Back to Witherspoon Step back three Not enough on it And the Panthers still down Wade Forest gets the ball back And it looks like Steve Forbes is going to use a to0 I I did not like that shot right there I that that ball needs to touch the paint You need to move the ball around have the ball touch the paint get as Jeff Cable and Steve Forbes look on 20 on the shot clock out of the timeout Heres Akens setting up his offense Witherspoons on it Akens with his eyes on the shot clock Scream comes from Kovven Running out of time Just five for the Demon Deakons and nothing coming together Aens has a tough contested shot Not the possession they wanted And now Pittsburgh has it Sixsec difference shot in game clock Jeff Cable uses a timeout And heres my thing Miles Coleman you need him to be the guy You get him in a oneonone Let Roman go attack the basket Attack the glass Well see what they do Cummings with it On him Screen comes from Corin Cummings Step back Finds Witherspoon Witherspoon Jumper falls Rake Forest has a timeout Pittsburgh leads by one and Steve Forbes will use it Hey Im telling you Ive been to Pittsburgh three times this year Here we go Dean Deakons down one in OT cheering Coven off the catch for three Too strong Witherspoon hauls it in and he draws a foul And Im Id be shocked after the play was over Akens and Im not sure if were going to be able to take another look at this Aikens maybe not take took a swing but there was a little extracurricular right here Were going to take a look Coven gets open and you want that shot a little bit earlier because you want a chance at the offensive glass Now were going to look right here Look at the end of the play cheering And we zoomed in on the wrong spot but thats okay I I thought that might have been a little something extra at the end Look fortunate that they didnt call it screaming So you see Witherspoon just 59 from the line on the season Well take one more look at it here at the end of the play And goes down Look at this extra like that There was a little There was a little something there This is the big free throw though 677 seconds No timeouts for Pit This is the big shot He hits it Wake Forest 67 to go No timeouts They got to have a three cheering cheering Akens to inbound Pumped away by Seppoa But it stays Forest Paul No its not going to We have a foul call thats going to go on Akens here And they waved it off Waved it off KBad raised his fist as if he was going to call a foul with this Thats a non call So were going to get back to it Remember Wake Forest hit a big shot earlier this season against Memphis Long pass cheering wrapping around the front Were going to see Spillers get it right at half court too far Eve Dunning Jr intercepts hands off to more Panthers draw the foul cheering and theyll shoot free throws Pass a little bit too high applause Take a look same play as they had in Memphis against Memphis rather at the Bajar Mar in the Bahamas earlier this season Execution not the same Pittsburgh the team that weve talked about has not been good from the line this season They are six for seven from the stripe in this overtime Its amazing This is a huge win for the Pit Panthers Coach Jeff Cable So Pittsburgh gets it done in OT Big time shots in big moments from a
