have Northridge on the schedule if youre Stanford Sea Sun winners of four straight out of the Big West Conference The Matadors and Cardinal meeting for a third straight season here inside Maples Pavilion Stanford ended Sea Suns campaign last year in the first round of the NIT Tony Padilla Michael Greenstein Mark Fulton your officials Fulfana on the block had it altered inside A late whistle and a foul And Sea Sun got to the free throw line 30 times last time out dropped a hundred on Sack State Monday in a win at home Theyll take a couple free throws just 16 seconds in tonight Well this is an aggressive team Chris What theyll do is what just what you saw They will attack the rim to try to pound the offensive glass One of the leaders in the country in offensive rebounds So when you when youre playing against a drive you got to get out there and cover down crack down and try to seal off the back side of the boards This is an uptempo sea sun team 11th in the country in adjusted tempo Well they like to score and score in transition 92 points per game across their eight wins Just 62 points per game across their losses Theres Stanford trying to win a fourth straight Theyve won six of their last seven Ryan Agarwal in the starting five for a second straight game Rajosi to the floor A parro with the shot clock into single digits Heres Okorei with a flip up top Dealer extra pass Apara sticks the three Nice patience by Stanford The shot clock dwindling down Calmly get the ball to Okoro who knocks one down Aquars 13th triple of the young season Secondyear Cardinal transfer from Harvard as Ogaro misses his first attempt Cissson is terrific on the offensive glass but Hughes couldnt hit the second opportunity from outside Gayler way outside And it bounces off taken by Davius Lori who had a season high 20 points Monday against Mike Bby and Sacramento State at home Heres Davis This uptempo offense leads to an open corner pop and a knockdown for Larry Hughes who leads Cissson Sun at almost 18 and a half a game Textbook drive and dish to the corners Thats where you want to be on drives Larry Hughes II his father Larry Hughes senior first round pick out of St Lewis had a nice decadel long career in the NBA including a couple years in the early 2000s with the Golden State Warriors And thats an offensive foul on Chisamak Par who tried to use the elbow to get a little more space on the base Well good call by Tony Padilla You know obviously the defender sold it but still you cant lead with the elbow When you do that you initiate contact The right call was made You know this is an aggressive team Theyre not going to if youre playing if youre Stanford youre going to have to get used to a team playing you awfully aggressively Josiah Davis on a bounce An easy two for Mammud Fauana whos got three of the first six for Caesana in his third year with the Matadors Came over from division 2 with Andy Newman as Oki misses off the back rim Another one and done trip for Stanford They feed Fauana inside and he cant get this one to go but headed back to the free throw line for a couple more Yeah and thats what he does Hes very good for Fana attacking the glass Hes a big time rebounder but hes really good at getting to the basket And Andy obviously Newman talked to us about that He really enjoys this veteran player thats able to get to where he wants to go Andy Newman has often referred to Mimmude Pana as the glue of this Sea Sun team Hes from this region San Jose out of Santa Teresa High School Went to West Valley College for a couple years then Cal State San Bernardino where he came off the bench in Andy Newmans final division two season a final four squad And well he was the only guy that tked over to Sea Sun with him Well exactly But theres a little bit of a story with West Valley Well get into that later Uh very familiar territory to Andy Newman Couple free throw misses for Fauana who shoots him at just 60 Apara draws a foul on this end He made nothing or something out of nothing there I mean he got to the rim and thats what hes done Hes done that his whole his whole career But Cal Smith knows that hes you know done such a good job here at Stanford Chris Hes built a winner Came over here from Washington State where he was a Pack 12 coach of the year been successful at every stop hes been at from Columbia to USF Hes brought his style of play and hes done nothing but win games since hes been at Stanford Kyle Smith led Stanford to 21 wins in his first season last year 119 in the ACC Made it to the second round of the NIT Also set the program record for made threes last season as Apara splits the pair at the free throw line Twopoint lead early for Sea Sun Aiden Camman has come off the bench early for the Cardinal as has Grady Lewis for Sea Sun Hughes spots up and nails his second triple Well how about his range I mean you talk about a guy that you better be ready He let that go between the 10second line and the top of the key I mean thats a thats a long range missile that he just knocked down already 46 made threes this season for Larry Hughes I shooting better than 40 from out there Raosi in a crowd couldnt massage it in and its claimed by Davis Now he could have drawn a foul there Just kind of hurried himself Didnt need to Had a smaller defender on him Davis lost it into the ready arms of Aiden Cameron coming off the bench tonight Has started eight of the first 13 games this season for Stanford Theres theres that switching defense that Andy Newman talked about Theyll switch one through five Davis picks up O Cororey Late in the clock here for the Cardinal Gayler recovers the deflection Apara tease a three and its taken inside by Agaro Stanford just one of five from the field to open the game as the Matadoras turn it over for a second time And Stanford will have it on the other side Sea Sun from the Big West Early 94 lead here on the farm over the Stanford Cardinal in the nonconference finale for both teams snorts None of those guys were able to figure it out Andy Newman has No you think Put this in perspective Chris Theyve had nine winning seasons last 34 years Andy Newmans about to get three of those So uh hes done a good job Really announced himself to the college basketball world with a win at UCLA back in his first season First ever trip to the NIT for this sea sun program last year And well early in this game Chisum Apara has his fingerprints all over the offensive side of the floor for Stanford Well hes the one factor Chris that really makes you difficult to guard because hes able to get to the basket And one reason is hes really improved his threepoint shooting You know you you get your threepoint shooting down Hes had some big games this year where hes knocked down threes Now you got to guard him at the at the threepoint line So hes able to get to the rim absorb contact and hes hes made a career of getting to the free throw line Stanford got to the free throw line as a team 41 times last time they played a week ago in Phoenix in a win over the Colorado Buffaloos Sea Sun one of the best tempo teams in the country They race up the floor get off a quick three but an empty trip James Evans off the bench missing out of the corner And Our somehow adjusting inside his first points Benny Giler with the slight of hand on the inbounds to make matters worse for the Matadors Thats the Achilles heel for this Sea Sun team as Okorei works inside and draws a foul Chris I I mean you said somehow theres the behind the back put it up with your other hand and scored I mean he does things to the basket that other players just dont do Forget about as a freshman Most players dont do that Hes able to get to the rim absorb contact and and find a way to score Checked in today seventh in the country in scoring at more than 22 points a game the true freshman from NSHA New Hampshire as Jeremy Dent Smith comes off the bench replacing Benny Geler 32 points against Colorado a single game freshman scoring record for Stanford And there have been a lot of great basketball players that have spent their freshman seasons with this Cardinal program Yeah And I coached against him so I know firsthand And hes as good as as all of them And hes just had a phenomenal fresh freshman year Evans wraps it inside Nice find And theres the division 2 transfer Grady Lewis who played up this way at Cal State East Bay for three seasons Now his second year at Cissson Yeah they took advantage of McCory that time Got a great turned his head and got beat for the layup Lewis coming off the bench after starting a couple games early in the year And Oscar Hilte fouled inside The true freshman from Belgium whos averaging about 11 minutes a game off the bench for Kyle Smith Hes done a great job But again its Auka Aores thats really helped the big guys in this team score Hes really a good passer You talk about his scoring but he put that ball just feather pass over the top enabled Rajosi to get to the free throw line Josiah Davis couple of starters get back on the floor for Cissson Lets get the reverse jinx going Hes 20 30 Hes 12 for 39 which means hes going to make that one See how that goes No Wrong guy You had the right idea That was Kyle Smith would like to see AJ Roshi at the free throw line a little more and have him go in Yeah No Heres Josiah Davis with a whip out Evans takes it into the paint Mgaro the welltraveled sixthear senior Off balance missed it inside And here come the Cardinal with numbers Oh Cory to the basket Lays it in Hes so good in transition Yeah I I I I short change Hilty on that last one The foul coming this way Its on Stanford as Jordan Brinson tried to drive it inside Yeah nice look Jeremy D Smith just Thats a nice break Three threeman break You know Andy Newmans not happy his guys didnt get back in transition but thats a new look for Stanford this year Theyre really trying to push the ball Theyve got numbers Theyve got depth And when youve got numbers Chris you push the basketball You try to take advantage of of attacking before defenses can get set up Benny Geler back in the game following a short rest along with Jaylen Thompson Okaro nice shot fake inside and got smothered by Thompson who just checked in Yeah veteran move Got to the rim Maybe could have scored it but he said You know what Im going to freeze my defender Get him in the air There he is He probably could have laid it up but you know what He got the sure foul I like it Good fundamental play Well Josh Agaro senior from the Cayman Islands College career that began at Oklahoma Then San Jose State which is just down the road from here And KBY Community College for a year Last two seasons in the Sunb Belt at Texas State And the road comes to an end here with Sea Sun Four colleges Thats thats the nature of the the beast this year And as college basketball goes you see a lot of players extending their career into their fifth and sixth year Good to see players getting an opportunity to finish their careers Im always was for that 13s on the board early An NIT rematch from a season ago Theres a switching defense by Andy Newman Thompson Quick trigger Tapped out to Geler for a second effort Thats what Aiden Keman does Hes so good on the offensive glass Jeremy Dent Smith cant hit from way outside and Fana in among a a crowd of Stanford Cardinal able to pull down the miss Theres Josiah Davis one of the top facilitators in the country across the lane Bana out to Lori whos fouled on a three Davius Lori and you have to respect that shot Hit six triples Monday night at home against SAK State And Jeremy Dent Smith a little late on the closeout defensively Well exactly and and you know you youve got a shooter the worst thing you can do is foul the threepoint shooter You got to go straight up and down You know theres that tendency to want to get out on him and make him a driver but you you got to just stay vertical Davius Lorie sophomore from Chicago 12point per game at Johnny Logan College in Illinois last season The shooting has come on strong of late Andy Newman feels like hes done a nice job adjusting to this level of college basketball after spending a year in JO last season Andy Newman played up in this region for a couple years at West Valley College in Saratoga Played for the great Bob Burton I can tell you that And if you played for Bob Burton you played for not only a great coach but a very very demanding coach And he got a lot of his transition basketball tough defensive mindedness He hes admitted that to us from Bob Burton I hope Bob you watching Hi to coach Burton Yeah Bob Burton 80 years young now and Andy had assisted him as a coach at Cal State Fullerton Phenomenal his time in Orange County Phenomenal coach and at one point was actually elevated to interim head coach taking over for Bob Burton as hell whistled for an extra step Stanford turns it over for a third time early Well coach Burtons still active knowing knowing him Hes out there Hes working with teams and you know you stay in touch with your former coaches for sure but Bob Burtons a guy you want to stay in touch with just a wealth of knowledge and a good guy Nice start here on the road for Sea Sun Theyll get back to the Big West on New Years Day Ogaro spots up front rim the three Lori keeps it alive inside and last touch by Stanford Well thats that offensive rebounding prowess we talked about And again how good is is are the manadors in offensive rebounding Theyre outstanding They go up and get offensive rebounds Theyre 14th nationally Yeah top 20 in offensive rebounding and total rebounds a game as Ogaro catches one home off the glass Yeah 14th and 15th respectively Uh thats getting it done So youve got to really seal off the glass when youre playing against any Newmans Matador team Stanford just three of their first nine on this end as they settle in following a weekl long break Oki picked up by Lorie Theres Thompson to the baseline Hes open in the corner off the side of the iron and claimed by Hughes Theres Davis Offensive foul Benny Geler took the charge Benny Geler to the spot Benny Geler just got to the defensive spot Thats how you play defense Stanford battling back and theyre going to have to do it defensively Theyre behind They trail by four We got a good one on our hand at the farm Got the ability Chris to knock down shots from deep Weve saw that And obviously Pedigree playing you know in his dads shadows a little bit but Larry Hughes was a tremendous player and his son certainly can can shoot the ball from deep Couple early trays for Larry Hughes to pace Sea Sun Matadors trying to score a power conference win before getting back to the big schedule A near takeaway Raosi down to the floor and traveling called against Stanfords AJ Rahosi Good hustle by by Northridge You know Stanford only connecting on 30 of their shots Chris seven of their attempts though have been from three So theyre relying on the threepoint shot I think they have the ability to get inside maybe and attack the rim as they get to the free throw line Lori wasnt ready for the pass and its picked up by the Cardinal Stanford playing some pretty good defense themselves Nagger Wall flashes the leather takes it to the free throw line on a bounce Cameman low post positioning out to Geler for three Its good You cant give Benny Geler that shot Hes too good for three Hes a automatic threepoint shooter when you give him that space Well Benny Geler in his 89th game in a Stanford uniform Recently notched a 100 career threes Fana sneaks it in off the window Well Benny Geler has carried them in games but hes shooting about 45 from deep Five early points for Mmood Fana the longest tenur matador in his third season with the program Oh Cory off the bounce tried to hang and hit Cameron fouled on the putback attempt More free throws for Stanford Well thats the challenge that Northridge is going to have Chris is that when Benny when when Okore gets switched out on a on a on a big he can drive it and now their guards have to stay in the rebound Stanfords there on the offensive glass because theyre going up against smaller players I think this game is being celebrated as a holiday in a lot of households We havent had a Division One versus Division 1 college basketball game since December 23rd Now we we talked to Kyle Smith about this You know you try to give your guys off Christmas come back but I think almost every team in the country comes back probably late get the practice in but theyre playing and practicing and and theyre getting a chance to play but you know you ask players what theyd rather do They want to play uh go back spend time with family but then come back and play Now Stanfords in the zone and this zone gave Colorado a lot of trouble in their last game Helped them secure a win Larry Hughes elevates from the elbow Another knockdown Hes got eight Zone is good but you got Larry Hughes that makes it even more challenging to go zone Gayler its not that time Here comes Ogaro Sea Sun one of the fastest tempo teams in the country Its Hughes on a heat check He buries another one And Kyle Smith wants to talk things over Larry Hughes for Portal this past off season but felt like Andy Newmans relationship with those NBA guys could help him get to the next level at this program And it did And thats not uncommon That happens not just at Northridge Its certainly unique but it happens a lot of those programs down in Southern California where youve got the pros that are down there and theyre able to work out and train Donovan Young making his season debut for Stanford the sophomore from Pasco Washington and Buuka Okorei Off the glass and good Chris its not the shot thats impressive Its how easy he makes the shot look I mean he goes up over the top He elevates and then uses his off hand probably as well as his strong hand and just kisses it high off the window Cory with eight of the first 18 for Stanford Off to a slow start at home Lori hierarching three bounces off into the ready hands of Ryan Agarwal Young had missed the first 12 games of the season with a lower body injury Al Smith welcoming the depth at that position back with Youngs return here tonight Jaylen Thompson had missed some time early this season with the thumb injury Well its its a big addition to get back Chris because you got Donovan Young whos you know a veteran guy even though hes only a sophomore Hes 68 Hes able to find a Aiden Keman inside He just zips him the basketball He draws a foul Thats a smart play Just try to get it into the into the post area if you can Seventh foul on sees sun and Aiden Cameman taking the front end of the one and one Well and this is a good game Why do you play a Donovan Young You save him maybe for the ACC opener You can but you want to get him some reps before he gets in Hes been out all all this time so you need to get him some repetitions into the game so he can feel comfortable in in the opener Kemans missed three of four free throw attempts this first half The Sea Sun lead is five Theres Brinson the veteran point guard in his seventh season of college basketball Hughes on target again Stanford back in the zone They did a pretty good job until they left Larry Hughes open again again on penetration and kickout Larry Hughes has 14 points on a perfect four for four from threepoint territory One of the best threepoint shooters in college basketball this year and Chisumak Par fouled inside And more free throws for Stanford We mentioned the 41 free throw attempts Stanford had last time against Colorado This will already be 13 and 14 for the Cardinal in this Well thats where theyre going to have to get their bread and butter here because theyre not shooting the basketball from three So youve got to drive I like that Opara has the ball in the high post Thats a perfect place for him because hes being guarded oneonone and theres no help side But you can see here whats at stake here Look at Stanfords start the 112 start just an outstanding start and Cissson looking for its first win But theyve got some players on this team This is a good tough challenge for Stanford going into the ACC but this is also a good game for Caesar trying to smother Larry Hughes with a hand in his face and he finally misses from the outside Thats good defense by Benny Giler The senior said Look youre not going to youre going to have to go up over the top of me Agarwall pulls the trigger and missed it short Here comes Brinsson and Hughes took an extra step Yeah good call by officials Hes sixth turnover but a sevenpoint lead for the Matadors from the Big West Got eight assists He and Kyle Smiths team generally doesnt give up that high of an assist total They they like to make you hit tough twos or oneonone contested shots I Okori leading Stanford on this end with eight early points Hughes picks up Okori Theres Apara to the baseline up top Jeremy Dent Smith and it bounces out trying to get it to Oscar Heay on the inside Stanfords fifth turnover Yeah I like the attempt looking inside Thats a pretty tough play to defend high to low but just a really good wraparound defense by Sea Sun Matadors nine of their first 16 on this end Already nine free throw attempts for the visitors from Southern California Shot clock into single digits Lori on the drive and draws a foul Attack the freshman Oscar Hilt and Davius Lori will take more free throws Already his fourth and fifth attempts No thats a good offensive move Benny Giler doing a pretty good job now on Hughes but youre making other players have to guard oneonone with no help because youre not going to come off of Larry Hughes So thats smart You drive the side Larry Hughes is being defended and theres no help defender there Five straight games in double figures for Davius Lorie whos now started 12 of Caesars first 14 games on the docket Lone power conference game on the schedule for the Matadors trying to avenge losses here each of the last two seasons Andy Newmans first game as Sea Suns head coach was here in Maples Pavilion more than a couple years ago A par spins and scores off the window Yeah they needed a heavy diet of that Chris Thats pretty unstoppable if you can get the ball down and deep on the blocks Carl Alex Shimchick Jr from Germany seeing his first action and a foul on the floor against Stanford Theyre over the limit So Jordan Brinson the seventh year senior music from Englewood down south will tow the free throw strike for the one and one I think Stanford will pick things up offensively but what theyre going to challenge is going to have to be on this end of the floor And when Stanfords gotten in trouble this year they picked their defense up Thats really whats helped turn the tide because theyre a good team in transition but youve got to get some stops Jordan Brinsson one of 14 active college basketball players that began their career in college before 2020 Brinssons been all over the place UAB Utah Valley Salt Lake City College Fresno State third season at Sea Sun Injuries a part of just about everybodys journey when youre a seventh eighth year guy like we see every now and again but hes turned out to be a steady backup point guard for this Matador team Uh hes been a a really a great addition and you know valuable to his team Ninepoint lead for Sea Sun trying to make it backtoback seasons for the Big West with a win here on the farm Kpali beat Stanford in here last November And Chisum Par trying to help Stanford through some early offensive struggles gets back to the free throw line I like they go to Chisum Parro again when they need a basket or some free throw attempts He is a real difficult guard defend hard to player oneonone both on the block and in the high post area You mentioned this the big west Chris Big West has had some pretty good teams now You you dont even you know we havent even talked about teams like uh UC Santa Barbara and and and Russ Turner and Joe Pastnack and the teams at at Irvine who have been on top but UC San Diego now just the way they played and Hawaii having a great year This league is just loaded this year It could be one of the best years that that the Big West has had in in several years UC San Diego represented the Big West Almost knocked off Michigan in the round of 64 back in March and off to a 102 start this year despite losing their head coach to New Mexico in the offseason Larry Hughes on a heater Yeah stop it Larry Hughes Just stop it I mean laughter I mean enough if youre playing if youre Stanford you got to hope he just quiets down but you got to do something either get it out of his hands or you know get somebody to maybe double him Stanford fans murmuring Youre killing me Larry Cory missed it inside Here come the Matadors trying to stretch this lead to double figures Davis inside tried to muscle it up Taken by Heilte Thats good defense by Stanford They were tough at the rim Jeremy Dent Smith D2 first team allAmerican each of the last two seasons at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Southern California Someone Kyle Smith calls the best facilitator on this team Smith driving Oh missed it Shimch with some nice defense inside for Sea Sun They had a mismatch inside They had a guard guarding their biggest player Just couldnt get it to him Five minutes left in this first half Sea Sun has led for the bulk of it Davis crossing spinning left it short and a foul on Sea Sun going the other way Will put the Cardinal back at the line where theyve attempted two fewer free throws than field goal attempts early in this game You know it happens that way sometimes Chris You got to take what you what the defense you know kind of gives you and theyre giving you the drive and so Stanfords taking advantage of it But you know Stanford shows you how tough they are to score on when you get the ball to the rim you got to go over some big guys and and its tough to finish So but I like the aggressiveness of the defense hopefully down the stretch of this half maybe to turn the tide a little bit Yeah thats its one thing that Kyle Smiths team has done They theyve gotten to the free throw line You can get there 40 plus times Thats thats thats getting it done On pace to get close to that as hell take connects on first with Stanford now in the double bonus Oscar Helte averaging more than four points per game Seeing a lot of time as a backup big for the Cardinal Okorei boards the heel miss A chance for this to be a bigger possession for Stanford Heelte on the block Wraps it in Yeah thats smart basketball Benny Geler gives up a shot Gets the ball inside and what happens They get they get to turn around Two points at the rim Winds up a threepoint trip Hughes on a catch AND SHOOT HE KNOCKS DOWN ANOTHER ONE Im watching it Chris and Im still having a tough time with it I mean doesnt matter where he catches hes got rhythm hes got confidence and hes letting it fly Larry Hughes lighting up Maples Pavilion 19 points five first half triples Well go back to Heilte in the low post Jeremy Dent Smith with five on the timer Drops it off block Par fouled again Yeah good play I mean not much going on for Stanford but when they get the ball into Chisum Pararas hands he can make something happen Hes really difficult to guard around the block But you talk about Larry Hughes you know weve watched some pretty good performances that is really uh hes putting on a show And the only thing that might slow down Larry Hughes is foul trouble Just picked up his second And itll be interesting to see how Andy Newman manages this the final four minutes of the half Well Chris I had a philosophy when you had a big lead youd probably get him out If its game is closed youre behind You got to leave him in But then again you got to trust your player a little bit too A lot of it comes down to personal trust Uh you just dont want to pick up an offensive foul Then you got to be a little bit probably softer defensively But how do you take out a guy thats had this kind of half Its hes been there Hes been just the load for them A dozen for Chisumak Parra whos attempted 10 free throws this first half at home Late in the clock here for Cissson They dont often let it get down to single digits on this end Brinsen got to go Fauana on the move Blocked out of bounds by Aara Right as time expires on the shot clock Theyll look at it as we step aside with 333 to play in the half Larry Hughes So you dont want to get anything to the rim Nothing to the rim Brinsson triggers Knocked away byte and a shot clock violation Good play by Andy Newman to try to get that tip but smart play by Stanford They knew it had to be a tip and they played it accordingly Good defense Andy Newman thirdyear head coach of the Matadors a power conference win in his first season at UCLA which really announced to the college basketball world out west that Sea Sun was to be respected again A program that didnt have a winning season for well over a decade until Andy Newmans arrival Oh Cory off the bounce And that foul on the floor will put Stanford back at the free throw line These will already be the Cardinals 21st and 22nd attempts of this opening half Yeah more as you mentioned more free throw attempts than field goal attempts But you just talked about Andy Newmans mark on the program You can go into UCLA youre right from down the road and you get a win Thats getting peoples attention and more importantly than anybody elses attention Youre getting your own programs attention your players the confidence and it helps you on the recruiting trails Tied a program record with 22 wins last year O Cory one for two nine first half points for the freshman phenom who leads Stanford at more than 22 a game Only Camboozer of Duke AJ Debanso of BYU averaged more per game as true freshman this year Grady Lewis spinning inside Missed it off the side of the iron Hell with a nice box out and board Yeah good good defensive positioning by Hilt Really nice Final three minutes of the half and Stanford make a push before the break They trail by seven on their home floor for their final preacc tuneup Ryan Agarwal in the starting lineup for a second straight game Swings it Akara flashes the leather puts it on the deck and draws another foul He has been a foul magnet this first half And thats smart basketball Chris because what theyre doing is theyre attacking the rim and the paint And theres openings and Aubara is getting there Hes a tough cover Hes able to get to the free throw line and theyre keeping themselves in this basketball game by by getting free throws The sixth foul Chisum Pora has drawn this first half Now eight of 11 from the free throw line Now two possession game If they can now get a stop together and come down and convert maybe cut this thing down theyll be in good shape at halftime But your sea sun youve got other ideas You want to see if you can keep that momentum and just balloon this up a little bit with some momentum 144 Apara closing in on his season average of 15 points here before halftime Brinson picked up his dribble Fana tried to sneak it inside Lewis recovers off the carum Five to shoot The baby hook pops out and tapped back in but it was hanging around the cylinder Offensive basket interference No points for Sea Sun Well thats a thats a tough break again for a team that just goes and gets offensive rebounds That ball is sitting up there That was close That that was a really close one And Andy Newmans asking for a little verification uh from the veteran official music This is a veteran crew here but theyre going to look at it on the monitor here Thats a good challenge Uh Chris thats a big basket If that if if that gets overturned that gives them that lead they want you know right before halftime So theyre going to look at it on the monitors Call on the floor is a sea sun turnover No points for Joshua Garo The call on the floor has been challenged under review Yeah And again for our viewers this year youve got to make sure that its overturnable not just slightly Its got to be uh really uh definitively overturnable Um enough evidence to show that the the call should be overturned So the officials have to determine in their estimation that this is certainly uh going to be overturned Its got to be enough evidence to show that Hopefully well get another look but uh you know from here it looked like it was so close worth challenging So if this challenge is unsuccessful Cissson not only loses a timeout but they lose the ability to challenge anything the remainder of the game Well theres the look Its up in the air You know thats just right on the right on there And I think if if again if its close you have to kind of leave the call I think thats a better vantage point there It I think youll get the best look here That may be off the left side of the rim Yeah I I dont know anything about that My shots never went off the rim left or right They were pretty much down the middle So I Theyre either air balls or down You know you I knew youd catch me laughter on that one Youre too smart for me Sylvester I got to be careful You know its interesting Uh but you you bring up a good point too and just stating the rule that you you lose the timeout So how valuable will that be Thats valuable but getting this basket overturned is valuable too Its a its a its a look And now you have guys on the bench too Chris that can look at their monitors and theyre telling their head coaches Hey coach challenge Offensive basket interference call on the floor Its been confirmed Itll be Stanford ball So they they uphold and and so you lose it But but Andy you know hell I mean Andy Newman is just discussing it with Mike Greenstein just to see And you know theyre theyre in their determination It wasnt enough It It was so close I I can see the rationale for challenging I really can Now if youre Sean you just you know you didnt get the basket so you have to come down and get a stop and try to regain that momentum that you had when you built that double digit lead Sea Suns led by as many as nine this first half on the road Iuka Okori swings it gets it back from Chisum Par Little twoman game A par and it bounces out Last touch by Stanford Cardinal just two of 11 from the outside after a seven of 21 showing from threepoint territory last time they played against Colorado in Phoenix Yeah that thats little been been a little streaky but a lot of thats had to do with the Sea Sun defense too Theyve been at the threepoint line pretty well Cs had a little more difficulty guarding against the drive Thats Thats an offensive foul A moving screen on Grady Lewis Yeah thats a good call Post player was trying to get down Lewis trying to get a a running head start for his teammate but you got to come to a jump stop Good call by the officials You know interesting Larry Hughes is now setting screens And if youre a good shooter and you set screens your your mans basically a no help man So setting screens can enable your teammates to get open Thats good strategy by coach Newman Feed Hilt inside He spins on Lewis and floats it in for two And thats good strategy by coach Smith Continue to go to the basket and get some easy ones Oscar Hilte Six points three boards in 10 first half minutes off the bench for Kyle Smith Ogaro feeds Fauana down the baseline and up the escalator for the jam Boy he went to the top floor on that one Chris I mean nobody at home and just flushed it No resistance Mahmud Fauana captain on this team Seven points cheering and Stanford turns it over Aggerwall could not find his footing now A little hesitant I think he wanted to shoot it The defender got there just in time I mean but watch this drive The baseline flush Defense didnt get down there quick enough Good ball swing and drive A good job by catching it on the run on the move Larry Hughes with a game high 19 for Sea Sun Shimchick lines it up Missed it badly Alex Shychic just two of 11 now from threepoint territory this season See if Stanford tries to go two for one Not in a hurry Oh Cory off the back rim Cameman had his hands on it Instead it ricochets to Brinson And now Cissson can hold for the first halfs final attempt Yeah this is a big basket potentially Again this could push this to a threep possession game on a score Hughes trying to feed Shimchick They turn it over Oh Cory steals it into the front court Zigzagging down the lane Lost the basketball and the half court heave Not much of one from Larry Hughes the second but 19 Five triples that first half for Larry Hughes now one shy of 50 on the season right before the halfway point of the year Sea Sun will play 18 more regular season games all against the Big West after this one Chisamar Para lowers his shoulder whips it out Oh Cory wide open and he cans the three Not just good basketball Thats just inside out basketball You go to the rim defense helps out you go right back out outside Cory with the knockdown Josiah Davis stops and starts throws it away Akara the steel soaring inside He lays it in and the games tied You want to draw up a start for the second half Chris you couldnt draw the second half start better than that Great defense by Stanford A quick fivepoint burst out of the break for the Cardinal to pull even Lori elevates Missed it off the heel Aggerwall clears Stanford has not led since it was 1312 in the early minutes of the opening half Oh Cory pulls the trigger and fills it up 8 nothing run for Stanford to start the second half and a timeout sees sun Youve been wondering where I is Hes back Hes turned around the Stanfords fortunes 15 points for Ibuko Cororei who dropped a single game freshman program record a week ago in Phoenix 32 in a resume win over the Colorado Buffaloos See how Cissson responds out of the Andy Newman timeout Lori missed it inside Another one and done trip for the Matador is out of the break A par and Okori have combined for 31 of Stanfords 41 And the Cardinal who shot 24 free throws that first half draw another foul here Yeah watch Ibuka Cororey He plays with so many different speeds but he knows hes got a defender on his side and he just rides him to the basket knowing hes going to attract the foul But he you know you say why is he so effective Hes not always the fastest player on the floor Not that hes not quick He is but he changes speeds He changes directions And hes got really good body control to the rim I was talking to Mike Dunley whos here watching from the Warriors and you know hes here watching these guys play uh and you know you know hes got to keep his eyes on players like Ibuka Cororey because hes a guy that can play at this next level even as a freshman you know hes got success written in his future Lori missed again inside and last touch by Sea Sun Its been Stanford this half If Id love to have been in the locker room at halftime for Kyle Smith and his staff theyve obviously got a message across to his team and obviously the sea sun has gotten the attention of Stanford 10 straight for the Cardinal coming out of the break Agger walls open and he buries the corner three Simple basketball Chris You go inside you draw three defenders and you knock it down out to your threepoint shooting uh slash artist in Ryan Agarall Thats 13 straight for the Cardinal Davis touch shot inside off the side of the backboard Oh Cory cant hit that time That would have brought the house down and maybe even another timeout Cissson looking for its first points of the second half And they go to reliable Larry Hughes up to a game high 21 Yeah you just cant leave him Oh Cory hits another three You cant leave him either Were seeing a shootout at OK Carell Chris youre watching Okore and Hughes put on a shooting exhibition A 20 piece for Ibuka Okorei Seventh time hes notched 20 points in a game through his first 11 in a Stanford uniform Tough take and finish for Joshua Garo Well Cory lost it A takeaway Josiah Davis dashing down the lane and he cheering scores plus the foul Boy Sea Sun needed that Well they were about to go down and trailed by even more until the turnover and now the chance at a threepoint play Heres a drive Defender turns and youre able to get the contact draw the foul and score the basket Big time play for Sea Sun on that play and Davis Really nice drive by Josiah Josiah Davis Just great body control This is kind of the pace we expected the entirety of the game and we didnt get much of that in the first half because of all the free throws between the two teams Well the teams were playing aggressive but I I youre right and both teams good in transition good depth Both teams players Youre not playing just four or five guys Camps out and drills the three Now theyve got their version of of marksman Theres the rifleman Bennett Keeler Stanford hit two threepointers the first 20 minutes of the game Theyve got five here in the first three and a half minutes of the second half Now they can shoot it but theyre getting better quality shots Chris Thats the difference Davis picking his way and missed everything inside Thought he was fouled Here comes Geler Flips it across the floor Aara jump stop It finds its way to Aggerwall on the baseline Taylor holsters his weapon Yeah very patient He could have shot it Jeremy Dent Smith on the drive and he stumbles Draws the reachin foul on James Evans Well Stanford doing a better job now Theyre theyre spotting up and getting better looks You say why is the ball going down now Theyre getting much better rhythm jump shots off of drives penetration pitch post touches double teams on the block and then kick outs Thats an easier way to get threes Josiah Davis three fouls Cissson with a multitude of other guys that have two Right now Davis staying on the floor picking up Raosi in the low post Akaro with five on the timer elevates and flips it in Thats a confident shot off the glass Didnt look like he had much of an angle to the rim but he got there and he kissed it high off the glass for the two Stanford is sizzling coming out of the half 21 points for the Cardinal in 4 minutes and 19 seconds after scoring 33 the first 20 minutes of the game Its all Cardinal all the time at a halftime here in the nonconference finale at Maples Pavilion Ibuka Oy with three long range hits Hes got 20 points in the blink of an eye And Stanfords up double figures at home Down A couple trays for Benny Geler tonight whos now got 105 in his Cardinal career Hes hes a marksman Sea Suns been outscored 216 coming out of the half and a miss from Evans on the baseline claimed by Rahosi Matador is just three of their first nine from the field Meanwhile Stanford seven of eight and five of those seven makes from threepoint territory Looked like a completely different team coming out of halftime Apara on the crossover stops at the free throw line leans in and it rolls out Well Stanford also doing a better job of cleaning up the first shot defense Clean rebounds not giving up seconds Go cradles it high off the glass and basket interference Evans had no business putting his hand on the rim Youre right That ball was going down and he did not need to go on the rim Thats an automatic You can see it Shot goes up high off the glass Thats going to go down And now the offensive interference Thats unfortunate Just you know you want to be aggressive but you got to kind of just you got to show some discipline and lay off Rajosi on the take scores Yeah good play Stanford getting the ball on the elbow right at the corner of the free throw line Youre only one or two dribbles away from the rim Those are good set plays by Stanford Stanfords lead is a dozen Agaro ran the same play This time no basket interference Now you werent going to see that happen twice but a really good play I I think uh Sea Sun giving Stanford their own medicine the drive from the elbow Josh Ogaro with eight points on three of seven shooting for Sea Sun Theyve got to lock in on this end The buckets have come too easy for Stanford in the second half as I Okori draws another foul headed back to the free throw stripe Hes done that this year Chris Hes really made something out of nothing I mean he drives the lane and hes just so hard to defend because he finds his seam and he gets the ball up to the rim The true freshman who was the Gatorade State player of the year in high school in New Hampshire drawing almost eight fouls per 40 minutes which is top 20 in the country His next free throw attempt here in his 11th college basketball game will be his 100th Well and thats an example of what we call we used to say dont settle You tell your players dont settle Ibuka Cororey doesnt settle Hell take what the defense gives him or if he needs to make something happen he does not mind getting to the rim or drawing fouls The 11point lead for the Cardinal who trailed by five coming out of halftime Ceson led by as many as nine in the opening 20 minutes Agarwal picks up Ogaro Heres Lori on the baseline and a late whistle Blocking foul on Stanford will put the sophomore from the Windy City at the free throw stripe for two Yeah looked like a clean block Might have been some body but you see its a late call pretty vertical there but then over the top Yeah Stanfords been hard Now usually CES Suns done a good job of getting offensive rebounds Stanfords given him very minimal second chance opportunities this half Davius Lors points exclusively by way of the free throw line tonight Sea Sun will resume the Big West season in Northern California at UC Davis New Years Day The Big West plays what they call bold week where they dip into the conference schedule for a couple of games in early December And Cissson split their first two Big West games with a win at home over Bakersfield and a loss at UC Irvine Irvine picked to win the league this year but UC San Diegos got the best record among Big West programs nearing the resumption of conference play Cameman across the floor Aggerwall knocks down the three Uh he was here early Chris We were watching him warm up He was here early He said he felt better injuryfree and hes playing like it now Sixth Stanford tray in the second half Davis on a spin and a foul on Stanford Jeremy Dent Smith picks it up Theres a world Jeremy Dent Smith just couldnt quite get there in time Absorbed the contact Stanford give you a little bit of a inside out look Third foul on Dent Smith He leaves the game Davis sandwiched out to Brinson and he knocks down the three Theyre dangerous if you give them some looks You You think its just Hughes They got some other guys in this team that can also knock down some shots Seventh tray this season for Jordan Brinen the seventh year senior Back to a single digit game Rajosi lost the handle and a Whos the foul on Looks like its against Stanford Yeah I thought that was a good call It was a loose ball scramble Uh good defense by Sea Sun You can see the drive takes place Good help side defense and then some contact One thing Stanford doesnt want to do Chris is start turning the ball over Now youve built this lead up Dont give it back on turnovers Theyve given up zero fast breaks so far Thats a pretty good stat especially against the Sea Sun team that ranks 11th in the country in adjusted tempo Ogaro showing off his length and athleticism at a twopoint make And he can get to the rim too Stanford cant relax Theyre only up double two possessions now Little little over Back to a sevenpoint game here on the farm 12 minutes to play on the nonconference schedule for both the Matadors and Cardinal ACC play begins for Stanford just three nights from now when Notre Dame comes to town cheering Five on the timer Hell take out to Geler on the fly by Yes sir Rainbow three cheering Cool as a cucumber Chris Benny Giler had to get it off before the shot clock expired He did Brinsson cant answer back cheering Lori grabs the loose ball for Cissson Shot clock didnt reset cheering Davis picked up his dribble Lori on the move Lost the handle Picked up by Geler Numbers for the Cardinal Abuka Oh Cory hammers it through Uh thats a point guard getting up over the top of you for the jam Oh you got to love that play Game high 23 for Ibuka Oi as Joshua Ogaro works his way to the free throw line for a pair on the other side 11 minutes to play on the farm Second half all Stanford and all Iuka Oi game high 20 in this gym today looking at these two teams play Obviously Larry Hughes is on a lot of peoples radar But if youre a freshman and youre playing like Ibuka Cororey youve got to be uh getting the attention of pro scouts as well Well Kyle Smith was very honest with us pregame He wasnt expecting him to adjust to this level of college basketball as quickly as he has No he he kind of said Look I have to kind of play this guy Hes pretty good And and hes honest about it You know um coaches like to take credit for everything And he said I knew he was good Did I know he was this good Probably not But thats thats a credit to Bua Cory too coming here and just showing you what he could do Uh you know in his freshman year Again its not just the points Chris Its the uh ability to play under poise uh toughness Yeah the little problem This look like a hockey substitution here I think theyre changing on the fly Cant do that Frustration shown by Andy Newman He was trying to get Jay Chisum in the game It looked like he hopped over the boards and sent a couple of players on the ice but he was you know hes responding to officials who I think he thought waved him in He made his point I like the officials are going to talk about this now I dont think you want to award any technicals if you dont have to If theres a miscommunication no harm no foul Nobody scored But Im hoping theyll just continue to play not issue technical fouls but the officials will determine that Doesnt matter what I think Tony Padilla Michael Greenstein Mark Fulton veteran crew Oh yeah these guys trying to assess what just happened Yeah I used to have fun with these guys Theyve done games of mine for many years and and theyre a veteran crew I told them theyre all better officials now than they were back in the day probably true of all officials when youre not coaching Well its like everything with more reps you get better Yeah Well theyre good Now they were good then But you know coaches Chris always want calls Theyre always going to Thats their job Theyre like pleading for the defense of their team Lets see which way they go The call on the floor is a class B technical foul for illegal substitution Stanford will shoot one shot and still retain the ball Well I dont think Andy Newman was trying to go six on five At least it didnt look like it I think they just tried to get in there But uh its unfortunate because thats just giving away the basketball giving some points away No surprise they put the 94 free throw shooter Benny Geler at the stripe Well the veteran Mike Greenstein and Andy Newman just kind of they didnt hug it out but they they laughed it out So thats good to see and confirmed by Michael Greenstein Just it was an illegal substitution I think Andy Newman knows it but hell give up the one point Not the end of the world Well this is Stanfords largest lead a 3833 sea sun lead at the half Stanford has already matched its first half point total less than halfway through the second 20 minutes Aara cant hit Heilte going after the loose ball and whistled for the foul Hell get called in the on the push Thats a good call by the official Little hand in the back to come up with the ball Its good if you can get away with it cheering Thats the seventh foul on Stanford So Cissson will trot down to the other end and take the one and one Yeah keep your eye on the bonus situation because that could come into play down the stretch of this game much like Stanford got in the early bonus now as Cissson who has gotten there and theyve got 10 minutes plus and trying to build up to maybe a two shot fouls and the double bonus Josiah Davis 76 at the free throw line Cissson the fourth program for the point guard in four years Began his career with Bob Huggin at West Virginia then to Tennessee Tech for a season last year at Niagara in New York Leads the Big West at more than six assists per game Thats a lot Its not many guys in the country that can boast six plus assists Good to see Donovan Young getting some more minutes in this half as well Donovan Young making his season debut for Stanford tonight 68 sophomore forward from Washington Akara missed it Tapped back out to Okorei Hell load it up and miss it off the back iron Hell live with that Top two scorers attempting shots but not coming through on that last possession Davius Lorie knocks down the three His eighth straight game with a made triple Well hes shooting 36 from three Hes got a ability to stretch the floor and hes knocking him down This is back to a sevenpoint game A Cororey knocks down the triple There he goes again Chris Just when the game gets tight Aorei calmly knocks down a three to stretch the lead 26 for O Corey who set the freshman single game record with 32 last time out That may be in some jeopardy and Cissson headed back to the free throw line as Davis is fouled on the floor Yeah good penetrating pitch there You know you got to get up there You youre playing against a Cory You know hes going to drive you but you you forget that hes going to knock down threes if you dont get your hands up CO doing a good job Chris So getting to the free throw line really now and thats how they can hang in this game They had a post up situation posting up Benny Geler on the block Stanford didnt come down with help and Davis was able to draw a foul Thats good basketball screaming Couple more free throw makes for Davis Stanford has hit 10 threes in this game eight of them after halftime And Alori has half of those makes from distance in this second half Aar spins drops it off Rajosi loses the handle cheering and a foul on Stanford will put Sea Sun back at the free throw That thats out thats outstanding defense Watch the help the dive down thats called Youre halfway on the catch Youre all the way on the dribble And thats just a great great job of digging down on the post Just what you want to do You want to get there on the dribble You dont want to get there on the catch Soon as the post player dribbles it you you attack on the dribble cuz he cant pull it back Nice job Larry Hughes had 19 in the first half just two points since Chance to get reactivated at the free throw line The senior from St Louis who spent the last three years at St Lewis Stanford beat the Bilicans down in Palm Springs late last month and on paper thats Stanfords best win to this point Yeah No thats a good win and its a road win too So you you take that and you know you say well youre not playing a lot of road games but you got enough of those coming up in in the in the conference Im okay with that I think you want to get your culture built You want to be able to have your team play You know Cal Stanford teams that play at home Youve got tough spinals going on So you you you know youre going to do plenty of cross country traveling Get as many games as you can close to home Couple knockdowns at the free throw line for Larry Hughes the second Hes got 23 Feed to Young in the high post Lob it inside the heel tay and it bounces out Thats a great high low look Just didnt complete the play Brushed himself just a little bit Chance for Sea Sun to creep closer and Lorie scores off the feed from Josiah Davis and Kyle Smith wants to talk things over Stanford stretched the lead to 12 but Sea Sun thanks to six straight Its a fourpoint game with 8 and 12 minutes to play Good if they can get Aar to attack on a oneonone and see if Accorey can make something happen uh as well Well the first game between two division one teams in four days and Cissson hanging around here on the farm and the final nonconference tilt for both teams Ibuka Oy game high 26 Bad pass taken away by Davis Coast to coast He scores it off the window Eight straight for Sea Sun Its a twopoint game Well thats an uncharacteristic turnover by Ibuka Aore Just kind of a slow floating pass Youd rather see him try to attack and make something happen offensively Dont count out the Matadors Hell in a crowd out to an open Cory and he missed this time but Hell had it for a moment Knocked away by Hughes and Sea Sun has it Yeah Kyle Smiths really disappointed He just given the ball away last few possessions Davis oh hes starting to feel himself Couple free throws and a chance to tie it for Josiah Davis the welltraveled senior from Canada who started his career in power conference hoops at West Virginia In isolation the help side was coming and you were getting kickouts for threes Theyve got to go back to that And I I know thats why Kyle Smith took that time out screaming Josiah Davis had 22 points Monday and a win at home against Sacramento State and has pulled Sea Sun within a point Yeah theres something psychological Chris Youre up or down by 12 You come back music now with this free throw and you have a chance to tie it now Psychologically you know youre back in this basketball game Thats 10 straight for the Matadors to pull even And Josiah Davis reaches double figures with 10 points Well Corys had a big second half dealer plays it back to Agarwal out of the shot fake and a reach in foul on Lori the fourth against Cissson in this half Yeah and thats good execution They had Cayman Keman on the block really being fronted and but their helpside defense was there on the backside thats allowing Agarwal and some of their players the ability to get open Thats why hes able to draw that foul Good set by Stanford Five free throw attempts here in the second half after Stanford to 24 the opening 20 minutes of the game Akara picked up by Ogaro and fouled Yeah theres no theres just theres no answer Youve got Okara isolated Youve got to bring a second side help defender there and they didnt do it in time and they drew a foul So thats the recipe where Stanford was able to get to the free throw line Theyre going back to it I like it Andy Newman yelling from the sideline He wants to get his helpside coverage solidified But you know thats tough if you decide to help on the block against Okara Youve got sharpshooters on the perimeter and Geler Abukori and Ryan Agarwal Three guys that can nail threepoint shots Next free throw for Abara will be his 14th attempt Well thats just a thats a ymans work You youre getting the line 14 times Thats getting it done You know Stanford back in the zone now Theyre going to try to try to uh disrupt the rhythm here of Sea Sun Davis with a jump stop Slithers inside Fana tried to tap it back Its taken by Ke Oh Cory glides Tried to use the off hand and it bounced out Yeah kind of had his strong hand if he wanted it but he went to the off hand but nice drive Just didnt finish the play Theres Davius Lori going high off the glass and Cameron vacuums in another rebound The hit ahead Agarwal lays it in Beautiful pass from Ibuka Okorei to set up the transition too Great outlet pass Great fullcourt read and fine by Agarwal Really nice pass Picture perfect Only Okores second assist tonight but it was a big one Stanford builds the lead back to four 6 minutes to play on the farm Hughes watched by Geler Down to five on the timer Agaro has to go Crosses over Puts it up and its short off the front rim Thats the Stanford defense Thats the way they started the half Youve got to get stops if you want to win a basketball game And theyve gotten two in a row Some key stops last few trips down for Stanford Our probing Aara picked up his dribble and drew the foul on the floor Thats number six on CES on this half Hard hard cover Par is trying to get in the gaps Youve got shooters around him So you cant overhelp onto Okara if youre guarding a threepoint shooter Good Good scheme offensive scheme by Stanford Stanford poured in 40 points in this second half Add two more plus one for Ryan Agarwal Well whos open on out of bounds under sometimes its a screener here is the roll back player and Agarwal now whos gotten a really clever play He gets the shot fake freeze fake defender goes up in the air and now has a chance at the threepoint play but hits a big basket on the out of bounds under six straight for Stanford after Cissson tied the game Back to the zone Stanford playing the two3 matchup Kyle Smith has employed this defense throughout his career Hughes from way outside and he fills it up Larry Hughes trying to will CES Sun back Its a threepoint game I I you know Im looking on the floor and the zone looks pretty good to me Everybodys matched up but you need a a hand up and out if youre playing against Larry Hughes Six triples tonight for the senior from St Louis O Cory leaning and getting back to the free throw line for a couple more Youre youre finding guys now Chris that are doing and playing their role which is important Youre watching Ibuka Aorei now getting to the line drawing fouls Youre watching Larry Hughes knock down shots and youre watching Oara as well trying to drive Everybodys got to do what they do Its up to the defense to try to make you do something thats uncomfortable But uh when you play your role and you do what you do well uh thats thats the best thing you can do to help your team 454 to play Ibuka Oori has 27 One more free throw coming That freshman single game scoring record may not last more than a week No that was no fluke either I I I thought the same thing Chris you bring up You know youre going to play a zone I know this is the old barnyard zone but maybe a box in one You better do something You got to keep uh Hughes from getting touches Hes just too good Davis with a nice skip Agarwal came out of nowhere to block the shot Wow What a block by Ryan Agarwal Saved the basket Sure to Stanford comes away with another stop Aggerwall with the shot clock inside of 10 Akara Cameman on the offensive glass A big offensive rebound And Aiden Cmans done that for the Cardinal all year Hes a 69 610 player that can go up and climb the offensive glass Very athletic Down to five on the timer Oh Cory flutters it in for two A 30 piece for the freshman And how about the ease with which he shot that last floater Just made it look easy Well FA in a crowd and draws a foul Free throws for Sea Sun on the other side But Ibuka Oi continues to make noise out west 32 a week ago Hes got a sense about him that most young guys dont have Mood Fauana at the free throw line out of the timeout When you ask Andy Newman whos been the heartbeat of his program his three seasons at Sea Sun look no further than Fana who passed on big money at other programs in the portal to stay at Sea Sun for his final year His two sons youll find them at the end of Sea Suns bench almost every game And they both wear number 11 jerseys because they absolutely love Mimmude Battle Bell will show you something He does it all for this team He gets steals he gets rebounds I mean hes hes he can make assists Hes just a good allaround player but very aggressive Tissson trying to make a late push but theyll need stops down the stretch on this end Another possession where Stanford works late into the clock Hakara pulls the trigger Missed everything and the shot clock didnt reset The officials will stop play to check it out Put 5 seconds back on the timer and Stanford will trigger in from the baseline Well that might have helped Stanford Chris because Ryan Agarall was trapped on the baseline about to fall out of bounds That thats a big break for Stanford I know theyll have a short clock but just to get the ball back and not turn it over huge Thats pretty good defensive possession for Cissson Theyll go back and try to analyze but Andy and Newman very happy with his team and you can see him encouraging his players on the sideline saying Were right here guys We need to stop big time and come down and score and narrow this gap But the officials are going to determine this the time now Stanford ended sea sun season here in the opening round of the NIT back in March Yeah Lets check to see if this ball hit the rim It did It looked like it grazed ever so slightly Thats huge Theyre going to Maybe not Theyre putting three on the timer here You see something maybe that nobody else sees No Well maybe it wasnt a graze but thats a short clock Its got to almost be a quick shot here Put it down to two on the shot clock Agarwal blocked Gets it back and it bounces out Oh I thought that was down too Big break for Sea Sun that Agarell doesnt score it Agaro with a step Patience and a score Threepoint game Yeah you called it patience because there was contact and he just waited and and scored it But now youre Stanford You got to find a way to get on the board 11 and seven for Joshua Garo who almost averages a double double has six this year He picks up Apara on this end Crunchtime hoops in the nonconference finale for Sea Sun and Stanford tonight Oh Cory on a spin and a drive and a miss Matadors can pull even with the tray Agaro threw it away Agarwal steals it Good decision by Agarwal not to kick it ahead and be in a hurry Youve got the lead You got two minutes on the clock You need desperately to get to the foul line or get a score here A timely takeaway for the Cardinal High lob came juggled Saved it to Geler HE LAUNCHES A THREE ITS GOOD cheering Sometimes its better to be lucky than good Oh Benny Gilers not lucky Come on Chris Sylvester Thats Benny Geler at his finest hour Davis picked up his dribble out to the corner Its Hughes with a miss off the back rim Geler taps it into the front court and wisely peels it back out to take more time off this clock Smart play by Benny Geler He could have gone inside Why Your clock is your best friend You got time on your hands You got the lead Dwindle this time down make the game shorter Oh Cory whos got 30 tonight gives it up to Aggerwall and an offensive foul He pushed off Thats good call Thats good defense And and Ryan Agarall knew it But lets look at what happened here And youve got the pass Let me let me better clarify coach I dont think the three was lucky I I think the way Cameron saved the ball in bounds Oh I know I had and tossed it right to his teammate was rather lucky That was actually a good save by Cameron That was heads up because that did save the possession And I agree with you and I I knew what you meant but I had to give Benny Geler a little shot in the arm Its Hughes with an offbalance three and he cant hit this time Aiden Cameron fouled immediately Larry Hughes thought he was hit on that threepoint attempt but Camman will come down to the other end and take the one and one for Stanford with 63 seconds left You know Chris thats two plays in a row Now to get back to your point where Aiden Cam has made two big plays He gets the save on one end and then he goes up and gets the monster rebound and draws the foul Thats huge by Aiden Camman Hes just such a a versatile big guy for Stanford He can defend you Hes unselfish He makes hustle plays for you See those three assists I think that last one was a little lucky Well we we wont disagree on that one But but the effort was there He made the effort to save it Didnt step out of bounds Went behind his back Dont think he had eyes in the back of his head I would tell you that But he he knocks down his free throw Now if youre Stanford you have your your number one goal Dont stop the clock and foul But you must know where Larry Hughes is at You you cant give him an easy open look Couple clutch makes for Cammon who had missed three of his first four from the line Eightpoint lead for Stanford here in the final minute Two3 zone Davius Lorie fouled out on that last sequence Hughes triggers up another one This one bounces off Fana has the stick back and its a sixpoint game 498 Andy Newman takes his penultimate timeout Well youre okay Thats attractive And youve got Cal with Louisville You got both Bay Area teams going to have the ACC teams come in there Youre going to see some pretty pretty well attended games Geler will run the baseline into Ocore who flips it back to Gayler Theres your two best foul line shooters up to Apara to the rim I tried to make a statement here in the last minute music and the officials pointing to Mimmude Fana and this appears to be headed to the monitor Well that would be a break obviously if Stanford can music get some excessive contact Okara had a decision He could have pulled it out and he said No I got a clear path to the rim At least he thought it was But the problem now is you stop the clock And youve got to make your floor is being reviewed for a flagrant foul I think there was a push on the play when Aparo was up in the air And if thats the case they could deem this to be excessive and flagrant That would really put a thorn in the side of Sea Suns chances Already up against it here down six 414 on the clock Well you want a foul Chris But you want to foul early And there there it is Looks like could just be a basketball play Yeah I dont think its anymore I think theyre going to I I didnt see it I mean did you say anymore music But you know you have an opportunity if youre Sea Sun and music rather than the twoshot foul maybe you foul him on the floor make it a oneonone The common foul on the floor stands 52 for Stanford will shoot two shots Well its the two shots either way So so the foul is going to take Yeah foul is going to take place That That foul didnt occur on Apars dunk attempt because its Cameman going to the free throw Yeah they cleared him out and so to the line Yeah good call by the officials They were right on the play and you got Camman with two Always easier to hit free throws when you have that cushion or two rather than the oneonone Camman is a 70 free throw shooter Hammond who had a career best eight rebounds against Sea Sun in the NIT last year has matched that with eight boards and a lot of them down the stretch of this game including four straight free throw makes and some steals Hes one of their league their team leaders in steals They go back to the two3 trying not to foul Eat up a little time now A lot of time here and theres a steal cheering Great job by Stanford making him use clock Now theyll be able to salt this away Gayaylor flips it ahead Hell take throws it down There is your dagger 10point game inside of 20 seconds Agaro has it deflected out by Hiltte who delivered some big time bench minutes for Kyle Smith and company He sure did Stanford had to dig deep I mean they were in a game They trailed this by well over double digits in the first half and they they they came back with a vengeance in the second half Sea Sun led for almost 18 minutes tonight but Stanford ultimately too much in the second half as Ogdaros fouled with 11 seconds left 55 points since the break for Stanford Yeah And you know you you talk about the offense but a lot of that was off the defense Chris And and thats the message Cal Smiths going to get you know to his team Theyll look at film They say Lets why did we why were we able to get 50 plus points in the second half Well they did it with good passing Their schemes were good They attacked at the rim got kick outs They did it off off of fast breaks Theyve done a good job all game long off of fast breaks Stanford has So thats been a real plus for Stanford Theyve done a a really good job Luko Cory with backtoback 30point games Tismar Para chipped in with 20 himself borrows free throws Full sea sun within eight But those will be the final points of the night there in Maples Pavilion Another entertaining battle between the Matadors and Cardinal But Stanford pours in 55 second half points and they close the nonconference
