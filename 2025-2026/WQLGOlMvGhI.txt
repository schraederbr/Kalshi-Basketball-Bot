Pivot has made that jump for Cap Our officials tonight Bill Cington Jr with Eric Lewis and Justin Porterfield applause Cal coming in at 132 on the season Virginia at 122 Tess Ditter with a double team gets it inside and finds Johan Kru to get the swing started tonight And Ditter prepared for the the trap And interesting enough we talked about Dana Ames return Also returning is Wilkins the 2018 defensive player of the year in the ACC for the University of Virginia who has perfected that trap However Ditters going to have to get out and cover John Camden who has now made a threepoint field goal in every game this season Thats a great point Hes hit 21 threes and now the past seven games So a guy that youve got to watch from the outside shooting 40 from three Heres the Ritter again Wild right now He follows his own list Offensive rebounding is a strength of the Whos on this season 144 offensive rebounds per game Another three This one no good by Pippen applause Got to keep an eye on Justin Pippen Hes holding on to that right hand after falling down on the shot Was sitting on the ground holding on to that right hand Something to keep an eye on for the remainder of this game You talk about offensive rebounding for Virginia Mark Madson head coach for Cal So thats a factor cheering and a big point of emphasis for them here tonight to try to crash the offensive glass It is because they watched Virginia Tech get 20 offensive rebounds against Virginia in Virginias loss there last weekend So when you consider that this is something that coach Madison wants to make sure they attack M Thomas for three Malik Thomas only shooting about 28 from three but a capable shooter Shot over 35 last season And as his shooting continues to develop this Virginia team gets even better Just see 10 plus points in three straight games for Thomas And Virginia leads it early 72 Here is Ames now working his way in Nice play So the conversations amongst the crowd here pregame was does data Ames go for a big number against cheering Virginia here today To the corner Thomas again And the offensive rebound by Hall Der again Thomas to the basket Malik Thomas And he is fouled for Virginia as we welcome you here to Charlottesville inside John Paul Jones Arena Cavaliers and the Bears tonight as weve got a twopoint game here early and heading to the free throw line for a pair as the foul was on Dayday Ames Here is Malik Thomas Mike Cory alongside Cory Alexander here tonight Differentiator between the two You have a E No E No E for me Yeah There you go Ill just call you E Thats how you do it Got to find a way to differentiate it Yeah We were talking earlier about what this has been like here in Charlottesville with a new look Virginia team this year people in this you know this fan base are extremely excited about what Ryan ODM has brought to this program Of course replacing the legend that Tony Bennett is And when you consider winning a national championship big strong shoes to fill for Ryan ODM but hes up to the task And again I love the fact that coach ODM comes out with the suit on over there on the sideline No tie but still has the suit on coaching him up like his dad did back in the day Well how about this The former Cavalere Day Ames throwing it down and Day Ames taking advantage of we were fortunate enough we got a chance to see to sit in on coach Matsons film session today and go through that shootound and Day Ames following the the scouting report snaking that screen getting all the way to the rim for the easy finish We did I thought that was great I mean he went through a lot of different plays talked about the good you know that his team does but what they really need to do here tonight to be successful Heres Ames again Shot clock is inside 10 And now the crowd was able to fool Chris Bell because the band started to count down the shot clock but they were 5 seconds premature Chris Bell fell for it So give the band a lot of credit for forcing a tough shot And on the inside stepping with it inside 10 to seven Virginia Ames again from behind Thomas takes it away Lewis going to a travel there instead TAKES IT IN AND THROWS IT DOWN Sam Lewis had finished cheering through contact for Sam Lewis whos coming off a careerhigh 23 points against NC State last time made five threes So you know the Bears are going to try to take him off the threepoint line dumps itself lead shot redirected by Odanso Two blocks already for Hall for three How about a combination of Grunlow and Onienso inside this year Cory I mean theyve got 70 combined blocks Its more than 15 ACC teams this season Well they theyre respectively number two and number three in the ACC in block shots per game So its absolute great rim protection for the Whos and even though this team doesnt hold teams to a lowcoring total like they did back in the day they can still do it on the defensive end of the floor music turning defense into offense Sam Lewis attacking the rim with the strong finish Virginia by five music music Well one of the things that we saw was they they were going to during their post trap which I was happy to see Isaiah Wilkins the 2018 defensive player of the year in the ACC here at the University of Virginia now with a much larger role with this Cal Bear staff He was the guy talking about how they were going to defend Virginia throughout this game music We saw the post trap a number of times early The first one ended up with a with a nice feed from Ditter to Grumbbo underneath for a basket So Virginia is absolutely prepared for that post trap However I was just happy to see Isaiah Wilkins coaching his guys up Yeah the assistant coach now for the Cal Bears got a nice ovation from the UVA fans here tonight before the game as he was introduced There he is Yes And not only was a a a great player here but also an assistant coach for the last several years saw under on Tony Bennetts staff So a wellbeloved member making his return along with Dana Ames who was a player here last year 2018 ACC defensive player of the year There he is And I love the fact that Mark Madson has really given him a voice especially on the defensive end of the floor Coming from this program and being you know tutored under Tony Bennett for so long you know one thing hes clear on is how to get the job done on the defensive end of the floor The foul was on Gertrude for Virginia in the previous possession Its 12 to9 Cavaliers by three here Chance Malleries in Dumps it inside the ball Get knocked away Its Justin Pippen doing what he does best Similar to his brother Scotty and of course his dad Scotty who were absolutely great with the hands Nice pass to get John Camden the easy layup Milos Elich that time on the assist and its a onepoint game here Good ball movement by the Cavaliers St Louis Nice take and the second time St Louis has recognized that Cals trying to run him off that threepoint line So he uses his size his athleticism to be able to get to the rim for a nice finish Cal shooting 50 four of eight from the field So is Virginia 50 at six of 12 as they lead by three Another back door almost there Heres a jumper on the way and its good by Ames And you know a strong start for Day Ames but hes not really forcing the action Thats one of the concerns Does he force the action and hurt his team He has not done that He has taken whats within the offense to get his looks But I believe off to seven points early Yeah its a really good point Three of four from the field for him with six points and we played 6 and 12 minutes here and a good job inside there by Pippen to try to tie up on Odieso Virginia still cheering has it Deon Telus cheering pocket picked from behind by Pippen Yeah you cannot play around with the basketball with with Justin Pippen Pippen on the other end going to line it up Unable to get the three I think theyre going to get DJ Campbell who did not play in their last game but from Hampton Virginia is on the floor Hes been in and out the lineup all year but good to see DJ get an opportunity to play here in the home state Coach Matson and another point of emphasis that we heard from him earlier was the deflections he put up on the board from the last game They had 25 deflections Seven of them were from Justin Pippen And weve already seen active hands here for Cal so far in this first half Yeah Pippen already has two steals So when you consider active hands and really and thats the one thing that both these teams want to do they want to disrupt you on the defensive end not allow you to operate comfortably on the offensive side of the floor Paul bounces it inside here for Gruno How about that an uphill DHO between a sevenfooter and a 610 guy Telis misses on the three Theres a foul on the rebound Its going to be against Cal But you see the European influence especially up front for Ryan ODM When you consider the fact that Grundo catches the ball on the block never looks to score Runs an uphill DHO to give a handoff to Nitter whos a ball handler has ability to make plays off the bounce now goes inside and a foul as Krunlo is going to head to the line for two And Milos just picked up his second in a row for Cal number eight for the Bears And all Mark Matson can do is fold his arms and be frustrated by that That was one of the one of the video clips they showed in their film session earlier today that they were not going to give up easy buckets on the underneath out of bounds play and they gave up a great opportunity on that one all the way to the final four for a team that supposedly wasnt supposed to be in Right But you know great to see Miami now of course going up against a tough task in Miss and the Old Miss staff going back and forth between Oxford and Baton Rouge Louisiana That was the first game of the season I did in college football this year was with Miami and Mario Crystal But I just I think you youve been around this long enough you know like when youre an at your alma mater you know it just kind of means a little bit more you know and I think hes wanted to get this team back up to where they used to be And uh hes a couple games away from potentially winning a national championship Well and he absolutely has the support of his fan base and the alum And you remember Michael Irvin after their win in the first round Michael Irvin coming up and kissing him on the cheek laughter right after the game So but yeah no exciting times and of course college football as we get down to the final four and of course the championship game will be January 19th which Im sure well all be looking forward to watch Fouls on Don Hall here for Virginia Here is Ames and already with eight first half points on three of four from the field and two of two at the foul line But this is the strength of Virginia right now when they substitute Theres really not much fall off You bring in Chance Mallerie whos a double figure score at almost 11 points per game as a freshman Good defense by Cal Paul Back up here from Mallerie Five to shoot applause Montas coaches with the foul Coachennis getting minutes with the foul trouble to Helich right So Mark Madson has three bigs that hes going to throw out there in this game And of course when youre playing against the size of Virginia youre going to need all of those fouls as this game comes down the stretch And Telles just got banged in the knee it looked like and hes shaken up holding that right knee and the officials stop the the game nice rightfully so Then hell get a 10 to two and well take a timeout Well be right back music Tied at 15 8 minutes gone by first half music be even more sore tomorrow but Im sure well see him back in this game But Jakari broke the wrist on the Sports Center number one play where he had a huge dump against Maryland Now he falls hurts the wrist but he continues to play in the game and he then of course afterwards gets it xrayed and finds out that he actually broke it But I saw the play I saw the dunk and congratulated him on and but I didnt realize until yesterday that thats where he was injured Yeah that was in that 80 to 72 win against Maryland a few weeks back And now inside the foul for Tessa Ritter applause And this Virginia team when theyre sharing the basketball is when theyre at their best Sam Lewis is going to get tremendous attention when he catches the basketball after a careerhigh five threes made last time out He makes the nice pass on the inside to Ditter who you can see is more than strong enough more than physical enough to finish through the contact Foul was on Pippen His first for Cal 16 foul Nolan Dorsey is in as well for Cal 21 He just grabbed the rebound Chris Bell for coach A nice back door play and its Pippen So one of the things were seeing with Cal is Mark Matson uses his bigs as facilitators Weve seen a number of nice finds Theyre playing five out We see a number of nice finds from his bigs throwing those back door pocket passes to guys for easy layups but it takes the rim protection from Virginia out of the cheering lane because theyve got to defend guys 20 ft away from the basket Heres a three for St Louis Its no good To your point Cory theyve got five assists on the six made baskets thus far But look at who those assists are from Its not necessarily the usual suspect in Justin Pippen cuz hes out there getting buckets right now but its the big guys who are dropping the dimes Pivots got six points and its the first Cal lead since 37 seconds into the game here tonight Lewis cheering And theres another deflection from Cal but UVA still has it Halt relocates as a three for the lead Its nice play cheering by Don Hall there to recognize as the defender Dorsy is covering and trying to close out on him The pump fake gets him to fly and then the side step allows him to knock down the three ball Two of seven from threepoint range for UVA here tonight One for four so far for Cal Onepoint Virginia lead Were halfway through this first half Pippen from deep Wow what a Thats a tough spot for Nitter to be in to have to try to defend Pippen on the exterior Kevin has the ability of course to shoot that and shows it off with the mismatch Day Ames loves it from the sideline Now its the other way and Ritter knocks down the three Thats the answer for Tess Ritter Okay you make a three on me I can take care of business on the other side But the Hall got away with the grab of the jersey on that possession forcing the turnover from Pippen That is the first count of the tie and UVA waiting threes as Mallerie hits one And now four different players have knocked down a three ball and weve got a timeout music music How about Virginia knocking down the threes here Cory Theyre on top by four Backtoback threes allowed them to build this fourpoint lead Hal Hall with a nice find from Chance Mali on a previous possession And then Chance Mallerie knocking down his first three of the game So its this back court for Virginia And I talked with Davin Hall yesterday just about his leadership with this group but also mentoring Chance Mallerie who should be the future of this program And he talks about you know hes now this is his fourth year in college He says that Chance Mallerie is the most ready freshman that hes ever played with And thats high praise for a guy that you know was at BYU for three years and had a tremendous career thus far Yeah Mallerie right out of Charlottesville right here in town St Bellefield school and you talked about Hall Uh they call him Unk uh because what is he 23 years old Is that is that right Does that fit there It does fit laughter when when when youre dealing with of course you know 18 year olds You can be ump when youre 23 but it has more to do with his experience and his voice Hes a guy that when you talk about Don Hall that you know Ryan ODM has he makes sure to tell him get rest get rest because he has to remind him he puts so much work in on the court and as you can tell in the wait room as well Basket was scored by the freshman TT Carrer for Cal got cut the lead down to two Shot clock here 3 seconds Hall for Virginia to the corner as Tillis puts up a three Hes back in cheering that right knee wrapped up a little bit more now He seems to be moving pretty good Heres Carr for Cal TT Carr who leads the ACC in assist to turnover ratio Tillis is is excuse me not Tillis is second but half of the assist to turnover ratio TT Card 61 assist to turnover on the year for a freshman That is fantastic Yeah its outstanding 36 assists just six turnovers as Lewis knocks down the jumper for Virginia And Sam Lewis has stayed hot this young man And again hes not doing it from three like he did against NC State Hes attacking the basket being able to score in the midrange Both teams are four for their last five from the field here Back over to Pepin Good defense by Hall Camden for Carr The shot clock is at four TT Carr gets bumped by Telus to fade away from the baseline How did he knock that down Well we talk about freshman We talked about Chance Malry GT Carr on that same level staying close to home going to Cal and having an impact off the bench as a freshman under Mark Madson TT Carr with backto back buckets getting the job done recognizing he has more than enough time on the shot clock to get separation and knock down the mini to make it a twopoint game music been doing on the football field this year Glad to see it back Similar to how it was in the early 90s when I was here on grounds and our football team was at the top of the chart There you go Well and I think the excitement too like as you said from football and now to basketball continuing especially the way this team is scoring 86 points a game tracking for the second best all time only only behind the 1954 555 Wahoos who average 898 points per game So still a ways to go for Virginia to try to top that but you got to respect what Ryan has done here in his first year Shot clock again going down for Canal Camden Oh its an easy one Offensive cheering foul and thats his second of the game and it turns it back forever Yeah And again John Cman made it very easy for the officials on this one Whenever you extend that arm as he does blatantly to discard Chase Chance Valerie on that possession thats an easy call for the officials Now how about on the other side for Cal Theyre averaging 815 points a game which would be the second best in their history 839 was the best That goes back in the 197071 season Yeah but these are two really really good offensive teams When you consider they do it different ways Virginia does it strengthen numbers We talked about eight different guys whove had 16 or more in a game seven different leading scores Cal block by Chris Oh Chris Bell getting the block but also being comfortable Well it was great action offensively to find Lewis at the rim Nice pass from Tillis Chris Bell coming over again I mean again the call You think that was B Yeah I mean because cuz hes I got all ball You did but you also caught him on the bottom Okay I would I would cuz Well I would like to see what arm did that cuz unless he has three laughter I hear you But regardless I believe thats going to be the second on Chris Bell It is as he goes to sit down So you know if you called that foul in the pickup game somebodys holding the basketball and saying Were not playing until this gets rectified I hear that Thats actually just the first foul on Bel It does go out and Virginia now on top by five How about Sam Lewis getting the job done once again Eight points for him Three or four from the field And right now the leading scoreer for Virginia as he was in a win at NC State on Saturday Yeah And hes played the most minutes so far in this first half of anyone as this ties the largest Virginia lead of the game at just five Six and a half to go step in cheering trying to work his way in over Thomas Its short but the way Thomas is going to win that battle with Justin Pippen trying to back him down Thomas taller stronger to take his chances oneonone in the paint Thomas for three cheering now doing on both ends of the floor Does the job defensively and now Chance Mallerie finds him gives him an opportunity beyond the threepoint line to knock down his second three of the game And right back the other way offensive rebound here for Cal Lee Dort And a wide open three is eight up that time by Noah Dors Roy got a great look and a nice drive from Dort through traffic and Thomass pass the puck got it cheering back Yeah Thomas just rushed up and recognizing that Dort was in the area Probably could have taken his time and got an easier layup Now Carr kicks it and its Pippen Its another long race three But when Carr comes into the game it allows Pippen to move off the basketball And now hes the recipient of a nice find and hes able to knock down a three ball Leads all scorers in this game here with 12 points and four of seven from the field and his second threepointer of the night Heres Tillis Intercepted by Ke and then hes fouled by Ditter applause and cheering I believe thats the third steal of the game for Justin Pippen And I believe Tillis was expecting a trap that never came We got rid of the basketball Had an opportunity to play oneonone with a smaller day a guarding him Got rid of the basketball too early and Pippen in great defensive position to be able to take it the other direction Coach Madsons group here playing Virginia tonight Then they got Virginia Tech cheering January 10th battle for this ball had a foul called How about two guys who were teammates a year ago going after Elijah Gertru who last year with a knee injury with great hands to knock the basketball away from Day Ames but I believe they got Gertu for the foul Yep And thats a second Crowd doesnt like it cheering Fifth team foul for Virginia The officials discussing I believe the concern was about the clock That will be a reset of the shot clock cheering Theyve got it at 28 right now which means that it was a turnover All right here it is So theyre going to call that possession for Virginia and then the foul But I dont know that El Gertru actually had possession of that basketball cheering but its going to allow Cal to reset the shot clock Ames and he is fouled by Gertrude again So thats going to be the third now on Elijah Gertrude Six team foul for Virginia and Gertrudes coming out Here comes St Louis I tell you what regardless of the production its a win for Elijah Gertude to be on the floor with the knee injuries this young man has had Its good to see him on the floor and more importantly in Ryan ODMs rotation Pippen doesnt get the bounce this time Going to be a foul over the cheering and applause back and its on Lee Dort And thats his first and the 10th on the team for Cal here in this first half And Dor trying to come up with the offensive rebound as Elish will come back into the game for him Elish playing with his two fouls And so foul trouble starting to mount up for the Cal Bears with that front line Well you said it earlier Dewan Campbell who played only five games for a total of 18 minutes He got in early And then Montas Cochenis who has only played in seven games for a total of 20 minutes He had to see action for Cal And with the 10th team foul its an automatic two shots at the line here for Onenso And look at this coming up on the ACC music Network on Saturday Florida State NC State Syracuse and Pit and then Cal hanging out here in the East Theyre at Virginia Tech All coming your way on Saturday our triple header here on the ACC network So Dana Ames making his return to Virginia tonight John Camden will actually make his return to Capital Coliseum where he spent two years with Mike Young at Virginia Tech So reunion week for the Cal on the bench right now for Cal Had a year at Memphis Those two at VTEC as you said also at Delaware and now here at Cals a graduate student Da with the three top who was able to come up with his third block of the game 35 on the season for him and now he puts up the three cheering and again it is a shot that is encouraged by everyone on this Virginia roster has taken a three this year except for one player and when you do the job defensively like music this coach ODM will give you a little leeway to let the three go from beyond the arc knocking it down at 38 as well Also the rebounding advantage here in this game tonight 169 and 6 to1 on the offensive glass in favor of the Cavaliers Camden for three doesnt go and its tracked down by Hall Great job by Donah Hall coming out of his area to come in and grab that rebound while the bigs were boxing out You know we talked about Virginia shooting the three had a conversation with Ryan in practice Im sorry sorry coach Holdm in practice yesterday and they will not get close Its another steal D Ames getting out of transition right into the hands of Ames and Hall coming cheering back gets called a foul and theyre going to say shooting foul here for Ames and hell go to the strike Ames jumping in the passing lane and with the new year of continuous motion this is the right call to be able to get a shot You dont you dont agree Was he in his gather I dont think he was shooting Was he Are you serious Hes in his gather cheering You got You have one step to get into your gather Hes going to the rim in the shot So but you you youre familiar with the rules I understand the continuous motion I was just watching it today actually on Yes Last year that would not have been a shooting foul right This year with the change in the rule that is a shooting foul because you have the step to be able to get to the rim So that is that is a direct example of the difference in this year compared to last year Back to my point about the story with Ryan they wont get close to leading the AC in threepoint field goal Florida State is shooting almost 37 threes a game Yeah So as good as they are how much of a gap it was even get close Another deflection there by TT Carr but Chase Mallerie ends up with the ball in his hands Unable to get the three to go and Cal hanging around right now not allowing Virginia to really get the separation that theyve been looking for Theyre going to kind of force it up Doesnt go out of bounds off of Virginia cheering They going to Were going to have a challenge here Yep So Virginia wants to challenge that last call and it went out out of bounds off of Cal instead Right in front of the Virginia bench So if coach ODM is challenging that University of Virginia is challenging the out of bounds caught on the floor California ball music All right So theyll take a look at it and well come back in 30 seconds music All right So back to the previous play It was ruled after review the call on the floor is overturned Virginia will retain his challenge Will not be charged a timeout Virginia basketball on the end line Yeah clearly a last touch there by by Cal but a great job by Ryan ODM and his staff recognizing and it happened right in front of their bench but more importantly being able to go back and see the video to see that that does go off of Elixs hand last And again you use your challenge this early in the game you got to be pretty sure because you want to make sure you have a challenge late game on what could be you know each possession will matter so much Yeah 100 Cory Then they have one more challenge left for the rest of the game And uh they still have all four of their timeouts Can only carry over three to the second half And Ora different on that possession St Louis could have had a good look from three but decided to drive it Now he puts up a three and its short and its tapped back out by Grunlow cheering and they call foul on Cal Its on Eli who picks up his third He barely got back into the game and thats why coach Matson is so upset Hes got a decision to make here to probably get him out again Hes going to have to Lee Doris coming in off the bench So Gruno is at the foul line Lets get your take on the freshman here You got Gruno out of Germany a freshman at 7 foot Dinner from Belgium freshman at 69 and then Mallerie who you talked about earlier the 510 freshman from right here in Charlottesville My take is you got three different type of freshman You got one whos 22 23 years old whos played three years of professional basketball and only has two years of eligibility So we can call him fresh call right You know what the simplest way is because were here in Charlottesville just call him a first year because because when you consider the fact that he only has two years eligibility so hes a freshman but hell never get to be a senior And so Chance Mallerie is a true freshman So thats the differentiator Bruno has three years of eligibility So from a basketball standpoint he would be considered a sophomore but its his first year So hes called a freshman cheering So we just call him all first years And Chance Mallerie is the true freshman Do you have this written down somewhere that we can finally take a look Listen I I graduated this great university I got to write this down I tell you what I find since were about 6 years removed from CO now we didnt have this problem But no youre right Its got to be year one year two year three Heres the threepointer from Der Doesnt go And back to Pippen from Cal They trail it by seven Camden wide opens I am shocked John Camden did not shoot the three He caught that basketball clean No one near him beyond the threepoint line He goes to the midrange shot which of course he makes it Every shot you make is a good shot but gave away an opportunity for three Fivepoint game Derer over to Thomas cheering Thats a trap Thomas got eight points here tonight One stretch this last minute 20 for Cal They were down 12 at home against Notre Dame in their last game in the first half Cut it to four at halftime and of course winning that game on a Day Ames fourpoint play with seconds remaining But right now this is a stretch We got back travelers cheering as Dort on the perimeter shuffles his feet after they called Thomas with the same infraction on earlier possession And a timeout is taken by Virginia Now Im know hes not happy about the foul trouble on his front line but if you told him hey you go into Charlottesville and you got to play this high power Virginia team on their home floor theyre undefeated and right now youre down five with a minute remaining in the first half I think he would take that Yeah no field goals in the last five minutes for Virginia As I say that St Louis puts it in St Lewis continues cheering to attack the basket and I love the fact that hes even though he had a great shooting performance against NC State hes not selling for three First Cavalier double figures with 10 points A threepointer the other side for Ames doesnt go Thomas and then almost got knocked away there by Dorsy Thomas stays with it Feeds the cover block by Dort as that was a nice defensive play to get back there for Cal Well theyve had some blocks tonight some deflections some steals Well thats a grown man block by Dor Groomlow a little under the basket and tries to come back inside with that left hand Lay it up Dor cleaning it up but then adding insult to injury Ditter picks up the foul knocking over Day Ames sending him to the free throw sprite Was that Carr Forgive me Carr will go to the line Yeah So Duner with his second personal foul 18 foul for Virginia One and one here for TT Carr Big miss there really here at the end of this first half trying to close this gap And now you got a Virginia team that could potentially hold here for the final shot Then a second half differential shot clock and game clock So Mallerie controls it 8 seconds to go Six to shoot Thomas for three Great look Thomas ends the first half the same way he started A beautiful find from one of his big guys Big sharing the basketball on the interior Opening possession of the second half for Cal here Down by 10 and a threepointer off the mark that time from Chris Bell Thats one of the guys who has really been missing in action for the Cow Bears Chris Bell who averages 148 points per game has yet to score So give the whos a lot of credit for doing the job defensively John Camden got away with some contact on the arm of Derritter on that possession And Tess Ditter still talking to the officials wondering where the whistle was as he looks at Justin Porterfield as the two still having a little conversation Ditter upset about the fact that there was no whistle even though Virginia will maintain possession with the arrow Hall to put it in Thomas Bruno trying to feed a cutting Lewis into the hands here of Der and finding cheering Bruno for the duck Nice find once again from Derritter That play was almost a turnover but ends up being a positive but off the nice cut Cals in a little bit of a drought here See the numbers 1120 sense there one for eight cheering Bell in some trouble and theyre going to call the foul here on Sam Lewis A play that could have been a disaster St Louis unable to handle the basketball Ends up being a nice cut and a nice feed Bigto big action Derritter and Gruno connecting similar to the first half It was it was in the the first possession of the game It was the trap with Ditter finding Gruno under the basket for the easy bucket So Ditter showing off his passing ability throughout this game as hes done all season long Well and 12 assists on 15 made baskets for Virginia here tonight Yeah everyone shares the basketball Thats one of the things about this team Theyre at their best when everyone is touching the ball and part of the action on the offensive end Yeah its a good point Cory I mean it kind of goes hand in hand right And if youre going to score a lot youre going to have a lot of different scorers and a lot of guys involved You better be sharing the ball You share the ball but another great thing about that is that means youre making shots You have cant have an assist without a made shot laughter Weve seen a lot of great passers but if youre passing the guys that cant make shots youre in trouble Virginia average over 17 assists per game So this is a team thats used to sharing the rock and theyre right at their percentage from the field 48 right now Heres Thomas Stellar game for him here so far tonight Hes already got 13 He really is And hes the guy that really hasnt gotten on track offensively as to what they were expecting He would led the Mountain West forgive me the West Coast Conference a season ago at 199 points per game You dont expect him to come average 20 in the ACC but you would expect him to get more than 128 which hes averaging on the year Yeah already over his average tonight Came from San Francisco driving baseline Bell wilder doesnt go tapped around Heres Lewis and Virginia really starting to take command here Thomas is fouled applause and Pippen picks up his second Great visit with Mark Matson earlier today We had a chance to go to what is an unconventional shoot around I loved it though They actually went through and Im sure more teams do it than we know about We just see them when they come over to the gym but they we were invited into their film session and then afterwards they go into the ballroom where theyve got the tape on the floor right for the court But what I love best about it is actually have the ACC logo in the tape Oh I didnt see that YOU DIDNT NOTICE THAT NO I saw the tape of the Oh the attention to detail The ACC was actually in the middle of the paint Oh thats great Just like right here I mean again they made it as realistic as possible Yeah I know exactly where youre at Pivot on the dunk by the way Now Ritter is fouled underneath for UVA Yeah they went through the the walk through there kind of in the ballroom as you said Uh I thought the film session was great showing clip from previous games and you know things that they need to do here to be successful tonight And foul was on Ames his second And you know one of those things was they wanted to crash the offensive glass That was going to be a big part of this game He said Were also doing really well when the ball moves So you talk about movement for Virginia Cal the same thing And theyre starting to struggle a little bit here in this game Down by 12 points Well you got to give Virginia a lot of credit And again in practice yesterday Ryan Odman did a number of different drills to make sure that his team was doing a job defensively rebounding the basketball Virginia is one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country Theyre number one in the ACC but theyre one of the best in the country when you consider the 144 offensive rebounds per game But teams dont think that theyre great defensive rebounders but theyve shown to be that here this evening James out to Dean Campbell cheering Crowd doing their best to distract the shot clock Its down to five Campbell hes pushing behind Yeah Sam Lewis with his second for Virginia The other thing for Cal is they came out just yesterday Coach Matson said last year on trips theyd come out two days ahead of time and that and thats just a lot You know they want to try to keep it as semblance as possible without you know overdoing it Theyre on the road here for four or five days as it is because they got Virginia Tech coming up in three days Well Coach Matson and I had a conversation last year and you know I stand on I honestly believe that both Cal and Stanford during this stretch at the beginning of the year they should spend two weeks on the East Coast And the reason being is because that would eliminate one of the cross country trips throughout the season Now with the league going to 18 games there will be four trips for the two West cheering Coast teams as Bumbo gets a nice look inside once again from a nice find from Derritter as Mark Matis on the floor trying to call a timeout and they wont give it to him Ball gets reversed here in the corner over to Ames I agree with you Cory about that because theyre the ones that kind of have to deal with it like if youre in Virginia you dont go there this year You only go every other year to play those teams on the road So so they get these guys at home this year So theyre not even worried about that But as a Cal and Stanford youre youre doing it multiple times Well the reason being and when So for Cal they dont resume classes until January 19th Okay Stanford is on a quarter system so they go back to school even later than that I talked with Kyle Smith about it last year I talked with Mark Madison about it last year If you leave both programs and I when I say programs are also the womens programs during basketball season you have both your mens and womens programs They come over and they play four games in a twoe span on the East Coast after Christmas beginning of the beginning of the year And so now what it does is during the stretch of January February going into March in ACC tournament time they only have to make two trips back over across the country One of those normally happens at tournament time to make sure that you stay for the ACC tournament Thats a really good play cheering Campbell couldnt get it to go for Cal deflected stays this way into a teammate So lets see who that is Thats on Yes So that thats a change of possession now as the ball goes out of bounds off of Chance Mallerie It stays with Cal but because its in the front court you dont reset the shot clock to 30 You reset the shot clock to 20 So its Cals basketball with 20 seconds remaining on the shot clock but it is a new possession So that is a rebound and then turnover right from the ESO And so 20 on the shot clock Cal possession They inbound Its knocked out of bounds again Kind of danger zone here if youre the Bears right What do they got to do to get back in laughter this I mean theyre down by 15 even though only four minutes gone by in the second half It starts with stops Virginia shooting 50 from the field and so Virginias getting everything they want on the offensive end And in this building youre going to have a tough time beating the whos when theyre able to operate this comfortably on the offensive end of the floor Dames gave a opportunity away to pick up that foul on chance Mallerie Mallerie was already in the air Day jumps into him He gets three free throws Thomases it inside for Odessa And another great example of sharing the basketball from Virginia as Thomas attacks the basket but then is able to drop it off as defender comes over to take him away from the cup 15 assists on the 18 made baskets in this game for the Cavaliers And thats thats the secret sauce for Ron Odum Again you want to get quality looks especially from three but you want to make sure that the your teammates are creating those opportunities for you as we see another air ball on the offensive end for the Cowboy Bears Alique Thomas attacking the basket getting to the rim as Elish comes over Its the easy drop off is able to catch it and finish the easy one for him And again this really is a a twoheaded monster when you talk about that center position for Virginia We talked about both guys being number two and number three respectively and block shots but theyre able to catch and finish around the rim which is a bonus especially when you have quite the guard play that Virginia has Very versatile Heres Mallalerie thought about the three instead finds Tillis four to shoot Zone defensively by Cal but Virginia prepared for the nice back door cut from Elite Thomas But this is what I really like most about the change of play style play for Ryan ODM Malik Thomas makes the bucket but he doesnt celebrate run back He is there picking up his man 94 ft Ryan ODM has made it very clear they want to disrupt on the offensive end of the floor defensive end of the floor and come up with turnovers The nice cut from Thomas as Tillis is able to find him Thomas goes off the glass but no home run trot Simply find your man and pick up 94 ft Yeah great observation Cory Theyre doing it here tonight 19point lead underneath to the plush That doesnt go Mallerie had a hand on it Ono has it Heres Tillis Cavaliers on the run Tillis on No And Thomas had a chance at it Threepointer in the corner by Carr Cal is two for their last 15 from the field And Virginia settled in defensively And so right now theyre making everything difficult for the Bears on this end of the floor and Day Ames who got off to such a great start really hasnt been able to get much going since the opening minutes of this game as he now checks out Justin Pippen returns and we talked about Chris Bell averaging over 14 points per game is still scoreless in this Lee Dor blocked inside And then the ball movement too Yes especially when youve got great perimeter players On Esso there another delivery from Chance Mallerie but when you look at the four guys on the perimeter onso is able to play in the middle of who do you lead right I know Everyone is capable from three and also can play off the bounce So Virginia puts you in tough positions when youre having to guard them Dor picks up his second personal foul for Cal And Virginias got a chance to push this up to 20 21 if Onenso makes both Chance for 20 on the second free throw coming up tomorrow College Football Playoff semifinals gets underway music and the ACC Huddle pregame show starts at 6 And well have a field pass music presentation of the Verbbo Fiesta Bowl after the game Complete breakdown coach and player interviews all coming up tomorrow night as Miami and Miss battle for the chance to move on to the national championship game 8 nothing Virginia No points in the last four minutes and 20 seconds in counting for Cal 20point lead Heres Chris Bell Lost the handle trying to gather but cheering Mallerie gets the steal and inside its Chance Mallerie averages two steals per game So nothing new for him to come up with an opportunity and turn it into points on the other end of the floor Another block inside the three by Kevin cheering Nine blocks tonight by Virginia and Onienso who came in with 32 and then you had Grunlo who came in with 37 But both of these guys have had elite shot blocking performances throughout this year On Ensu with eight blocks against Butler and Grumbllo had a seven block game as well So youre talking about two true forces with rim protection with both these guys and and it allows your perimeter players to truly be able to get out and pressure I believe theyre going to go over and look at this But I thought youre right about the big guys because they can play outside they can pass the ball theyre blocking shots they can knock down a three I mean its a tough cover no matter what And its been great team basketball by Virginia this season They lead it by 22 We got a timeout Well be back music at it during the timeout Came away with no flagrant on the play but the offensive foul stands of course on on Hall 14 fouls for Virginia three for Cal in this second half Bears have been scoreless over the last 5 and 12 minutes as this thing has ballooned up to 22 Pippen fouled there cheering by Thomas Well the Bears have only scored two points since halftime It was a 433 game at the half And so you consider the fact that Virginia has started this half out on the 142 run and really providing that separation Whatever coach ODM said to him in the locker room absolutely worked because they got the job done more so on the defensive end than even more what were used to seeing from this group offensively Yeah Only three second half points now for Cal The lowest points in any half for them this season has been 31 And we played almost eight minutes here in the second frame And now Cal will move their defense up to see if they can force a couple of turnovers for Virginia to find a way to get some positive momentum in their favor and get back into this game But theyre falling back into the zone defensively after the pressure Corner three Lewis and rebound Ames A wild runner there by Dorsy Doesnt go Another extra pass Thomas for three Thats no good And its tracked down by Grunlow Another offensive rebound for Virginia Theyve dominated the offensive glass throughout this game A nice hands to come up with the deflection but Cal throws it away turns it right over after the great effort defensively They give it right back to Virginia music You can see the frustration Cavaliers by 20 57 to 37 Cory you talk a lot about the offense for the Cavaliers this year What about the defense Youve mentioned that numerous times tonight Giving up just 68 points a game on average this season Yeah giving up 68 points per game on average However in the two ACC games theyve been giving up 78 points per game So when you consider that Virginia doing the job much more effectively here tonight against a cow team that comes in averaging over 80 points per game So its not as though this is a bad offensive team You just got to give Virginia a lot of credit with the job theyve done on the defensive end They certainly have Thomas knocks down another jumper Hes got 17 points that leads all scorers in this game tonight Even with those two games in the ACC overall throughout the first 14 games six of them theyve given up 70 or more points So in the other eight theyve given up less than 70 every single game The difference between their scoring and their defensive and what they give up is plus 181 on the season Yeah And again thats a lot of it has to do with the disruption that coach ODM wants to bring on the defensive end You see after Malik Thomas makes the midrange jumper on the last possession there are three guys in the back court picking up 94 feet And Chris Bell who comes in averaging over 14 points per game is still scoreless So give Virginia a lot of credit for the job theyve done on one of the leading scores for the Cal Bears Yeah hes second on the team at 148 a game and hes 0 for five from the field here tonight Pippen has 16 He averages 148 John Camden averaging 138 Hes got seven And then Ames in his return here to Virginia where he played last year averaging 176 Hes got 10 points but his 10 points came early probably in the first 10 minutes of the first half Ditter going to stay a foul cheering Strong finish by Ditter and you wouldnt expect anything less from Tess as he finds his way to the rim backs down a smaller bell and then able to go through the contact And if you just look at that video you wouldnt think that Ditter was the one that was fouled laughter right It was Bell ending up on his back even though Ditter was the one that got fouled on the possession Kevin Now Camden Ames is fouled And Ditters going to pick up his fourth here And Ditter immediately points to his own head telling himself he has to be smarter playing with those three fouls So now as he picks up that fourth it brings him out of the game And now the lineup gets significantly smaller for Virginia as the Ritter stops and has a conversation with coach ODM Territter has fouled out of two games this season Hall is fouled out of two cheering and Malleries fouled out of one So Day Ames who also spent a year at K State and played them this year and now hes played Virginia where he was here last year Now in his new home at Cal 23 points in the last game in that crazy finish against Notre Dame in the win And tonight hes got 12 And a nice trap by the Bears pushing Chance Mallerie into that coffin corner forcing him to step on the baseline Its almost like having four defenders there when you get a trap in that corner Two players the sideline and the baseline And Cal getting the basketball back Kevin for three Malleries on the run Chance Mallerie cheering underestimated his strength Chance Mallerie who was an elite football player as well when Ryan ODM and his staff was recruiting Chance when they were at VCU Jarius Theas used to actually come and watch his football games And so again they theyve been recruiting Chance for a long time Chance committed to Virginia hours after Ryan ODM was announced to have this job It was a perfect fit Believe it or not Chances older sister was actually working for BCUs basketball program in Ryans first year there as a head coach So the family ties have been there for a while Perfect match between player and coach Probably looking at some of those skills in the football field they have What can we use here on that on the court But youre right I mean that was that was textbook on his drive to the basket there and the strength that he was able to show you as a freshman at 510 186 I watched this young man play a lot of high school basketball games played with my nephew Austin Wilford So went to see those guys play a lot and you know Chance has zero fear at all Will attack the basket against any size Now a three here from Lewis Camden clears it out Two of 15 from the field this half for Cal Bell And just a great box out there by Gru stifling defense tonight by Virginia Well and Virginias done a great job of keeping Cal off of the offensive glass That was something that they talked with the Cow Bears about earliest cheering open opportunities as such Well heres the uh story on this one Four Virginia players are in double figures Cal only has four players that have scored at all tonight And we came into this game talking about the ballot scoring for Virginia and how the Bears are really topheavy They have four guys averaging over 138 points per game but all of those guys under their averages outside of Pippen in this one applause And Talon Hall crashing the offensive glass is fouled going in And that just shows you the effort difference here tonight for the Cavaliers Up 25 music music during the timeout Cory is is evident of where were at here tonight is that you didnt think Cal was going to be this bad on offense and maybe you didnt think that Virginia was going to play this good defensively and they theyve been awesome tonight Well I think thats been its a combination of the two And Mark Masss team comes in averaging over 80 points per game halfway to that with seven and a half remaining in this one and really looking for answers as theyre able to get the bucket on the interior But Virginia has made everything difficult for the Bears on the offensive end Lewis is foul on his way in for Virginia It was the first basket of the night for Milos Elich who was dealing with foul trouble throughout that first half I mean he had three fouls so he wasnt even hardly out there And finally gets into the scoring columns So now its five different players that have scored for Cal here tonight Coming up on Saturday here on the ACC Network triple header music action for you with NC State Florida State Syracuse and Pit Syracuse got the best scoring defense in the ACC right now and Virginia Tech hosting Cal as theyre here on the East Coast Cals first ever trip to Blackburg Its all coming up on Saturday Its a lot of first evers happening as of late North Carolina will play in three different places that theyve never played One of them at SMU where SMU and Andy Infields groupy Miller were able to top the Tar Hills at home And now North Carolina will go to both Stanford and Cal Uhoh Devin Tillis took another hit to that right knee We saw him have the exit earlier and this time one of his teammates falls into his knee Hall was called for the foul And thats uh good to see Tillis up But youre right had that knee injury earlier in the first half I think you dont need to risk anything more here at this point with a 23point lead cheering applause And uh thats got to be enough for Telus here tonight Well heres the issue And again youve got your teammate going to block a shot but as he comes down he goes right into the knee of Tillis So a little friendly fire on that one but fortunately and again just from the look of it thats just basically taking another hit to that sore spot Yeah hes glad he was able to get up and walk off on his own Camden with 10 22point game Mallerie Heres Thomas Four to shoot Mallerie up and in with two on the shot clock applause Seven points for him tonight and seven assists as well That thats where hes really grown as a player His ability to make plays for his teammates a number of great finds tonight Spent the majority of his high school career as an elite scorer and even though he had the ball in his hands a capable passer but he was looking to score more Now you see him facilitating which I could think he continues to grow into a leader of this program hopefully for four years Correct How about the season high in assist for Virginia this year 25 They got 21 here tonight and 555 remaining Thats somewhere they could absolutely get to that as Chance Mallerie gets to a careerhigh His seven assists And again hes only 140 No let me take that back 137 away from the freshman record at the University of Virginia A walking uh record book right here Ill tell you that Its my record This is great laughter here Doesnt get any better than this I only know the number because its my record laughter Thats right between you and our statistician Drew Drif whos done a great job with us here tonight We appreciate it We We got it all covered Well he hes less than that away Lets just say that Yeah Basket and a foul I can really appreciate the way that this team has not only shared the basketball but more importantly how guys have been willing recipients Often times youll get big guys who cant catch this pass Theres a lot of traffic in the lane The only whos able to catch it and more importantly finish it A opportunity for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way Elich has fouled out for Cal Tough night for him Just 13 minutes One for one from the field Thats it and one rebound was hampered in that first half of the foul trouble And he only he averages 13 minutes a game but it just wasnt the same type of game cuz youre youre dealing with all those fouls But you can see that Mark Madson had more of an emphasis to get him more minutes in this game with the size of Virginia Hes actually played more minutes than Dort I believe whos a starter in this one So he wanted Elish to be on the floor more throughout this game but foul trouble truly hampered his production Look at this heads up cheering Okay big fell doing the job defensively and then the skill to be able to take it to the other end and finish it off cheering You know thats not something you see often sevenfooters who can steal the basketball and turn into two points to the other end without any help from the guard Thats 12 for Onienzo and also eight rebounds to his credit tonight Couple of blocks as well And here it is again on the endo doing the job getting a hand in the passing lane and then the skill to be able to take it to the other end and finish it Theres another sevenfooter who played here who could make plays like that Im not gonna put on you to a neck kind of correct Yeah But still I mean it you know and from when you played and and youve seen the evolution this game you do the NBA obviously as well I mean what about the big guys today right If youre a big guy you you got to have those skills right Its not just back to the basket anymore is it Well there is no more back to the basket very few guys that can do that but they can make threes They can you know pass the basketball You can play through them on the perimeter And Virginia has really seem to be three guys that you can do that with When you think of Bruno Derritter and Oneso but all these guys have the ability to make plays on the perimeter with their passing with their cutting and yet they still hold true to being true rim protectors guys that do the job on the defensive end of the floor Tess Ritter just fouled out for Virginia here And Virginias really been able to do this without a huge performance from Derritter Hes their leading scorer but 12 points for him Four under his average And is he fouls out It was taking a time a little bit of time for the notification I think coach ODM knew like chop chop Lets get somebody else We know that Test knew Yeah we we knew that test knew It just took a little longer applause What else is going on in the ACC tonight SMU number 24 in the country at Clemson Clemson leads by six right now with about 4 minutes and 20 seconds left in that game Tough place to play Anytime you go to Little John its going to be difficult SMU who is great at home over the weekend over North Carolina getting out on that road that is tough Yeah beating North Carolina whole 97 to 83 on Saturday Another great hands once again by Justin Pippen Aims behind the back and Dort was unable to handle it All right So now the example we just made about Oneso and his ability to catch the basketball you see how important that is as he comes up with what I thought was going to be another offensive rebound but the passes that hes catching in traffic right Dor was in the open floor but couldnt corral that pass It was behind the back pass and and often times as guards we would say to the big guys I hit you in the wrong spot your hands and and so sure but thats where the pass landed Day Ames with a nice behind the back pass hits Dort right in the hands Just unable to corral it and finish it for two points Coaches is back in for Dort Mallerie takes a look at the clock Five to shoot Under four to go now in the game And a wide open Sam Lewis Threepointer doesnt go Pippen draws the contact and well shoot two when we return 75 51 Its all Virginia here tonight Back to Charlottesville for the conclusion of this one after this would be those teams to get there if the net rankings were the only metric which its not But right now eight teams looking like theyre in really good shape for the NCAA tournament in the ACC But what this does for the entire league is it gives you more opportunities for quad one quad 2 wins is which the the selection committee truly measures when it comes time to making those selections So with there being more quad one quad 2 opportunities in the league this year that makes the league better for everyone And it also helps that if you dont win against one of those teams it doesnt hurt you as bad because the ranking is so high True I mean thats the thats the thing You got to take care of business though too against the teams that are not you know in that top eight you know as you saw right there But thats that certainly helps uh this year as opposed to the way it was last year It it really does help And again you know the change to 18 conference games allow coaches to be able to schedule differently And I believe that the ACC coaches did a tremendous job of doing so throughout this year when you consider the fact that on Virginias by week Valentines Day February 14th theyll play Ohio State And so instead of taking the week off and not having a game in ACC action theyll go out of conference take on a Big 10 team and thats a quality game that youre playing So the Im not going to sit here and tell you guys Im in favor of the 18 game schedule but I do like the fact that coaches have taken advantage of it Well you would be if if the rankings are as good as they are the way there are now No I would like it better if it was 19 because that way everybody would play everyone Okay See the way with 18 games each team does not play each other right So there are matchups that dont happen Virginia does not play Clemson this year in the regular season Duke does not play Miami in the regular season So 19 games in my opinion would have been perfect allowing teams to be able to schedule one more of those nonconference games but still everyone plays each team in ACC play three for Virginia We were talking about that earlier with uh some people that shoot around Its more like when youre on the football side you know when you you cant play everybody you know you got such a big league Whats the tiebreaker situation there You know cuz its like well we didnt play them Then you got to go two or three deep and common opponents and all that Its a mess But you can only play one game a week in football right In basketball you can play two which with 18 teams it gives you an opportunity Again I I personally think 19 would have been the number Sure Brian Odum about it yesterday He was absolutely in favor of the change made but when you consider the fact that you dont play everyone he doesnt like that part of it Paul just fouled out here for Virginia Six points six rebounds for him here tonight And its John Camden to the line for a pair here for Cal cheering And uh we are super excited about this Saturday night Freshman Fenob Caleb Wilson 17th rank North Carolina They are in action hosting Wake Forest But immediately following this game were going to debut the documentary chronicling UNCs 1993 National Championship team led by Dean Smith Its the latest installment of the ACC Networks Word Number One series Cant wait to watch that coming up this weekend I saw it live and in person Ill definitely check it out of course But when you consider I played against that 93 team three times They beat us all three times that year including knocking us out of the ACC tournament in the semifinals And of course led by my dear friend rest in peace the late great Eric Montro uh who was a part of that 1993 national championship team George Lynch Derek Phelps Brian Reese my guy Boon Donald Williams I remember everybody on that team because they made life tough for us during that that year What did they do so well you know to make things hard for opponents Dean Smith and all that I mean Dean had a a special defense for me Now he may have used it against other people also but he would not let me catch the basketball on the inbounds after scores George Lynch would stay up and he and Derek Phelps would double team me And if I did get the basketball as the point guard they would trap me to make me give the basketball up And so I hated that And that was the one thing I hated about playing against Carolina that year is George Lynch was so great at getting out and trapping and getting the ball out of a point guards hands and Derek Phelps wouldnt let you get it back Well and then how about back then right where every year you know they would remember you know cuz you played on a team for four years most of the time right Its like oh here he is again Hes a sophomore Hes a junior Theres cheering a s And the crowd would remember it too Im sure they got on you all the time They absolutely did remember it And not only did you you have guys that stayed and played for four years you played everybody So you got a home in away with everyone Were talking about now teams that dont even play each other in the regular season but the ACC is twice the size it was in 93 when the Tar Hills won that championship is my young fella Owen ODM checks in the game I need Owen to make a three He has not made a three on the season And we got to get Owen a look Dorsy for three No good Big hand by the way from Malik Thomas as you saw for good reason Third game this year with 20 plus points His 26th of his career Its a great job by him tonight 20 points four rebounds hit four threes to really help put the hern on in this game today Big thanks to our producer Sean Fton our director Graham Robinson Eric Elgrren our technical director Casey Quinn Taylor Walsh Greg Driscoll James Rogal Thanks everyone cheering Great job to our crew applause today Tremendous effort from everyone here in the control room Good to be back home working with even though Seans growing the hair out Im not used to that Yeah foul doesnt go here Its been that way That kind of a night for Cal as Cochennis does score it And thats going to be the end of this one Virginia and a 10point lead Never looked back at the half Ended up going up by 25 They win it by 24 84 60 music and theyve just been dominant both sides of the ball
