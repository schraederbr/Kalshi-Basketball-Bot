What Im most impressed with is his efficiency of being able to hit shots Hes not forcing bad shots Sometimes youll have a guys eight of 10 He keeps taking them Hes taking shots Hes making shots really consistent at a high cliff Look for a good game here today And Notre Dame wins the opening tip Should point out the Irish are in their black the Ben uniforms to honor the local Southbend community Fort Wayne wearing the white and gold today Here is Jaylen Harelson on the baseline with a kick out Cole Serta for three Doesnt fall and Carson Town an offensive rebound cheering Big offensive rebound on a missed three here Look for the Irish to be able to continue to attack Harelson with a shot clock winding down over for Sundra Down to five on the timer Serta bouncing it down to Tout cheering through a double team and he scores just before the shot clock buzzer Fantastic patience by T with the shot clock going down to finish with his left hand right over that right shoulder Great pass by Ser there Good possession by the Irish So now well see Purdue Fort Wayne with the basketball for the first time Same starting lineup for head coach John Kaufman that theyve gone with in all 14 games Name of the game for the Mastadons Pace and space They averaged nearly 86 points per game but a turnover on their first offensive possession And as they continue to figure it out Purdue for Waynes got to take care of the basketball to be able to get there And they also got to get some stops to get going into transition And head coach Micah Shrewsbury looking for his best start in nonconference play going into the ACC Notre Dame starting with a West Coast swing against Cal Stanford after the holiday break Here is Sundra on a nice cut on the baseline Great passes by Notre Dame in the half court Good finishes by both Sundra and Tal Both of the left hand finishes here And you see that starting five for Notre Dame the same group Micah Shrewsbury has gone with three straight games since the loss of Marcus Burton against TCU And theres a nice cut to the basket Cory Hnot with his first points Really quick first step from Hadnot there Just gets gets an angle and great finish He can really attack the bucket over 56 for the field Heres Harelson on the baseline Left it short Offensive rebound and it doesnt go on the second try either Tough play but Notre Dames passing the ball really well here to start the game in the half court Just making quick crisp passes Heres Male Stevenson The transfer coming over from Bramley bounces it down to the baseline Darius Duffy left it short there Jaylen Harelson the star freshman McDonalds allAmerican Had a tough matchup against Evansville Gets it to Sundra His three in and out And the rebound comes to Hatnot Astounds looking to move quickly Duffy on the handoff for Stevenson kicks back out Had not for three and he gives the Mastadons a lead Hes efficient from there I mean hes making field goals making shots but hes really efficient cheering Good job by Mass just getting the ball down the court getting it open This Purdue Fort Wayne team over 35 from downtown on the season Extra pass for Serta His three too strong Rebounds hit by Harelson Nice play Shrewberry will try and thats off target and itll go out of bounds Back to Purdue Fort Wayne their head coach John Kaufman in his 12th season leading the Mastadons Last time he brought his team here back in 2016 when they had John Kar He had some great stories about coaching Kchar and what a job hes done with this program over in Fort Wayne And talking to him before the game its easy to see his personality has that magnetic personality to him where hes just telling stories Hes coaching He loves the game He loves teaching Even though hes got a lot in the transfer portal he has to teach the game and he just loves it You can feel it and you know his guys feel it So Macedons team theyve really challenged themselves in nonconference play Three on the way from Maximus Nelson Doesnt fall and tout rises up for the rebound Harelson pushing ahead Turns it over Transition opportunity up ahead to Stevenson and he lays it home A threepoint lead for Purdue Fort Wayne The Macedons are not scared They they have played a really tough schedule already heading into the season So the moment for them is not too big You can see it already just aggressive defensively trying to make plays Theyve got to get stops and get up and run and they know that Cut off a conference win against Detroit Mercy last week Heres Harelson has it swatted but another opportunity for Tout and he finishes T is so good at rebounding He just finds spots whether its offensively or defensively positioning is so good that he just finds the right spot to be in Hes got a great couple great finishes already Third straight game going with the headband for Carson Tab Its been a new look Worked out well for him Stevenson lines up a three and six it They can shoot it They can score it Theyre confident in here already cheering When we talked to John Coff and he said that schedule they play they wont be intimidated by this atmosphere Its an atmosphere without the students on campus after final exams And a turnover once again for Notre Dame What a start for Purdue Fort Wayne on the road The Mastadons with a fourpoint lead early Male talked to coach Kaufman He mentioned just that challenge in this era You get together in June but youre used to having players playing together for three four years Theyve had Hadnot in the program but Stevenson a new addition They certainly look comfortable here today Heres Hadot Kicks back out Stevenson looking for another three Too strong on that one And Sir Mohamd the rebounder Mohamd cutting off a careerhigh 21 points against Evansville Miker Shrewsbury telling us that was a game that was really huge for his confidence But another turnover into the front court Comes Havn and he slams it home with one hand Coach Shersbury had made a bunch of substitutions there at that timeout Obviously not happy with how his team came out to start the game Its been a 122 run for Purdue Fort Wayne Just the start the mastadons were looking for Logan with the basketball here Over to Shrewberry cheering Now Kevin Jai who also came on Shot clock winding down under 10 Mohamd will try a three Not cheering finding it there The rebound comes to Morgan and the Mastadons look to push once again Morgan extra pass over for Cabba His three short cheering Logan IMS rising up for the rebound and that goes off the hands of Brady Kaylor Another turnover for Notre Dame But again the Mastos continue just getting defensive stops or getting steals and getting out scoring Notre Dames been pretty good half court defense but Purdue Fort Waynes been so good defensively Theyve been scoring in transition Theyve been scoring quick Notre Dames got to take care of the basketball to be able to make sure they get their defense set Their defense been set Theyve been pretty good Its been three turnovers for Notre Dame over the last two minutes This Purdue Fort Wayne team averages their opponents do 15 and a half turnovers per game So that is their specialty forcing turnovers Theyre doing it so far Theyre really going cheering Cabba up top over for Morgan cheering The junior from Wisconsin Had not fakes the three Now hell take it and he sinks it Cory Hatnot What a start Now Shrewsbury looking to respond and he does Its like when you play horse in the backyard you try to match it right there applause Well that was much needed to end the run for Purdue Fort Wayne Cory had not already with 10 points He is a perfect four for four from the field cheering Deandre Craig over for Hadot left side defended by Ives They go to Craig for three Doesnt fall there Jai with the rebound Shrewberry looking for another off target Purdue 4 has been really good Had not just created space He doesnt need a lot of space but he just makes just enough space and then youve got an answer when that comes up But just a phenomenal job of Braden Shubberry getting out in transition again creating space and similarly just a quick little move to create just enough space for both shooters to be able to knock down their shots Adnances really impressive Hes got a great first step because that first step hes also creating space to be able to get his shot off Heres Craig all the way to the bucket with the left hand Its an eightpoint lead for Purdue Fort Wayne See Ryder Frost on the fer for Notre Dame The freshman out of Beverly Massachusetts Another player that can provide some shooting for the Irish Giant had it poked away into the back court Craig dives for it Loose ball near the baseline Out of bounds Itll be Notre Dame basketball but the based on keeping that pressure on Yeah No reset of the shot clock too since it wasnt a turnover So but again Purdue Fort Waynes just getting deflections Theyre making plays They theyre theyre hustling right now at a level that coach Shrewsbury searching a little bit Hes got five players Hes seven different guys in Hes trying to find guys that are going to be able to answer the call right now Mohamd on the drive high off the glass No but a touch in the cylinder and thatll be two for Notre Dame And I think Sir Mohamd answered that call last game but hes a guy thats going to have to come off the bench be able to be aggressive Moves like that are plays that coach is looking for him to be there And then Notre Dames also got to have a veteran that is here Co Muhammad great drive Obviously gets the goalending but high off the glass Great drive continue to be aggressive get in the paint being able to find those veteran plays cheering to be able to make a difference Well its an expanded opportunity for Mohamed to handle the basketball with Marcus Burton out Cabbas three too strong Offensive rebound and a second chance for the Mastadons Mosley a three and thats too strong But another opportunity now Craig will try from the left wing No And a fourth opportunity nearly But Logan Ives comes away with the basketball ahead to Frost cheering Mohamad trying to back his way in against Craig and an offensive foul And that will send us to immediate timeout The Mastadons off to a good start on the road They lead by six The second side and then be able to look to attack So the Mastadons looking to build on this sixpoint lead They have come in with the right mentality here on the road A whistle and a foul coming on Carson Town And if Im coach Shbury this is where I need Carson Toutton to be my veteran leader thats able to be here Hes made some great rebounds Hes made some great plays but I I need him to be vocal right now I need Carson Tout to have it Notre Dame take a stand before conference play And right now take a stand right here Craig gets into the lane Layup is short and Im saves it just before it goes into the corner Even here this Carson T pointing and talking in transition for a secondary play like hes got to do that on both ends every possession right now Heres Serta on the outside over to Harelson still looking for his first points Serta straightaway three left it short Offensive rebound Harrelson touted on the handoff cheering Shot clock under 10 Times got trapped for a moment Back to Harelson Kicks out Serta in the corner Thats short and the rebound taken by the Mastadons Serta 0 for four here Honestly a couple of hes been so open Hes probably uncomfortable for how well theyve guarded him recently Had not with a dump off a block there from Sundra DAngelo Alise Just great defense here Just good position defense Good job without fouling They say hands off DeAndre Craig Jr Now Hadnot whos already got 10 over the corner and Nelsons three doesnt fall and Harelson comes in for the rebound That was a good rebound out of his area He wasnt right underneath the basket Went and got it and a blocking foul as Jaylen Harelson came down the floor This one going on Chris Morgan That is the first foul on Purdue Fort Wayne Weve only had three total fouls in this game But Luke weve seen a scoring drought for both teams Its been over 2 and 12 minutes for the Macadons over 2 minutes for Notre Dame What are you seeing on the defensive end I I think both both teams have really just locked in since that early run that Purdue Fort Wayne had Notre Dames locked in for Purdue Fort Wayne Theyve really guarded pretty well especially being able to get back on defense and stop Notre Dame in transition Fakes the handoff for Shrewsbury Shot clock winding down now for the Irish cheering Harrelson now looking to drive pull up jumper doesnt get the roll but a foul as both teams were going to the rebound Carson Tout tumbling down get to their score first foul on Cory Hatnot they get it into Shrewsbury corner three thats moneys really good baseline out of bounds side of bounds they have been all season coachberry does such a good job of sets great looks that was a big bucket now you got a threepoint game and so now for Notre Dame looking for a score and then a stop if your coach for Shrewsbury Second made three for Braden Shrewsbury Nelson kicks out Had not looking for the response off the back iron Tipped by Tout and Harelson has it for Notre cheering Dame Shrewberry fakes Now hell take this one In and out Offensive rebound Harrelson backing his way looking for space high off the glass No tipped by Tout into the hands of Sundra So a third opportunity for Notre Dame this time down the floor Hockey assist for T on that rebound Cant hit there cheering And the rebound comes to Craig Purdue Fort Wayne looks to push screaming Nelson thought about it Over for Craig into the paint and he got it to go Plus the foul DeAndre Craig Jr Great drive by Craig Great job being able to get get to his spot You dont have his feet set Taking it through contact He drives He gets to his spot Cole sort ofs off to the side He gets an angle on him and then he takes the ball up strong off of two feet Too often players will go in off of one foot Try to finish Wont get the foul Instead hes got the hand one going off of two feet going through contact and finishing You know Purdue Fort Wayne early on was so good at getting to their spots being able to drive being able to create space Notre Dame stopped them from reversing the ball so easily Theyve stopped them from being able to just move through their progressions Theyve done a better job defensively the last four or five minutes here Craig completes the threepoint play Its back up to a sixpoint lead for the Mastadons Aserta take a step in now Pounce it down to Tout in close Cant finish Tipped out of bounds Itll be Purdue Fort Wayne basketball with eight minutes to play the first half Purdue Fort Wayne up six just to get in the offense So hes scoring a lot but hes not forcing it I think is what Ive been most impressed with so far from him Well we asked John Kaufman Cory had not went from a nine point per game score This year hes over 20 points a game And he said the main reason graduation and the transfer portal Thats whats allowed him to step up his game He was always this good just wasnt handling the ball quite as much He was more the sixman for the mascots last year As that ones left short Kevin Jai rips it away Notice how coach has played 10 guys already as you were looking at just in the first 12 minutes Hes searching for a five thatll go and be able to get stops and scores for him on a consistent basis And a turnover right back to the sixth turnover for Notre Dame in this first half Purdue Fort Wayne only has one And I think I think Notre Dames looking at coach Shbury has given some feedback to guys of just being able to execute get on the same page get locked in here Well both coaches mentioned its a challenge playing that final game before a holiday break Its just a funky time You just finished finals Youre moving out of the dorms and moving into the hotel for a month Morgan in the corner screaming This three pops out and it comes to Sir Mohamad as the Irish push ahead cheering Serta driving to the bucket and he gets the roll Hes missed a couple of threes but hes got to be able to create Hes either got to take the shot and continue to shoot it or hes got to drive Thats a great decision by Cole Serta Hopefully now if youre in Notre Dame cheering Coach Shrewsbury now hes seen it go through You want him to continue to knock down shots His first points of the day Craig on the outside Back for Morgan Kicks it out Three on the way No with one on the shot clock but a foul that goes on Kev Jai picks up his first Notre Dame worked him all the way down the shot clock and then all of a sudden give up a foul Thats a mistake that coach Shrewsbury is not going to be able to live with So hes holding him accountable here four days before Christmas Everybody else is talking about Christmas Coach Shrewsbury wants to celebrate Christmas about 4 or 500 today No holiday talk until 400 Matthew Mlen is on the floor for Notre Dame Havent seen much of him at all this season Transfer from Madonna University as had not with the tough finish He can score in a lot of ways Great finish great play That is 12 points now And a turnover into the hands of EJ Mosley up ahead Blocked there by Mohamd cheering Shrewsbury now on the baseline Out in the corner Shrewberry looking for another three Hand hit Now had not going to work once again with the right hand 14 points in the first half for Cory Hatnot Great job keeping his eyes on the room through contact Finish it high on the glass Back up to an eightpoint lead for the Bastadons Mohamed on the baseline Too much on it and then a foul Maybe a little bit of frustration there from Sir Mohamd after the miss 100 Continue continuing to try to create on the other side Purdue Fort Wayne has been really good Led by Cory Hadnot Cory Hadnot is making plays scoring a lot of ways Hes really good just through contact finding a way to be able to score at the rim being able to finish high on the glass there Hes getting just enough of an angle on his first defender but hes able to continue to attack and then be able to finish at the rim He is six of seven from the floor Very efficient Big time scoreer for the Mass Had 33 earlier this year against Oakland You can just see it New Fort Waynes confident right now Theyre cutting confident Theyre moving confident Theyre running through their sets going through their progressions Mosley shot clock down to two Had not has to launch And everything is falling for that man right now Christmas is coming early right now that on that one Thats that is a Christmas come early gift for Cory Hadna 11point lead largest of the day Its a 70 run for Purdue Fort Wayne And now Cole Suro will take a timeout as hes trapped in the corner and Notre Dame searching for answers out the half where coach Ray is putting five out there where hes trying to figure out whos get me stops get me a few scores and get them on the bucket and then make some halftime adjustments and come out and try to have a second half But they need to figure it out before league play anyway So if they can figure it out here it could be a good thing for them Ives with a high arcing three Doesnt fall And Carson Tout with the offensive rebound Kick out for Shrewsbury Pulls up with the runner Doesnt get the roll Tipped out of bounds Itll stay with Notre Dame Notre Dame 26 field goal percentage right now Theyre getting shots Theyre getting a few offensive rebounds but theyve got to find a way to score basketball right now Harrelson over to town into the corner for Ims and a foul EJ Mosley picks up his first Mlen over for Ims Hell try a three Thats short and the rebound into the hands of Darius Duffy Leave it there I want Logan IS to confidently take that first three rather than catch it Jab step twice and then take it I think thats their names got to find that veteran leadership that confidence to be able to turn that corner right now for them offensively Its been a three and a half minute scoring drought for the Fighting Irish A 70 run for the Mastadons or he had not with 17 points outscoring Notre Dame by himself looking for another three Off target on that one Mlen with the rebound Harelre going coast to coast Draws some contact Good stop Good transition here for Notre Dame Cory had not that might have been his first tough shot hes taken where there wasnt a lot of offense You a little bit of an ISO Then Notre Dame get the stop and getting it out Harelsons got to be able to continue to attack I know he had maybe an okay game last game but when Burton went down a couple of games he really stepped up Hes in McDonalds AllAmerican freshman form to be able to be there The bank is definitely open tonight Well he was maybe taking some free throw lessons from Carson Tout there might laughter maybe it does still count for the same amount of points if it goes through So but Harelsons got to be one of those guys that steps up continues to step up and I I look for that to continue to be there in the second half transition but they got to get stops to get in transition Theyre not getting transition if its after the baskets already made First two points of the day for Harelson He was 0 for five from the field Coming into today there have been 10 straight games in double figures Fort Wayne runs some good sets They really get through their sets get through their progressions They run Hadot off a lot of screens move the basketball they share the ball You can see they cut with great confidence Greg gets underneath the basket Five on the shot clock here for Stevenson trying to cross over find some room and a shot clock violation He didnt get it off Really good defense by Notre Dame to get the end of the shot clock Craig continued Stevens continued to try to create but just really good defense there by Notre Dame Been some long scoring droughts for the Mastadons in this first half as well Its been over two minutes without a bucket but Notre Dame cheering searching for answers on the offensive end themselves If youre coach Shbury 27 points doesnt concern you defensively but offensively 18 points would be a concern Obviously tout underneath the cup and he finishes cheering Great pass great finish cheering Really good play by Carson Tat on the handoff getting to the rim because theyre double teaming on that pick and roll Touts able to get out really quick They didnt get the rotation over fast enough and a great pass And thats one of the adjustments I thinks going to need to make at halftime cheering Greg over for Nelson Another possession going deep into the shot clock for the Basedons Adnot cheering against falling away off target and the rebound comes to Sundra and the defense bringing some momentum for Notre Dame The bench on their feet Logan has done a good job guarding Hadnot here the last few possessions especially when he gets into ISO late shot clock Over for Tout Hands off Harelson who lays it home Howdy is crafty in there when he gets the ball in that charge circle area Hes coming up with different plays different finishes rebounds tapping the ball out applause Starting to fire up the crowd a little bit Its been a 6 run for Notre Dame Purdue Fort Wayne leads 20 cheering Thank you music Good Under doing a fantastic job Town is diving to the basket music as theyre getting double teamed on this pick and roll The rotation was late that last time got a bucket This time the rotation was there Tout makes one extra pass and gets Harelson on that next play But Notre Dame is now impacting the screens Earlier in the game Purdue Fort Wayne was trapping the ball screens They werent getting dragging it out getting the ball out quick enough Now theyve made an adjustment Theyve drugg it out on that double team Theyve gotten the ball out Touts getting to the rim rather than rolling to that short roll Theyve done a good job of adjusting Good Good adjustment by Dave here Craig has it swatted by Harelson Hes down on the floor Ims to the other end and lays it home Harelrelsons back on his feet Looks like hes okay but went down hard to the floor after that block A hard block and a hard fall Acidons will roll it out So the shot clock is off Its an 80 run for Notre Dame but Purdue Fort Wayne looking for a bucket to give them a little bit of momentum heading into the locker room Its been nearly four minutes without a point for the Mastadons Look for him to find a way to get Hatton out of look here Craig with 7 seconds now Stevenson will try a three Thats an air ball out of bounds 31 on the clock here for Notre Dame This is one of those situations you work on and shoot around 3 seconds left Youre usually waiting for end of the game by end of the half Get it into Harelson with one second Has to put it up at the horn and it doesnt go off the glass But Notre Dame ends that first half on an 80 run But Purdue Fort season long for this Notre Dame team Astadons looking to score coming out of the locker room and itll be Notre Dame basketball A turnover on the first possession for Purdue Fort Wayne and and Im not surprised at all to see Logan Ives out here to start the second half His defense really started a lot of that run in in the first half on had not and then just offensively hes creating energy Hes cutting incredibly hard He did a great job in that first half earning the start and theres a really nice cut with the reverse laying and coach Shrewsbury looks like a genius Were starting in the second half and getting the first bucket Also Coach Shrewsbury after timeouts is 97th percentile in the country right now after timeouts starter possessions Im pretty sure that the uh what he draws with is a wand over there instead of a marker And a turnover forced there by Tout So a chance for Notre Dame to get the lead Harrelson on the baseline out to Sundra Open three Left it short Rebound tipped and taken by the Mastadons Better better energy from Notre Dame here to start this second half Heres Stevenson over for Nelson and he hits the three Much needed bucket for Purdue Fort Wayne And Nelson can shoot it Hasnt shot it a ton here today but he can knock it in First points of the afternoon as Harelson gets right to the cup Here is Stevenson over into the corner and that three doesnt fall DeAndre Craig unable to hit Notre Dame with a chance to tie it or take the lead not had a single tie in this game Notre Dame has not led since the 1842 mark of the first half Harelson across court for Ives HIS THREE GOES AND Notre Dame back in front Great read by Harelson drawing Logan I just stepping up when you need somebody to knock in a shot Hes been that veteran for them a few games this season and that is a big time shot for Notre Dame when they needed it Seven points for I leads the way for Notre Dame Heres Nelson Already has one three here in this second half Now Stevenson for Hatnot Kicks back outside Nelson he has got three more But he is their shooter He is the knockdown Pick and pop Knock it in Times over for Harelson Backing his way against Stevenson Kicks out Sundra in the corner Too strong Harrelson got a hand on it Over to Sundra into traffic and he draws a foul Great hustle by Harelson here I mean I love how Harrisons backing the defender in on this post up ISO and then be able to make the kick outs Then the shot was missed and he doesnt give up on it Hes not frustrated He didnt get the assist on the shot He makes that next play Goes makes a hustle play Knocks it out Gets to here Great kick out from Harelson to get to Sunder on the shot Then Harelson just a great hustle play When youve got a freshman McDonalds allAmerican thats making hustle plays like that it changes things tonight I think you go with it Not surprising that Logan IMS has had a great start to the second half here because of how hes guard had not on the other end I think when you take on those challenges on one end of the court it can translate to your game and get you reengaged get you going And so for both of them Harelson a couple big blocks couple big plays Dont be surprised that his offense continues to take a step forward as they be able to play in that way And Harelson gets another hand on it there but transition opportunity Craig and he bumps into IMS Two free throws to come I thought he got that one cleanly Lets take another look And he felt like he was straight up I just dont know if he leaned in I think its that left arm thats down I do think he was actually clean up top but that left arm is down just enough that he gets that foul DeAndre Craig the junior from Chicago misses the first nearly an 83 free throw shooter on the year cheering cheering And he makes the second Back to a twopoint edge for the Mastadons Harelson all the way to the bucket Again the hustle plays from Harelson Multiple plays in a row Then the next possession he gets all the way to the bucket and gets a finish Really good job by a freshman to find his way through this season to be able to make those plays that translate to a bucket there cheering Craig with a stutter step and he gets the roll off the back iron Great change of tempo there of just a little euro step change of tempo Slow it down just a bit to get to his spot Haroldson backing his way against Stevenson and out of bounds Itll stay here with Notre Dame Harrison just taken off I mean this is on a made bucket right Made bucket Getting out and he just goes downhill Great spacing on the side Braden Shberrys hit a couple threes They cant leave him in the corner Make it all the way to the rim Eight points on the day for Harelson Town Hands off here for six on the shot Barrelson trying to find space and a foul before the shot Thatll send us to immediate timeout Back and forth we go Purdue Fort Wayne ahead by two with just under 16 to play Saturday needs to step up without and I think hes the consistent one to step up I think theres guys like Harelson and Braden Shbury Theyll have huge games big scoring games but they need somebody thats just incredibly consistent I think Logan might be that player for Notre Dame At least he has been today Brady Kaylor a little bit of an awkward shot Thought maybe he took a bump as now Hadnot with the finger roll and the finish So good on his change of speed Thought he had him stopped Just a little change of speed and then a burst right to the rim Really really good job by Cory Hadnot First points of the second half for Hadnot And a reachin foul there on Chris Morgan Picks up his second Cory Hadnot fix that old John Wooden quote be quick but dont hurry Right Hes quick but hes not hurrying And hes not rushing Hes waiting on his spots Hes waiting for a defender to make a mistake Harelson Shrewberry over to Kaylor and another reach in Not really likes this matchup with Morgan Gordon Harelson when theyve got Morgan Garvin Harelson Theyve almost cleared out the side Let him get in a little bit of that point forward backing the ball down But I really like Harelsons decision making Hes not just forcing it going to the rim because he has a smaller defender on it Hes making good plays for teammates Morgan just picked up his fourth foul So he heads to the bench DJ Mosley the freshman coming in in his absence Harrelson spinning his way Puts it up and hes got two free throws to come Good offense by Notre Dame A couple of little dribble handoff or zoom actions coming off each side Good ball reversal and patience Didnt work the first time Go to the other side run it again and then be able to get paint touches I I think theyve done a better job here the second half of really getting paint touches and getting in the lane Jaylen Hsons been a huge part of that Well Luke you mentioned earlier its great to see from a McDonalds AllAmerican the kind of hustle that weve seen from Jaylen Harlson Micah Shrewsbury told us earlier today he loves getting in and watching film Hes very coachable and you have to love that when you have a player with his kind of talent that is so receptive to the coaching this staff is giving him You know my eighth grade coach told me with five bucks and potential you can get a Starbucks drink But with potential and coachability and potential and willingness to get there in a growth mindset Jaylen Harelson is setting a ceiling thats limitless for himself because that potential can be expanded can be grown upon and really something to be done with Mosley on the kick out for Nelson with a hand in his face He knocks down another Nelsons only hit three twos all year so he is their shooter for them He is going to pick and pop Hes going to continue to hit shots Three big shots for Nelson here in the second half Third made three Its back up to a sixpoint edge for the Macedons Tout out to I looking for three more and the response Huge extra pass from Tout I love the extra pass He could have gone up with a floater Instead he makes an extra pass A good to great pass from Carson Tout So Logan I into double figures Had not looking for three of his own Not there And the rebound comes to Kaylor Harelson backing his way Likes the matchup Skip pass for Serta Now Kaylor on the wing Lines up a three and he hits again Started by Harelson and that ISO on the one side Great spacing by Notre cheering Dame Toutton the dunker Three on the weak side and then just sharing the basketball when the defense rotates And a timeout taken by John Kaufman A 6 run for Notre Dame Great run with the spacing Let Purdue Fort Wayne make a mistake and take advantage of it And that spacing has made a difference in the second half Much better threepoint shooting a lot better looks in the second half for Notre Dame Theyre three of five from the outside And weve got a tie ball game with just over 13 and a half to play here in the second half Going to respond out of the timeout Mooseleys three is short Sir Mohammed claims the rebound Coach Kaufman runs some good sets out of timeouts out of sets and he is you can tell that his team believes in his sets They run it with purpose I to the baseline Kev Jai right underneath the bucket Out to I in the corner Too strong And Hadnot rises up for the rebound Stevenson cross over on Serta high off the glass No offensive rebound and the short runner falls Great job by Stevens Just a ste extra effort Second effort making a play Little floater inside First points for male Stevenson since pretty early in the first half He had quick five now up to seven points on the day Mohamd backing his way against Stevenson Kick out now Serta left wing three off the back iron Offensive rebound Mohamd and the reverse lay and doesnt fall Cabba clears the rebound for the Mastadons and a foul on the other end Thats a great play They tried Sir Mohamd in a similar play similar spacing good rotation And Cole Sera takes the same shot that Kaylor hit Cole Seras missed a couple of shots here That Thats where you just got to hold your foul through Think about your technique Exaggerate Hes missed a few but hes a great shooter 0 for five from the outside today Came into this game at over 42 of the season And throughout the year the story for Cole Certa has been hes been an outstanding second half shooter Hes had a lot of quiet first halfs but usually this is his time of the ball game but so far hasnt been able to get going And if youre Cole serter right now youre looking to get going defensively getting a couple stops getting tagging a couple cutters Stevenson step back three Oh what a shot by Male Stevenson And again he saw that little floater go in inside Gets the two to go and then makes a tough shot there So hes into double figures with T Shrewsbury on the baseline drive for two applause and cheering down low Craig will launch a three short Jai battle for the rebound and loose ball foul on Purdue Fort Wayne will send us to a timeout with Jai down on the floor Purdue play music for a nice three for the Mass in the top 75 of the net coming into today as theres a reachin foul on Hadnot and that is the seventh So Braden Shrewsbury will have a one and one its been impressive to see Luke just the improvement of the ACC from year to year Its been a talking point the last few years as Shrewsbury sinks the first is conference maybe its slipped a little bit It seems like theyre back to where the ACC typically is 100 I think it as as they continue to get there whether its players or its teams and then it really becomes these nonconference theres been some big nonconference games and some big nonconference wins for the ACC here to start the out Purdue Fort Wayne I think is going to do a phenomenal job in the rising league and so just being able to compete here and compete on a big scale and I think as they head into league play as well looking for them to be able to play the way theyre playing now in the league play cheering Oh and a little bit of pushing and shoving there and Cabba is saying he took some contact to the head Weve got an elbow thats shoved here And so double technical fouls They offset We move on 18 foul on Purdue Fort Wayne Fourth on Notre Dame Stevenson lines up a three Doesnt fall Tal rises up for the rebound Mohamd gets by his defender Shot clock under 10 now Town hands off Shrewberry Town looking for a pass out to Shrewberry Has to put it up Did he get it off They say no The shot waved off and a shot clock violation Really good defensive possession by Purdue Fort Wayne And I was most impressed by Purdue Fort Waynes talking on defense They were pointing They were talking They trapped a couple of the handoffs Then they got back they rotated they didnt leave shooters on the weak side Really good job that they had left shooters a couple times and some of those post ups some of those drives Really good job defensively there by Purdue Fort Wayne Ninth turnover for Notre Dame compared to just five for the Mastadons And theres a really nice cut by DeAndre Craig and the feed from Yuval Leven Fantastic pass Even better back cut Harrelson backing his way Had it poked away and it comes into the hands of Cabba into the front court Ibrahim Cabba had his shot affected Loose underneath the bucket Battle on the floor Tied up Still trying to sort this one out He teach differently because hes teaching new players He doesnt have as many veterans and he does a phenomenal job of teaching the execution that they have had tonight Shrewberry down for Tout doesnt fall Tipped around Tout has the rebound trying to get it out to I deflected last touch by Notre Dame cheering and its another turnover back to Purdue Fort Wayne 10 for Notre Dame five for the Mastadons And thats a big statistical category for this team Coming in they average a little over 10 a game and they force 15 and a

line for two Scooby Harelson doing a great job of same match up they had earlier before Morgan got in a little bit of foul trouble I think coach Rbury literally walked out there and shook his hand telling him thank you for attacking the basket Hes been really unselfish But there is a balance there where at some point Harelsons got to go get a bucket himself And hes got to be able to be a threat to be that dual threat thats able to pass when someone else is there but then be able to go and score it when hes got an advantage Weve seen moments this season where Harelson has had that mindset where he can take over a game You think back to the last few minutes of that TCU game game against Idaho as Harelson sinks the first free throw And Harrison gets here You can we could hear him here saying thank you Walked over He helped him up I think he thought he was still playing Thank you for being able to get there Harrelson now into double figures with 10 and he sinks the second free throw back to a onepoint game applause cheering as Chris Morgan the red shirt junior brings it up the floor for Purdue Fort Wayne for Wayne run some great sets but had not has not scored as much here in the second half Im coach Kaufman Im looking for a set that I can find a way to get him going here cheering Morgan tries the baseline out to Nelson Hes been hot from the outside now Had with a nice crossover to get space and he gets the three off the back iron And just a few sets and baseline drive Extra look Good finish Hines with the spin and finish Great job by Notre Dame of not sitting back

lays it home for two 24 points for Cory Hatnot Great job by Had of moving over on that defensive slide Just getting that help side Great steal Great score Tout gives off for Harelson Out times in the corner and another turnover That is the 13th for Notre Dame in this game Its got to be frustrating for coach Truberry because that is the right play right They come off Harelson comes off that play Hes driving him Hes probably telling him Hey I need you to just get off two feet make that pass into the corner and make that play Thats the right read Hes got to make the pass Sera coming back into the game He has not been able to get going yet 0 for five from three Craig now with a jumper short Shrewberry the rebound for Notre Dame settles it down for Ims and miscommunication Another turnover Craig all the way to the bucket and hes fouled Two free throws to come for DeAndre Craig Great defense Great great opportunity to be able to get fouled all the way to the rim Just a miscommunication He thought either Cole ser was popping up or Tat was popping Great job by Craig be able to get to the line here Craig misses the first Deandre Craig with 10 points today Transfer from Denver Originally from Chicago went to Mount Carmel on the south side of the city was the Chicago Catholic League MVP in his high school career He makes the second fivepoint lead for Purdue Fort Wayne with six and a half to go If youre Purdue Fort Wayne youre looking to get a stop and a score Extend this out here Poked away out of bounds Itll stay with the Irish for Notre Dame Theyve got to find a rhythm And when Sir Mohamad and Harelson have both been kind of the point guards look for whos going to initiate the offense here for Notre Dame Sundra hands off for Ims Back to a cutting Sundra who lays it home Great pass by just being able to come off be able to finish And coach Rusberry has been all over because of their double teaming that pickle Like we talked about that first half that dive to the rim is whats most open creating the most help side And now its stolen away by on the floor cheering Sundra on the outside Shot clock under 10 Shrewberry to Kaylor for the tie No And the rebound comes to Duffy applause Purdue for Wayne here looking to run a set Threepoint lead Needing a set here Trying to be able to create probably for Had not but also theyve got a lot of sets Just giving

created Colerta now at the line hes missed a few shots This is as a shooter where you get to see a couple of them go through and then being able to have those big second half threes that hes had

Second free throw goes as well Sixpoint game Harrelson trying to get to the bucket once again Hes fouled So two more free throws That has been the move for Notre Dame but that time continuing to wind down And with Purdue Fort Wayne hitting free throws youre looking for in this play Purdue Fort Wayne to miss one free throw to catch up by one point catch up being able to be there Theyre looking just for that one next play They just havent Purdue Fort Wayne hasnt missed free throws Theyve done a great job executing here And that was Chris Morgans fifth foul So he is fouled out of this game Darius Duffy also in some foul trouble for the Mastadons with four So two more free throws for Jaylen Harelson Hes seven for nine at the charity strike today cheering He makes the first Nobody stop Second free throw to come for Harelson He makes both And Notre Dame force a turnover So far Purdue Fort Waynes done a great job getting the ball in They get it into Stevenson and their best free throw shooter is back to the line Purdue for Waynes done a great job in this press breaker of just you know have a guy split both ways being able to make plays and then being able to catch the ball be able to handle it under pressure get to the free throw line and they made all the free throws here So Stevenson back at the line Normally would be in front of the Notre Dame student section but the students away on break That makes it a little bit easier to shoot on this end of the floor and he has been great all season long at the line And he misses the first He might have jinxed him on that one but hes got 17 today and hes hes taking the responsibility there He when youre shooting 91 youre not happy with any miss especially at this stage of the game Youre more surprised by missing than you are by making at that point in time But for Notre Dame thats where the strategy of continuing to attack Second one does go Now a two possession game here Still have time with a timeout left Harrelson to Shrewberry Fires a three in and out Harelson the rebound Puts it up and in Threepoint game with 81 to play New for Rangers looking to get in safely Mils got to get a deflection or steal here Stevenson gets it into Hadnot and hes fouled Two free throws for Cory Hadnot Looks like he want to take a look at something Might be the clock his moms on the same page So if theres any critiques there its coming the same way from Corys mom And thats not always true Uh parents sometimes parents believe a lot from their kids and maybe not quite as aligned but Cory had not as we head into the holidays here and Christmas with mom you know have conversations but probably wants that one there So he misses the first critical second free throw upcoming with 72 cheering Two to play One timeout left for both teams each in the double bonus The second free throw for Cory Hadnaugh That one does go Massive free throw for Hatnot A fourpoint game I has to throw it the length of the floor Tout is open Out to Shrewberry FOR THREE AND HE HITS IT ONEPOINT GAME with 41 to play Phenomenal play after the free throw eight turnovers in this game Done a great job taking care of the basketball Onepoint lead for Purdue Fort Wayne with 41 to play Looking to pull off the upset on the road Notre Dame looking to come back Craig the inbounds man trying to find Stevenson Gets it in eventually to Maximus Nelson So hell head to the free throw line Five of seven on the year Its not many free throws for the season but hes a threepoint shooter Has only shot a few twos on the season Obviously can shoot the basketball Two free throws with 33 to play And he makes the first No timeouts left for Notre Dame And Luke do you think if he makes this second Im assuming John Fains going to tell his team to foul up three You would think so with under five seconds Do you think here cheering hes going to tell him to foul but make sure theyre not in the shooting motion Makes the second threepoint game No timeouts for Notre Dame I down the floor gets it to Harelson Harelson puts it up and its short Purdue Fort Wayne PULLS OFF THE WIN THEY TAKE DOWN NOTRE DAME for the first time in program history
