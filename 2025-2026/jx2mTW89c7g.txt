Naples Pavilion Jerry Heater Jeff Pon and Chase Shaw are officials We are underway Georgia Tech basketball again No Kui Reeves Jr 15 points per game missing from the Georgia Tech starting lineup by Endango Their second leading score at 12 a game And they started off with him in the post battling spinning They could not get the roll The rebound by AJ Rahosi Stanfords leading rebounder at five a game Stanford starters led by Ibuka Okori second leading scorer in the ACC Shooters with Geler and Ogre Wall Donovan Young has been in the lineup since the injury to Chisumakara Late shot clock 5 seconds for Uggerwall Hell take a screen He can really shoot it Hes got to get it up Big rebound inside Thats Rozie and it was stripped by Jaden Mustaf Some of the most active hands for Georgia Tech Hes on the run and hes got our first bucket of the night Thats good defense on one end and a good transition in the other They got to the rim Stanfords going to have to close the door Damon Starttomires team will get to the basket They one of the top twopoint attempt teams in the country Theyll shoot it from two They dont settle for threes Stanford offense that scored 64 in a twopoint loss against number 20 Clemson on Wednesday night Slower paced team in ACC play And you can see it late shot clock for a Cororey Geler steps to his right and drills it And hell do that You let Benny Giler alone hell knock down that shot Hes had gamewinners this year so you got to get out to the threepoint line with him and beyond 41 threepoint shooter for a team that shoots it at 34 upper half of the country Heres Mustaf against Rajosie in our first foul of the night against Rahosi Well you can see Benny Giler had a little hesitation He was open the first look I like the escape dribble Keeps his eyes on the prize If youre a shooter eye the rim Dont take your off your eyes off the prize that he can knock shots down If youre Georgia Tech now and again I I go over this uh point that theyre going to try to get in the paint They they really like to attack and not settle for threes They want to get to the basket Kick ball Reeves who theyre missing tonight at 38 from three They have all these guards and a Kai Fleming gets the start tonight for Georgia Tech that just to your point they just love to get right downhill Well theyre old school in that respect and uh coming from a coach that was a pretty good player That was a great play defensively Fight the run out cheering Yeah watch Cooper Hes deceptive He gets steals He has been a guy coming off the bench with the what hes done for minutes played Youve got to put him in the lineup And Kyle Smith has rewarded him Came right off the bench in the first two minutes And Dongo in he muscled it home Thats thats a mans play I mean Hilt is no small guy He just shedded him and got the two in the paint Now I Okori top 10 scorer in the country one in white second leading scoreer in the ACC behind only Cameron Boozer of Duke Hell take one Threepoint shooter 31 Its probably the only part of his game that needs a jump Well he takes volume shots A big reason why that percentage is not better Dongo created space for two backtoback buckets for Bay and Dongo You can see that hes alone Stanfords going to have to do something Maybe put cheering a second defender on him Hes tough oneonone Donovan Young in the lineup for a seventh straight game since the injury to Aaro He scored I like that Donovan Young gives him some size and strength He just bullied his way over the top Thats not easy to do against these tough Georgia guards 22 starts Yeah over his first couple of years a sophomore Heres Dongo off the screen Floated up Thats intercepted Donovan Young Cory just loves to dance Here he comes Doubles there He steps back anyway and knocks it down Yeah he danced and he dined and he and I mean he just found a way to get the basket Hes so good with his dribble Youve got to keep him in front of you but he can pull up You watch him tonight He goes behind his back as Washington slipped got up and then a foul probably a bailout from Benny Keeler Well Stanford wants to maintain their aggressiveness And you know as a coach I never mind a teams picking up a couple fouls early but you dont want to do them when the other teams not attacking but you know you you got to establish yourself defensively and and with an aggression If youre going to play Georgia Tech you have to play aggressively You cant play passively I think there is some question for about the minutes right now Dongo just exited Hell take his first rest of the night Cole Carowak comes in Where does the offense come from for Georgia Tech Top 200 offensive team by efficiency in the country Boost off in It was knocked away Carowak the big sevenfooter He gets fouled Theres the third stamina Yeah And I think thats what you have to do Its by committee If its Carowak if its inside you got to get your guys Reed Reeves I mean not playing but you you got to get the ball into some guys uh that can attack the basket They dont have a lot of size Thats why theyre bringing in some of the players theyre bringing in Uh but you you know youve got to get to the foul line No way you can score Still no Mo Cela Still know Payton Marshall Two guys 610 plus Guy Fleming off 19 the other night at Cal Jump stop couldnt hit got his miss went up and drew foul Well there may there may be an answer to your question Kai Fleming for the try to get the two We got a we got a tight one in Palo Alto for Cardinal Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets just underway alongside Ben Braun Cooper Borman our great ESPN crew doing a nice start for a Georgia Tech team that came in having lost four in a row seven out of their last eight Theyre injured but here we are Threepoint game to start No And you know theyre theyre not going to make alibis Thats Damon Starttomire That thats kind of his MO And you know youre missing 67 and youre missing uh you know 6 7 foot and now you get the rest dango at 69 You dont have a lot of options So thats why I think you see Coryaku getting in so quick and cheering and if youre Georgia Tech you have to continue to do this Get to the foul line They scored 85 on Wednesday against Cal They can score Damon Starttomire Hes really and it makes sense based on who he was and his who his career has really represented The cheering guard play for Georgia Tech You see the 48 pay points So much of that has come on drives Yeah And thats incredible stat I mean Cals got some big players as well but to do that and to play Cal as tough as they did Cals got an awfully good team Cooper And for them to come back and take the lead in the second half thats quite an accomplishment especially on the West Coast David Raagin knocked that away Kelly on his way in left it off and it leads to two underneath for Jaden Bust Thats three guards that combined for two points Well and theres the pressure Youre What are you going to do You talk about changing your format That fullourt press lead yields a turnover and a a score Look how small Georgia Tech is in this lineup Jakori all the way across the way Keep it moving No good from Jeremy Dent Smith grad transfer out of Division 2 Cal State Dominguez Hills Thats a pocket pick and thats a Cory off to the races He had it knocked away He wanted the foul call there but you just saw Ibuka Cororey and what he does People forget about his defense I mean hes got long arms about 68 arms span and you cannot I said this in shoot around today You cannot cross over in front of him If you do youre going the other direction Hes really good He wanted the foul call didnt get it But he hes really tough Takes us to a timeout Were all tied up early here in the first half Tied at nine first half Stanford and Georgia Tech Referees are looking to see that last play with Ibuka Okori Jerry Heater Jeff Pod and Chase Shaw And yeah thats a challenge They have to determine if that was overwhelming uh evidence And you know from this angle Cooper it looks like there was a lot of hand They say the hands part of the ball but if you grab part of the wrist first uh it looks like you know lets take one more Its good camera work by our crew And and there is the play and the hand is underneath the ball There was some contact Well see what happens I think uh lets see what they rule Get our explanation right here Okay great job from Chase Shaw there So this is Stanford basketball That was a Georgia Tech challenge Damon Stimire just did something pretty bold 5 minutes into this game Yeah Well you know what You you got to do some bold things when youre down a couple of players and youre trying to break a losing streak Uh but you know its interesting the the challenges I think are good for the game A lot of fans dont like it but you want to get it right You want to make sure the call uh gets going in the right direction And now as Aiden Cman takes a three and knocks it down to his weak Yeah why not I mean thats all hes done in the last game and now into this game Hes been on fire Career high the other night against Clemson 19 points He was phenomenal If you had woken up on Wednesday and said Aiden Cam is going to go for 19 against the number 20 team in the country Im not sure anybody would have believed you But he played that confident as that goes out of bounds Well stay with Georgia Tech And he shot that with confidence No And we talked to him at shootaround today You were there and I think the great telling sign was look I you know I just he was in his own And he didnt think about a lot And and so when youre playing sometimes you know as smart as you are youre at Stanford youre going to be a thinker But when you get on this basketball court you got to play and you got to put a lot of thoughts uh question marks out of your mind You better be confident and play He sure was Kid from Andover Massachusetts hit us with a go Pats Oh yeah And shoot around today Heres Cam Craft Couldnt hit Came in there and he got the rebound So hes been in the game for two minutes Hes got three in one Yeah hell be in this lineup for a while I dont think Kyle Smith can afford to take him out too long Benny Keeler stepped back faked it Shot clock at 10 for Jeremy Dent Smith He loves to drive and he does and he stepped it back There was nobody there for that one Yeah tough when you make your decision to go to the basket downhill from the top Your your entry and outlet passes are in the corners or wing and he tried to pitch it back Everybody else was trying to flatten out But Jeremy Den Smiths a good player Theyre going to need his aggression this game He He can He He can turn things around Hes had huge games for this Stanford Cardinal team this year His last action for the moment Ibuka Okori checks back in after a twominute rest bit Marie Minan the German up top for Craft He steps inside He jump stops and couldnt finish again Threepoint shooters missed two inside THIS IS A CORY ONE ON THREE IT DID NOT make him Oh Oh Oh Was applause that with his left hand and the contact and the harm I mean you think hes not tough in transition Not heres the split I know theres a Super Bowl coming up the the back through There it is Splits the defenders Gets fouled and just kisses it high off the glass with his left hand Might use his left better than his right and puts the ball in the basket Chance for a threepoint play fastest kid in his class from really the moment he started running He was a middle school track star and you can believe it when you watch him do what he just did to give Stanford their largest lead early by six Hes special and when he plays well Stanford does well Must hes got a couple of buckets Fed it down and Dongo couldnt grab it Came and got a hand Okorei open floor on the spin GOT HIS MISS FIRED IT OFF OF GEORGIA Tech and keeps possession Abuka Okorei everyone Thats a big time heads up play to keep the ball alive He was spinning to the basket I think he had Benny Geler in the corner and he usually finds his shooters but he said You know what I got it going tonight and he took it to the basket Couldnt complete the play But Sanford playing awfully well early Camman tracks it down Watch him versus Andongo in the post Now feed it in for Donovan Young He dropped it He picks it up He has no dribble And El Cory checked the timer He gets inside and he scores with his left again No problem Most players are not as comfortable going with their off hand Not a Buuka Cororey Eight nothing run in two minutes Four Stanford steals nearly a fifth instead in dongo Kai Fleming on the drive in traffic He bumped Nice finishing Big time shot by Kai Fleming He can do that Freshman Really a good looking player for Damon Styomire Theyre going to need him to step up Top 100 recruit fourstar guys Really starting to look like it over the last couple of weeks very confident in that last play Cameman floated in for Young Donovan Young smaller man out of just could not hit and Dongos got a rebound Eight boards a game for Bayern Dongo Coast to coast Goodbye Now Kyle Smith not happy about the parting of the Red Sea on that one Nobody at home I mean thats not the guy you want to I know hes big and strong but you got to get somebody in there Give him some interference He looked up like what No one there Kemin fly by He couldnt put it down Young sticks it back I like the aggressiveness for Aiden Keman He might not have made that basket Thought he got fouled But how about Donovan Young on the on the putback giving them some nice minutes early Donovan Young guy who didnt play very much early in the year Fleming tried to twist that in He was fouled Paint if you didnt guard him at the three he would he would knock down threes shooting a high percentage And you know he was a guy that go get some rebounds He was an experienced player So youre losing all of that And they have not been the same team without him as you would expect but theyve got some other guys that can step up and well talk more about that later but uh it puts a challenge on them Off the free throw heres a Georgia Tech pressure David Starter team will do this Well I like that But I like that uh coach starter is is trying to pick up the pace and put some pressure on Stanford Be aggressive Cameron Grant checks in Didnt play on Wednesday night against Clemson Uggerwall refeed the post Oscar Heilte Thought he had a window Instead back out for Uggerwall who drives Shot clock at five Its still Uggerwall Got to get it up and he went up and down Traveled for a turnover Yeah I think you know thats not his game really getting into the paint and posting up but he had opportunities to go up maybe get a foul call Um but you know hes a guy that usually gets shots and open looks Uh Hilte very unselfish you know had an opportunity to take his man oneonone with no help If youre a post guy you got to try to get inside and make something happen Prove that you need to get a double team maybe score a score a basket if you can But uh Stanford is trying to look inside Cam Craft I mean hes really the four right now Hes 66 the second tallest player on the floor for the Yellow Jackets Remagan nice finish over the top of Cameron Grant Well theyre going to get that with their guard play Theyre going to be able to take bigger players and kind of step them back and get some looks They just have to be able to knock them down So theyre taking advantage little against big on that end On this end Cory couldnt hit Now you got big little on the Stanford offense Yeah No its just you know its the way youre choosing to play Craft great shooter Exhibit A You said it and he backed you up Cooper I mean good shooter Absolutely He knocked that shot down as you announced it Must have heard you 7 nothing Georgia Tech run after an eight nothing Stanford run earlier in the first half Well hes not exactly unguarded either but you know here it is the kick out Hes big hand up You got a 7ft arm span going over the top But that shows you if youre a shooter you cant worry about the challenge shots You know you want to get challenged shots but you have to have your eyes in the rim and get some art He puts tremendous arc on that on that ball Reagan was called for the foul so hes got two Hes out Jaden Mustaf comes back into the game Young to Nova Yeah Well right idea but when youre feeding the ball from the top youve got to make sure the post player doesnt have a a defensive post player doesnt have a hand or foot across Not much of an angle there A tough angle to feed Dan Smith back in Jaylen Thompson gets his first minutes of the night 24 and white defending right now And Dongo hes doubled Spits it across Heres Craft Got a smaller man on him instead Lamar Washington downhill blocked Donovan Young and hes the first man to it in draws a foul on Indongo Well how about this series in this sequence were looking at Donovan Young I mean gets comes all the way over times the block and then gets the loose ball I mean keeps it alive and draws the foul He hes been active you know hes starting to get his feet wet Hadnt played missed a lot of the opening part of the season with injury Now hes starting to get some significant minutes and they need it with the injury Two on par No question Den Smith pocket pass Roz Yeah good look by Jeremy Den Smith You called it pocket pass off the dribble Steve Nash dribble it and let it go right off the dribble Love that play Stanford led pretty big Georgia Tech took the lead now Onepoint game Stanford back on top And dongo intercepted again Ibuka Okori fits Stanford cheering steal and then the favor returned by Washington Georgia Techs not going to stand for that long MOST CLEAR out everybody You think Georgia Techs not afraid to attack the basket Thats the second flush of the last couple of possessions Theyre aggressive They do attack the paint Pretty good 11 minutes of college basketball Deep one Den Smith off the mark and Lamar Washington very good rebounding guard pulled that down with one arm Now Georgia Tech can really defensive rebound Washington couldnt finish over top of Rahosi Ibuka Okori three rebounds a game in his game Pulls it down Seven early points for the ACCs second leading scoreer Ibuka Okori Hes got it here and hes got space to work with Got a switch on Washington deep one Not for him That he knew that was in When the ball left his hands he started backpedling He knew that was in Thats thats the confidence with which that young man plays First man to 10 points Three for seven start from three for Stanford And how about Georgia Tech Good threepoint shooting team 36 top 60 in the country Theyve only taken one as Craft misses on the ground Anybody can get there Its Washington who blew the layup and Al Cory Hes one on two Thats usually enough On his way at cheering you know what slight of hand is I I know theres a guy named Houdini but I dont know Doesnt get much better off of the wind So uh you got to admire his ability to want to take big shots put the ball in his hands Uh Cal Smith elected not to call timeout which I dont think in the end might have been a good move because otherwise you call timeout he might not get that last shot So uh Cal Smiths been around the block I mean hes been a tremendous coach coaching the year in the back 12 Washington State obviously done a great job USF now here at Stanford in the short time hes been here Hes watched a 6 nothing Stanford run to give them a fivepoint lead Georgia Tech 36 threepoint shooting team has taken just one three so far Theyve done just this again and again Most spins it in I dont know how he got to the rim against Jaylen Thompson I mean Jaylen Thompson was all over him and he just used his body Its funny an offensive player turns his body You got to move McCory boy he just wants to shoot tonight Muscled that up It was taken away Probably his first bad cheering shot of the night Bad in air quotes Washington Thats stripped by D Smith Thats his sixth Stanford steal of the night Wow How about the reach out there on the other end from Chaz Kelly the third Now its Moosetop Wants to go right and its blocked into a wedgie Thats a jump ball And were going the other way But you know h how do you get by Youve got to be able to attack And when you attack watch this move Its the Its Its the hesitation and the spin I mean two great moves in the same possession Add a reverse layup to finish the deal Stanfords scout about him was all about the right hand Well he went to the left side of the rim with his right hand there Yeah he still got what he wanted and went to a strong hand Tremendous move Jaylen Thompson basted in getting four minutes since the Al injury Thats his seventh and eighth point of the year Yeah but hes looking more comfortable on the floor Hes hes not afraid to take the ball to the basket make something happen Six of those eight points have come since that injury to Apara waiting jumped it out Its a lot of space for crap but he traveled before he hit the three Well he wanted to get to the open spot Needed the uh dribble and and didnt put it down Good call by the officials If youre Georgia Tech now you got to get back to getting some stops Theyve gotten some good possessions defensively but theyre going to keep some pressure on here I mean if youre playing against a Cory its interesting to hear Damon Stamar talked to us about it today He said Look hes going to get a shot Hes going to get a shots Hes going to get points You just want to make sure he doesnt have monster game and try to limit the touches and shot chances he gets or and keep him off the line The big task is easier said than done And its 13 points for Cory on five of 10 shooting so far Right back to him Well hes going to get his points His point was you know he gets his He got to keep the other guys down Heres Aorei again Oneonone dancing jumping Geler steps takes a three and knocks it down Now Benny Geler is just lethal from three I mean hes now got the ability to give you the shot fake You got to honor it You go for it He gets the side escape dribble and three Good play by Benny Gayler He said two off of that Stanford by eight Kelly created some space Keep it moving An open three Thats no good from Eric Chatfield the freshman from Atlanta whos up late a lot for Georgia Tech McCory quick trigger knocks another one down Starting to look like one of those nights But what you see is what youre getting from Ibuka Cororey I mean he theres so many ways that he can give it to you and hes going to get his points Damon Sidomar was right on Hes you know youre not going to keep him down for long Hes had one or two bad or off nights this year Not many He is 16 So much of that 142 run Indongo couldnt hit Hell had the defense and the rebound Bigs for Stanford had held up so far against Indongo Ai he looks surprised he missed Well thats a heat check but hes earned that Chafffield got out of there Georgia Tech needs one Largest Stanford lead Mustaf Washington Theyre two for two from three Yeah much needed shot by Georgia Tech They needed that desperately Now getting ready to go down to the 4minute TV timeout But you got to if youre Stanford get good shots You know this Georgia Tech team is not going away They climbed all the way back against Cal 14 down to take the lead in the second half Got an off ball whistle and a foul against Georgia Tech You know its interesting Cooper and you look at Corys stats and hes only 31 from three but you know hes had a couple bad games and one of them against Cal is arch rival 0 for nine and one for 16 that just doesnt happen very often They did a nice job on him but when you have to take the baler shots from three to help your team try to come back your percentages go down But you can throw those percentages out if youre playing against McCory Ugger wall couldnt hit Geler got the rebound tapped it out Thats Benny Giler at 61 who got there Hes open for three He made it happen Now he looked it off He looked his defender off I And Ive seen him play enough He I knew he was shooting it Its tough You give him a look from three hes going to drop it Hes going to give it up Kid who had one D1 offer at a high school UC Riverside walked on here Nice load Good finish on the other end from Eric Chatfield Just his 11th game of the season Freshman from Atlanta Now the question is can Stanford get some other guys like Benny Geler going and Ryan Agarwal Jeremy Den Smith Theyve got to get some guys that can shoot it And this has been a way to go and score too is to get uh hand Gayer was short Lamar Washington hit ahead at Chadfield He scores Yeah that was a tough play in transition I think Vinnie Geler made a decision to go for the ball and probably thought twice about it Decided he wasnt going to get it It was too late Backtoback bucket Sevenpoint game Yeah Georgia Tech theyll do this to you McCory dancing Foul on the rebounding action against I think Andongo Well check it If it is its his second Stanford by seven Doesnt have a monster night Hes done four or five things You saw it on the highlight as Gailer misses a three Boy he was in there on the rebounding action Now its Chatfield transition Lamar Washington Georgia Tech keeps punching back Well that shouldnt happen Kyle Smiths not happy about it I know that you you take a three and they come back and get the defensive rebound and come back on you but Georgia Techs a tremendous defensive rebounding team So you got to know theyre going to go up and climb the glass and maker really good at at uh converting uh on the offensive end from defense Josie needs some help He does get out of there Stanford content to go down under 10 Some of the slowest possessions in the league Gayler 4 seconds Underwall got to get it up Thats great defense by Georgia Tech I mean theyve made it difficult now and and as I mentioned if you do get a shot against them theyre not going to give you too many offensive rebounds Stanford got a couple early but not many late Theyre just very stingy with giving up offensive rebounds Now Stanfords going to his own zone now trying to pack it in a little bit on this team for good reason Georgia Techs only taken two threes of the game Find the man in the middle Moose stop Tough step back He could not hit and dongo was followed by Uggerwall in the rebounding action Yeah good decision by Kyle Smith down the stretch here If you can try to collapse your defense keep your bigs at home and make this Georgia Tech team hit some outside shots make them knock down some threes and hed only taken three threes Kai Fleming can knock it down coming off 19 and the fivepoint loss to Cal on Wednesday And they hit another They havent shot a lot but they made them now And he had a little something to say to the the Sanford bench like you want to stay in that zone youre going to get more of this I you got to like be the the competitiveness I you know people think thats trash talk Thats just confidence and and confidence in your ability and you know fight Jackets have lost four in a row Stanfords lost five in a row You got the sense talking of both sides They are sick and tired of it In the corner thats a three Donovan Young joins the party He does that He really gives you a lift because you know hes tough to the basket Washington got fouled by Giler Yeah You see Georgia Techs approach down the stretch here Theyre going to try to attack you on mantoman coverage Man zone doesnt make any difference if youve got one on the ball Theyre going to get into the gaps and try to go by you and youre going to have to defend if youre a defender to depend on your helpside defenders to step in the gap Very quick team to defend And theyre right now doing a good job as Georgia Tech and Damon Sodtomire of getting now to the foul line Oscar also in one and one for Lamar Washington 75 shooter Folks coming up next well get you to Provo at 1030 Eastern 730 Pacific on ESPN The night capped off by number eight Houston and number 16 BYU game thatll be back end didnt go Wall the rebound Final minute of a first half that has seen seven lead changes between Stanford and Georgia Tech and mostly Ibuka Okorei who just drew a foul Well thats what he does I mean he shows you his body Hes not afraid of contact and very seldom is he just going to put the ball in front of you but he he uses his body to shield and he can draw fouls If youre playing against him you got to make him go over the top of you and try to finish Easier said than done but hes so adept at getting to the foul line Hes done this all season long Hes made both so far tonight 82 free throw shooter sitting on 16 first half points Hes got the front end First place in the SEC by the way on the line ABC Sunday womens basketball matchup Joyce Edwards and third rank South Carolina against number 19 Tennessee Coverage on ABC begins at 3 Eastern tomorrow Hes one of the top freshman scorers of all time here Casey Jacobson who I coached against was awfully good and hes knocking down his record if he hasnt already just put it you know in the record books But that was a nice inside play cheering And Dongo two bites at it Couldnt go TRYING TO GET A THIRD down at Sheffield to get the job done And Dongos kind of grinning like how did I miss those I had two three point point blank layups or dunks Little guy picks up the slag Perfect guy in the middle of that zone And Dongo shot clock off 20 seconds uh you know the balls going to be in Abuka Corys hands and youve got Georgia Tech showing you zone Thats not a smart thats not a bad move now to see if they can try to close the gaps and make somebody else pay a JUMP IT DOWN WHAT A PASS YOUNG COULDNT FINISH ONE second at the buzzer block to do it and end one heck of a first half at Maples Pavilion Great finish on Wednesday Georgia Tech battled back from down big to get back into that game Stanford had a shot at the buzzer to win it Both have had to sit with the taste of frustration over the last four days Yeah as a coach and as a player you dont like that The best thing you can do is play as soon as possible Jaden Mustaf had eight points He was the joint leading scorer with a Kai Fleming for Georgia Tech And you see and go down low for Fleming That was a play coming out of halftime and executed perfectly I mean just a backside screen on a post up Thats something you dont see a lot And they got a layup Put it in the post with your best player available And then Flemings the first man to 10 points for Georgia Tech Ibuka Okori 18 points in the first half for the freshman Floated down for AJ Rosi in the post Its Raosi going at Andongo He scores Hes a skilled post guy I mean the only hole in this game is his free throw shooting other end Raosi fouls Lets look at that play that opening play coming out I mean the post up takes place and then youre trying to watch the guy thats posting up but what happens is you lose sight of the backside guys You play one pass away but they gave up a backside screen and a and a and a cut to the basket Now if youre Stanford you got to correct something in a hurry Theyve given up some transition baskets uh you know here and and thats hurt them Theres no way that you should score on one end and get beat coming back in in the other I know Kyle Smith talking the staff talking to his players about it Kyles not happy about it You can see hes got his head down and he wants it to be tougher You cant depend on You cant depend on your free throw defense Cooper to stop Sorry I couldnt hear you The students just got free shack Yeah well theyre here and thats a good way to get them in the house Theyre active but Rahosi is pretty tough on the block against Endongo Hes gone back to back Andongo has two fouls and you can see theres a little bit of give and take there Well its smart S smart on Stanfords behalf to go and isolate Bust had it blocked out of bounds Stays with Tech but thats not thats by design Youre saying Okay were going to go at your best player See if we can pick up a third and and Rahosi is really agile with his feet Great footwork But here you can see the blocks I mean youve got a couple of guys here two two players blocked that shot BACK DOOR CROPPED OH MAN thats our second leg of the night Yeah I dont know whats going on there but uh if you get the ball high off the glass thats not supposed to happen But that ball was blocked off the glass And what a what a great back door cut If youre a shooter the best thing you can do when youre getting pressured back cut And he did I thought Craft did a great job of of isolating and back cut betting to the rim for for two shots cheering ABC NBA Sunday Showcase double header Jaylen Brown of the Celtics hosting Jaylen Brunson and the Knicks Good Eastern

Jaylen Brown a Calgrad Cal Cal alum And Damon Stomire is on that staff Absolutely He coached one of my former players on the Celtics AJ Rahosi Three straight possessions this matchup Spinning three straight scores Well thats just really smart basketball Give Kyle Smith credit I mean hes isolated Nango for good reason because he cannot afford ill afford to pick up a foul or a series of fouls One of really two tall guys remaining on the Georgia Tech bench and Dongo threw it away Well he had a chance to go up and return the favor But you know look at Raosi what hes done AJ Roi a local product here division two player by the way division three And look what hes done Hes gotten the ball to the basket They theyve called his number Uh really good post player His footwork is excellent and their team has done a good job Just when you think its about a Cororey theyve changed gears and theyve gone inside to the big fell Former walkon at Washington State under Kyle Smith He was smart to bring him here Right back to him Fourth straight possession Double was a little late He got it out Set a three that Ugger Wall couldnt hit Thats a rebound inside for Lamar Washington Georgia Tech on the run Washington cross Boy hit the floor very hard and he stays down Extra man for Stanford right now as Washington gets up slowly It leads to a three D Smith cheering Yeah Jeremy Den Smiths not going to miss that shot You give him that open look Hes had games where hes been on fire from three Stanford going to the two3 and Damon Sodomire really smart timeout Raosi if hes got one kryptonite though its his free throw shooting He struggled from the line Dont be surprised to see Damon Sodtomire and Georgia Tech foul now Saw Lamar Washington take a hard fall before the break Hes in and Craft miss Theres rebound underneath for Stanford Cole Carowak is in the game and hes trying to track down Rozie Craft got the job done Well instead of laying it up he wanted to get the dunk and that probably cost him the two but cant blame him He wanted to make a shot emphatically Fleming has a rebound Well he made up for it there and got the big rebound but if youre Georgia Tech youre going to try to again get down low if you can and get it out of his hands Aore split the world You You cant forget about him for long Hes been quiet but as I said hes hes not a selfish player but when he sees an opening hell play Heres the two3 zone the matchup zone that Kyle Smith will employ for Stanford Passes come here to Mustaf Tough shot Thats an a Cory rebound He was Stanfords leading rebounder of the first half Hes coast to coast Theres a Lamar Washington rebound for Georgia Tech Ninepoint game Fleming taken away by a Cory Eight STANFORD STEEL LEADS to two Well how about the steel by a Cororey I mean we talked about it his ability to get in the passing lane The dribbling is lethal on on the dribble Hes got 22 Largest Stanford lead 13point game Fleming in double figures already on the spin Shot clock late Got to get it up Mustap didnt get close Thats good defense by Stanford But Abuka Cororey we got something going on Ive served on committees with him Uh hes innovative I mean a tremendous AD Mike was here when Mike Montgomery was here Had some awful successful teams much to my chagrin I might add But uh just a really really good person but uh I mean great AD but even a better person Now his daughter works at at Stanford It was uh it was strangely friendly between you No weve always had a great relationship I dont like didnt like playing his teams but he was always supportive of me and my teams as well but he was an advocate for the league the Pack 12 for years Uh he he was so much a part of of that success of that league Uh always innovative and and uh you know hes what an athletic director should be He supports his coaches and hes done so much You hear Damon Stodder talk about Ted Leand Leland He loves to realize hes not only did he got him a job at Pacific hired him there but he was instrumental helping him get to Georgia Tech as well Youd have to think hes enjoying the game tonight Seven lead changes between the two teams Well they better keep inviting Ted back with these results Den Smith 3 seconds gets it Rebound to Chaz Kelly The third does not yet have a point for Georgia Tech Theyve scored just four the start of the second half Stanford scored 13 to open up their biggest lead of the night Eric Chadfield gave him great minutes Two and blue in the first half Its Kelly still with that zero Pass was affected Comes to Chatfield Kick it out Wide open three Fleming got it Yeah hes been a really tough player for Georgia Tech He stepped up huge I mean just a freshman Hes going to have a great career Had a turnover and a foul Cameman ends up on top of remagin Cal Smith not happy about that turn of events you you cant relax against Georgia Tech and again I go back to the Cal game just their very last game you thought that game was away and they came all the way back had a chance to win maybe this in parts of the second half when they took the lead then Cal had to put them away but theyre going to fight and so you dont want to make it easy for Georgia Tech you got to you got to continue to play at the pace youve played at Stanfords played well but you got continue to play well Georgia Tech will not go away You know we we talked about Damon Starttomire and why hes been successful And you know he thinks the game a little differently than most coaches Cooper he hes got a real uh interesting way of analyzing the game He comes up with things that really you dont think about And Ive coached a long time but when he was with me at Rice he he had a way to read players He had a great way to read the opponents And you know hes had such a successful run I think he was at Arizona a tremendous player there just an allstar Uh got drafted the NBA successful NBA career but hes hes also a players coach Hell get in his players but he also understands the psychology of todays players You look around at this roster and he was such a great guard The way his guards play a Cory got it out dead Thompson fighting for the rebound and Dongo just took it Thats a mans play Yeah So Damon Dynamar you know his players will mirror him a lot of his their toughness Post battle down there between Indono and Thompson Reagan pocket pass Indongo had it effective Got it back and drew a foul on Thompson Thats a second missed dunk I think he thought itll be a little easier than it was but you know Stampers battling They got some big guys in there Aiden Cams you know 610 Hes not going to let you just put it over the top of him But you see what Georgia Techs trying to do Theyre going to try to get to the line shorten the game up a little bit maybe get stop the clock and just inch back in this game And theyre capable So if youre Stanford you know buyer beware cheering This games a long way from over Coming up ESPN 1030 Eastern Provo Utah 730 Pacific night capped off by number eight Houston and number 16 BYU cheering Hey Cooper I got to give a shout out to Bobby Crims I hope hes watched this game I go way back with Bobby Kremens and one of the great alltime great coaches but one of the great alltime guys and uh he still shows his way here and there talked to longtime radio guys here today and Bobbs you know got his name on the floor So uh hes hes special Um one of the alltime greats Just out of curiosity is there a coach that you dont know No laughter I doubt it If you do its his problem Yeah Well no I This means Ive been around for a while but Im fortunate to have been friends with a lot of coaches through the years Its a fraternity Alongside Ben Braun Cooper Borman Stanford basketball sevenpoint lead I Okori dancing one two three had it knocked away Its Fleming on the run out M again Thatll stay with Georgia Tech Well Stanford very fortunate Let me tell you this They get they get the basket Thats 51 Maybe a chance for a threepoint play Thats 52 Theyve just nailed this almost to a one possession game Again theyre not going away Youre there was good hustle by Stanford getting back in transition Kai Flemings given them some great minutes these last two games of the West Coast trip that down right to Geralt and they got away with one Well you know it looked like a travel Im not sure if it was but it sure looked like one Eight nothing run A left alone cheering I I dont understand because Aorei finds a way to hurt you in every way he can And I mean a lot of people say thats not a great shot He launched from three Youre trying to protect your lead but when youre Ibuka Cororei you get a couple of luxury freebies Youre allowed to take that shot Hes got 25 He hasnt missed in the second half Its Fleming step back Thats a really tough shot and he got the roll Well you see that Georgia Techs unfazed before he hits the three but theyre not coming back and going anywhere So again Stanford the onus of them they got to maintain Cory back on the run Nearly carried it and then had it taken Fouled Chaz Kelly the third laughter He was trying to like pull what he wanted to say out of his mouth and just put it away Yeah he he said Yeah that was a great I love that There is a I dont know about that one I sold it but he may have a point there And I think You know you cant go back and challenge fouls If you could you would challenge that one but I love the demeanor like you know ref you can put your whistle in your pocket You dont need to blow it right there Its only the its the first foul against Georgia Tech in this second half too Georgia Tech showing you some zone now Theyre going to change things up a little bit against Stanford Theres the zone Dan Smith attacking it with the dribble Fouled Raosi undercut underneath We got a game at Maples 5953 second half Game with 12 to go Well theyve got a great coaching staff at Georgia Tech and theyre going to figure some things out They just fight but theyve got guys that have coached on national championship teams been head coaches in the ACC or the 10 Aorei Wow Got it cheering Wow man applause You know you can you can scout all you want Cooper but that just a oneonone He knew enough that a guys on his hip Anytime a defenders on your hip Youre clever enough to draw that foul And thats I mean this is a two possession game You put the ball in a Corys hands he now has a chance to separate as he as he does as he did Kid who shows up doesnt say a word just walks in the gym makes quiet play after quiet play has 28 points Yeah hes gone for 30 a couple of times this year He probably get there again But heres Stanford going back to their two3 zone making Georgia Tech attack and score it And Fleming did that Yeah is a guy right now you hes finding opportunities Hes got 17 Yeah hes had a great game Theyre going to need him down the stretch Three off of his careerhigh of 20 for the freshman from Marietta Georgia AJ Roi in the post Cory baseline had to flip it out and he did But Den Smith got it done Thats the danger of Ibuka Cory He finds his teammates and he found Jeremy Den Smith for yet another three Stanford needed two buckets A Cororey makes them both happen Thats right He Fleming doubled fast this time and a Cory near the early steal instead Remaga to the corner CHATFIELD cheering D SMITH GOT AWAY FROM everybody and finishes Uh hes putting together quite a game right now The three he just hit the breakaway two Stanford trying to separate here Big turnaround Big big run by Stanford Fleming and dongo Wow That bolted up in the air down to earth and Fleming saved it Hes on the sideline Got a foul against Dead Smith I cant believe there was basketball court left over there Not much I thought they were going to call a timeout It wasnt but wow Its also the third foul on AJ Roi Roosi and Aiden Cam really the two main bigs for Stamford both with three fouls Cammans coming back into the game as Rozie sits Well you think Stanfords in good shape because theyre theyve built a double digit lead but now you got a little foul trouble in play and youve got a Georgia Tech team thats capable of coming back So youre still going to have to finish this game if youre Stanford Fleming boy he is a microwave No you know he shoots it like microwave like Vinnie Johnson Its funny you said that That was a line drive and just when you think its theres no trajectory its a line drive into the net Hes gone for 19 now in backtoback games Well its a 10point game now McCory down low Cam lost it on the way up and thats a foul And Aiden came pointing at the rim Its like Im going up I wasnt passing it You said to Aiden the other day about the other day like You werent thinking huh He goes Yeah I wasnt thinking I was just playing And you know its all interesting with players Cooper that and hes one of them too that that you know hes such a bright kid and hes just he understands a game and hes a Stanford student but you know its funny when when youre in the zone sometimes youre not Youre youre letting your instincts and your aggression take over And he was aggressive He had the game of his career He put he helped put his team in a position to beat Clemson And by the way Clemsons an awfully good basketball team but they had them beat if Abuka Cororey hits that last shot They they walk out of here with a win 19 points five rebounds two steals two blocks and hes averaging five points this year So yes he was in his zone And uh you know hes much like Maxim Reno that played on this team uh who made a big jump between his sophomore and junior year This young mans capable as well Maybe not to that level but hes capable of getting better He has a high ceiling Takes the lead back to 12 for Stanford Kai Fleming has scored the last six points for Georgia Tech Jaden Mustaf Cam Craft Mustaf nice spin got to the hoop and couldnt finish Thats the tip in from Indungo Thats what you get for attacking the basket The help side comes and you dont clean up the backside block Good offensive rebound McCory going to the line Well Georgia Techs a little frustrated because theyre allowing Cory to get to the free throw line But if youre guarding him oneonone with no help and hes quick at at isolating he gets to the basket before the help can come it makes it tough Really respects this young man but and you know gave him his ultimate compliment Says I dont care what we do you know hes going to get some points We just got to make sure the other guys dont get big games and he doesnt have a an extraordinary day But you know hes done this a number of times So hes going to get points Can they get other guys stops But Damon also was playing without three of his or two of his top big guys Kyle Smiths I got got to be pleased now But hes got he knows this teams got to close the door here This games a long way from over 29 Yeah And how do you Yeah And if you look at how hes done Cooper theres a lot of good freshman in in the country Look at the the company hes keeping By the way youre talking about Damasca and Boozer the top two top two in the three freshman And hes right there with them step for step He has 30 points tonight Ibuka Okorei Stanford by 12 Dongo Tempo slowed considerably for Tech Mustaf couldnt get there Hilt wasted one arm Yeah nice nice defensive rebound by Hilt Hes got some pretty good stats for minutes play Thats hes a good rebounder Five a game Cory Ugger Wall Guy Flemings really been the only offense for Georgia Tech in the last five minutes Passed it nicely to Washington Led him to that got it back and hit the hand of Kee and Dongo for two Nice hands Lost control of the ball picked it up quickly and got it off the glass And again heres Georgia Tech just kind of hanging around I mean theyre right in this game still Problem is Stanford in the second half 59 from the field Yeah theyre showing you what they can do Theyre coming off of one of their better games they played if they didnt come away with the win against Clemson Cory with two around him trying to rip a pass down He got a bounce Hell take outside Camman left alone Well fake set that up Thought he was going to hit it Washington has the rebound Who stopped behind the back Oneon two into Camman He missed it And now the run for Stanford Ryan Uggerwall leaves it off D Smith Back to the corner Uggerwall hesitated Takes it in Ryan Uggerwall gets the roll Well thats what he can do cheering You know hes not a post up guy but if you take away his three which a lot of teams do he will at his size get in the paint and go over the top of you Dongo twists it in Well I like the high low Great attack by Georgia Tech High post entry against his own The big guy comes up to guard and you duck in your big on the block Thats an unstoppable play Wings dont get down down there quick enough Cory gets a screen Split two More went high couldnt hit and then a foul Kee I think shoved Craft in the back to take us to a timeout Still a 10point game 30 for that man Efficient I mean nine field goal attempts and hes been perfect from three Carowak out of the timeout He finishes and one How about the play call against the zone out of the timeout Youre talking about Damon Starter Didnt play against much zone as a pro and and they didnt play any zone when he was at Arizona So hes learned some basketball Hes paid attention Thats a great high low out of the timeout A chance for a threepoint play And just when you think Stanfords got a little cushion heres Georgia Tech breathing down your back And by the way I dont want to say it too early A perfect 9 for nine from the free throw line I knew Id screw that one up Carowaks a career 0 for four Now 0 for five But hes the man who got the tip to the rebound to a three Craft thought it was in Rajos got the rebound Yeah he knocks that down Watch out But Stanford still got to be efficient here Boy Stanford didnt dodge a bullet They dodged a nuclear missile That would have been huge Heres Benny Giller playing with three fouls He hasnt played a lot Theres a foul Carowak wrapped up Rozie down low Not a bad foul And and again if Rozie has to shoot free throws a 33 free throw shooter thats got to be part of Georgia Techs uh game plan Youre not going to let him get to the basket without trying to get some free throws But youre Its just amazing that Georgia Techs playing without two of their top big guys and theyre still outscoring Stanford in the paint 3632 Thats a big stat And now defending the paint Craft got his hand in there got a takeaway And here comes Georgia Tech all night You think theyre out of it They come right back Kelly had that strip Got it back Needs some help Heres Fleming Next points a careerhigh Stanford knew it They doubled Finds Washington Missed their last few threes Theyve had their chances Those are big good looks Wide open for Georgia Tech 30 points for Cory Take a little time maybe unless hes got a drive and hes fouled Yeah And thats you know you got the pos decision to make You take time off the clock but you dont want to kill your momentum And if you able to get to the line with Tuka Cory you take those odds any day How about the fact Ben hes about to take his 172nd free throw of the season Yeah freshman not afraid of contact Hes more durable than you think Hes a strong player and he knows how to draw fouls So what a weapon it has to have Abuka Cororey on your side That works strong I mean hes listed at 621 185 You see him in person he is so much sturdier than you think he is Well hes got a demeanor on him too People dont talk about that a lot He doesnt seem to get rattled even when hes having a a down game or missing shots He always feels his next shots going to go in or hell find something else to do His shots not going down Hell get to the line Hell find his teammate So he really plays beyond his years as a freshman 32 for Ibuka Okorei Dongo barely got that and then it was taken away Aiden Came big miss Its a transition IT IS 34 cheering with the left hand Why not His off hand looks like his dominant hand You cant tell Another ball on the ground Roi got in front of it off his knees He gets it away Big play by AJ Roi to take that one away So Tech had cut into it down to seven McCory came right back Hes got 32 Being chased by two He spun into a triple and got fouled I think by Kelly And you watch Ibuka Cororey again Hes as you mentioned his strength but look at his ability to just change his speed get to the glass Once he gets to the left hes good I mean he just really slight of hand I mean he shows you the ball takes it away tucks it then when hes passed you he shows it back again and just really adept at getting the ball off the glass with his left But hes really good at at drawing fouls 35 applause If he makes this one hell tie a careerhigh of 36 in the win over North Carolina earlier in January But you know how hard it is to score when everybody in the gym including your opponents knows youre trying to go for points yet he still finds a way to do it Thats the sign of a great player I mean its just hard but he makes it look easier Its true You know it I know it We spent all morning talking about it with both coaches He has 36 Largest Stanford lead of 14 Washington to the corner Fleming had a block Cam all over cheering it 610 makes a difference applause Ninth Stanford block Ibuka Okori sitting on a careerhigh trying to set a new one on the dance Boy watch him go Its Aorei Ripped a pass to the corner Den Smith sets it Shot clock at six Its up and its good cheering Jeremy Den Smith Why not Thats the Stanford team thats knocked off some big teams this year and had Clemson on the ropes Huja try to snap a fivegame losing streak The Stanford Cardinal keep the atlarge hopes alive They have four quad one wins on the resumes Chhatfield goes with the bang Yeah nice look You know I think back of what Damon Startar talked He said Look were just going to make it hard on a Cororey We know hes going to get his points And by the way he has made it hard Dory makes things look easy but hes had some tough tough takes Offensive foul screen but it is 36 for that man Is it easy for Ibuka Cory He makes it Look at that Four quad ones And And so theyre still there Theyre hanging around Theyre you cant tell them that their season hopes are are dashed Theyre going to continue to play and so this is a big win one at a time They were on the bubble in mid January Theyve lost five in a row So theres no question theyre not in the tournament fields Fleming miss and Ugger Walls got it Den Smith to the hoop to theres no question that you know their their tournament hopes are theyre not in it right now but they were close against Clemson Theyre going to probably win a Oh man A Cory with a block Theyre probably going to win what was a cant lose tonight but you cant go back and play what if because they did have Clemson on the ropes Cam in going to the line and and Clemson is showing you how good they are Theyre theyre up at Cal and thatll be a big win for Clemson as well Cals fighting hard to get into the playoff picture Theyve had some good wins this year to be sure but you know basketballs a long season It its you know you got to look at the entirety of your resume and you want to be playing your best basketball at the end for a couple reasons One you could get at large bids Two you still got the tournament and and anything can happen in a tournament Every one of these teams are good enough to advance in your own tournament And sometimes youre playing against teams that know theyre in the NCAA tournament and so they give up some games in the tournament And so you got opportunities and thats why you want to be continue to play well How fun is Charlotte going to be for the ACC Its going to be a monster tournament Mustaf into Dan Smith locking foul Jeremy Dent Smith took a good hit there He he gave up his body and hes a tough kid man He Hell come out on his own but hes modeling it off Hes not going to let you know hes hurt Um but Ive been impressed with Stanford because Georgia Tech came here with with an effort tonight Uh Cooper I mean and and obviously uh Kyle Smith knows that he knew he was going to get Georgia Techs best shot He respects the job that came starter and his staff Carl Hobs a veteran coach GW was on the was on the uh Connecticut uh staff that won the national tournament as the associate And then Bon Wells former player at Ball State that I coached again against as a player and a former NBA player So hes got a good staff and hes you know Damons going to get his team ready But Kyle Smith and his staff they he got his team ready to play today game they needed and a game theyre going to get Well thats right And and and theyve earned it But they they you know basketball is a cumulative game You you want to play well because its going to affect you usually your next game Theres a certain identity your team has to have They could have felt bad about the game that the the hangover could have lingered on that loss to and I asked Kyle I said Are you guys over that game He said Were over it You know the guys are theyre putting it behind them Were not theyre not saying what could have been talked to Jeremy Den Smith had a chance to make a big bass a couple of their kids today and they they let it go They just they said its on to this game This game is more important But heres the trouble that AJ Roi has He really just struggles for a rhythm He was a 65 free throw shooter in his last year uh before he transferred and just struggled this year at 33 And I think its kind of gotten in his head that if you know free throw shooting is so psychological a lot of times See it there He was out early working today Yeah he was Three is good Jaden Must stop You got to feel if Georgia Tech can get their full complement of players back theyre still going to present some problems for some teams in the ACC Ugger Wall burns a timeout Its also the ACC and so theyve got some talent as well but you just no easy stops in this league I ai by the way still on 36 points And its tied for a careerhigh And he has a look in his eye like he wants another new career high And hes downhill OKORE GOT cheering A NEW career high 38 You read him Cooper You You look in his eye and you know you know that look and you saw it and he he didnt let you down I think everyone in California knew 38 Craft not close rebound to Young and Stanford is on its way to a fourth ACC win and on its way to finishing a fivegame losing streak Ugger Wall Youngs got it Boy Cory he wants 40 You could see it A COROREY FOR 40 HES GOING TO THE line with a chance The whole student section saying it behind us Well you know its interesting In a game not long ago he was was responsible for 40 points which is good enough stat to begin with Now hes responsible for the 40 hes going to get and his teammates How about hes probably contributed to about 50 to 60 tonight Thats how good Abuka Cory has been this evening against Georgia Tech The pride of Nasha New Hampshire Well he gets these points You might see somebody at the scorers table I think hes proven his point but the last thing you want to see is him coming down with any type of injury 12 for 12 from the line 39 points for Abuka Okori Or theyll just ride it out but well see This has been quite a performance We weve been treated to Heres the Heres the stop Jeremy D Smith will give a curtain call to a hookah of Cory What a performance tonight applause cheering Im not supposed to be biased but I feel like standing up and clapping a little bit And this is Stanford I never clap for Stanford Ive never in my life clap for Stanford But you got to respect what this young mans done And and by the way Damon Stomire the competitor he is a lot of respect for this young applause man It takes one to no one How about this one Its the first 40point game by a Stanford Cardinal since February 7th 2002 So 24 years ago to the day when Casey Jacobson went for 41 against your check Yeah Dont make sure its not Kell Thats all I Thats all Im asking you I dont want to be part of a record and it might have been by the way Ive seen Casey go off cheering more Ivan Young 92 for the Stanford Cardinal 24 years ago to the day The last Stanford 40point game Ibuka Aorei gets it done as Chapfield misses it Aggerwalls got the rebound and the Stanford Cardinal didnt get their you know on one win today but they may have just gotten their biggest win of the year Well its a statement And its your next game and its how you played and its the way to bounce back after a really tough emotional loss It was painful to lose to Clemson They felt like they had that game Dan Smith Well they can save a few of these but you know what Georgia Tech will regroup too you you feel bad because they dont have their full complement of players but you know this is the nature of the game that youre playing in and its a tough league but youre cheering as good as your next game So both players both teams will regroup but tonight it was all about Stanford and Ibuka Cory 40 points for
