as Frank would say Well basketball fans of the state of Massachusetts theyve waited more than a decade for this matchup But Boston College and UMass back on the floor playing one another for the 48th time for the first since 2014 And its Boston College that starts with the basketball Offensive foul illegal screen called cheering against Jaden Hastings Lets take a look at tonights starting lineups brought to you by the basketball hall of fame A UMass team thats transitioning or transitioned from the Atlantic 10 to the MAC this season 6 and3 record for Frank Martin squad and Marcus Banks Jr number 24 in white demands a lot of the basketball I go away from him here fadeaway off the back iron for Daniel Hanken Sanford as we show you the Boston College starting lineup brought to you by the basketball hall of fame and Luca Taves has moved into the back back court with Fred Payne and Donald Han Jr has the ball here Passes off her hand Got to be strong with the basketball against this UMass pressure Theyre going to get up in your chest You got to square up and try to go by them Han Jr passes out 1 second on the shot clock Pay got it off in time and opens the scoring by draining a triple Fred Paynes made 21 threes on the year in 10 games but hes also a guy that is uh can make plays off the bounce as well So important He in hand in the back court Pull up pop Banks rattles in and out No good And UMass they will pick up right as you cross through midway Their guards on defense suffocate you Press all the way out Taves And now Payne Fred Payne in attack mode early Collided with his own player Hastings and turned it over cheering Theres Earl Grant head coach at Boston College Now he usually keeps a low profile but he was active on his social media last night trying to get this team going 10 games into the season This would be a big win for him as they try and turn the corner Hes trying to get the fan base excited at Boston College and show a little personality Sometimes that helps He said he was you know its not just social media but hes been going around campus going to where the students are eating lunch and saying Hey come on You can be the difference in some of these close games down the stretch saw him handing out tickets last Friday before their New Haven game and they needed every fan there for New Haven New Haven a big lead at the half but they came back and won and uh you mentioned their tough losses this year but just takes a couple wins in these tight tight situations to get you over the hump And this team continues to play hard for Earl Grant Even this morning when we came to shoot around very excited group about playing tonight as their instate rival And in trouble finds Taves Its a deep three Way off the mark And theres UMass head coach Frank Martin He said hes thankful to the Hall of Fame and to Earl Grant for putting this game together He said This is a great basketball state and you need your two highest profile programs in state playing each other Yeah theyre not really a rival when you dont play for 11 years but they want to try to get that going again And Frank and No have a lot of respect for each other and are good friends Taves lets it fly and misfires again And these are deep threes from Luca Taves and he has been way off the mark Well I would say cheering one is enough Youve got to wait a few more possessions before you take that shot again and get everyone involved especially when youre playing that point guard position But Betsy Mis fires long rebound UMass keeps it cheering Minutemen still looking for their first points of this game Scoreless for more than three minutes to start it trying to squeeze it into Betsy Hall Now cheering Banks gets it Nothing but the bottom of the net for Marcus Banks Jr Well Marcus Banks Jr has been just tremendous for UMass Just give giving Frank Martin that toughness that experienced player that defender that he loves You see right away UMass is going to pick the ball up as it crosses half court again BC settling early for a lot of threes Theyre not a good threepoint shooting team Theyre only 29 on the season They take about 27 threes a game but they only make about seven Every shot from Boston College in the opening four minutes has been from three You know as you break them down I think thats their problem their shot selection They play hard defense Theyre pretty good uh rebounding team but the problem is is that shot selection and even even with Donald Han Jr hes only shooting 19 from the three Hes such a good player going to the rim Hes got to have more balance to his game and just mix in the threes here and there But when you over rely on it as a group as Boston College has this year that becomes a problem when you dont have knockdown shooters and going against a UMass defense who presses out on you And if you can spread the floor there should be something open inside potentially Now thats the one that UMass is not going to do Theyre not going Theyre one of the best teams in the country defending the three Shot clock down to two Payne had to hurry it comes up empty Both of these teams looking for their offensive footing early Well when rivals get together for the first time in more than a decade youre going to get some physicality and defense the story so the hoopal but we do is watch the matchup last night in the garden BYU and Clemson and then Yukon and Florida and then watching Marcus Banks come off that pin down screen ready to roll Banks has the hot hand Hes got all five points for the minute early Boston College made their first shot but now has missed five in a row Good pass A rim rocker underneath Aiden Shaw Well thats how you beat UMasss defense If youre strong with the basketball youve got to try to drive and attack take the help and then dish as the help doesnt if the help doesnt rotate quickly enough And thats what they do They have pressure on the outside but Marcus Sanford is really strong on the interior at 68 The scoring is picked up out of the timeout UMass continues to pressure the basketball Chase Forte thought he was going up to shoot that ball Passed it late and it was knocked away Takes a few possessions to get comfortable if you ever do against this UMass defense But Ro talked about it this morning Youve got to not only be strong with the ball but youve got to square up and attack You cant have the ball stick from one side or the other As the ball swings if youre lucky enough to enter it in a scoring position then you have to attack You got to square up attack and attack with your head up to be ready to make that extra pass And you cannot settle for threes And in attack mode well defended Shot clock down to one Payne lets it fly That rims out no good cheering A good transition defense by the Eagles cheering and they award Boston College the basketball KJ Parker was trying to go coast to coast It was a good job by Parker getting into the lane but BC does a very good job with their length on the inside Kappy that time Good rotation over BC after making their first shot just one for their last eight and they turn it over Now this UMass defense dialed in You cant leave the floor without a specific pass entry ready and pass is very active with the hands in the passing lane Payne splits two A kick out for three big and BC goes in front Good job by Simone was coming down the floor as that trailer Not known as a threepoint shooter but was left open and made UMass pay Sometimes theres a reason youre open but that time made them key to deny that all hand and lines it up Cant connect Offensive rebound Capki kicks it right back to hand Couldnt connect Aimo feeling it now And three missed threes from BC on that possession And you mentioned earlier Tim they are not a threepoint shooting team and yet they keep taking them Well its bad combination Youre a bad threepoint shooting team and the team youre playing is one of the best at defending the three So they made this one but I wouldnt bank on a bank shot all night long as a recipe for winning offense And if BC is just going to come down and take a lot of threes theyre going to be in trouble tonight Nine of Boston Colleges 13 shots have been from three They do have the lead but both of these teams struggling for an offensive rhythm early Jaden Jingay at the line Massachusetts native junior coming off a good performance against UMass LOL 15 points four assists Jing Jingai has been a very good player for Frank Martin so far over his career and hes a very good passer Hes not a shooter but hes a guy that can get to the rim Plays bigger than that 64 frame Athletic type of player that Frank Martin likes to recruit A hardnosed defensive player Forte the hesitation and misses the layup UMass trying to push the tempo Twohanded slam DANIEL HANKEN SANFORD rocks the rim Well Hanken Sanford again just thats what what Frank wants to do in transition Theyre going to have the big guy and that time is Hank and Sanford rim run The first big down the floor will run right to the rim And if you dont get back on defense and defend early thats what will happen Forte Asamote now Payne fires a three Cant hit it Theres a rim runner again Hanken Sanford this time couldnt hold on to the basketball Daniel Hanken Sampler Hes got an array of moves at the rim but this is way too easy because of the fact that just flack beats Kappy right down the middle of the floor You see the progression from Hank and Sanford following his head coach Frank Martin from South Carolina and he just keeps getting better year in and year out Boston College eight points in the opening eight minutes against this UMass defense They have missed seven of their last eight And theres a turnover again Thats UMass Theyre going to poke and prod at the basketball You have to be strong You cant go into a crowded area because the second defender will come in and swipe at you All alone for three Parker cant knock it down Both of these teams getting looks just cant bury him Well UMass is not a great threepoint shooting team either but theyre not going to take as many Frank will not allow it Theyre going to try to run their high low game and attack to the rim first Tough take from Forte and its stolen away UMass keeps piling up the takeaways The blocking foul is the call Caleb Steager the freshman UMass basketball leading by three Just getting started New York just lit up and all the money made for cancer research last night And of course Coach Vital continues just to have blood sweat and tears to raise money even through his the toughest of health battles And its great to see him back on his feet Hopefully Charles lets him speak a little bit this weekend Yeah Whos going to have the mic more Charles its hard for Charles to do but Im sure out of respect From Hall of Famer to a Hall of Famer itll be fine Boston College struggly shooting the ball to start this game Three of 16 from the floor two of 10 from three and five turnovers And yet its still a one possession game Well now an aggressive two3 zone defense Theyre not going to lay back Theyre going to get out and pressure the ball on the perimeter BC doing a pretty good job of moving the basketball with the pass that time on the attack That was a very good move by Seager just to attack the gaps And BC was good in that possession because they ball fake They moved the ball quickly from side of them one side to the other and they had good spacing And when they did reverse the ball Stiger did a good job of splitting the gaps getting to the rim and not settling for the three Now as a coach why would you switch defenses when youve been dominant with what youve been running Well thats what you do And Frank Martins talked about it He said you know we have to look at our defensive philosophy And he wants to pressure like they did at the beginning of this game but he still doesnt have total confidence in his bench and and as a coach if you dont have confidence in that bench its very hard to play that 90 that 50 ft of pressure on every possession for an entire game without using your bench And right now I dont think Frank has total confidence yet in his bench So hes going to mix it up and play some zone Jaden Hastings poked that away Hes got a great wingspan and thats on full display Well its no doubt that BC moved the ball a lot better when Ro Grant took Han and Payne out of the game who were really settling for threes up and under Scoop to the hoop Daniel Hank Sanford Well thats the other problem When you take Payne and Hand out of the game you lose something perimeter defensive wise And that time UMass took advantage Taves the blow by tried to hand it off for Hastings and its dispossessed again Dribbling in the middle of the lane when you dont have good spacing UMass will attack that basketball Its Sanford Hes had the hot hand but thats but from in close goes begging from three And Boston College six turnovers to go along with a poor shooting performance so far Havent made a basket in more than four minutes And a foul called Marco Ratovic the freshman from Montenegro driving with a head of steam Well that was a good job by Ratanovic You know what he did was he just squared up on the wing He saw a little bit of light and he that little pullth through move and he put his head down and was strong with the basketball You know points at a premium in this first half and the first game of this Hall of Fame Classic double header We saw how important free throw shooting was Yale beating U Albany and dominated the Great Danes from the free throw line BCs defense has been pretty consistent all season long and one thing they do play hard physical defense and rebound the ball pretty well They dont turn you over but its not a gambling type defense but its solid in the half court Pretty good communication time Good contest from the outside but a little late on Parker KJ Parker makes Boston College pay A fourpoint lead for UMass Eagles still looking for their first field goal in five minutes here They have struggled in the half court defense from UMass Steager a three No good Banks tried to thread the needle there Kick ball Itll stay UMasss way Boston College Hey Tim when youre coaching a team thats just struggling to find an offensive rhythm Boston College 0 for their last seven one for their last 10 How do you try and break out of that You got to go inside Youve got to go inside You got to use your side They have an absolute size advantage and they can go into guys like Hastings on the interior I think you can play through him a little bit more than they do And you know hes got to work to get it open as well But at times they settle and the outside will open but youve got to go inside first again especially against this pressure Shot clock did not reset The good defense continues from Boston College They just cant get anything going on The offensive end until that aided Shaw onehanded alleyoop and thatll inject some life into the Eagles offense Well thats Shaw on both ends first with the block and then just running the floor and attacking again That shows you what they can do offensively on the inside but then Sanford showing a little muscle as well Count it plus the foul and UMass leading by four BC good opportunity here and this was music something they should bottle go into the big fella over the top the transfer from pretty close and uh its probably anybodys ball game I tried to give him a little pep talk before the game and uh they came out with motivated What did you say to him uh just you know in terms of what my experience in basketball was and the fact that you know mentally spiritually emotionally physical Well they have come out and played together particularly on the defensive end Points have been at a premium in this one although an easy layup there from Capski Yeah But joined by Julius Irving Dr Jay inducted to the Naymith Hall of Fame in 1993 Theyve done a good job keeping you involved Theyve named an award after you the Julius Irving Award which Cooper Flag won last year Whats that relationship been like with the Hall of Fame Uh its been great You know once I uh was inducted and and 90 this is teamwork and it just shows by having you in the locker room But whats your thoughts on the UMass program as it stands Well you know right now its its a program that is on the rise uh you know the fact that Frank has been a had the experience in the final four the the goal is lofty They got to try and become a final four contender and uh theyre not going to theyre not going to do that without the help of the community and obviously the uh the support of the university and the alumni So as one of the alumni I mean I try to pitch in where I can and anything hes asked me to do you know in this short period of time Im done Were talking with Julius Irving Hall of Famer right down the road here in Springfield Massachusetts He was inducted in 1993 after an incredible pro career in the ABA and the NBA But it all started at UMass And I was reading up about your time at UMass Tim just asked you about it but you played in the NCAA when they had banned dunking I I mean people today will not remember that I How was that ever outlawed Come on We just saw a sensational dunk a little while ago And uh I had the ability to do that while I was in college but did not have the opportunity I think um guy named Lu Alenda aka Kareem Abdul Jabar was the the the big factor in the in the NCA NCAA trying to neutral neutralize uh his dominance He was really just that good And uh they took it out of the game for a couple of years and they happened to be it over overlapped with my varsity seasons which were 1970 to 72 So So I didnt get a chance to dunk in college except in the warmups and uh once I got out of college you made up for it I had saved up a lot of dunks I saved up a lot And then when I started in the summer pro summer league and played in the Rucker thats where it was really encouraged and it was a big part of uh the playground So so maybe what I didnt do in college and was able to take to the pros was you know for for good reason and and there was a benefit to not dunking in college Saved them up saved up a lot of dunks and a lot of jumps definitely and then some Your alma mater UMass on a good run right now after that flagrant was called against Hastings You got the two free two free free throws that were cast A little bit of separation here Yeah Betty Bio looks pretty good on the inside when they go to him and then BC the other end They went into Capi down low and then Forte drove it to the rim So BC is starting to adjust a little bit to the UMass pressure and theyre not just settling for threes but continues just to attack the lane I I like the way they run their transition They really put a lot of pressure on the back side of the defense and theyve got their bigs running the floor and thats that time clerk sort of a physical presence on the inside and Tapki and Yeah Im amazed that these guys havent played one another in so many years Like seven or eight years No 2014 Over a decade 2014 Wow See this is year 11 and uh you know I mean basically theyre neighbors in the same state and you know BCs program I guess with them being in the ACC or whatever they they have to limit what what teams theyre going to play outside of the conference And then theres the money game again Yeah You know you make it worth my while then Ill come and see you Right Well its great that theyre playing here in Springfield I think that means a lot to Yeah to the stage The the Hall of Fame does a great job of putting these matchups together And here Franks playing that aggressive zone and when they play the zone they still get up on you And again DC looking to take that quick three Kick out three off the offensive board Fred Kane drills it and its a twopoint game Now we have so enjoyed being joined by Dr J Julius Serving Were going to let you get back to enjoying this game as a as a fan and as an alum and really appreciate your insights and the time Well I appreciate spending time with you guys and were all in the same building trying to see a good basketball game Julius its always great to see Well see you at the next uh golf tournament in Rhode Island that I see at all the time Come back and see us and we missed you there Well do that All right Thank you Julius Really appreciate it You know proud UMass alum and a Hall of Famer right down the road in Springfield is his alma mater Drains a three to go up by five Tim Welsh Jay Alter with you You know points have been at a premium in this first half UMass starting to hit some shots Theyve had the momentum since that flagrant foul called against Hastings You cannot let up against UMass You see they keep putting the pressure on you and they move the ball but defensively theyre really in sync and Im sure Frank liked that shot from Banks from the outside Although he does trust trust Banks a lot just as a veteran presence on the floor Now for Boston College Donald Han Jr their leading scorer is still scoreless trying to get number 13 in maroon and gold going How great was Dr Jay What a treat for us Hes been stopped every couple of steps for a picture Well been a lot of great players in the history of basketball but not a lot of great people Not all not all of them are great people I should say that And thats a great class personified right there That guy thats just beloved by the basketball world in general not just by UMass Chaotic sequence here And a foul will send Marco Ratanovic to the line when we come back UMass a fivepoint lead as an instant All those I think has to be Arizona and Alabama Two teams with final four ambitions and thats where Ill have my eye on Lot of lot of baskets The shot clock operator can take the day off as there will it will be fast pace But you watch college basketball now I think every games fastpaced Its just the the new way to play Everybody four out five out The big guys can all shoot threes They can all run Seen it tonight Just big guys are pretty athletic and get up and down the floor Defense has been excellent on both sides Rejection Aiden Shaw swatted away UMass recovers though Shot clock at eight Jingay Tough take and it rolls in UMass up five Jingay thats what he is At 64 he just goes inside Hes not Hes fearless amongst the the bigs of Boston College Theyve got to rotate over and be more physical and pres present themselves with their length and not allow a 64 guard to go inside like that Three minutes remaining in this first half Boston College theyve struggled offensively Seven turnovers just shooting eight of 27 from the floor Forte looking for a three at the end of the shot clock Misfires Pull up pop in transition and it rims out That was halfway down but did not drop for KJ Parker Foul on the rebound College Shaw got caught handtohand combat on the interior Hank Sanford is hes a load inside as far as trying to block him out because not that wide but hes just wiry He knows how to rebound out of his area Step back three Banks and that rolls in Marcus Banks Jr fires UMass up eight Well you can see why Frank Martin just loves Marcus Banks Jr I mean he just steps in and plays with just that look that Frank Martin look defensively and then confidence on the offensive end Largest lead of the night for either team Hand still scoreless Floats it to Payne who fires the three and hes fouled So Fred Payne will shoot three free throws with 208 remaining of this first half and Samford just theyre so amped up defensively and theyre theyre taught so well to close out just with such intensity He just got a little off balance in the corner Good job by Payne drawing the foul Sunday afternoon some good womens college basketball for you 1 Eastern on ABC Baylor taking on number two Texas And then over music on ESPN Penn State is at South Carolina Thats Sunday Right down the road from us weve got the great Yukon women continue to roll Nice ceremony over the weekend retiring the great Sue Birds number I was thinking actually watching that theyre going to run out of numbers with all the great players theyve had going through there Said to Gino I what took you so long Her number should have been retired the minute she left He made a comment the greatest point guard in the history of college basketball men or women Im not sure hes hes not wrong One of the best of course Offensive foul called for an illegal screen You know for as poorly as Boston College has shot it in this first half and theyve certainly turned it over seven times to be only down five youre still right within striking distance It feels like UMass has been the better team in this first half but the scoreboard doesnt necessarily reflect it as much as it should Well this is kind of how BC rolls and why theyve been in most games because of their defense And LSU game is a great example just they play hard They play tough They like playing for Earl Grant but offensively they just have their struggles Payne they do stuff like off the mark Well they do stuff like that I mean thats just horrendous decision by Payne Hes not open Hes 24 feet from the basket with 10 seconds on the clock And thats just begs into the defense And that puts so much pressure on your defense Jay And they play it so hard Theyre tough They play it hard They play it together But when you come down and make decisions like that it just takes you out of a ball game Capi beats the buzzer Only a second left on the shot clock and its a one possession game Deep three Too much on it Long rebound and Boston College has it up ahead Heres hand in attack mode and hell have a chance to tie this game at the foul line Tremendous hustle for the loose ball down the other end Capy kept it alive And this is what Han can do This is what he has to be go with his first second and third option That hardnose drive to the rim is as good as it gets in the ACC at that That was Hans first basket of the night And with that made free throw this game is tied at 33 and Boston College on an 8 nothing run over the last 71 seconds If I was D coaches at BC I would take that clip and show it to Donald say This is your game and he takes seven threes a game but he only makes about one per game So take that out of the equation and his percentage is really good Pull up pop No good Offensive rebound flying in is Jingay to keep it for UMass Banks This time he knocks it down and fires the minute man back in front Oh hes so fundamental Shows the ball Doesnt settle for the three Uses his strength that ball fake good balance squared up banged it in Banks leads all scorers tonight as Boston College ticks this first half clock down They can hold for the final shot 10 seconds to work Trailing by two Payne launches into the attack in trouble and a deep three Missed it And UMass heads into halftime clinging to a twopoint lead These teams are pretty evenly matched because of the defensive effort UMass starts with the basketball and a twopoint lead Boston College 20 of their 33 points came off the bench in a first half where points were at a premium Defense definitely the story Marcus Banks he was the leading scorer 15 points to his name 24 in white They go away from him Shot clock down to five Carbuchi has to heave it and cant hit it And thats a shot clock violation again And that that was what BC can do to you They get out and pressure you They put good pressure on the perimeter very very good in rotations that time UMass never got into much movement on the weak side of the floor You just said it Boston College settled for too many threes in that first half Just three of 18 A lot better when you go inside Aiden Shaw rocks the rim And thats there Jay That they can get that if theyre strong with the ball move the move the defense on the weak side of the floor and then get the ball reversed and then attack UMass answering underneath foul called Daniel Hank Sanford who had a terrific first half Well we saw the athleticism in the first half of Aiden Shaw on that lob play in transition and his ability to block shots and he can be a force down low And now hes not a guy thats going to post you up carve out space but with movement he can make some things happen like that on the baseline We were joined at the first half by Dr J UMass alum Hall of Famer and maybe the most famous dunker in the history of basketball And he said he was impressed with Aiden Shaws dunk Thats when you know you did something spectacular A good doctor still got a little sparkle in his eye for todays game with all the threes that are shot to do it the oldfashioned way and just hammer it home like he used to I think its a crime against humanity though that dunking was outlawed when he played college basketball for UMass Something I didnt know even happened until I read about it today BC trying to get it on the break Hastings kicks it out Good ball movement Finds Payne Cant finish it from three Anken Sanford spins his way and muscles it home for two Hes going to be a good player in the in the MAC for Frank Just a guy that finds a way Doesnt they dont need him to throw him the ball but he just finds a way to make things happen with his energy Donald Han Jr in attack mode and thats more like it for Boston College Well thats what he can do And we said it in the first half just as good as any player in the ACC as far as creating and getting to the rim with strength and finishing Second chance opportunity for UMass and Jingay threw it away Fred Payne tried to tiptoe but stepped out of bounds Ball back to UMass Daniel Hanken Sanford This is what he does Hes hes high percentage because hes at 68 He has that ability to twist and turn If you give him a little bit of space he finds angles and this a guy that knows how to find angles and even with a little bump at the rim Hes so strong he can finish in traffic 14 points tonight for the transfer from South Carolina whos found a home here at UMass onepoint game in a rivalry matchup that has all the makings of a close competitive fun finish in this second half Kbuchi is going to be a good player for Frank Martin Hes only a freshman Hes got a tremendous assist to turnover ratio about 3 to one Still learning the ropes how to run the team at times in the half court Leonardo Betsio tough take there the Italian Hell get you the hardearned points inside Well hes still learning the system as well Hes going to be a very good player in the MidAmerican Conference You know the thing about that is BC really wasnt ready to play defense on that baseline out of bounds play Well the big man battle that has emerged in this matchup Bowden Kapki against Leonardo Betio And Kapki goes right into the Italian and draws the foul Betios a very good find by UMass His staff has done a excellent job of balancing the portal and still bringing some good young players into the program Now you mentioned a moment ago UMass in the MAC making that transition from the Atlantic 10 I would say a you know still competitive but more winnable league than a very very competitive Atlantic 10 right Yeah I mean when you talk to Frank though he obviously has a tremendous amount of uh respect for the teams in the mat because he knows college basketball I mean Akran is excellent Kent has been good Ohio U Bowling Green over the years Buffalo came out really good start this year So certainly continues to improve Now the A10 is excellent but thats a its a tough take and its drilled by Marcus Banks Jr Marcus Banks Jr is really hard to guard because of the fact that he can beat you off the dribble You see the good big strong body hes got and hes got tremendous footwork there with the step back and excellent defense there right in his face but he rose up over the top Hastings finds Taves and on the drive couldnt finish it he wanted the foul and didnt get it the trailer nobody But he picked him up an easy two Just BC just didnt communicate with hand that went to the floor and it was five against four No one really matched up properly Pay cant knock it down UMass with all the momentum The Minutemen have made three in a row Bets in attack mode Missed it THERE TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL FOR TWO Dmitri clerkio drives to the rim and the help came over but on the backside BC did not rotate down on the from the guard spot to block out Largest lead of the game for UMass Kapki draws the foul and hell get two at the line but UMass with the momentum in this second half Leonardo you like to say that a teo and Frank said You can call him anything you want You play like that The Italian all the way to Amherst Stewart but you doing the promo about the greatest guy to ever do promos And very true I mean people forget how talented he was He was so wellliked and such a good guy and cheering such a sad story that we lost him too soon But just a tremendous talent and so wellliked I mean if you didnt like Stuart Scott watch like watching him do sports center theres something wrong He didnt like sports Well he attacked her every assignment with that unique ability to just get everybody to smile and be engaged and looking forward to seeing that debut of Booya One of his many signature catchphrases And weve got a good one here in Springfield right down the road from the Naymith Basketball Hall of Fame Two possession game UMass leading by six with the basketball Demarcus Banks 24 and white has been their goto guy Has the ball here 17 points to his name Bet leaves that off the iron Bet is gaining confidence by the minute in this game Really wants the ball and been very physical and active getting to the rim and he has dominated his matchup in the second half Boston College have not made a shot in more than three minutes The offensive struggles continue for Earl Grants team Another turnover there Well they cant get into any rhythm on the offensive end of the floor right now And theyre doing a better job of not settling for threes And I think Earl Grant obviously told them that at halftime but the pressure on the perimeter takes you out of your stuff And sometimes you just have to scrap your playbook Jay and just you know play basketball Get the ball move from side to side get spaced set some hard screens and then attack Jing finds Bets He has not been shy continues to let it fly Misses that one The foul called on the rebound will keep the ball with UMass Betio every shot hes taken though has been a good quality shot And he shoots 58 on the floor for the season So Frank Martin trusts him Just keep being aggressive And I like this battle right now between Betiel and Capki Two physical banging bodies in the paint Hastings all over Clark Dumped down Guess who BETSY ALL AGAIN Count it PLUS THE FOUL The Italian stallion has taken over this second half in Springfield Well hes getting some space Theyre spacing the court around him Theyre doing a good job Hes doing a good job of presenting himself and he slides on that baseline But the one thing that Boston College is making a little bit of mistake Theyre letting him get to that over that left shoulder Every move hes made is g has gone over that left shoulder and hes attacked with the right hand Got to be aware though hes a very efficient passer as well He makes that move with his head up but right now theyre letting him find that good angle to the rim and hes taking advantage completes the threepoint play and UMass starting to separate Largest lead of the game for either team Well the difference right now has been UMass has a better balance offensively Theyre going inside right now to Betty O but theyre also still attacking on the perimeter Theyre trying to get out in transition Their guards have not forced things but if you give them an open look theyll knock it down And then this defense they keep pressuring Thats this time a little two3 pressure coming back out of a 221 but theyre so aggressive in it even though theyre still play theyre playing zone Hand threw a lot of contact No call Ball goes off UMass Itll stay BCs way And Donald Hand hes been looking for a couple foul calls in this second half but hes not getting them Only five points for Hand who leads BC in scoring Hastings rejected at the rim Clark says no A transition three Count it PLUS THE FOUL A CHANCE FOR a fourpoint play Well everyone knows you have to go into the portal and find the right players that fit your style your mentality And Marcus Banks Jr is really a mirror of what Frank Martin professes as a coach Hardnosed Frank calls him the adult in the room And is there any doubt he is He is that just comes in and just plays Doesnt change his expression Hardnosed defense doesnt take any possessions off Fails to complete the fourpoint play But UMass up by 12 Payne that at three goes begging The wait continues for a Boston College basket Nearing 4 and 12 minutes UMass misses two layups Balls loose Battle for it Thats a jump ball Possession arrow with the Eagles What are we talking about We havent played this game in 11 years These two teams are going at it And good resistance at the rim on the inside by Oamo but again UMass on the floor BC just trying to hang in there with some physicality in the lane Yeah rivalry renewed in the state of Massachusetts These two programs playing for the first time since 2014 And its UMass with a 12point lead Boston College has missed their last five shots Five minutes without a made field goal And that one rims down no good I really cant fault BC anything what theyre doing And theyve missed some open shots but every shot pretty much has been under duress as UMass just their defense has been getting stronger by the minute UMass outscoring Boston College 197 in this second half Eagles just desperate for a basket Foul called on the floor Clerk was pressed out on Hastings Well BC has to continue to attack in the lane and try to get into UMasss bench because Frank Martin talked about it We talked a little bit about it in the first half its hard to play this pace defensively unless you go into the bench And when they go into their bench at times this year they they have not held on to leads It happened in the Virgin Islands It happened against Harvard They survived Harvard but they had a 23point lead in that game and Harvard crawled all the way back into the game So BC has to try to hang in there keep putting pressure on UMass especially as Frank puts his subs in Well the Boston College bench has been the brightest spot for the Eagles They had 20 points off the bench out of their 33 that they scored in the first half Osamo is part of that group but cant add to it Misses the first Earl Grant told us its been difficult at times to keep this group confident with all the close losses Five and five through 10 games Four of those five games They had a lead in the final minute of regulation You come up short Theyre going to have to dig deep here in the final 12 minutes down 12 But theyve played hard tonight and theyve continued to play hard all year The problem is playing smart You have to do both And at times they have not done that offensively Tonight first half that was very evident cheering And Hastings grabbed that one It was still on the rim So counted for two points for UMass and the Minutemen A 14 point Grant Frank Martin to the Hall of Fame to reunite these two programs after layoff Absolutely And I kid I only kid because I care about games like this and then and theyre important and we had the same thing when we were at Providence you know playing Rhode Island that its good for the whole region and trying to pump the basketball up in the region I and I applaud these guys for getting this game together Hopefully itll continue First BC basket at 6 minutes and 30 seconds Can that ignite a scoring surge Right back to hand Hes fouled and hell get two shots at the line You know immediately Marcus Banks Jr comes back in the game Just a brief hello to Frank over there on the bench and he understands BC is going to put the press on He needs Marcus Banks Jr in the game And Gabbuchi is a a good player but he and Banks playing together out there gives them two excellent ball handlers And Banks has led the way with 20 points tonight for UMass Donald Hand whos Boston Colleges leading scorer only with seven points to show cheering The hand has that hitch on the free throw but it works Well Donald Han Jr is an excellent player and Grants talked about him earlier tell you just he was pressing early this season When youre the guy who has to go every night and get you know be the main bucket getter sometimes that weighs on you He needs some help Needs some help on the inside I think they have the ability guys Shaws played well tonight Hastings is another guy that on the interior they can play through A hard foul Hastings down on the floor Leonardo Betiel clubed him there Betiel just kind of runs into him by accident Boston College upped their defensive pressure there and it led to a stop Now can they string together some possessions to claw back trailing by 10 I like it because their length can be problematic Not only in the half court we talked about it on the interior and at the rim but in the full court if they can get some traps they may be able to turn UMass over at times to get back into this Forte everything but the finish Had a layup and missed it but gets the ball back Never gave up on the play FLYING IN PLUS the foul Donald Han Jr But again not many better And and first of all give Payne excuse me Forte all the credit in the world staying with it Misses the misses the bunny in traffic but stays with it with that length And Betiel just a little careless Didnt see him coming and they certainly saw a hand coming if you if you didnt blink because he can fly And he was flying to the rim And Betsy has to come out of this game with four fouls and he combined with Banks have given most of the firepower for UMass tonight cheering as Hand cuts it to seven UMass led by as many as 14 That lead has been cut in half Big time cheering basket there and an and one opportunity coming Dwayne Wimbley Jr the freshman with an immediate answer Well this is how you have to beat pressure Youve got to space the floor and then make the defense pay You cant be soft and try to pull it out because BC is really overextending almost in a desperation type mode in the press because they got a couple turnovers But if youre confident with the ball and attack it with the pass and then put your head down and make them pay at the rim you can get them to back off some with their pressure And now Hastings comes out of the game with four fouls as the fouls are piling up Another foul called this one against UMass and Boston College is in the P So theyll be shooting a one and one here So a long time Boston College will have in the bonus here and their free throw shooting has been exceptional tonight 16 of 19 from the foul line after a 10 for 10 first half cheering Simone connects on the front end of the one and one Bowl season begins Saturday Two games on ABC kicks off noon music Eastern time The cricket celebration bowl and then your night cap on ABC Boise State and Washington as bowl season starts up overlap season here in full force Good basketball good football all through the month of December Transition three off the mark but Banks follows his own miss then lost the handle And in attack mode another and one opportunity Donald Han Jr Hes bringing Boston College right back in it Well hes bringing him back doing what he does best And this is always been a thing Dont show me what you cant do Show me what you can do until they can prove they can stop it And thats what Donald Han Jr is doing right now He is putting his head down and using that power that agility that skill and that toughness to finish plays right at the rim cheering 12 points in this second half for Donald Han Jr and Boston College trailed by as many as 14 and theyre back within five with 10 minutes left in regulation A fun finish certainly coming between two teams that have not played in 11 years Heres Fred Payne trying to wiggle his way through off the window and in for two Its a onepossession game Well again thats pain in hand Thats where they can be at their best And against this pressure thats the best way to beat it Frank Martin is not happy Time out Frank Martin Boston College once down 14 Back within three Theyre three for 18 at halftime Theyre not a good threepoint shooting team And UMass music is an excellent threepoint defending team And what theyve done is theyve spaced the court and then theyve drove down the lane and finished at the rim Boston College a 132 run in under two minutes One possession game UMass a threepoint lead with the ball coming out of the Frank Martin called timeout Parker lost the handle Payne couldnt keep it in play And Tim you mentioned when UMass was up by 14 that theyve struggled to hold on to leads when they go to their bench and they have forced to go to their bench here with Leonardo Betiel out with four fouls Marcus Banks was on the bench and allowed BC to get back in this game Yeah Betiel crashed in to the BC forward running up the floor kind of an unfortunate foul and then when he had to defend in the paint he got his fourth And now they dont really have a guy to throw the ball to on the inside A hand has had the hot hand for Boston College in this second half 12 of his 15 have come since intermission Capki down the lane up and in for two and a chance to tie it at the free throw line A good job by Capki and they double on the outside and no one comes over till its too late Wimbley comes over but its way too late You got it on that short roll down the middle of the floor The rotations have to come right on the catch and then wait for the defensive player Clerk to recover back into the lane But they doubled the ball way too far out on the floor and BC took advantage Well since Boston College trailed by 14 in this game they are on a 162 run cheering And you can feel their confidence building you know not only from hand and pain but guys like Kapi and you look out on the floor Forte has been very good defensively up in the front of this press using his length You see getting up on the dribbler They have stormed back and erased a 14point lead in less than three minutes Boston College all the momentum New Mass trying to steal it back Foul called on the floor 8 seconds on the shot clock You know BC is in the double bonus but UMass not shooting yet One more free throw and they will be shooting the rest of the way Become a very physical second half Tim well the Yukon excuse me the BC guards have been very good against UMass on the perimeter just forcing the issue not allowing them dribble penetration in the middle of the floor and doing it without fouling while keeping Banks somewhat in check Offensive foul Illegal screen called against Clerk Frank Martin not happy with the way his team has played in the last three minutes Well BC is doing a really good job of paying attention to Banks Theyre not gambling but theyre keeping him on the sideline Theyre making sure hes they find him in transition Theyre not Theyre pressing up and theyre trapping but theyre not gambling and overextending Boston College has not had the lead in this game since it was 87 And UMass controlled most of this game led by as many as 14 but the Eagles looking for the lead and they get it Scoop to the hoop Forte fires the Eagles in front If youre going to be successful against this UMass pressure thats what you have to do Youve got to have the floor space and youve got to attack You cannot fool around with the ball Youve got to square up and go Stolen away Asamo dispossessed Itll stay Boston College ball Eagles on an 11 nothing run 182 over the last 3 minutes and change Well BC stopped settling for threes and started attacking Thats why theyre back in this game and a half against a good defensive team And this is what theyve been doing since Theyve been attacking inside and been very successful Yeah they have gone inside completely turned around the game plan And you called for it coach I mean you said if Boston College is going to come back in this game they got to stop taking the illadvised threes And thats exactly what Earl Grants team has done to turn this game around Well its one thing if you have good shooters and youre playing against a tough defense you still got to have balance But when youre not a good shooting team and youre playing against a really good airtight perimeter defense then youve got to make them pay in other ways And to BCs credit they figured that out at halftime And Im sure the coaches came into the game and had it figured out But sometimes the players dont always execute the game plan until you have to get it into their head at halftime And you know it didnt really start until the midway point of this second half or even a little bit sooner Their defense has been rocked tough I like this pressure Its really rattled UMass and taken them out of the rhythm up out of their rhythm offensively Clearly they miss Bio on the inside because they dont really have anybody to throw the ball to Maybe Hawkins Sanford can give them something against this pressure Jing misfires Another Boston College stop The UMass scoring drought reaches three minutes here Forte finds Asamo cleans up his own spill BC largest lead of the night Five Again the attack by Forte breaking the defense down off the dribble with his head up ready to attack the help and then make the extra pass Time out UMass Boston and not playing soft on both ends Leonardo Betol has checked back in for UMass Playing with four fouls since hes been on the bench UMass has looked like a different team Well its a good move You Its now or never for UMass cuz theyve totally lost some momentum and their confidence Kick to the corner Nothing but air Bet almost had the offensive rebound but it was ripped away Four minutes scoreless for UMass BC with all the momentum Hand cant finish it Stolen away Forte The steal and the slam Again out in the passing lanes Not a gambling defense but solid pressure getting up into the face of the offensive player denying on the wing being ready to make that next move defensively with good pressure defensive movement and then attacking after the steal UMass desperate for a basket Theyve been scoreless for almost five minutes Wide open three Its good Marcus Banks Jr Boy the Minute Man needed that three Oh they needed the extra effort on the glass which freed up Banks for the first time in a long time because of the offensive rebound A foul called will send BC to the free throw line You see Chase Forte what he does is you throw a loose pass and just getting out and not being solid now against this BC pressure has cost UMass And BC really is giving UMass a dose of their own medicine on the defensive end Good hard pressure denial on the wings getting up in the face of the offensive player Forte connects on the free throw You know Boston College shooting better than 80 from the line Thats where games are won and lost and UMass just seven of 14 from their free throw line Well we talked about UMass and them not being able to hold on to leads Well BCs had their major issues as well this year In four of Boston Colleges five losses the Eagles have led or been tied in the final minute of regulation Think about that You know youre a minute away from being nine and one instead of five and five Bets spent a long time on the bench in this second half and draws the foul Kapi not happy about it and hes teed up Bowden Capy let the emotions of this rivalry get the best of him Hes called for the foul and then the technical Well Kapki played pretty good defense He was trying to deny Betty Old over that left shoulder which he loves to go to on every occasion He gets going with his left Now hes going to go back to the right He builds that wall but the verticality See he doesnt go straight up Hes got his arms in the path of the shooter Thats a good call And what a chance college in various ways throughout the season where they havent been able to where theyve played good solid basketball for 36 37 38 almost 40 minutes theyve had the the three overtime losses and then they make these mental errors down the stretch Banks one of two on the technical free throws and now Betio will step up Errol Grant told us exactly what you were just talking about Tim In the games that they have lost down the stretch costly turnovers and free throws have cost them Well the other issue on that is that sequence is Capi has really played well in the last seven eight minutes given UMass a lot of problems on both ends and with his physicality defensively and he has needed to play Bettyold down in the low box and offensively hes been a force in the in the lane as well as far as setting ball screens at top and rolling to the rim on that short roller all the way to the rim But now hes out with four fouls So UMass just two of four from the foul line and it stays a twopossession game with under five minutes remaining Boston College clinging to a fourpoint advantage One of these two teams leaving with a instate rivalry win having not played since 2014 hand Hes had the hot hand Keeps attacking the rim and draws another foul He is a perfect five for five from the foul line tonight Frank Martin is just pleading with his players because Donald Han Jr when he has that space its too hard to defend with one player So he is getting to the rim at will and UMass has to come over and give help Theyve got to try to come over and meet him outside of the paint Believe it or not Donald Junior only has 11 assists on the season coming into this game So what do you do You come over and make him give the ball up You cannot let him get ahead of steam and get all the way to the rim Youve got to make him a passer First miss for hand from the foul line tonight Boston College lead stays at five inside Benny Why not Good call from the bench by Frank Martin He understands Kapkys out of the game He is their best inside defender as far as power goes And theyre going right into Betty Hall And Hastings playing with four fouls screaming Deep three Forte missed it Right down the lane The floater falls KJ Parker Hes made it a onepoint game Well again BC settling for that three They got out of that routine and that rhythm that they were in as far as attacking the basket and Forte just settling for a three Forte feeds it Aimo just enough on it to finish it at the rim And another technical foul A taunting technical foul Gives two free throws to UMass here And the Minutemen failing to cash in Went one for two on the first technicals And now Parker misses his first Makes the second And UMass will retain the basketball trailing by two Thats a good play by Fort just on ball reversal Attacked that gap of the zone and its right there Earl Grant did not agree with that Obviously lost his jacket Maybe he was a little warm over there I doubt it Hes Hes hot Hes trying to protect his players I dont know if hes mad at the call or his players I would be mad at this player Banks a three Its good Marcus Banks fires UMass in front Well BCs just got to settle down now and keep attacking the basket UMass has made their last four shots Final three minutes in Springfield Hastings missed it Awesome After that technical foul hes got to settle down He tried to dribble drive from the wing all the way to the rim He was fortunate to get rid of it without turning it over Pull up pop Nothing but cheering the BOTTOM OF THE NINTH KJ PARKER Foul by Forte Hell have two at the line Well Marcus Banks went a long time without being effective because BC got up in his face but on that possession they forgot where he was and he got very comfortable on the wing and then just playing that high pick and roll Nobody comes up on Parker and just their BCs defense has been good for so long a long period of time that got them back in this game that got them the lead in this game but they have relaxed here in the last three minutes cheering They ballooned the lead to as many as seven and UMass has come roaring back the minute men have made five straight baskets Forte a chance to make it a onepoint game Got it have to keep an eye on 24 and white Setting the screen here Banks leads all scorers with 27 We tick down to two minutes remaining in regulation What a cut Hank and Sanford delivers And for some reason Hastings just ran out and doubled the ball in the middle of the floor and it turned BCs defense into not available on the rotation at the rim Just I dont know what theyre doing defensively I mean here on the ball screen they double in the middle of the floor and just an easy attack on the backside I mean Hastings just runs up and doubles the ball 45 ft from the basket in the middle of the paint of the middle of the floor Well Boston College has dominated the free throw battle 25 of 31 to UMasss 10 of 20 and it continues Forte makes the first Forte just 61 on the season six of six tonight and its a onepoint game If Im UMass I go back to that middle ball screen and see how BC reacts because the back side of their defense right now is not very organized Ching in the paint slips it right back for Hank and Sanford and he draws the foul Its becoming a bit of a free throw competition down the stretch The Hastings is telling Earl Grant to use the coachs challenge Hes pleading with the Eagles head coach I dont know what he wants to challenge You cannot challenge a foul call And thats his fifth Thats what So he has fouled out of this game And Boston College without their two best big men Bowden Capki and Jaden Hastings have both fouled out of this game But youre right Tim you cant challenge a foul Well I I do know that the announcers such as yourself The officials of course and the coaches all know the new challenge rules but the players dont Thats thats the unfortunate thing but it doesnt matter The UMass foul shooting continues to be the kryptonite 10 of 21 But you see how important Betty has been for UMass When Frank Martin went back to him he really had no choice They were down six or seven with 6 minutes to go and he went back and the game has changed since because they have to play him on the inside which is opened up Banks Jr on the outside Its also allowed Hawkins Sanford to do his thing at the high post Boston College with two timeouts and Earl Grant decides to use one Thats a good job by Earl Grant just to kind of settle his team down is at times this year theyve made poor decisions down the stretch and that they can stop any of those three driving to the rim but theyve got to do it at their own discretion making the defense work first tried to feed it inside to Shaw a risky pass it deflects off UMass stay Boston College ball each team with one timeout for the final minute 10 here well Thats one person you dont want to put the ball in the hands of is a mode Hes got zero assists on the season Shot clock ticks down to eight Donald H in attack mode into the paint THROWS IT UP AND IT RIMS IN Tie game Now thats what you have to do because again UMass has not proven they can stop any of those three guards in the half court when they want to get to the rim trying to float it into Bennett It deflects off Boston College Well take one more look but I think this is off 23 in Maroon and Gold And I dont think theyre going to find enough there to say it went off UMass And now that becomes a little bit of another problem that BC uses that challenge because if they do lose it theyre out of timeouts You know on that last look does it graze off Bedial off his left hand and on the previous looks I agreed with you Tim but as weve zoomed it in here Betty raises that left hand And as you know Jay it might have but I dont think its indisputable music enough Yeah to change the call And the call on the court was music UMass basketball Earl Grant hes risking his final timeout on this coachs challenge Well youve got to make a quick decision Thats not the easiest thing in the world I think coaches are still trying to get comfortable with how to handle the challenges And obviously youve got the iPad in the second row with the administrative assistants or whoever you have in charge of that music And youve got to trust that they can look at it quickly And the call has been overturned Boston College basketball Were next to the MGM Casino in Springfield Earl Grant gambled and it paid off BC ball Well there you go Jay Alter with the young eyes and the coach with the the seasoned eyes of lot of a lot of basketball But good job by BC Boston College Five losses on the season Four of the five losses the Eagles have had a lead or a tie in the final minute of regulation Here we go again BC with the ball and a tie game screaming Shot clock down to 10 Forte draws the foul and cheering will have two at the line to give Boston College the lead with 21 seconds remaining Well UMass was in a zone They extended it a little bit and they were too spread out but BC did a pretty good job in the last few possessions of attacking this zone being patient And the reason UMass is in the zone is because they their inability to guard Forte and hand and pay off the bounce But again Forte making a good decision splitting those top two defenders This is the first Heres what Forte does He does a nice job of just change direction and he splits the two defenders And Hanken Sanford just extends out instead of building the wall He just needed to go straight up Instead he reached into Forte Forte was six for six from the line and then missed two UMass with one timeout Frank Martin decides to use it and he can draw up the final shot of regulation with 14 points Can take a jumper or attack and go to the rim UMass has made their last six shots Theyve roared back down the stretch now Can they go in front 10 seconds left Bedial hands off Banks puts it UP AND IS FOULED WITH 51 cheering Marcus Bank Jr will head to the line with an opportunity to put UMass in front Wow Excellent patience very organized A set play a little ball screen handoff and Forte got caught on the screen They didnt give him the help They didnt play the handoff very well He got picked off So he was in panic mode trying to recover after he got screened and caught Banks on the arm Banks just one for three from the free throw line tonight 87 on the season Got it UMass cheering leads Well hes obviously despite his issues tonight hes the guy you want on the line if youre Frank Martin Hes the guy you trust Hes the adult in the room Hes the guy you put the ball in his hands to win the game Got them both cheering Boston College has one timeout 5 seconds left Forte gets it across midcourt Earl Grant uses his final timeout 23 seconds remaining BC trailing by two Well excellent job by BC I would have liked to seen them try to get the ball up the court a little bit quick more quicklier but UMass did music a good job You know it if if you push the ball up the court in a quick manner youve got maybe 4 seconds to go if you try to beat the press with a pass But I like I like UMass though They put soft pressure and probably here you see the pressure and they tried to get the ball up the court in a quick manner but music UMass put the pressure on and the officials are looking at the clock I dont think they have to add any more time Seems like they got it right on the floor Forte just hesitating a little bit because of that soft pressure I think you you have a play after after a made free throw where you you push the ball quickly up the court if by pass and you got to put pressure on the defense I think they had too many guys in the back court but give Frank Martin and UMass credit They were prepared for that So they put soft pressure You see the pressure They didnt just fall back on defense If they did BC would have been able to move the ball right to half court with a pass and then save a couple seconds music So theyre going to add half a second onto the clock 28 So what can you do if youre Boston College in under 3 seconds Oh you can get the ball right to the rim I obviously you know how is UMass going to play this I think music UMass definitely has to try to switch on everything on the outside and make sure if Im BC I try to get Donald Han on the move going to the rim And thats what theyre going to do Theyre going to come out and set a screen for him and hes going to get the ball on the move going to the rim They get it into Forte for the lead Houston and UMass holds on
