Boston College and Maroon and Goldby are underway at our Tuesday night ACC double header and its a road team Boston College that starts with the basketball cheering Eagles have shown flashes including over the weekend against ranked Louisville on the road They led at halftime led by as many as 10 against the Cardinals but couldnt finish it Looking for a full 40 minutes on the road again against a ranked opponent tonight And a turnover Porter ripped it away on the opening possession We take a look at the Tigers starting five ranked this week in the AP top 25 for the first time this season applause A really good start here with Clemson on the defensive end of the floor there Got to know youre going to get help in the post Fred Payne opens the scoring Nothing but net on a three As you look at the Eagles starting five Earl Grant last three games has gone big with Capki in the starting lineup to join Hastings on the front court and Clemson manages that by going big on the front court as well Well Clemson has the size and they play inside out They do a really good job Its more incorporated in their system But BC this is new but the size is allowing them to control the paint Offensive foul Theyre going to tag RJ Godfrey for a push off on the screen Got to be still setting those dribble handoffs Hes trying to caught him on a roll there Often teach bigs you got to pop your feet in the dribble handoff and protect the first foul Fred Payne goes back door Tough take and rolls off the rim No good Well Payne has had the hot hand for Boston College 24 points and 22 points in his last two games against NC State in Louisville Theyve gone to him early Hes got the lone three points tonight in the early going This will stay Clemson basketball Boston College touched it on the end line 13 seconds to shoot as Nick Davidson checks in for Gfrey who picked up the early foul here You can see both teams trying to fight on the interior Theyre battling for position inside Both teams want to control that orange area right there Neither are great threepoint shooting teams but this is what they want to do Get to the rim Dylan Hunter scoop to the hoop for two Heres Donald Han Jr leading scorer for Boston College in attack mode finds Taves on a three and he knocks it down Two early threes for the Eagles on the road and those shots are going to be there with the bigs playing inside guards You got to stay attached and chase these guys off the screen Both teams are kind of playing in drop coverage The immediate answer for Clemson Boston College two for two from three This is a team that shoots under 30 from three on the season Good start against a Clemson team that Boston College has played well historically under their head coach Earl Grant Clemson this time went for got out of drop coverage Now theyre switching Heres Hastings in the post working against Welling Passes out of the double team and turns it over Clemson brought pressure and BC turns it over Yeah they changed the look that time against BC They have been playing in drop coverage keeping the bigs in the paint letting the guards roam free They knocked down those two threes Brad Brownell had enough of that He started going to his switching manto man defense that time Justin Porter coming off that season high 26 points Heres Dylan Hunter And now down low with Carter Welling This is a good big man match up Welling on Hastings Welling backing him down The righty hook falls Runnings a tough match up Jay He goes over either shoulder that time You got to respect him going over the right shoulder with the lefty hook Hes looking for angles when he gets space He gets it that deep you can count it Well after Clemson missed their first two shots of this game theyve made three in a row to tie it at six Theyre going to get Bowden Capi for palming the basketball And thats another Eagles turnover Three in the opening four minutes Yeah Hastingss a really good defender and a shot blocker but Wellings just using his body movement and footwork there Gets to that hook Nothing Hastings can do but just sit there and watch that go in Well Clemson seven straight wins into the top 25 and rightly so And its because they do it with their balance Dylan Hunter a pullup pop Tigers have made four in a row And all five on the court can beat you oneonone difficult to defend as Fred Payne rejected at the rim Welling flew in Hastings did well to recover the possession The officials are making the shot clock reset And that brings us to a stop in the action Just getting started on our Tuesday night double music header Clemson up two back when BC was in Little John Coliseum down 3311 and Brad Brownell said this is his least favorite team to play all year because hes got to go against a guy who knows him so well He said he knows all the secrets and he said Brad Brownell draws up his plays in the sand No one knows his secrets but he has played him extremely well And were talking about some really good Clemson Tiger teams And they have stayed incredibly close since Earl moved on to be a head coach at College of music Charleston and then reuniting in the ACC Well its because theyre just similar in a sense Theyre really rock solid defensively BC has struggled scoring the basketball but defensively they have been a really tough score Taves fires a three buries it Two threes for Luca Taves Taves is off to a fast start and hes got a couple of open looks Hes does a really good job when he doesnt force the action Let the offense come to him and hes done a great job of that here in the first half And another offensive foul called against Clemson Off ball Throw the numbers out Youre talking about 29 on the year Scratch that laughter knock down their third three here in the first half You know the players youre looking up at your coach like theyre not supposed to do that in Scott report So you know Brad Brownells peering down at his former assistant Earl Grant and says youre under 30 from three and you come in here and make three of your first four Thats why these teams has spit the battles over the over the years That Taves three ended a six nothing Clemson run BC back in front Fred Payne cant connect The points are going to be at a premium You see the early shots in the opening five minutes Everythings contested It will be But thats thats the shot thats gotten BC in trouble Youve played this game and youve got inside out Youve got good looks COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL Dylan Hunter A chance for a fourpoint play applause And I get why you run out of a guy like that Hes shooting 41 from three Hes gotten off to a fast start with a layup a pullup the leader of this team You help off of him and he is shooting the lights out from behind in the threepoint lane So comfortable right now and confident Knows hes the leader of this team and hes off to a fast start here Knocking down his third basket here early Hunter cant complete the fourpoint play but hes going to get another chance at it because of a lane violation called against Taves He just cant do those things Its simple And he has the shooter You have the easiest job there You pinch down on the big and get the shooter Those are mistakes when youre trying to pull off an upset you just cant make Hunter fails to make him pay though Even with that miss Dylan Hunter has seven of the first 11 for Clemson cheering Trying to find Hastings Boston College Three turnovers in the early going Nice back door Caleb Steager ties it at 11 Thats the second back door for the Eagles And thats what you got to do against this Clemson Tiger pressure Dont keep chasing the basketball Do a great job of cutting away Theyve done that twice and been rewarded for it Porter step back Cant knock it down Its a good look Cant complain about that If you grab Ronell cheering Taves has had the hot hand early Hes made two threes in the early going Finds Fred Payne Drives baseline Welling but Hastings there to clean up the spill through contact A threepoint play opportunity for Jaden Hastings Thats what you want to see from your big when youre playing against someone and theyre a shot blocker there Attack the rim You go when you clean it up No one there to block you out but a guard Hunter knows he just didnt get there in enough time Hastings made a play Now Jaden Hastings always around the rim in perfect position that time after the Welling rejection Now he cant complete the and one opportunity after Dylan Hunter just missed a chance at a fourpoint play Hastings is not a really good free throw shooter So sometimes it starts bothering you gets in your mind when you start missing those Chase Forte into the game for BC Just passed it off to Bowden Capki BC not as much quality depth as Clemson The starting five throughout this ACC calendar has played teams like Louisville incredibly tough Its usually when they get into the bench where they wear down But right now a fourpoint lead after the Fred Payne make shot that baseline right there And again continue to handle the pressure This is a really good BC team and dont be surprised this team was up against Louisville They they just wear down They had the tendency to wear down and thats what Clemsons hoping for Nice spin move Nick Davidson cashes in and that ends a six nothing Boston College run cheering Boston College doing a great job of handling the pressure right now As you can see Clemsons pressuring the on the perimeter Great job by BC handling pressure Its a great drop step spin move there And again this is where Clemson controls the game J in four games this year theyre plus 48 in points in the paint Now Brad Brown now So he keeps his timeout keeps his ability to challenge and the Tigers get the basketball This is what he was challenging was originally called BC ball You can clearly see it goes off Steer Well the one thing Id say if Im BC if Im coach Earl Grant Im happy with that because Id want the foul called on that And so Id rather this happen early in this game than late cuz the Fishers cannot go back and add the foul RJ Godfrey back into the game He picked up an early foul Only played a minute 40 And this is just Clemson basketball Theyre going to pound it inside Scoring in the post and in the paint Got to watch the foul trouble if youre BC Godfrey misses the first tomorrow night And weve got a good one here First of two on our Tuesday night double header Syracuse and Florida State still to come Clemson really struggling from the foul line They are 0 for three to start this game against BC Godfrey still scoreless after those two free throw misfires Eagles have started well on the road against a ranked team very similar to their game over the weekend They were up by 10 against a ranked Louisville team on the road This is a BC team a lot better than their record Seven and nine but six of their nine losses have come when they have been tied or winning in the last two minutes as Godfrey goes to the bench again picking up his second foul And you heard me say earlier its why you protect the first foul because now hes got to sit for a while picking up the second and were not were just getting the halfway mark here in the first half Like the adjustment Earl Grant made there struggling to get offense inside He tried to post DJ Han there to get him going Shot clock down to three Hand has to hurry BC beats the buzzer doesnt get the finish though Aiden Shaw off the mark Scramble for the ball Davidson trying to track it down Hastings rips it away and foul trying to throw it down The Eagles are winning the hustle plays on the road but theyre leading ranked Clemson looking to add to that lead with Hastings here Jay theyre playing harder deflecting the basketball That time you had three guys chasing that basketball down Odds were in BCs favor Great job by Hastings there Great foul here Can Hastings give you one of two cheering Nothing but air on the first You know Randolph you get a few games into conference play and if youre a team like BC you still see that zero in the win column for conference games you you play with a little bit of desperation and I think youre seeing that from Boston College in this first half Jay cheering and screaming theyre playing with a lot of desperation but they they are a good defensive team and theyre playing the problem that theyve had is sustaining offense and right now theyve gotten off to a really good start here on the offensive end of the floor and the defensive intensity has always been there But if youre if youre Earl Grant you got to be really happy with your guys Zero wins in an in a win column in ACC play and youre here against a team thats already four wins and youre battling Chase Thompson misfires a three Tapped out Thompson tracks down his own miss This is what we talked about about the depth with Clemson Just rotating guys in Another turnover Thompson couldnt connect with Welling Miscommunication between those two Ripped away Justin Porter says Give me that LOOKING TO GO COAST TO COAST and hes rejected Good recovery by Aiden Shaw to swat it away Justin Porter is really doing a good job on both ends of the floor Hes not just scoring hes defending as well And this time he gets in the lane and Hastings having none of that He blocks that out Now weve said a couple of times tonight this is a program in Boston College that mirrors Brad Brownell and for good reason Earl Grant a former Brownell assistant he has built this program with defense So points at a premium when these two get together Davidson a chance to tie it and one coming The difference in the two right now is that Clemsons helping their big men out on the post BC is letting their bigs play oneonone and theyre paying for it with foul trouble Someones got to come down to offer some help if youre going to allow the bigs to dribble and get angles Well that ends a twominute Clemson scoring drought And Davidson does knock down the free throw to tie it at 16 Finally gets one to go down One of four to start here about this first half All even midway through this first half Boston College playing the ranked Tigers tough in search of their first ACC win Clemson trying to stay perfect in conference play cheering Forte kicks it out finds Fred Payne Missed the floater Yeah Jay one of the issues thats created with Boston College in the big lineup even though it helps them defensively and it helps them rebounding Davidson the hot hand hes got the last six for Clemson Is that right there Clemsons big space the floor It can shoot the three BC Bigs cannot And it allows the defense to choke down on their guards And this is what allows the team to go on runs against BC They just dont have the ability to spat you with their front line guys Forte lost it He gathers Davidson Another stuff Davidson tried to thread the needle there to Dylan Hunter Stolen away Both defenses wreaking havoc in this first half The turnovers continue to pile up Nice take off the window and in Bowden Capy Capy Thats what you can do You dont have to be a great shooter but you can put it on the deck drive the basketball and get to the rim Great job there 11 combined turnovers that has resulted in 10 points off turnovers and another three falls Nick Davidson starting to feel it Weve been waiting for a Nick Davidson breakout game Hes got 11 of Clemsons 22 Nick Gav is off to a hot start music Clemson Tigers Coming in off the bench Hes been really impressive here on the offensive end of the floor And again he has the ability to space you Kims got to get out there Theyve got to get out there Spend a three ball Davidson a perfect four for four on the night Right when the Tigers needed a boost on the offensive end Davidson has injected life and its a fourpoint Clemson cheering lead Just the theme of the Clemson Tigers Theres always someone new Payne another floater It doesnt drop Fred Payne getting in good areas Just cant get them to fall Looking for Davidson again and overshot him Clemsons been a little sloppy with the basketball trying to force the post feeds If its not there just move the basketball Theyre getting good shots and good looks when they just run their offense Credit BCs on the defensive end of the floor for it Contested three off the mark Ratanovic his first shot is a misfire Clemson does a really good job when they run their hollow action They try to throw it over the top but that ball is in the air for a really long time allows weak side defenders to come over and help Buckner a three no good So for Clemson its really been Davidson and Dylan Hunter Those two have combined for 18 of the Tigers 22 cheering Pay pull up pop Cant stick it applause BC just one of their last eight Payne has missed his last four DAVIDSON GREAT MOVE ONEHANDED JAM NICK DAVIDSON applause This was the Nick Davidson we thought wed get at the start of the season He looks like hes starting to settle down knocking down threes and taking it to the rack But both teams playing hard A foul Clemson with all the momentum music 22 ranked Tigers a sixpoint lead Talk about thats the secret They just wear you down with bodies Davidson a perfect five for five 13 points with Godfrey only playing two minutes this half with foul trouble That is exactly what makes this Clemson team so difficult is their depth and their quality coming off the bench Davidson buries it again right on Q Davidson six for six Hes got 16 Yeah theres going to have to be an adjustment with the way Boston College is defending that wide pin down Another turnover DAVIDSON WHY NOT Missed it on a heat check Long rebound finds Taves Boston College has one for their last eight Seven turnovers as well struggling on the offensive end Jump ball possession arrow with Clemson and that is another turnover and BC is struggling right now Got to find a way to get the ball in the paint Great job there by Wellings just jumping out aggressive on a dribble handoff creating the jump ball opportunity and forcing a turnover Boston College has gone scoreless for the last three minutes It has allowed an 8 nothing Clemson run to grab control of this first half Davidson who has it here the catalyst 16 points two shy of Boston Colleges team total Now Boston College is switching everything So lets see if Clemson finds the right matchup Davidson draws the foul This is whats so special about Clemson They dont change what they do Theyre going to play inside Theyre going to try to man the paint control the paint All of their bigs have the ability to face up and shoot threes but all of them are really good inside Davidson up to 17 points now in this first half As we remind you Thursday night terrific womens basketball double header right here on ACC Network Louisville at Notre Dame at six and then Virginia at Duke at 8 right here on ACC Network Mlepson largest lead of the night and Nick Davidson has already tied his season high and hes done it in about 15 minutes 18 points which ties Boston music Colleges total Jay Im going to jump out on a limb here and say hes going to be the second Clemson Tiger this season to score 20 points in a game Im just going to push all my chips to the table Theyve been so balanced that think about that They only have one 20 point scorer this season Justin Porter It is 26 points against Notre Dame here Just again theyre starting to control this game both ends And I know they call the goalending but you know the length and ability to alter your shot is there but thats what BC has to do Get aggressive Attack the rim Put pressure on the rim Well Boston College needed that bucket It ends a scoring drought that was nearing four minutes That allowed Clemson to separate Heres Porter Step back Missed it Porters gotten a couple of good looks there at the midrange shot missed those two But Brownell wants him to stay in attack mode continue to be aggressive look for his shot Hand very quiet in this first half Dumps it off Good finish Bow and Kapki on the inside Really good offensive possession there getting to the second and third shot sharing the basketball and again getting feet two feet in the paint Davidson wide open The hottest hand on the court misses That would have put him at 21 in the first half QBC Where does your offense come from Its got to be DJ Han or its got to be Payne One of these guys got to find a way to get them going Well Han has not shot it well as of late BCs leading scoreer They go up top Jaden Hastings Great alleyoop Its a great read there Clemson tried to top block and not let the pin down for DJ Hang Great recognition and unselfish play on his part Instead of fighting against the screen he sets the back screen Pacing gets the lock Well after Clipsson opened up a doubledigit lead BC on a SIX NOTHING RUN DAVIDSON ends the run with a three 21 points in this first half for Nick Davidson Hey BC Nick Davis is hot You might want to guard him Just FYI And he just missed a wideopen look on the previous possession Yeah theyre theyre playing with fire leaving him open He is hot right now Contested shot goes begging for Taves Now this is what the Tigers knew Davidson was capable of A terrific career in Nevada He averaged 16 points per game last season for the Wolfpack He struggled offensively so far in a Clemson uniform but not tonight GOOD LOOK PORTER GOT IT Tigers are making the Eagles pay Justin Porter drains the three The difference in the two right now is Clemsons just scoring within the flow of their offense Right now Boston College is having to come down and try to run a set every time and thats just challenging cheering Six first half threes for Clemson They are opening up the lead Offensive foul against the Eagles Clemson comfortable up 11 at home music you know hes not always the biggest fan of the net and how conferences have manipulated the analytics and the numbers but this year it does go in the favor of the ACC having all those teams and 14 in the top 75 very strong It has been November and December matters and this league has had a tremendous start to the season and its carrying it over in ACC play But the Tigers are one of those teams at 14 and3 find themselves ranked in the top 25 in the top 30 of the net 40 in ACC play and three of those four wins have come on the road I dont know if people understand how difficult that is Three games on the road and your four wins this early in the season You may have teams that wont get three wins on the road all year long And now here at home for the first game of a threegame home stand even after that Bowden Capki three Still up by eight under a minute to play in this first half Thats a big shot there by Capki Hell have that all afternoon long And Porter on a great crosscourt pass Shot clock down to four HUNTER FLOATS IT UP screaming Carter Welling slams it down applause Great trap by BC Unable to get the cheering skip pass there and and they paid for it Dylan Hunter turning the corner throwing a lob Eagles trying to hold for the final shot of the half Trailing by 10 cheering Clock down to four screaming Steager stripped and Clemson closes the first half with authority It was back and forth between Earl Grant Steal this game and win their first conference game of the season They start the second half trailing by 10 Their leading scorer on the season Donald Han Jr scoreless Hes got to find a way to get going Jay Hes got to get himself in this game Hastings cant finish Kapi couldnt clean up the spill and tried to go to Kapki inside Hes been able to get to the basket and finish if not score for his teammates RJ Godfrey only played two minutes in that first half with foul trouble They go to him here that falls out of bounds Will stay Tigers basketball Oh we could not have predicted this the two leading scorers of these two teams both scoreless in the first half And Godfrey going out with foul trouble did tee up the incredible 21point performance in the first 20 minutes for Nick Davidson But this is just what Clemson is They dont need God to score every game They got multiple guys that can step up and do it Great defense there by Hastings Taves missed it He hit two threes in the first half Couldnt connect on that first try of the second Yeah hes got a really good look there Brad Brownell wasting no time Nick Davidson already at the scorers table looking to check in Welling that rolls in Friendly roll I dont think you can allow the Clemson big to play oneonone They try to take your middle to get an angle of not spin baseline That time the spin baseline didnt work Spent back middle and shot the jump hook Backcourt violation Davidson checks in for Welling Thats 11 turnovers for Earl Grants Boston College team tonight Not a good recipe for a team that doesnt shoot the ball particularly well Shooting under 40 on the season You cant beat yourself And sometimes those turnovers happen because they struggle to shoot the basketball and theyre just trying to force the issue and they get careless at times Porter give and go with Godfrey Rolls to the rim It is fouled Hell get two at the line Its really good unselfish play there just sharing the basketball getting on a short roll coming off the screen catches on the short roll and you can see put you in a dilemma in the defensive end of the floor You got to help on him If not they throw it out to the corner for the open three Godfreyys first point of the night comes in the second half We remind you the gymnastics season is underway Our first ACC Network meet Sunday afternoon Dont miss it Number 13 Stanford taking on number 11 North Carolina Coverage begins 4 Eastern 1 Pacific right here on ACC Network Godfrey one of two at the line Godfrey and Davidson playing together now on the front court after Davidson spelled Godfrey with that first half foul trouble and an offensive foul called against the Eagles That is now 12 turnovers for BC and they only have 11 made shots That is never a good recipe for a road win had the last two turnovers are just bad turnovers Here is just a pushoff right in front of the official pushoff trying to Theres no need for it Frustration starting to set in Good defense there by Aiden Shaw to deny Davidson Boston College just struggles to find an offensive rhythm A very choppy first half The turnovers dont help Well theyre playing big Jay And the problem is that youre in ball screens but Hastings running out Put so much pressure on your guards to score because neither of the bigs are really good enough to beat you from three Clemsons allowed to stay inside protect the basket but on the other end they space you and they have the ability to score inside as well The Clemson crowd and Brad Brown now cant believe it They call the foul against Davidson I think everybody thought this was going to be against Hastings You see those two guys tangled up Does seem like Hastings was all over Davidson for an over the back And another Tigers foul called Game like this both teams are playing hard Sometimes the officials reward aggressive play and credit Hastings on that Hes at least attacking the basket He and Shaw going to the rim Boston College shooting 0 for four from the floor since halftime Still looking for their first points And another foul called against Clemson Thats three on this possession alone They dont like the call that time but thats the right call again No one boxed out Hastings got a free run to the rim Had they not fouled him I think he gets a tip though And thats the third against Nick Davidson So now he has to come out of the game Foul trouble Something to watch for the Clemson front court Payne step back three DC needed that to fall and it doesnt drop Yeah you again getting paint touches Youve gotten those three fouls and still come away with an empty possession Wallen all the way to the rim Everything but the finish BC still scoreless in this second half What can they do offensively to get into a rhythm One we got to find a way to get their guards out in this game And its a difficult matchup because again you spacing the floor with your front line guys They dont have to guard their bigs outside and those and and this is what you cannot do is take bad shots Well Hastings was in perfect position A bad shot leads to two with the dunk Get Hastings and Shaw the basketball on short rolls and get them on the move They can be more effective in scoring the basketball that way Good pass Godfrey Hes hammered It will get two at the line here Hastings just watching and follows the basketball Welling turns the box out Hasting tracks it able to recoup the catch and finish I think hes much better when hes on the move So hes But hes got to sprint out of those ball screens And hes got to be relentless on the offensive glass Well he just picked up his third foul Jaden Hastings whos been the biggest bright spot tonight for Boston College Earl Grant going to leave him in the game You got to be concerned with the size of Clemson frontline guys And Hastings been active You need him to rebound the basketball applause And youre struggling on the offensive end if youre BC But Hastings has five offensive rebounds in this game You got to find a way Donald Hays got to get aggressive here He and Payne going oneonone in the post is not hasty strength Hes got to be careful not to get a foul trying to hook here Heres Han still looking for his first points of the night Boston Colleges leading scorer Rejected by the rim Didnt get the angle Yeah he got buried underneath the rim that time Hes big Hes a physical guard They tried to post him up early Wouldnt be surprised to see BC go back to that Got to find a way to get him going Dylan Hunter back to Godfrey Goes right at Hastings for two applause You know the front line guys of Clemson know Hastings has three fouls Theres not much resistance he can offer you at the rim right now Heres Fred Payne Kick out three Forte no good I thought Forte had a the pull up Jay The previous touch was a much better shot than that three he just attempted there Right back to Godfrey Clear game plan to go at Hastings Hastings well defended blocking without fouling and now commits the foul Thats his fourth and hes going to have to come out of this game Tony Bennett the list goes on an incredible achievement and the success and consistency he has brought to Clemson in the last four years has been remarkable Jay Ive always been a huge fan because I coached against him so I understand how his teams are Theyve all been been really good on the defensive end of the floor but guarding his stuff it it drives you insane I mean he had counters upon counters and I think hes one of the best coaches in college basketball So Im not surprised at all with his success And right now his Tigers team riding a sevengame win streak undefeated in ACC play They have grabbed control of this game Bowden Capy a much needed make for Boston College Kapi has flashed Hes knocked down a three Hes put it on the deck there Nice post move Getting an angle there And we talked about a third score or someone that BC can run their offense through I think they may have found their guy Well even with that make BC just shooting two of 11 in this second half and Clemson continues to separate Buckner drains a three My question would be BC is if youre going to play Aiden Shaw at the four and youre not going to run and get much offense out of him you may have to go small here and change your defense very difficult to go small against this Clemson team though there with a nice finish here and then Clemson comes right back and buries the three and that would require you to change your defense You may have to play some zone and pick your poison but right now it feels like a bow constrictor right now and Clemson is just tightening up their grip Well we mentioned in the first half the relationship these two head coaches have Earl Grant coaching as a Brad Brownell assistant here at Clemson Grant told us that he thinks this is the best team that Brownell has had in all his years 16 years at Clemson And its certainly the best coaching job cheering he has done getting this team rolling right now ranked in the top 25 sevengame win streak And I think Coach Grant might be right I I mean if its too early to be talking about ACC player of the year and coach of the year votings but its just part of it And if it had been Brad Rondell would be at the top of that list applause What hes doing with this group that will not have a pre ACC first or second teamer RJ Godfrey has come alive All nine points scored since halftime after he had foul trouble in the first half Just to continue the conversation on Brad Brownell he has exceeded the ACC preseason poll in 12 of his 15 seasons as head coach at Clemson This being year number 16 Youd think theyre going to exceed it again Oh absolutely Payne nice take Eagles need more of that Theyre picked seventh and and I think theyll finish a lot higher than that transition three bottom But Johnson getting in on the scoring surge at Boston College forced it Two of those teams if Louisville was healthy right now theyre losing to Virginia who I think is going to climb the rankings and climb the seedings when its all said and done If Ryan ODs group can stay healthy if that rim protection much needed make out of the timeout by Fred Payne Eagles only had six second half points before that bucket in more than seven minutes of game action Tried to come out there in a 221 pressure and fall back to the zone Its just so difficult to come back when youre offensively challenged like BC has been throughout this season including tonight You got to get somebody hot Donald Han would be that guy He turns it over there Couldnt come up with a catch 13 turnovers for Boston College tonight Hand is still scoreless And thats not a good math equation No I mean that that there just exemplifies the issues that Boston College is dealing with You do a really good job defending and they are a really good defensive team but you put so much pressure on your defense eventually JUST CAVES IN ONEHANDED JAM Carter Welling applause The rack attack from Welling And he goes flying on the other end as well We got to take another look at this You a sevengame win streak and stay unbeaten in ACC play So far so good for the home team Tigers You know for Boston College down 20 it can feel like 30 or or 40 Just the way this team struggles to score Their leading scoreer Donald Han Jr still scoreless tonight Fred Payne now has 11 to lead the Eagles after he knocks down two from the line Yeah Payne has been their best player since the start of ACC play Hes just playing with a ton of confidence and something that DJ Donald Han Jr is struggling with at the moment Welling misfires from three Offensive rebound finds Davidson Nick Davidson 23 points a season high for him Yeah Jay You see how the basketball just found him and when you shite I mean he just comes in and he does deflect it on the offensive end and the ball tips away throws back in his hand and he wont get an easier one than that Foul called against Buckner Hes not happy with it his third I mean hes flying in on the offensive end This is tipped away and just Thats when you know its your night Its your night Its just your night First basket of the second half His previous season high against an ACC opponent was 14 against Pittsburgh He had 21 points in that first half During his stretch he scored all those 21 points in a 9minute 28 second span He outscored the Eagles alone 219 and that really started the separation of this game and Clemson has stayed in control Yeah were in a dangerous moment here for Boston College because Clemson is starting to to heat up and find its target on the offensive end of the floor that Davidson scoring surge the difference so far and BC they just cant stop turning it over trying to hurry up the court to hand and that is now 14 turnovers for the Eagles tonight then Jay what happens is when youre struggling to score youre just trying to get out in transition beat the defense down play a little fast because you dont want to play against this this Clemson set defense just a lot of unforced turnovers A lot of frustration setting in Johnson pull up pop Got it cheering applause What a Johnson with a nice midrange pull up there off the bounce Just getting to his spot in rhythm Pay knocks it down on the other end The Eagles have actually made their last four shots Theyve got four turnovers during that shooting streak though The problem is for Clemson Tigers the last eight trips down the floor or last seven trips down the floor Id say they scored on six I mean here just comes off and again you cant help up with the front line guys of Clemson knocking down jump shots here and Fred Payne comes off and knocks down the midrange shot Hes the only offense Boston College can rely on here tonight Now can the Eagles string together some stops Easier said than done against Davidson already with a season high That rattled in and out It was halfway down but didnt drop Hell go to the line to shoot two I think BCs got to help I mean these bigs are you see the blueprint Theyre driving middle Theyre trying to turn baseline BC is doing a really good job of defending the initial action Got to get some help to these guys And that is Bowden Kapkis fourth foul So both Hastings and Capki with four last year and that was Wake Forest last year U I I dont know which one would do it Both of those teams have much improved and I think that Wednesday game during the week is a really difficult ask for a team flying I mean traveling west Well Jaden Hastings back into the game for BC with their backs against the wall playing with four fouls Fred Payne hes got 15 to lead the Eagles Donald Han Jr yet to score tonight And another turnover Buckner read it the whole way The steal and the score And one coming applause Yeah Donald Han Jr loses his footing there and ace Buckner just gets in the in the passing lane here I really loved what I see from Buckner Hes more comfortable Hes fearless Even when theyre in close games he just comes in and give this unit a added offense and confidence And maybe for Brad Brown a little too confident at times but you love that hes fearless Now when Clemson lost their talented freshman guard Zack Foster to a torn ACL earlier this season it was Buckner who stepped up immediately scoring a career best 19 points in the first game without Foster Hes been a great addition to this quality depth You can make the argument that Clemson is the cheering deepest in terms of quality depth in ECC play This is what I mean when I say he comes in hes just fearless That doesnt always go his way but hes unafraid of the moment And when youre coaching young players its a quality you love to see Pay into traffic Well contested by Clemson Nothing comes easy against this Tigers defense No theyre playing with two bigs The bigs are mobile Bronnell asked these guys to defend on the perimeter and at the rim Provide rim protection You see here theyre up on the screen Theyre not playing back and drop coverage You come up tag So Davidson called for the reach in there on Hastings Man theyre up 24 and theyre fighting They continue to fight Davidson doesnt like the call Theres Zack Foster the freshman guard who tore his ACL We were just talking about him a moment ago Hes a handful I mean his his ability to create his shot his speed just a minor setback there Hes sitting next to a Clemson great guard and Terrell McIntyre there This is the front end of a one and one Nick Davidson comes out of this game for Clemson with four fouls 25 points to lead all scorers for him A scoring high in a Tigers uniform Hasting has four fouls Welling attacking him and a foul called but it was not Hastings will send Welling to the line for two Aiden Shaw came over late Had to get there and foul If not its another dunk for Welling Carter Welling the junior from Draper Utah He has provided big minutes for Clemson this season showing he can prove at this level coming from UC Irvine and Utah Valley Stepping up to the ACC he has been outstanding and such a tough player I was looking at his bio earlier today He is one of four boys So hes got three brothers Thatll toughen you up for ACC play laughter in the paint Yeah theyre really high on him They love his ability to stretch the defense Thats a big knock down threes left and right shoulder in the post Just a typical front line player for Brad Brownell in the way he plays Nearly another turnover for BC Itll stay with the Eagles but Clemson in command looking to start ACC play 50 under eight to go for more than 15 years Basically Brad Brownells entire tenure here as head coach for the Tigers Mrs Grooms and Coach Brownell those two have been the main stays laughter How about that record 11 straight in the ACC And if you wonder why Paula Groom started doing that her grandson when he was growing up loved airplanes So took him to the local airport and kept seeing the Clemson basketball team get on planes and said no one was there to wish him luck and send him off So she started doing it and been doing it ever since She has sent them off to a lot of wins What is the key Randolph for winning on the road One it its difficult because there got to be so much communication thats being done when youre away because of how loud some of the arenas get and you talk about a connection connected group of guys One you got to be really really good and tough But they just check all the boxes Theyre tough Theyre unselfish They do all the little things And more importantly with Brad Brownell they always control the paint And when you do that you always give yourself a chance to win Like I said in the ACC play coming into tonight theyre plus 48 in points in the paint Now Brad Brownell is doing it with a different roster but the same way if that makes sense Its different guys but its still the Clemson identity Its defensively and theyre just starting to open up their offensive playbook He had to change because hes always had retention this team He had 10 new players and so he had to bring them along slow offensively and thats the scary part for the ACC Theyre starting to figure some things out Hes starting to be able to get his counters in Tigers fans not happy with the call underneath against Godfrey but it did look like Shaw stepped out of bounds I think theyre just wondering why the foul was called That is Godfreyys fourth Shawn misses the front end of the one and one And we talked about the offense starting to come around We got 645 here to play and the Tigers average 77 points a game Theyre well on their way to getting there Too much on the three from Dylan Hunter Payne into the paint kicks it out Clemson defensively been suffocating Nothing Boston College can do on the offensive end in this second half Yeah theyre just having it settled for shots like that Those are just not efficient shots And Aiden Shaw is left open in the corner for a reason Hes only made one three on the season shooting 11 screaming Step back three Porter misses it Foul called And Clemson outscoring Boston College 296 in this second half And even though the Tigers have missed their last four and are in a scoring drought their defense protects this lead Yeah Well theyre always going to defend And what happens when theyre struggling The difference between these two teams they have the ability to go inside And the one thing I think when BC goes back and watch this tape theyre going to wish they they were able to dig and help on the bigs a lot more and force the perimeter guys for Clemson maybe to make some more threes Clemson hadnt shot the three ball great outside of of Anderson Hes been the hot hand Porter hadnt gotten it going and but thats just the Clemson way Its just different guys step up They dont force it They are still trying to pound you inside and theyre shooting a good percentage from three to eight of 17 Well even from half to half it can be a different guy Godfrey was scoreless in the first half with foul trouble 10 points in this second half Davidson had 21 of his 25 in the first And this is what hurt them Godfrey and Welling just get to stay in the paint Aiden Shaw will head to the line to shoot two And thats what they got to do with the front line guys of Aiden and Hastings Those guys got to catch it on the move Theyre Its better for them Catch it on the move Get to the rim They dont have to dribble because theyre not back to the basket players inside RJ Godfrey fouls out Brad Brownell always coaching Yes he is Theres always a lesson to be learned He looks like Jerry Wayne right there because it its like hes never happy Hes up 24 right now Five minutes to go and he is coaching like RJ youre going to hear this all the way to the end of the bench Take your 10 points Im glad Now go sit down Well lets explain who Jerry Wayright is for people that dont know Hes the link between you and Coach Brown Jerry Wayne was your assistant coach at Wake Forest and then was the head coach at Wilmington where Brad Brownell was his assistant and I asked you during shoot around do you see any Wayne and Brownell and right there was a flash of it Yeah always coaching Shot clock down to two Porter rejected by Hastings whos played well with four fouls defensively for BC Payne transition gets it to go Fred Payne up to 17 Hes been the bright spot for the Eagles He just seems to put himself in the right situation He doesnt force anything The game just seems to come to him You can see why hes been their best offensive player since the start of ACC play Porter lines it up Cant connect But Clemson has missed their last six shots And weve seen this out of Clemson This isnt abnormal for them Payne hes got the hot hand Up to 20 points Backto back makes for Fred Payne BC Can you get enough stops here to make it interesting Like again make Clemson think about it Theyve had some leads Theyve squandered 20point leads before Can you put some doubt in their mind You got to find a way now to continue to get stops and get out in transition May be a case of too little too late but BC battling hard Hastings does pick up his fifth foul there So Jaden Hastings is music fouled out of this game But when you cant score you know no ones that good defensively They just go through so many scoring droughts and inability to score And some of that is because they got two bigs inside Kapy can stretch it a little bit but hes not a guy youre worried about beating you from three Hes made some plays from the perimeter Hes driven it Hes knocked down a three but Hastingss not a threat Shaws not a threat And then it puts too much responsibility on the guards And I think DJ Hans paying the most of it because he draws a crowd and hes just been uneffective and trying to create space Well Hand has been scoreless tonight DC looking for offense in other places and they just havent found it Taves is fires and Taves is only the real ball screen guy that they have too Thats the other thing and not a lot of He has the ability to make plays for himself and others and I dont know if anyone else on this roster is capable of doing that Other guys are just scorers Clemson will continue to try and protect this lead from the foul line Its been interesting They have not made a basket a field goal in 6 minutes and 23 seconds But in this second half theyve made 12 free throws So you look at that stat and say What They dont have a basket in more than six minutes How are they still up by 20 Well theyve done very well getting screaming to the foul line and continue to defend Thats why theyre 40 and soon to be 50 in the ACC is because of that that defense And again we talk about it sometimes Thats the negative They dont have a goto guy They just rely on the system and how they play and their unselfishness on the offensive end Its any guys night When you look at this Clemson season Randolph I wanted to ask you this The Tigers tough losses to Alabama and BYU right in that game and then they lose in the closing stages but you learn so much from losses Theyve responded from those two losses with this now going to be eightgame win streak What lessons did they learn in those two games that youve seen during this eightgame win streak One it is is a belief because this team came out of nowhere you know and right now I think they believe they can play with anyone You know youre talking about the 22nd ranked team in college basketball and I think they believe that collectively that theyre better than that They have a lot of improvement to be made And when you play against the Alamas and the BYUs you also its a reminder that you have to do it collectively When you play against a guy like AJ Deman being the number one I think the number one pick in the NBA draft coming up you saw how elite of talent he can be as he came in and took over that game and they know for us to be able to beat teams like that We have to play together share the basketball as you can see step up and make plays for yourself and others And Brad Brownell told us that they had less games in December compared to November So they finally got some time practice to practice and improve And that has played itself out during whats going to be an eightgame win streak including five of those wins in conference play I think Jake every team feels that way You start out the season you got so many games You got your mtees and you got all your your players festival whatever your schedule allows you to do You play so many games in November to start the year and then you get through finals and then I like to say you become a pro basketball team Theres no class Theres just its just youre figuring it out Its just get in the gym When youre a basketball player over Christmas if youre not getting better regardless of your class that thats your mistake You have a chance over the Christmas break to get ready to come out for conference play ready to go Make an improvement You got enough games to see where your shots are coming from how youre defending how youre helping your teammates how youre making guys better Chance to come out in January and show everybody The Dallas Thomas into the game and into the box score 69 red shirt freshman from Little Rock Arkansas They are very high on him See this is we talked about the inability to have a bunch of guards that can create Tiles is the one guy you know so much driven this entire possession on him and called for a push off that time Clemson continues to take care of business It was a close game for that 15 minutes and then Nick Davidson started the separation at the end of the first half and the Tigers have put their foot on the gas in this second half outscoring Boston College 3723 since halftime I mean you look at Dylan Hunter he had him going early Thats his first basket He had a quick seven points and started this game cheering screaming Boston College will finish this game with 19 turnovers Clemson cashed in for 24 points off turnovers and 24 points is the difference in this game right now 7450 Coming up next Florida State and Syracuse as our Tuesday night ACC Network double header continues from Central New York Yeah we just had the Orange last week Randolph they look a lot better with Donnie Freeman in the lineup as they try and make a push here in the ACC Hes made a difference since hes come back in that lineup We saw JJ Stling sighting here the other night and we got quality minutes from Kai and Anthony off the bench Watch out for the orange One of those 14 teams in the top 75 of the net And Boston College one of those four teams on the outside And the Eagles just four games into conference season need to start worrying about where are you going to get the wins in conference play so you dont miss out on the ACC tournament because the bottom three teams will miss the conference tournament still winless in ACC play Clemson still undefeated 50 music
