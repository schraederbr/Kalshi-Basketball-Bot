Our music officials tonight Eric Lewis Brian OConnell and Jamal Spearman Williams First shot of the night off the mark and the rebound by Justin Neil Starting five for UNCG We got two graduate students and two freshman in younger and Marville in the starting five Got to look out for Donald Whitehead Jr exhibit A Thats an and one if theyre going to give it to him Yes And they do Thats that extra step in the NCAA rules committee implemented this season Youre going to get a little bit more continuation But as for Whitehead this was a division 2 allamerican He is a jitterbug in its finest form Can get places off the bounce and really shoot the basketball as well The foul was on Darien Williams for NC State cheering and Whitehead trying to cap off the threepoint play Cant cheering do it applause Stunning five for NC State that has averaged 71 12 points per game so far throughout the first two Theres a three ball going down Paul McNeel His ability to come off off ball screens is spectacular And the elevation after the catch so difficult to guard High release point I really like his potential longterm under coach Will NC State hit 19 threes in their first game tied a school record against NC Central Then the other night against UAB on Friday Terrence they started 0 for 12 from threepoint range before they really picked it up Hey if theyre good shots well wait He wants to hit him obviously but you got to live with it You run good offense Mcneel again And hes going to be fine with that Little quick right there Id like for the ball to pop around a little bit Two good possessions to start out the game which got three possessions three threes Try to find something else a little bit Marvilles got it Freshman from France dealing runs right into a road block and a tie up as Cladier Copeland got right in there and grabbed the ball Its going to be UNCCG possession of the alternating era I love Quadir Copa He is so active defensively Look at his eyes He gets in front of the driver Quick steal and then hes going to wrestle that ball away I I think hes one of these all toughness team guys A 65 lead guard Very unselfish I call him the microphone but well explain why as this as this game goes on Theres going to be a foul here and free throws coming for UNCG Its on Ven Allen Luben Oh no free throws Its on the floor Marville to put it in cheering Having some trouble does get it in the last second Whitehead kneeling trying to power his way through Nothing doing there cheering Marvel shut off Tough fade away Got it Tough player Marlly with Orleó in France and theyre under 21 team cheering Orlone a very good program in their own right in pro You get minutes there you can go Go dishes it for Luben and he gets the bucket and hes fouled I love it Little ball screen and roll Nice job Guadir Copeland understanding I can get away from it Drags over the fiveman Quick pop and Ben Allen Luben whos not your typical five in terms of height but in terms of width really can carve out a lot of space Foul was on Domas Kzonus his first and Luben connects cheering I think what well notice too is whenever NC State makes a shot or after a free throw theyre going to switch up defenses You could see right now a one two one 34 court press just to get UNCCG out of rhythm A senior Valentino Panedo is in the ball game for the first time this season as he missed the first two games And driving underneath is Neie for the bucket Were tied at six Neers underneath their chest He controls the defense Nice finish Luben fouled on his way in again And itll be Panedo that gets called for that second Pedo getting caught out on the perimeter Hes not used to dealing out there all that often Ben Alukan one thing he cant do you give it to him at the top of the key he can straight line drive to try to create some contact Got to get in the stance and probably give Vinnal Lugan a little bit of room We were talking earlier about the personnel that NC State has You said What about at the five spot A little bit smaller And if you look up and down the rosters in the ACC um theres a lot of big fives in this league So but heres the counterpoint to that Venal Logan 6869 listed at 68 250 Hes got the strength to hold guys off But one of the advantages of that Mike is his ability to step out and switch in five spots Not every team in the league has that type of defensive versatility Ben Allen Luben supplies that for this team you can really get out and pressure the ball with him on the floor Yeah he needs to be able to do that both ends of the court Offensively you know now big guys got to shoot threes and defensively to your point Didnt shoot a lot of threes back at UNC A little bit of Vandy This is his fourth school in four years Heres a threepointer thats up and good by Marvel Marvel really good when he gets to his left hand cheering pull up Good elevation knockdown shot Going to have to guard him Hes got five points And right back the other way is Williams And NC State has regained the lead Darien Williams is Wolfpack Bart 100th consecutive start tonight for number one Darien Williams one of their top players Another three by Whiteand No good And rebounded by McNeel Williams again backs his way down on the mismatch and hits it over Whitehead Hey that wasnt a mismatch That was grown man over a not so tall man if you will Whitehead as tough as he is physically only stands about 510 or hes listed at that Thats generous Giving up about a foot there in that matchup Dont you love all the control from Williams He backed his way in You dont have to use your off arm You He was very under control in that part Yeah Really smart by him And sometimes you can get a little antsy thinking well I can beat this guy off the bounce I can beat this guy off the bounce and really bully my way in You have to maintain your balance And thats why Williams is so good Threepointer McNeel Thats not there but he got fouled And three free throws coming for Paul McNeel and well have it after we return in this a little bit of a skirmish here on the sideline in front of the UNCCG bench Lets wait and see what we got here or if we will have anything Theyre trying to separate the players cheering Right coach Thats the only thing I could see outside of guys just barking early applause and then at the beginning of the scuffle and then at the end when he pushes again he gets his second technical Gotcha Now hes ejected So whats going to happen is Paul McNeel is going to shoot his three free throws from the ensuing foul Then Gold is going to go down shoot four free throws for the two technical fouls And then its going to be gold basketball Greensboro basketball Sorry Yeah lets remember the uh the situation was is that McNeel was fouled shooting at three So he hits all three free throws and then like you said now here Terrence you got Donald Whitehead Jr at the free throw line for the technicals So they got cheering Hollowman for two in a row right there at the first when we saw the shove and then at the end and thats tough because the alarming part for me was I thought Antoine Jones got up off the bench and made the first contact and theres no technical called on him So at what point are we where do we start the confrontation I guess maybe Im wrong but well theres tough when you have a shooter like Whitehead Jr going to the line for four He can find his rhythm a little bit Now theyre actually they have six because there was a technical on Copeland as well I thought they had So look at Zero is the one instigating first and then five ends up getting a technical foul call Probably the first one around this area He gets pushed and then he turns around and starts talking again So the swing or not not it wasnt even a swing It was a tap really This is I think one technical would have been fine Two technical is over the top right And what happened was is you got the two free throws for the technical on Copeland and then you got the two free throws for the essentially flagrant two uh foul No two technical fouls Two two technical fouls on Hollowman Thats why hes ejected So the first technical foul first two free throws Second second two ball goes to Green What about the technical on Copeland too It was a technical 11 quadier cop Well get it sorted out when we go to break and ask these officials cuz that was a lot Williams After all that its 153 NC State by two Whistle and a foul here as Luben will head to the line Antoine Jones called for it 14 fouls on UNCCG and four on the Wolfpack Van Allen Luben Antoine Jones Thats a grown man Hes seventh school in seven years finishing his career at Greensboro But hes got his hands full with Ben Allen Luben Well heres this timeline right Look at this I mean its unbelievable really And the crazy part is he committed to Oklahoma State then decommitted signed to Texas Texas AM got out signs in Memphis stays for a year entered the portal committed to UCF gets out of the commitment goes to Louisiana or goes to Kraton then Louisiana then Bthoon Cookman Its unbelievable And Whitehead Junior you better find that guy He knocks down a three ball here and hes got nine points of the 16 so far for UNCC Greensboro Foul away from the ball here and its on Lillian Marvin Thats his first But back to the point he signs and plays at Kraton then plays eight games at Louisiana then goes back to UCF goes to Bthoon Cookman last year plays one game and then comes to UNCCG Th this guy is a renaissance man Hes all over the place Copeland trying to get it into Matt Ael whos in for the first time tonight True freshman from Baltimore Highest ranked snee that NC State has had in 10 years McNeel for three No Tapped around Rebound Williams Yes So strong and is always on balance He makes up for his lack of vertical burst by using his shoulders staying on balance and really just using his leverage against a sometimes bigger opponent Williams has six here early So does McNeel and so does Luben accounting for the 18 for NC State Whitehead finds Pano and hes fouled Telling you its a mentally tough bunch this UNCG crew I I mean theyre going to attack you relentlessly A lot of grown men on that side of the ball too They do have some freshman Sure But the affforementioned Jones 24 25 years old You look at Penedo whos at the free throw line Hes been to the NCAA tournament uh at his prior stop at St Francis won the NEC So they have some of these big strong bodies that can compete So if you dont get on top of things if youre NC State Greensboro because of their style of play is a team that can hang around right Well theyve got a chance here to cut it to one Theyve already had seven lead changes in this game tonight And thats a lane violation on UNCC Greensburg Officiating crews bringing it tonight Yeah they got they got a lot of stuff going on here Um to your point I mean UAB did this early in the first half in the last game and then NC State just kind of overwhelmed them toward the end of the first half and then to the second half Thats how crucial uh the end and the early part of this halftime area is going to be for this free throw team tonight Absolutely I like that set I like this set right here getting Abel coming off a handoff at the top of the key Hes got some ability as Kzonus gets his second foul Uh Matt Abels got some ability Youre looking at another freshman in a year of freshman in college basketball Hes just another one of these super talented guys A top 30 recruit Hes got good length Shoots some shoots a good ball And coach Will Weight raves about his maturity as a young player his approach as a guy whos a little bit younger U you want guys who can work and know how to work Thats Thats two different things Copeland spinning and throws it in for two Such a sweet move Hey put it here if Copeland crafty is an understatement I love how he plays and the swagger in which he plays with and the pressure that NC State now is putting on Theyre up by four Coming up on 13 minutes to go in this first half cheering Whitehead again for Jones Shot clock is at seven and a three second violation on UNCCG applause How about Quer Copeland We talk about how crafty he is off the bounce Splits the double team Nice little finger roll He just plays with such bravado and toughness I love his game Thats the first turnover for UNCC Greens Railroad here in this first half And NC States only had one as well Heres a foul See Allan Breed in the game He came up from Mcnes with Will Wade guy from Georgia He played on a high school team at McKe with Sheree Cooper and Isaac Aoro both of which are on NBA rosters but hes been in college basketball a long time because I think Okoro is on his second contract So another guy whos just kind of hung around and stuck with it Hasnt played a lot of basketball over the last two seasons due to a transfer and some injuries but he has some ability Played really well for Ed Pool He gets his own rebound Great job there by Breed on the offensive rebound that leads to two as Jerry Deng puts it in Largest lead of the first half six points Younger and fouled on his drive in Not really sure what youre supposed to do defensively outside of just keeping your hands up And I like the aggression KJ Younger hes a talented freshman Hes going to have some good games in the Southern Conference this year from the state of North Carolina But if youre Sier and youre coming over to help you got to show your hands cheering Dang picks up a foul and Younger will get another Two days from today you and I are back on it Not that far down the road Duke And well have that for you against Indiana State Thats at 7 oclock And then NC Central at UNC at 900 Friday right here on the ACC Network Both Duke and UNC off to the 3 and 0 starts Game four for both on Friday night Copeland for NC State The lead is five Copeland again Wow cheering I love the patience Change of direction Hangs on one foot So difficult to defend Wow Younger back the other way That doesnt go and its out of bounds off of UNCC Greensboro And a timeout We will be back 1159 to go in the first half Wolfpack have opened up a sevenpoint advantage I talked to Jones before the game tonight and he said Yeah He goes We called Will the young guy and I was the old guy No coach He was part of the recruiting coordinator Will Wade as an assistant there and Mike was more into getting some of the Xs and Os down They both had assistant coaches roles at DCU where they first met and now meeting up here again tonight in this matchup You know Mike Jones prior to coaching was a zoology major at Howard and his first job out of college was animal testing and he said they had rodents canines primates and he was in charge of the primates So he would have to go and pick up the monkeys Nice move by Abel He would have to go and pick up the monkeys and they so they would test the medicines on the monkeys He said they would get loose all the time and hed have to run and chase them and go down and then hed have it his gloves up to his shoulders And he said Youd have to be careful because some were docile some were aggressive But some of these diseases that the monkeys would get that they were testing for if they bit you theyd take you out in two weeks So he said I cant wait to get out of this and get into coaching Hes had a long successful career in coaching One everywhere hes been He he has And thats Wanted to get out of Wanted to get out of Monkey Tology Yeah But he was on track to be a doctor Yeah got an opportunity to coach at Sidwell Friends and uh thats been the story ever since Well thats uh your career path taking a a crazy turn right Left turn man Yeah No but one of the one of the good guys but hes got his guys playing hard right now And this is what NC States hoping for Lets speed this game up a little bit Copeland goes down with it Gets it out here for Sier He got it knocked away HE STILL HAS IT BOUNCES it and missing on the runner is Deng I dont think Den Deng ever really caught the ball And a foul here What do Yeah they didnt get the whistle blown or Brian Okonnell had a foul We went from it being very physical to a little kurfuffle on one side and now theyre calling everything Its a one and one here I really like this young man though Justin Neely Played really well against Kansas State Hes got that build that could have success at the SoCon level You Albany transfer last season Yeah 11 and a half points seven boards close to 50 from the field Its a guy whos a relentless in his attack of the basket If hes shooting his free throws well thats going to help So far this season through two games 14 points 10 boards 76 So hes the hub of everything this Spartan team does Spartans hanging right in this here Neely makes it a fivepoint game Hes got four Gives them a chance to set up their defense as well Exactly And if nothing else youre making NC State play at a slower pace which is where Greensboro likes to be Williams pulls up doesnt get the bounce this time And a good job there on the save from Nean Whitehead the runner How about that So crafty off the bounce Donald Whitehead Jr can score Hes got 11 points tonight Terrence Three or four from the field four or five at the free throw line Well he got all four of those free throws during that double technical situation Right You know when you play against a score the last thing you want to do is let him slow his body down to make some shots Williams runner doesnt go Tries to fight to get it back gets loose and a foul as UNCGs got it That was Marvel that picked it up Lets see who they call here applause Its on Dang and thats going to be his third I want Weve had 16 fouls called in the first 10 minutes of this game I like the effort here If youre at UNCCG theyre not going to back down They toughness in their DNA I I remember anytime as a player or a coach you played UNCCG or you played Radford where Mike Jones was at before youd have a nightmare before because you just knew you were in for it and they make you play their way So right now 2422 a lot of free throws exceedingly physical Thats right up their out Well as evident of this uh now onepoint game halfway through this first half 2423 6 nothing run here for UNCCG after it looked like NC State was gaining some momentum with a sevenpoint lead cheering Deng for three Save from going out by Marville I like Deng shooting threes I I like them when theyre more in rhythm He caught it Thought about it too long If you dont have it right off the catch go ahead and get rid of that basket Parville to the corner Its Whitehead for three Its good Eventually you got to guard him My goodness Donald Whitehead Jr They gave him a two cheering but the man can score it No my bad Meant that he had two or actually its a second threepoint Yeah it was a three Yeah excuse me I thought it was a three but nice move Back the other way missing on the three is McNeel Its out of bounds and its UNCC Greensboro possession Yeah I mean Whitehead hes four or five from the field two for three from threepoint range and hes got a game high 14 points A really good player right at 20 points a excuse me 19 and a half points a game last season Like sometimes these guys get looked over because of the height man Hes shifty He gets to spots Theyve been small Hes been small his whole life Hes had to score that way his whole life Yeah Nothing changes when you get to college and you cant help too much off of him or hes going to make you pay And how about the probably chip on his shoulder coming from division 2 University of Pennsylvania where they did have a great run They played some really good teams at their level but now to come here and do what hes doing at this level thats pretty impressive Absolutely and losing the handle out of bounds UNCCG there and Neil But you youll see every time NC State gets the ball back its after a dead ball Its after a foul Its like this is the kind of wrestle that the Spartans really like to play in They love to play in the mud Where NC State where theyre most comfortable at least in their first two games has been when the games moving a little bit Yep Theyre all for their last seven from the field as theyre down by two Luben hook doesnt go Whitehead again I knew it was going up from NBA range Not there That was well beyond NBA range My mans foot was on the wall guy He checked there for sure And now heres Breed who hands off for Williams Okay so if Im NC State this is not what I want And Copeland gets hit in the face But when thing things have not gotten difficult so far for the Wolfpack but you see right now Darien Williams is chasing the ball a little bit Its not working for them at this particular moment Continue to move the basketball even though theyre being really physical Cant chase this basketball No I agree with you I mean theres five guys in double figures in scoring right now in this season and theyve got one of them at nine right behind him So its a team game where a lot of players can hurt you Thats exactly right But in order for that to happen you know McNeel Jr needs that ball to move Then Alen Luba needs that ball to move Darien Williams he can create some in isolation but even he is better when the ball pops around a little bit So you know right now guys are getting frustrated Dont run towards the ball Let the ball work for you Were tied at 26 The foul was on Assan Madan cheering And thats our fifth tie of the night here with 810 to go in the first half Jones lost it cheering Williams outlets to Bre Back to Williams crosscourt finds a wide open McNeel for three McNeel cheering Not just a great shot but a great pass and a better screen by Vin Allen Luben on that backside to get McNeel open in the corner Thats good offense by the Wolfpack Second three of the game for McNeel Hes got nine points and its back to a threepoint NC State lead Seven and a half to go in the first half Whitehead for the tie cheering Good defensive possession Now get out and run Let this ball work a little bit Reed going to be cheering a blocking foul here on Whitehead Thats his first And were going to have free throws when we return Wolfpack by three Back and forth here in this one between these two Its a great job of number 22 Vin Allen Luben finding an opportunity for another guy and an even better pass by Darien Williams who to be honest with you Mike has surprised me with how well he has seen the floor in the first two games and almost two and a half games of his NC State career No I agree with you because it looks like you know hes well dialed in to the game plan Hes not under out of control Uh really within the framework of the team and and this is the preseason ACC player of the year too by the way that were talking about in late the overall impact of what he is right now in in my mind a first team allAmerican preseason because cheering of how he totally can control the game either with his scoring and with his passing Uh he was a big time gift for NC State and he seems like hes the guy who started the momentum for this program once Will Wade took over Its a seven nothing run for NC State Weve had five ties and nine lead changes here in this one And look NC State continuing to switch five ways Van Aloo staying in front of a point guard Thats terrific defense Now you got to finish possession Marvilles missed runner gets back out to Jones and 20 on the shot clock for UNCCG Whitehead Marvel pulls up No rebound Breed applause Coach Will Wade said that Breed was going to get some opportunity today Hes played eight minutes so far here in this first half Seven nothing run still for the Wolfpack leading by five Copeland No Everywhere but in Marville got bumped by Copa A double team Oh no and they stole it but out of bounds was NC State Were going to be able to take another look at it I think Darian Williams did step out of bounds on the side A little bit of a bummer Nice help coming over Youll see his right foot Well pretty close Will doesnt agree Yeah I appreciate the toughness of NC State over the last four to five minutes has shown on the defensive end of the floor Whitehead got going a little bit They started to chest up a little bit more play with a little bit more physicality there When when they switch with force uh its much harder to to score on them Now theyre sending a second guy at the ball And a timeout by UNC Greensburg applause and well step aside with him 604 to go in the first half Wolfpack by five Back in 30 seconds Ways to get easy looks And for two teams that have been playing exceedingly physical basketball and makes it tough Ill be honest too NC States had opportunities I think Ive seen about four shots go all the way in and bounce out Heres Whitehead Five to shoot UNCC Greensboro younger has to put it up and he is fouled and should have three free throws coming here as well Im not really sure why Wills upset Allan Breed obviously had his hands in the cookie jar right there as were going to be able to maybe we can take another look at it when you get to that spot and they pick up their dribble and youre that close Hands need to go straight up in the air and theyre looking to see whether its a two or a three and it is a three They confirmed it So three shots here for Younger Well see Allan Breed gets stuck gets stuck out on an island and I you know what Younger extends forward too So Im not sure I really love that call but you got to put your hand straight up cheering cheering Younger is going to get one more Sunday afternoon on the ACC Network Weve got womens basketball double header Jacksonville Georgia Tech at 3 then Indiana at Florida State at 5 That comes your way on Sunday right here here on the ACC Network on the ESPN app Florida State Indiana Florida State 31 Indiana 3 and 0 to start off this season See if this game can loosen up a little bit Weve had 19 foul calls correct And 30 free throws taken Copeland kicks it McNeel for three Weve also had a player for each team being fouled shooting a three Weve had a technical on Copeland for NC State And then one on Trey Hollowerman And they tossed him from the game for NC State from an earlier skirmish And theres a lot of fouls Was at 20 fouls now cheering combined to go along with whats about to be 32 free throws cheering College Hoops is back laughter Oh my goodness Well you know what its we were talking earlier about like the new rule changes where for a fans reference now any out of bounds play has to be challen if you wanted to to look at it has to be challenged by the coaching staff and you get a challenge and if you get it right you get one more final challenge If you dont you lose a timeout Anytime now Gage youre saying Oh review out of bounds It has to be a coachs challenge even in the last two minutes of the game anymore Its not The referees cannot needed it Copeland NC State needed it I NEEDED IT MORE MY GOODNESS COPELAND he hits the three Hes tough to guard and hes got nine points here And a foul called on Copeland Thats the second What I was about to get at is that once you start it youre in kind of that mode Lets go back to the three first I like it Face up hand down man down As a wise man once said Copeland if he hits the three that opens up his game because hes so good off the bounce Its really tough to defend Hes got good size good length and he never stops talking Even to the officials even to Will Wade to his teammates I dubbed him the microphone a couple of years ago Checks out Yes he does Thats three fouls on Copin now actually cuz he had the tactical and the fact that Trey Hollerman got ejected earlier in the game This is tough sledding with Alan Breed who hasnt played much now at the point guard spot going to really be relying on him today And its a fourpoint game here 3430 with under five minutes to go in the first half And Breed brings it up Luben almost got it stolen away cheering Williams Nice So calm so composed so collected And a foul My gosh thats enough Its on Ven Allen Wuben Thats his second Welcome to the ref show Thats 12 fouls now on NC State here in this game Lets take another look at it cuz I love whistles being blown Look Vin Allen Luben comes over Youngers off balance Yeah he he pushed him out I mean thats I I I know I know theres been a lot of Mike thats a whole bunch of nothing Im off balance I have the ball over my head That is a bailout call by this officiating crew thats been full of them so far Like if youre going to come in youre playing at NC State in the Lenovo This is big time basketball and for it to be thrown to a halt cheering the way it has been my goodness Its a little frustrating obviously because some of the great players here are out of this game dealing with foul trouble right now You got three on Copeland You got three on Dang for NC State Heres a three Thats good Mcel does it again so good at swinging his ri hips around to get his shoulders square and he elevates Hes got to be 10 ft off I I mean his hands have got to be more than 10 ft off the ground whenever he releases He is knocking down the threes here Hes three of six from threepoint range 10 of 21 so far for the season Fight for the miss and Williams has it for the World Cat Breed to the hole Come on Allan Breed cheering Seldom used never forgotten sped up right Never sped up And here here are his appearances last year I mean just such a good player applause Yeah And the one thing about you know what hes been able to do like you said where its its not sped up Craig Hamill there sports information director weve talked to helped us getting ready for these games He said you know someone said it looks like hes playing chess out there and the other nine players are playing check Thats exactly right And that also comes along the line Tough move That also comes with applause being an older guy whos been in college for a long time A nice move by Benedo going baseline drawing the foul cheering And I think the first thing that everybody kind of points to you were talking about the challenge earlier If you watch NBA games they can challenge foul calls and anything not available in the college game Obviously a big portion of that Mike you did such a good job of explaining to me because I was I talked to several different people in officiating trying to understand these rule applause what you could and couldnt challenge and at what points of game you could or couldnt Yeah its a its a little confusing to say the least And obviously the reason is a threepointer is no good by McNeel The reason for it was to try to speed up the games a little bit toward the end and all the reviews But see were in disagreement about this We talked about this before the game I I I think for the most part another one For the most part the officials on out of bounds calls getting called out So if you want to if you want to review it go ahead and challenge the play and thats fine You see Neely man he is so strong And thats a foul Thats definitely a foul And what has to you know be tough here for the fans because theyve all been incited I guess as well how many calls there have been tonight Theyre just going to start screaming no matter what it is even if it is correct which it was It was definitely a foul uh on that play But I know what youre saying Its It certainly brings the game to a little bit more of a a standill That is our 24th foul of this first half Its been a lot You know the crazy part about this whole thing is is you look at the stats and NC State really 45 from the field 36 from three only one turnover but because its been slowed down to a crawl its made it really difficult Williams three and its intercepted by Williams McNeel had a steam so athletic Paul McNeel Paul McNeel Jr You see him knocking it down from the perimeter You see the athleticism in the open floor too Neely kicks it out Marvel Thats a three Thats no good And Williams another rebound Hes got eight tonight with nine points Ael and Bonedo grabs the rebound Interesting to see how they can get Donald Whitehead Jr in a position to score send a ball screen up to him Hes been the guy that UNCCGs been able to rely upon to get a shot Well you called it He got it and then had to push it back out on the drive here Marville No Rebound at C State Sonia applause Ael fouled Theyre going to give him free throws right here And that is another point of this year they do get the extra step if theyre gathering to get in a shooting motion As you see foul right there One two Thats Well heres the thing Uh theyre over the double Thats true Thats true It doesnt matter They did wave two as soon as he was fouled though Thats the only reason I No I know what youre saying Youre wondering was that would have been an actual shooting foul or would it have been on the floor But its two free throws nonetheless for right now But I know what youre saying They call the foul on Clinton Aphinda Hes got three for UNCCG number two applause And now all of a sudden NC State has built up a 13point lead adding to their largest of the night Its Nolan Nargo from Denmark Number six whos in cheering has it Nargo back out to the outside Neely kicks it Margo for three Its good Danish national He can do that Threepoint shooter Just a freshman Went to high school in Spain and comes over Hes big time player They needed that one for their last eight Ael air balls it here for NC State And that was saved from going out by Younger and into the hands of Neely who was fouled cheering And then Neil number two See Norar drive to the middle by Neely He just turned into such a good passer My goodness Baseline drive Baseline drift Knock down But what a look on the baseline right here That is not an easy find cheering Norar is an interesting kid I I mean played in the FEMA U8 Division B Euro Basket Cup last summer was the MVP and made the AllStar five there This is a guy who can get hot in a hurry Threepoint shooter still adjusting to the speed of the college game but this is a guy who can really fill it up Yeah thats what he told me earlier today as well Terrence you said the speed and also the physicality uh that you have over here in the US as well Its an eightpoint game as NC State can hold for the final shot of the first half cheering 10 seconds to go Williams got it and a Heiho And thats the end of the first half Williams with that bucket now has 11 And thats three behind McNeel for the team high And the Wolfpack leaded by 10 I mean nice management at the clock at the end Books will lead to NC State trying to go to 3 and0 They got a 10point head NC State shot 44 in the first half UNCCG at 40 Heres Allen Breed They begin with Ael in as well The freshman number three is Williams drives in gets the runner has done that all night He is 6 for 11 with 12 points I like the offensive set coming out of the half opening it up on the right side of the floor getting him his to his strong hand Nice finish off the glass Williams also has eight rebounds in this game for the Wolfpack as well applause and cheering Good defensive possession I like the energy High hands NC State understanding the first four minutes of this second half incredibly important not just for them but UNCCG trying to keep their confidence up after playing really well in the first On the runner is Whitehead It doesnt go Lubens got the rebound applause You got Luben staying in front of a smaller Whitehead Thats not an easy pass Williams back to Luben Now back to Williams Minute gone by Second half Williams to Ael Thats a three Its in and out Foul on the rebound on Van Allen Lub Thats third UNCCG led this game 26 24 and theyve been outscored 251 since then If Im Matt Able and I catch that ball in the corner like that cheering and applause Younger fouled on his way in What were you thinking Well I think on the other side fans visibly frustrated on the other side Darren Williams makes a nice pass Baseline drive baseline drift Ael catches it so far above his head Thats one as a freshman like go ahead and give that ball up Thats a really hard shot to catch it above your head and cut back down cheering Darien Williams was called for a second personal foul for NC State KJ Younger the true freshman from Matthews North Carolina Neil tracks down the offensive rebound Younger for three and McNeel cheering skies in for that one Hes got four boards tonight Out of bounds on the sideline was able that time I like the pace though Push it up Nice crosscourt pass then the hit ahead Youre trying to play with a little bit more rhythm Younger a trap and a traveling violation But again like applause youre going to turn the basketball over Those things are going to happen If youre UNCCG youre okay with this one right Dead ball turnover set your defense Youve guarded fairly well first few possessions of this half Make sure this games at a crawl Seven total turnovers for UNCCG Two for NC State Inside bucket scored by Musa Sier A nice job coming off a downstream Paul McNeel understanding theyre tucking and tailing now that he hit hit a couple of threes Curls it Finds the open man Harville Wow How about that Fade away with contact Really tough shot Goes baseline Bounces back able to hit the tough floater Terrence you keep looking up here and UNCCG is still in this game Thats exactly right They just hang around and its because of the toughness plays The rebound on the off on the free throw Thats something theyre going to rely upon Thats a tough look Mcneel in a step back Three doesnt go And now Neely has it And a chance to go back into single digits with a bucket here Good ball reversal here as Whitehead puts up a three Its no good And that is out of bounds off of NC State My focus right now if I were the Wolfpack you have to finish possessions because theyre getting to spots Theyre making him shoot have tough looks Finish a possession with a defensive rebound Then you can get out and run a little bit UNCCG crashing the glass with at least four on some possessions have finished the job Well UNCCG didnt have any offensive rebounds They got three now here in the second half as Whitehead drains a three Youve been calling for it all night Terrence They still will not get on him And thats a killer Matt Ael completely lost track of where the ball was at And Whitehead just lined it up and fired And Williams comes back for the three applause Trying to fire up the troops here Hes got 15 points cheering Whitehead cheering Marville turns it into a road block and that ball hit the baseline out of bounds applause Both teams basket starting to open up a little bit on one side Ball reversal Sure Whitehead hes able to find one Able completely turned his head And then Darren William Darien Williams excuse me just so calm cool and collected Knocks it through Look at the microphone over there letting everybody hear about it Theyre a little jawing back and forth Maybe he was telling him Will you put up a three And hes like I did There you go All right we got it Hes like Thats what Im talking about Williams this cheering time He doesnt go Rebound by Neely Crowd wanted a foul Its an 11point lead for the Wolfpack Were coming up on 16 minutes to go in the game cheering The eight there by Williams cheering Five to shoot No And foul and a rebound on UNCC Greensboro applause They call it on Neely and we will return Four minutes gone by in the second half Its an 11point advantage for NC State at NC State Well said And uh he really does feel hes got that ability And I think with this level of talent now in the conference this year as this threepointer goes up thats off by McNeel with an offensive rebound back to Williams for three That ones good applause Love competition and players in this conference is a lot better this year Terrence in the ACC Absolutely it is Yeah sure did Double dribble and you alluded to it man Off an offensive rebound Thats the best time to get a threepoint look The defense is all inside the paint He walks into it lines it up forget about it Eight out of the 10 points for NC State does Darien Williams have hes been really good Hey a lot of it You said a more competitive ACC all the coaching changes Only good news uh for all four changes in the league I mean I know well talk about it as this second half goes along but I I mean a lot of optimism about the league nationally as far as who was brought in new the recruiting the uptick in recruiting the players I mean its an exciting time in this league and its going to be a really fun season Hedo kicks in Its a three ball that is no good And rebound NC State off of the offender miss I think you had also told me earlier its the year of the freshman It so many talented freshman It absolutely is and theres a few of them in this game Sier one of them applause and cheering The freshman scores it Very skilled big man I mean 22 years old He played professional basketball Okay Overseas now coming here So hes got experience Played for Manres Manresa which is right outside of Barcelona known as a known as a professional team with a lot of young players applause Sier I mean his ability to put it on the deck from the perimeter stands out You see him he catches it in the corner ball fake drives almost loses his balance but such a good athlete able to finish Hes a guy professional basketball in the ACB the top level in Spain I mean he he has that experience How about that for the moves there from the corner Hes also capable of shooting that ball like you said a threepointer but then to be able to get in there on that drive at 610 235 cheering That was impressive Last four years as you said over in Spain so far And if you make the team at at Manresesa that means youre looked at in the country of Spain as one of the next really good players So what happens is Real Madrid and Barcelona theyll sign these highle young players They will loan them out and Manresa is usually a team that gets those players because of the proximity to Barcelona one and two theyve just developed such a reputation for being developmental teams and hes showing why And Darren Whiskey getting wide open and hes knocking him down That is his third three of the night Hes got 21 points and its now the largest lead of the night for NC State at 17 applause You You cant leave that guy that wide open I mean he is making them pay I mean this is not very good scouting report defense that need you need to stay a little bit longer if youre number 24 Landon King Help the helper is needed against Arian Williams Tough cheering air ball and the three there by Whitehead applause cheering How about Jerry Deng getting out and contesting the smaller Whitehead We talked about the switchability of the NC State front court like showing dividends right now cheering NC State theyve gone nine deep in this game tonight We were told that Terrence Arsenal probably not going to see the court dealing with an injury So he is out as driving cheering in is Copeland for the two and its now a 19point lead When Copelands not in foul trouble hes played pretty well today Attacking the rim finding teammates Im a big fan of what he is And the NC State all over my guy Whitehead cheering and an offensive foul on Whitehead applause I think the size finally starting to play a role is seven You know right now you look at the the players on the floor Allan Breed stands about 63 Hes the smallest guy on the floor for the Wolfpack right now Called a foul on Neely actually on the offensive foul there And now Williams trying to go on the cut looking for Deng and he got fouled applause And UNCCGs done a nice job Theyre switching that first back door and then keeping the guys to slide up And for the most part Whiteheads done a nice job of getting there and getting hands on the ball or steel So that one was on Whitehead 19point lead here for the Wolfpacks Seven minutes gone by second half Williams game high 21 Another tough fade away He hit one earlier though and thats tapped out by Sier and into the hands of Neie cheering Neies quietly put together a nice little statline Nine points 12 boards This is Landon King for three and he hits it They just hang around dont they They just continue to play Now NC States pushed it out to 16 points Sure But it seems like every possession the Spartans just continue to compete If youre Mike Jones you have to be really happy with some of those Oh spit cycle cheering Copelan and hes got 13 on five of six from the field He rocks you to sleep and then he explodes to the rim Look at the points in the paint ter Thats a massive differential cheering UNCCG in the first half not got a lot of jump shots screaming cheering and free throws Another three up by King Thats no good Its NC State ball when we come back Copeland does a lot on the floor Rocks you to sleep Quick explosion and a little spin to the cup A really nice team there at the Commonwealth Auburn at Auburn for the ACC SEC challenge Steven Pearl now the head coach there Bruces kid Liberty always tough And then Kansas and at Old Miss those are not easy games Some high level coaching matchups Well youre talking about that VCU and the uh staff that we talked about with these two coaches Coach Jones and Will Wade were assistants on that staff McNeel how about he was really sparked with the help of assistant coach Brett Nelson who is now at DCU and he told him he had started helping him in January and really starting to get his game going again And thats where he took off toward the end of last year and into the early part of this season where he goes from averaging four points a game to 17 Hes got 14 tonight And Brett Nelson a pretty good player in his own right Played at Florida with Petty Dupe and Udonis That was a good team No doubt Yeah So you want to learn shooting from a go to Brett Nelson The coaching circle right You know in college basketball I mean you know youve been around you do all these games these teams Its pretty crazy right How it all comes back around and who you know they call it the coaching fraternity man And like if one guy has success at a spot like Will had success at BCU like people hes around are going to get those shots as well He got he gets the job because he was good with Shaka Smart right So like its amazing how all these things work Yeah All those assistants you know head coaches Mike Rhodess from Penn State now cheering You know whats crazy is the NC States up 20 but its been a methodical possession by possession by possession Like we need to start getting stops We need to run good offense We need to get our best player the ball in some advantageous spots And it just kind of builds on itself Nice play Deng for three Got it nothing but net after he was called for the foul the other end He drains a three and its 7148 And what an unselfish play by Darren Williams who in this second half has played really well shooting the basketball applause foul on Sier but terrific job D who gets rewarded for the steal You got the pass back to Daren Williams whos feeling himself Good shot for a great shot that ends up on the left 45 Jerry Dang he can do that He can knock down threes off the catch He gets rewarded for the good defensive play 19 threes in the first game for NC State 10 in the last game in the win over UAB Theyve had eight here tonight Eight of 20 As Whitehead has another Whiteheads got 18 points in this game That leads all scores for UNCCG the only player in double figures right now for them Hes been pretty efficient which isnt easy to do You know you look at his size listen at 510 I would say closer to 58 59 Just so quick off the bounce creates contact just enough to get the foul call Hes at the free throw line Not able to knock it through Oh hes been good Hes five for 11 from the field to your point The rest of the team is six of 19 applause on younger brother Hes on younger this foul Quadir Copeland he smells blood and water right now You see him taking the ball up Hes eyeballing the defense Theres a different sort of assertiveness with him right now He has it on the kick for McNeel and now Danny another three almost Sier offensive board of the stick back applause My goodness explodes off the floor Good athleticism Six points and six rebounds for him 12 second chance points for NC State in this game and the seven offensive rebounds as you see on your screen Heres Whitehead double team back out to Marville Three ball no good by Mian Another three Whitehead That is good cheering The air ball chance dont bother Whitehead at least do they Theyre all over them you know and its one of those things where this is cheering where you know its tough these days right in college basketball because everybody moves everywhere But I remember some games and some places where a guy might have done that one year and then when his team came back the next year the fans remember that and they were just booing him again cheering like the whole time And thats a nice drive there by Jones Good strong finish by Jones Good verticality on the other side OF THAT DENG FOR THE BASKET AND THE FOUL applause cheering Two hand ones here in this second half Dangs been assertive on the offensive side of the ball You get out and you run a little bit Sweeps goes through goes into the chest of the defender Pedo hands down Foul call Deng played pretty well in the second half Shows how he can move the ball and how he can stretch the floor And hes certainly a mismatch because he can knock down the three Hes taking you off the dribble And thats at 69 230 He has some talent Started his college career at Hampton Goes down to Florida State Terrific catch and shoot guy there Hes got good size and athleticism Can guard Offensive rebound here on the miss That was by Sier Now a three ball on the way MCNEEL HE STEPS right into it Offensive rebounds leading to open threes And McNeel to me sometimes he can get to standing straight up whenever hes catching the ball in a catch and shoot Another cheering steal Things getting sloppy This game starting to open up a little bit Not good for the Spartans cheering applause cheering scoring barrage here for NC State The lead is now 26 Total points in the first two games most since the 9091 season when they had scored 255 in the first two games but its been an onslaught here in this one too 114 they scored in game one 94 in the last game on Friday against UAB And theyve got 80 so far here tonight with another eight and a half still to go And I I Ill be honest with you Mike I think cheering this game has been the most impressive because theyve had to do it methodically It hasnt been like these giant you know eightpoint bursts in 40 seconds Like theyve had to stack possessions and stack possessions NC State playing really well Nice pass Whitehead three ball In and out What about NC States ability to put up all these points Okay Throughout the first three games what are you seeing here as McNeel puts up another three about defensively for these opponents I get it They love all competition at times but applause theyre about to score over 300 points in three games cheering I I mean its pretty incredible really And you know the thing that Ive learned from playing NC State you better not go under ball screens because it its its happened time and time again where UNCCG has got caught going under trying to protect the paint and NC States just done a nice job of taking what the defense giving him not making it too complicated Dang on the block McNeel fouled from behind on the pass from Ael applause and it takes us to a timeout Its a 10 nothing run over two minutes for NC State They lead big time here and its a big deal for him and he feels like hes kind of that glue guy right for this team and hes showing it Uh they call him Q I call him the microphone because its never stopped and he you know I called a Syracuse game a couple of seasons ago and he didnt stop talking the entire shoot around and he was a freshman So at some point they were running I was wondering is this guy going to run out of energy today Same exact thing same exact energy same cheering enthusiasm Hes an everyday guy And we talked to Will Were like Man hes got to be a pleasure to coach as a point guard He goes Well sometimes laughter He said Sometimes Because they it never shuts off the ball Now Copeland here guarding Offenda Ball knocked away Heres Williams to McNeel On time and on target Nice pass and McNeel Sweet finish 24 for McNeel Williams has 23 Copelands got 13 Those two those three themselves have outscored UNCC Greensboro tonight Nargo Neil for three The lid the lid has been closed on that end of the floor First half Greensboro just knocking down shots Second the defensive intensity turned up to a different level Theyre all for their last four Yeah 14 nothing run Make it 17 nothing as Williams smiles on his fourth three of the night Paul McNeel said Hey man Im open too Hey you let that man cook the way hes been playing Its a duel between those two back and forth cuz its 26 for Williams down 24 from McNeel A block by him from behind and then back down on the other end Williams with a terrific straight up contest And a lot of times like youre not going to block the shot if youre the primary defender Its got to be that secondary guy Perfect example right there Mcneel coming back and blocking from the blind side as Copeland checks out of the game applause and cheering and uh he wants to get in one of our seats in the future Hes a communications major He said broadcasting might be something for him down the line Pauls done right I could see it Well I mean he never stops talking I never stopped talking laughter Here we are But yeah you could see the energy and uh you know hes one of those guys where they say Oh you love him if hes on your team and you hate him if hes not Right Yeah Cuz he can get into it with you And sometimes you hate him if you are on the same team laughter applause and cheering But I think the big point if youre going to be a quality leader like cheering youre not going to be liked all the time because you got to address tough topics Just give him another look What are we doing My man is cooking Five of seven from threepoint rays now with 29 And NC State has scored 301 points already in two games two and a three4er games right now I mean wow And hes just walking into him And the thing is its you know UNCCGs running back to get in the paint and try to protect you If youre cheering going to switch you have to switch aggressively And thats Pedo who has not played a lot of basketball This is his first game of the season If youre going to go fiveman switch on a shooting four you have to get up aggressively or else hes just walking into it Thats target practice Totally five of seven for him five for 11 for McNeel Those two have hit 10 of the 12 NC State threepointers Heres Ael and the kick out Another one Another one is right OH MAN Darien Williams with 32 and six of eight from threepoint range Standing ovation and welld deserved applause applause 32 points for a career high cheering applause Well can they score 75 points in another 4 minutes and 30 37 seconds That would be the record But they got cheering 304 through the three games so far here tonight Next point puts him in sole possession of second place since 1990 for the most points in three games And a bucket here by KJ Young Hey small thing I appreciate how Will Wade leaves him in to get 30 with 32 and then tanks him out of the game I was I was gonna say when is he coming out That was uh the last were going to see in Williams Heres Ael for three That ones good Mike Cory when it rains it pours applause 14 threes tonight cheering And uh in terms of scouting report like you said if youre not getting on the threepoint shooters against this NC State team youre in trouble I mean theyve now hit applause 43pointers this season applause Official timeout the top 25 year after year after year for average attendance and the program this year right you know Will Wade comes in and the excitement here they sold 1032 season tickets the most since the 201617 season where they had just over 11000 I mean that that tells you what this fan base is all about number one and that its a loyal fan like this is going to be a really good year and they have some toughness about it You you talk about continuing to show up even when times were hard right I I mean this is a passionate fan base and Will made a great point to me earlier this season or cheering not this season but earlier this fall he was like you know in the city of Raleigh its NC State North Carolina then Duke in the state its North Carolina NC State and Duke nationally its Duke North Carolina NC laughter State so the city according to Will Wade okay is all about some NC basketball Thats pretty good Three ball up no good from Nargo And its backed out for another three And that one is good by Assan Madam Lets talk UNCG and uh thoughts with these guys Now theyre going to drop to 0 and3 They need to keep playing first and foremost and theyre going to have to guard the three somehow because were at a buck 02 better than tonight And the Wolfpack are are shooting 50 from three So thats not going to do it in a league in the Southern Conference where quite frankly I started broadcasting was in the Silicon That league offensively is really good and theres a lot of shooting and theres a lot of really good coaching You got to guard the three ball Agreed Heres a steal Dang Showtime cheering applause Soons actually around the number 12 13 best conferences in the country out of the 31 You know what I mean Thats good competition there for sure And youre right Coach Jones and company have to get back and regroup And for NC State another 100 plus 107 now as McNeel whats he still doing in the game made a new career applause 27 for McLeal cheering What a way to end the night applause Jerry Dane gets out in transition Nice look ahead cheering Open lane cleared for takeoff Next possession a little side step Paul McNeel take as many steps as he likes and will ever the confidence giving coach has Paul McNeel Jr looking like a new man this season No doubt Pass Oh no cheering applause 61 points for Paul McNeel here in this early part of the season A steal for Younger Fouled by Ael on his way in applause Yeah Terrence one other thing too that was just the fourth turnover by NC State in terms of this kind of rough and tumble game that weve had here tonight Its been really physical and in the second half the game loosened up not as many foul calls and you could see how theyre willing to jump in and embrace those things despite at cheering times being undersized at the five position but you see the physicality on the perimeter defense when they switch They switch with power cheering and that changes things And Ill say this you know I played in the ACC 2 years I used to love coming and playing here and looking behind the goals when you shoot free throws Morgan Freemans back there We got bricks like actual bricks I I mean just the creativity of the of the student section Like this is why you love college basketball Its not just to play on the floor Look

getting out and guarding at a higher level You know Donald Whitehead Jr for UNCCG got loose in the first half They took that challenge personally and shut him down cheering They did This NC State team man theyre dangerous especially if they shoot it like they did today And thats it Dominating performance by the Wolfpacks 110 to 64
