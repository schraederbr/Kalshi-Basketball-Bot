our three officials Its a Bay Area Virginia double header We got Cal and UVA later but right now Stamford and Virginia Tech just the fourth ever meeting between these two programs Neo of Dallas the freshman point guard from Greece runs this Hokei offense after a disappointing threepoint loss at Wake Forest on Saturday of Dallass first shot rattles in the score This guy hopes to score Thats what he does experienced European players and theres a lot of them over here this year and they made a big difference in college basketball Stanford coming off a really phenomenal phenomenal performance after a miserable ACC opener when which they only scored 40 against Notre Dame They doubled that offensive output in an 8076 win over Louisville which really speaks to the Cardinals ceiling Straightaway three Chisum Aara cant connect rebound Jaylen Bedford And each team has started the game in the mantoman And Stanford they rely just a little bit more heavily on the threepoint shot than does Virginia Tech although neither one shoots an excessive amount of three Stanford wants to get into the lane and get to the free throw line Bedford rising up Offensive rebound Stick back for Hanssbury Rims out cheering but another offensive opportunity here until Benford turns it over And a foul Thats a European foul right there The fast break Lets take him out of there Give him the ball out of bounds Thats what they do in Europe all the time in any of those transition situations The foul was called on Jaden Shoot whos from Yorkville Illinois But your point stands Mike Young in his seventh season He watches TV too Jim with guys like you stepping aside Mikes now the third longest tenure head coach in the ACC if you can believe that That guy wins every year Whos that guy at Indiana football He says I win Well thats what Mike Young does I He wins wherever hes been Long time at Wford created a SoCon powerhouse in Spartanberg South Carolina And thats an ugly pass from Oscar Hell take and thats going to be a problem for Stanford because they use a lot of high screens and Aorei is going to try to go off the screen and when he does his other players have to help him out That time he threw the ball to Hilte Hilte didnt even try to score and he threw the ball away Well it was it was a good pass There was just nobody there Was that Yeah thats what I I made a lot of those passes Threw it with purpose Just misplaced purpose of Dallas to Hansbury looking inside for Gerdak And its knocked away by Agarwal and the Cardinal take over Stanford as a very good defensive team They force a lot of turnovers Virginia Techs been one of the best throughout the season in taking care of the basketball except for Saturday Theres Ibuka Aorei getting started early knocking down the triple And thats a great sign for Stanford because Aorei hes an adequate threepoint shooter not a great one And so hes got to feel good that that first one went in At least 25 points in seven games already this year for Orai Hanssbury misses again close to the rim Pretty good defense there from Apara Well you see they jump right out off that screen Theyre trying to get the ball out of his hands Oar going to work on Hanssbury this time Chisum too strong off the glass Rebound controlled by Heilte going right back over Gerak No good Ahead Jaden Shu blocked by Agriall Pretty good defensive intensity in these opening minutes Good defensive teams You know shoot you get the ball youre a shooter Thats who he is a shooter You got to look at the guy coming pump fake to get a wide open shot Kyle Smith in year two having a laugh with Jim Shaw When I walked into Castle Coliseum today before the game I saw Jim Shaw sitting in Mike Youngs seat eating popcorn the way Mike Young used to court side Shoot inside the ark Shot clock at seven for the driving Bedford And again it rims out Second chance swatted away by Hilte Some really good defensive plays early here for Stanford Hookies have missed their last seven shots and a couple of them have been from close range Not uncontested but real close to the goal Hell tay to the basket Wow Theres a guy that got going with his defense and now turned it over on the offensive end and said Here I come a freshman from Belgium with a loud two as Geler gets called for the reachin foul on Dallas Well hell has only made thats his 20th field goal make of the year and todays his 15th game Yeah Heres Toby Lau His first appearance since late November and the Hokes are happy to have him back I always like to start a guy when he was coming back and hes been a starter but everybody does it a little bit differently He looked good in warmups and today he averaged over 30 minutes a game in his first six games of the season Average a double double as well About 13 and 10 See what he can do after the long layoff This is Hansberry Hansberry is now 0 for three You know Mike Young has no problem with them shooting threes but they got to move the defense around a little bit so they can create some better offensive rebounding opportunities Jeremy Den Smith into the game as well And he turns it over And who tipped that one away It was Lal And now Lals got a mismatch inside Shoot Unrecognized He goes to work Heres Lal scouting for the offensive board Toby Lwal is back Well if theyre not going to throw it to him hes going to go get it himself They like having this guy back here laughter Reminding any Virginia Tech fan who may have forgotten hes got incredible athleticism Heres Akara And the horn sounds as Aara was driving They play on That was in the stands maybe I think now theyre going to stop The shot clock stopped So the clock issue and well get a time out How about the freshman from Belgium Oscar Hilte detonating early but to way And what happened was there in the right hand right hand corner you can see the clock stops So the referees are now trying to figure out how long its been stopped And this is a situation where when that happens and theres a play going on you dont blow the horn you wait till the plays over but the horn blew And so because the horn blew the officials didnt really have any choice but to stop the game And so what theyre trying to figure out now you saw the clock stop with 1507 And we played a long time before they stopped the game You say you want to let the play unfold but at some point they need to recognize that theres no shot clock anymore and the play does need to stop right No When the clock grows I think they have to stop the game there because otherwise you have no idea what 36 laughter Hes a good player Really good player Hes been Hes off to a great start All right so my math is off here Shocking All right theyve reset the shot clock to 16 1452 on the game clock The ball bounced off the rim so they had to figure that out too Hopefully its not an issue again A Cororey misses the three and the rebound ripped down by Hansbury But you can see the pressure Virginia Tech is trying to put on Aorei to force him to give up the ball His teammates particularly his big guys are going to have to be able to score inside AJ Roi into the game for Stanford Kaden shoot rise and fire knocks down the three Thats the shot theyre looking for over there This he can shoot it and when he gets open looks he makes by 13 to Agarwal who hit four threes in the win over Louisville But thats what Agar wall wants to do is shoot the three He doesnt want to drive to the basket Referees look at each other Tokei basketball When Agarwal has a shot thats open in the corner I think the Stanford offense really requires that he take that shot But you notice Jim Rahosi rolled down the middle of the lane They didnt look for him Well and then when you drive from that corner theyve got too much help there Youre not going to the basket against this team Neither team Theyre cheering both good defensively Your secondary defender Well last Wednesday here at Castle Hokes a triple overtime win over Virginia Just an incredible basketball game and Virginia Tech dominating in the third OT period They did it without Lal and Tobys going to have a couple hiccups like that in his return to the lineup probably hadnt played since November and so its one thing you practice and you know you participated in the shoot around this morning but getting out there and actually playing in a game is a different deal Hokeis still among the best teams in the country in turnovers despite having a season high 19 at Wake Forest on Saturday and the reach and foul goes against Ben Hammond Virginia Tech number three Ben H Thats his first Hammond was certainly pretty hot the last time he played in this gym Really good 30 against Virginia That was a crazy game Looked like Virginia Tech had one and then he got away but then they got it back A par burrows underneath and again two strong off the rim Cardinal only one field goal in the last four plus minutes and theyve missed some close ones too Again not uncontested but theyve missed him right up against the basket The wall will take it Whats going on with these rims tonight gentlemen I dont think theres anything going on with the rim Theres something going on with the guy shooting the ball and I think the defense has something to do with that This is a tough matchup for Lal coming back from an injury Is that something Stanford can look to exploit cheering region foul on Gerak The answer to that question is yes but theyre not going to just try to exploit Lwal because Hawkar is looking to be aggressive every time he gets the ball Again nobody coming to help because theyre worried about Stanfords threepoint shooters And Gerach you know hes played really well as a freshman but he shouldnt have to help out against Rahosi Mal back to the bench after just about three minutes on the floor Aiden Camman into the game Goes right at Gerak Rebound controlled by Hanssberry Stanfords best offensive options are not inside Now Dallas on the drive loops it around Same spot for Jaden Shoot He knocks in another Thats the guy you want to get open Looks for Thats what Virginia Tech is doing Find him shoot and hes going to make those shots Not everybody can make that pass though Thats a great pass Agarwal misses his first look tonight Offensive rebound sets up Dent Smith for the reload Third chance Nothing doing for the Cardinal Wow Stanfords missed its last eight shots on the offensive glass Hanssbury kicks it Now you got to make sure you stay in front of Hammond He can kill you driving into the lane Have Dallas playing physical over D Smith taking charge Too big Too big Have Dallas that beautiful assist Hes also scored four points Benny Geler comes up shooting out of the timeout and Hansbury secures his seventh rebound in the opening nine minutes Hansbury hadnt scored yet though and that scoreless stretch continues as he turns it over for the second time Aiden Cam with a loud two to snap to Stanford Skid Well Hansbury fell down Couldnt get back in time And Hansbury doesnt need to drive the ball to the basket Hes a good midrange shooter and he can shoot that little one right at the ACC logo Now Dallas is a size mismatch against most guys that try to guard him from the guard position over Geler for two more Hes too big for the guards when she gets him down there Well Geler is only 61 so hes got an 8 in height advantage They started Aggerwall on him and Aggerwall is almost his size But Virginia Tech doing a nice job moving the ball moving players Theyve created that mismatch Only seven points in the first 10 minutes though for the Cardinal Performance more reminiscent of the Notre Dame game than the Louisville game Agarwal tough turnaround goes over Abdales Really good offensive play Theyre work Virginia Tech is making Stanford work really hard to get any shot Yeah if those Thats a nice shot But if those are the kind of shots youre going to be forced to take your percentage is not going to be very high Hanssbury puts it on the floor again brings it back out Stanford with Aara and Aorei both on the bench right now Bedford coming off the best scoring game of his hokey career This is his first lefthanded shot of the night Geler circles the wagons Guarded by the much bigger of Dallas Should be hard to shoot over him Aggerwall Not that time Pokeball Stanford Number two Well Stanford does a great job getting the ball up the court quickly Camman number 52 is open because Hansbury 13 fell down and then this is just I mean thats a great offensive play against a guy whos a couple inches taller Im not going to make a lot of laughter Cory and Apar are both in I I want to ask you Dan when you watch Danford vers Notre Dame and then three days later watch them do what they did to Louisville what what does that say to you Well it says to me first of all that Akari and uh Aorei and Akara adjusted pretty well but it also says that Louisville plays at a much faster pace and this is more of a tempo like that Notre Dame game Virginia Tech making it really tough in the half court Nice pass and thats a high percentage look there for Hansbury Defenses always start out better and as the game progresses offenses usually get better Thats what usually happens Why is that Its just defense The way defenses are a good open look An open look Shooting 43 from deep so far this season He shoots as well from three as he does from two Dont necessarily need to go for the steal there if youre Virginia Tech and leave him open Hammond called for the offensive foul The clear out Well he did hook him Thats his second foul Well Hammond has been such a key factor with his ability to drive the ball into the lane Geler does a really nice job staying in front and thats what you have to do And he does put that elbow out there but you cant let him get past you And Geler just does a great job Really took shot Thats what you have to do McCorys only taken two shots so far Hes one for two Both of them threepoint attempts Donovan Young in the game for Stanford Aara fouled by Lal Now Aara has not scored in this game yet and he and Okori score almost half of Stanfords points So those guys have to be productive about the arrival of James Franklin into town here in Blackburg And Stanford has a new football coach as well Tvita Pritchard brought in by Andrew Luck to resurrect the Stanford football tradition and Stanford needs to get to the free throw line They score a quarter of their points from the line Well Stanford has recalibrated after a stretch in which they didnt score for about five minutes Theyre back within two after trailing by as many as seven Well this is just a gritty grinding game And I think thats what youre going to see in the ACC all year long These are two pretty good teams Badford up and under lays it in Even though hell blocked a shot earlier in the game Stanford is not noted defensively for their shot block Another slam dunk at the rim for the Belgian freshman Oscar Heilte That was some That was some pass Really good pass to Cory Really good Hes not getting his shots yet but he made a great pass there After Stanford missed eight shots in a row theyre now four of their last five since I thought that ball really surprised Absolutely Bedford pressured by Aorei Tough shot Step back three in and out Guilt rises for the rebound Ibuka Okorei Hes just quick and slippery and hard to stay in front of He draws a lot of contact Didnt get the whistle that time though And Hansbury grabs his eighth rebound already That was really good defensive play by Hanssbury getting in there Jaden shoot pressure three off the front iron Yeah you have to get him off the spot Hes not as good a shooter on the move Geler Young Gilteara and Aorei Chisumara turned away by Toby Lau Not only did he have his shot block he lost his shoe Isaiah Pasha fouled on the flip trip Geler just picked up his second personal Lal blocks the shot and somehow it was with enough force that the shoe comes off This is the drive before where there it is right here Bedford Here we go Really good defensive play Well thats the thats what they miss not having the wall He is very bouncy Hes athletic Hes much stronger than you think And Aara thats his game be aggressive Drive to the basket Dallas triggers the inbound to Hansbury Six minutes to play here in the opening half Dallas coming off tough game at Wake Forest where he turned the ball over a lot early Hanssbury difficult shot Nothing but net Wow and three He only shoots 32 from out there And most of the time hes got to be wide open but that time that was a guy right in his face Yeah One of those shooters thats better with a hand in his face A Cororey Thats what he does Gets in those situations where he can get to the basket Thats where he makes them or gets fouled Hammond was playing with two fouls and was very careful not to pick up his third Off Dallas in and out rebound Hilte Hilte is doing a great job rebounding the ball and playing inside tonight Hes been a real factor for Stanford No doubt hes made his presence felt Guilts got eight rebounds to match Hansberry if you can believe it Apara lost it on the way to the rim Guilt Johnny on the spot in the corner Its Donovan Young and Lau rips down the board All five guys beyond the arc right now for Virginia Tech Out Dallas was open Buries the three spot up threes and shoot and the Dallas gets their open threes Thats the ones they need Not off the cheering dribble Pretty good contest there but Donovan Young scores anyway Thats what they have to do when they come out and basically double team ORI on that screen They got to make him pay Just the second basket of the season for Donovan Young And he also picks up early in the ACC slate Neo Abdales back to the free throw line He was two for five from the floor and a very strange performance on Saturday in Winston Salem Hes crisp so far tonight Four for five Looks like himself Takes advantage of his size down low and when hes open he can make the three really good with the ball and I think hes hell only get better in time Its a lot of these young guys are going to get better Theyre young players and theyre getting a lot of time and theyre going to continue to improve Neo 19 will turn 20 in February Hooks by six Agarwal overshoot Dallas grabs the rebound His first of the night Agarwal was four for four from beyond the ark against Louisville Different story tonight Another shot made by Abdales after the whistle Foul on Aara number Well hes just really hard to stay in front of And there was a little bit of contact there And its a little bit close to an offensive foul as much as a defensive foul He got her shoulder into Well throughout his childhood his favorite player to watch has been Luca Donuch And you see a little Luca in his game The way he navigates as a big guard the way he creates space for himself Hammond rises from 15 ft Theres the ninth rebound for the freshman from Belgium Oscar Heilte Seven different members of the Cardinal basketball team have scored cheering Thats going to be a illegal screen Offensive foul and ADM who looks befuddled by the call Well thats the way youre supposed to look when you get a foul called Every once in a while theres one of those calls and its just its a point of emphasis You know whether theres that much contact or not who knows But theyre going to call But its interesting with the two big guys swimming guys how many guys came over from Europe because of the upgrade in money from playing in Europe The young players over there get get 100000 Here they get 10 times that some Dallas doesnt get the bounce this time Rebound trickles to the corner where Okorei tracks it down That was a bit of a force I thought Aorei left hand No tip back up and in by Heil Hes got six points and 10 rebounds in the half Thats why when youre going to the basket like a Cory does just get it up there on the rim If you dont make it you give your teammate a chance to tip it up Yeah you force the big guy to come over and help out Kee continues to be a pest on the offensive glass Hes got at least one offensive rebound in 14 of Stanfords 15 games this season 14 of the 15 hes played I should say Hanssbury way off Geler will skip to his step into the fourth quarter Final two minutes of the first half For Stanford to be as close as they are with a Cory and Apara only having seven total points is a decent sign for Kyle Smith Well they did a great job did Virginia Tech that time keeping the ball out of the hands of a Cory up Dallas flips it inside Play by Geler Helpside defense on Geler just makes plays Heres Oara off the good screen and an air ball cheering Somebody opened a door It was windy earlier today Caught that one Thats not a good excuse Timeout Virginia Tech Time out 111 to play first half Mike Young takes his use it or lose it timeout with the Hookies leading by four music All on ACC Network on Dallas No look pass inside Gerac rejected from behind but the foul called on Agraal Evan that wasnt just a no look pass He looked the whole Virginia Tech Weve watched 19 minutes of basketball Jim what have been your primary impression so far Well right now the defense is over overtaking the offense It It sometimes takes a half I think the second half youll see a little different scoring from 50 points right now Theyll probably be 60 70 in the second half Stanfords got to figure out a way to get Apara and Aore going here But Virginia Techs done a great job staying in front of both of them until then Until then we jinxed him There he goes Well thats I mean hes looking to drive the ball So is Okorei About a 7second difference between the game and shot clock here Dallas 11 points two rebounds two assists You got to get as close as you can to the last shot and hope they dont get something quick down the court Dallas fortunate to get that pass to the corner Bford benies the three Stanfords got six seconds Plenty of time McCory in front of the Hokei bench off the side of the backboard No good Hokeis nine and0 this season Hasnt been able to get going Jim if you were Mike Young what would your message be to your team coming out of the locker room You want to keep your defensive intensity Thats what you want to do and play the same way Youre doing things you need to do but their defense is winning them this game right now Just play inside Gerdak picks up his second foul Well you you want to play aggressively but Im not sure that you got to be pushing against Heay like that Hes Hes had a really good game but hes not a big offensive threat inside Good Good Hes got some good wrestling moves He wanted to grapple a little bit Got good wrestling here in Blackburg Corner three Aara round and out Hes now 0 for three from deep but Heilte has been the story Incredible hustle Geler from super deep He may be the guy that made the toughest shot of the year to win a game for Stanford And he showed why right there Yeah that was the buzzer beater to beat St Louis off the missed free throw A miraculous win for the Cardinal over the Bilicans to the dismay of my uncle Joel who used to be a professor at St Louis University Hansberry turnaround hook goes He is so good when he can get down there and make that little turnaround hook shot but hes so good around the basket and in the midrange He starts that dribble move hes hard to stop Stanford coming into tonight hoping they could get a Cororey going like he did against Louisville Cardinal 2 and 0 in quad one games this year The St Louis win and then the Louisville win tonight A quad one opportunity road game against a top 75 net opponent for Stanford Both these teams 12 and three overall both one and one in the ACC winning over a top 25 opponent of Dallas Rebound tipped around Gerdak fouled cheering and itll stay with the Hokes Oscar Thats his Well hell has been everywhere tonight And that time he did a nice move by not coming up off his knees That would have been a travel but it was a nice pass out And heres Hanssbury He gets down inside and hes just too tough in there Thats a tough shot Tough midrange hook Dallas kicks it Hanssbury comes up short Gak keeps it alive again Bedford on the reload Apara has the rebound for Stanford McCory flips it inside Hell fouled by Hanssbury Number two turn 13 You know Hilte held his ground a little bit too long out there on that screen and by the time he was able to catch the ball the defense was came over to recover Nice idea by Okor Just the third free throw attempt of the game there for Stanford Oscar Heilte in the first half had 10 rebounds His third double digit rebounding game of the season Fans cheering are trying to come to life Its a little different when the students arent here though You miss both I misses both So they get Bacon Do they I think it might be only in the last 8 minutes Im not sure I think its in the right Oh we dont have bacon tonight Okay Oh bacon is only select games Why no bacon Well I think the fans are excited because they dont know that this isnt a select game Theyre expecting their bacon on their way out of Dallas I just dont know what you do against him if youre Stanford to match up with him sizewise Its tough when theyre a little on there Hes going to be good basketball in those Euro League games and so theyre veteran players coming And the fascinating nugget about up Dallas piece of trivia on him Hes the youngest player to score in a Euro League game He was called up during COVID because of injuries and some COVID cases He scored when he was 15 years old Say what did he score when he was 12 You know co was a while ago Well Luka was the MVP of the Euro League when he was about 16 or 17 Thats how good he was And is Jim have you been over to Europe and scouted some of those games in person ever I watch them all because my son plays over there and its really good basketball Really good Different men A Cororey could not convert and Gerak is fouled in the rebound action One of the biggest ways its different over there The biggest thing over there is how physical they are Thats the biggest thing Well now that time now that time Aorei was able to get into the lane but Virginia Tech did a great job covering him up without fouling Backs a good freshman Hes a tough tough kid and he gets rebounds in We got 19 against Virginia Yeah surpassing Mike Youngs wildest dreams Dallas just taking control and not giving it back Hes getting all the little guys down low and they cannot rub him First double digit lead of the game for Virginia Tech And Stanfords really in trouble here They just cant score Someone needs to change that for the Cardinal Pretty good defense by shooter cheering Say the same thing for Hanssbury on Aara Frustration foul there against Chisum Aara foul on number frustration I and if hes not scoring and Okoris not scoring where does Stanford find the offense to Lao back into the game played eight and a half minutes in the first half two points three rebounds one assist first game back since late November just nine better matchup down there against the bigger guys on Now theyre going to go the other way Hanssbury going at Young They did a great job there getting into that switch Second personal They charged the foul to championship team with neverbeforeseen footage Interviews with players and coaches All right here on ACCN and the ESPN app Gentlemen whats your one memory of the 1993 Tarheelss They scored they scored more points in the national championship game Was that the Chris Weber timeout I cant remember I think it might have been but uh North Carolina had a lot of good teams and that one got across the line So Stanford hadnt scored in a while Theyve only scored three points in the half Agarwal contested by Abdales See Abdales is down in the lane and Aarals got to get himself in better position so he can shoot the ball when its delivered But thats what thats what A Cororey wants to do Get down into the lane and get fouled third personal See theres no screen here And hes got an opportunity to just beat his man Hammond in a oneonone situation Hes hard to stay in front of First free throw attempt of the night for a guy that gets to the line a lot Hes number 12 in the country on free throw attempts 115 Hes got to get going for them to be in this game Hes got to get cheering there Theres plenty of time left and theyre only down by eight Its not like theyre out of the game Excuse me by 12 Its not like theyre out of the game cheering Stanford in their first year in the ACC went 119 led by Maxim Reno whos now in the NBA with Sacramento They were 9 and one at home in ACC games last year but you can do the math Their only road wins were at Cal and at North Carolina which stands out as the outlier Tough loss for the Tarheelss that night Its awfully hard for the California teams to come all the way to the East Coast Number 11 I mean no nobodys going to make any excuses but thats just thats just really really hard No they won two or three games I think one and two for Stanford and Cal Its hard to do UCLA has the same thing in the big 10 Southern Cal got bombed out twice this year at Michigan and Michigan State Tough to travel Now Dallas to Hansburys in on Rahosi and scores And Burrows in is exactly the way he plays on the inside He is a load in there Hes like a gopher just burrowing in Hes a gopher who can shoot there This tonight in uh Stanfords second true road game of the season Theres a three for Donovan Young Theyre counting on him to take a larger role after he missed the first 12 games coming off offseason surgery Yeah but the Virginia Tech defense doing a nice job cutting off Okore and then having guys play in the lane So youre going to have to make some outside shots And Hansbury Im telling you he is so strong He gets the ball inside He does a great job with his pivot foot All I think that time he might have moved it a little bit but traveling is a thing of the past 3 seconds in no longer basketball Seeing Hansbury make that too small logo remind me of the story about your son Buddy playing here and scoring what 16 18 straight points several years ago Straight He was given that too little to the sixoot guard And yet uh your big lead almost evaporated in that game Almost lost 16 or 18 by almost losing still counts as a win Trust me theyll take the wins Well while theres still plenty of time left in this game Stan Stanfords got to get moving offensively Hell take for two Well just set up two baskets a three in the corner and that one there And thats what hes doing Starting to be a little bit more aggressive Even if he doesnt score hes doing something The most active guy on the court tonights been Oscar Hete coming up with a steal there Accur from the elbow knocks it in A little momentum for the Cardinal Thats really a nice play Well thats what he just you know he got himself going with a couple foul shots Then he gets a couple passes assist really good assist Then he hits a jumper Thats what good players do A Dallas over two defenders No good And out of bounds to Stanford McCoy look theres three guys around him And he reed really does a nice job Drives him back cuz theyre worried about him getting to the to the the basket And then he steps back with that jump shot And its a sevenpoint game when it was 12 just like 30 seconds ago Poke into the back court by Pasha A Cori kicks it again Long two ro they call a three Say his feet were behind the line So Cory has all of a sudden brought the Cardinal back within four And we said they had to get moving and theyve moved So now lets see how Virginia Tech responds Dallas fouled by he tal He definitely behind the line behind Hes got three hes got three buckets two assists and changed the whole game Scored or assisted on Stanfords last 12 blocks Wow before that they really hadnt scored in the second half as you mentioned Thats what really good players do They get there when they need to be there I mean it looks like Virginia Tech is dominating this game and its a fourpoint Yeah Yeah If you didnt look at the scoreboard youd think it was much more than a fourpoint lead Well we saw Cameron Boozer put Duke on his back in the second half as hes done many times so far this year Its Aorei of Dallas and Boozer They are the threeman club ACC players who have scored 30 points multiple times this season Theyre really good Well Im really impressed with ADA He has created a number of mismatch problems for Stanford Long rebound out of bounds to the Cardinal Well and the guy who was out there knocking it out of bounds who nearly ran it down he really really plays hard and he goes after the basketball Coach Smith you got to be pretty happy right now You havent played well Your offense hasnt been good and youre right in this game and its really because of the freshman Kyle Smith said Last year we were astronauts doing something that nobodys done before coming cross country to play conference games this year He hopes that theyll have a little more toughness and resilience on the road Excellent defense though that time from the Hokes inside Hammond pulls it back out for Hansbury The lane opens up Hanssbury too strong So the late whistle is going to send Ammani to the line They get some openings and hes just really good at driving the ball to the basket Number 11 Ryan Thats his third number three on Agarwal down here Okuri made another great play and it should have been a bucket just couldnt quite handle it But thats the thing As well as Heilte has played tonight he has not been an offensive threat Stanford not really looking for him to be an offensive threat And so if youre the Virginia Tech defense I dont think you mind that the ball goes inside to heel tape No and but he got it right where he needs it You know again Virginia Tech just made a really good defensive play Thats the difference Hanssbury misses both free throws D Smith flies in for the rebound You miss free throws Its such a difference in games Such a difference And Gerak called for a touch foul on Cam as he made his cut Well you you cant grab a guy You cant hang on to him right in front of the official You know its harder to fool the officials since theres three of them But thats what you call a buzzer play game Yeah Gakm and out you come You mean they can see them when theyre right in front Oh I got it I didnt I never realized that Now you understand what the refs are looking for Jim after all these years I never got this whole See now thats they eliminate the screen Theyre not setting the screen up here So he gets a chance to go oneonone and its going to really create some problems Its just hard to stay in front of him Well they practice against screen and roll so many times that sometimes youre better with a good driver Just let him go Dont worry about the screen Heres a pop And we got ourselves a twopoint game Donovan Young making an impact off the bench And here again sets that up Another assist He scored or assisted on Stanfords last 15 points Dan Smith called for the bumping foul as Hammond crosses midcourt You see Virginia Tech hadnt scored a field goal in the last three minutes Stanford has tightened it up a little bit on the defensive end Each team has only turned it over one time so far in the second half Only 12 total turnovers for the two teams combined in the game so far Well this game may not be the most aesthetically pleasing game but these teams are playing hard Theres a tremendous amount of intensity by both teams on both ends of the court Its This is the way I think ACC basketball is going to be all year First two points of the night for Ben Hammond at the line Mike Young has lost his jacket as this game heads toward the final quarter Agarwal down the alley cross lane Cayman too strong Hanssbury with a strong hands grabs his 10th rebound of the night Well they did everything except make that basket and nobody stopped the ball cheering Almost a layup and then you come down give up a layup for a little fourpoint swing Well weve talked about Aore and his ability to get into the lane Hammond does it very well too And we know he can heat up quickly cheering Donovan Young way off on the offensive glass though Camman is there that again The Virginia Tech inside players are just not paying very much attention to Cammon or Roosi when hes in there when theyre trying to get offense Hammond looking for more and finds it Six points for Hammond Thats what he does Yeah he drives the ball to the basket You have to stay in front of him He won the Virginia game in overtime Well this is in transition and if you dont stop him hes going all the way to the basket And this is just a situation where theres some confusion Cammon and Agarwal cant decide whos guard and Hammond will make you pay for that every time Hammond started a few games but its nice to have a guy like him to come off the bench to spark you when theres a little bit of a low And thats why he comes off the bench because he can provide that spark And when hes playing at the same time as Abdales that gives Virginia Tech some really effective ball handling And I think hes really shown a big step up of improvement from last year He struggled a lot when I saw him last year Much better player this year Double figures in seven straight games after the missed free throw Though Caymans got six tonight but Tamman is alone under the basket and nobodys even looking at it Hammond nearly the steel among the league leaders in that department Shot clock is down to four and Aorei is near midc court Ibuka Aorei barely gets it off Finds the rim but Hammond rises for the rebound He told Camman to get out of the way and Camman didnt and that allowed a second defender to come Bedford is working really hard trying to keep the ball away from a Hanssbury banging inside Young wins the battle this time Geler flips it Gerak deflects it Last touch by Stanford Really good defensive play getting backings of football Miami Hurricanes against all miss program has had so much strange circumstances over the past month And then the Big 10 battle if you can call it that with Oregon and Indiana Bedford denied but a foul called Lets just say this If Indiana can make it to the College Football Playoff semifinals that gives hope to every single program in the country Well its why the transfer portal and NIL is good because you can be a Vanderbilt in Indiana and build up and get there Its not all you know Alabama and Texas those schools still going to be good but theyre not going to dominate like they used to And it gives those schools like Indiana a chance You know here you got a Pack 12 former Pack 12 school Oregon playing and Indiana a team that never got there in the history of program and thats the kind of good thing about NIL You know you always try to find something good about everything no matter how bad it might be And you get this balance that you dont get and never did get in basketball and football because of guys moving around and being able to reinforce your weaknesses and get a good player from a program thats really good that isnt playing that much And now hes in a program where he gets to play a lot Its good for everybody You know Geler doing some ball handling now as the point guard but its hard to get the ball to Okore because Bedford is just doing a dynamite job keeping it away from him They had all their success with Okori having the ball in his hands Heer wide left Another strong offensive rebound for Heilte A Cororey to the basket Well if hes going to shoot the three you got to try to to contest it but you dont run out at him so hard that he goes right around cuz thats what he wants to do 14 for a Cororey now on five of 12 shooting Hell got 12 rebounds in the game Bedford coming off his best scoring game of the season 25 at Wake Denied Gets it back Straight up goes Cammon Third chance for Gerdak Fourth chance coming up for the Hokes as Hansbury keeps cheering it alive with his 11th rebound A Dallas sets up Hammond Big shot Hes playing real good Very good That is a huge possession for Virginia Tech cheering Four Four offensive rebounds Thats all Bad pass through to the feet of Guilt Great hustle from Cam Sprawled on the hardwood here in Blackburg I think this is a big possession for Stanford A par gets a decent look but he cant make it You know theyre theyre in a real danger zone right here The Cardinal I mean you can feel it They got the game back close and now its enough spacing that theyre uncovering They were down by 12 They cut it to two And of Dallas makes it an 11point game again And thats part of the problem you have You got a guy like that on the other team who can take and make tough shots Hard to come back in that situation 18 for Neo They got it back in for his hands and thats what they needed to do This guy can go Iuka Aorei now with 16 He just got to take the ball Hes got to have the ball now for the last part of this game And heres Stanford Drops back into his zone They said they were going to try this today and I think this is probably a pretty good time to do it Jim do you feel a little giddy when you see someone go zone Its fun to watch once in a while just to see if it can work Well they get a stop and then I can say Ah yeah that works One of more teams run zone Wonders Jim Beahheim But get out of the way Give this guy the ball and get out of the way Spread it out a little bit Is that something you would say to the team in the huddle Get the ball to IA Get out of the way Yeah I remember once I had a great play call and we had a guy named Carl Washington and reactions music and then postgame the full breakdown with coach and player interviews Thats tomorrow night on the ACC network Miss verse Miami for a spot in the national championship game Foul was on Bedford right before the break So Stamford ball Theyre down by nine They just got a stop on Techs previous possession and they got it in the hands of the guy they want And with the heel Tay screen Aorei finds a layup I dont know if you can call that a screen but hell take intentionally got in the way He just kept spinning So yeah he just kept turning I dont think spinning clips I dont think Okores missed a shot or may or or didnt get a bucket for his team in the last 20 15 minutes of this game the wall hasnt made much of an impact in the second half in his first game back Hes fouled inside on the floor by He but Virginia Tech has such has done such a nice job on the attack in the second half that theyre in the double bonus and so theyre going to the line for two shots every time theres a foul called here toward the at the end of the game Virginia Tech You know the ne their next foul will send Stanford to the line for one and one Another missed free throw for the Hokes Virginia Tech getting the win over Virginia despite missing three rotation guys Mike Young said were thin as nickel soup laughter But he also said were going to be whole pretty soon And theyre closer to hole tonight with Lau back in the lineup Mike Youngs got some good oneliners coach Hes oldtimer Hes got a lot of them cheering Do you remember when you first cross paths with coach Young He reminds No he reminds me of Luke Connor Old school guy Hes just funny stuff Great coach What was it like competing against Coach Young Great coach Gives you everything hes got and then just shakes hands afterward No no Five to shoot for a Cororey Iuka whistle and a foul Thats where they kind of bail out a great player sometimes Its Hes going nowhere Hes going into where theres nothing there I dont know Well he just drives the ball to the basket and he saved Stanford on this play because they had him open coming off a double screen on the inside He actually put his arms underneath Well thats a great play cuz its going to be called It goes cheering underneath Its going to be a th but hes singlehandedly trying to keep them in this game Well they had him He He was down inside He came off a double screen He was all alone and Octaro wasnt patient enough He tried to drive the ball and Okori picks it up at half court and gets two points He is some player Hes a winner He gets things done Well look he has been a winner when he scored 20 The Cardinal 90 this year or 80 when he scores 20 Hes got 20 now Well see if that streak can continue Not if Ben Hammond has anything to say about it Thats a big shot right now at this stage of the game Well and they were struggling against that zone a little bit and he just knocks it down Hammonds got 12 all in a flurry here in the second half and a Cory loses it First mistake in the second half Hammonds doing a nice job defensively And a Corys first turnover just the seventh for Stamford Little razledazzle dribble there from Hanssbury And now thats a good thing it worked because he was standing in front of Mike Young Mike Young might have got it Oh of the spin cycle Cant finish Hammond tracks the rebound Shot clock did not reset And now the officials are going to blow the whistle and say perhaps it should have reset I think that hit the rim Thats the great thing with of Dallas Heat He gets a bigger guy at him and he just pulls him around and goes by him and the little guy with 428 to go Officials reviewing this play during the break The ball clearly hits the music rim So they re reset the shot clock Therell be 17 on the timer This was a huge shot for him and hes really been critical for the Hokes here since halftime Great second music half I mean hes hes keeping him in there keeping a little distance here just overcoming what the Currys doing at the other end Averaging 15 points off the bench in his last seven ball games Well the defense that time Donovan Young he went to cover Jaden Shoot You certainly understand that because Shoot can really put the ball in the basket and Hammond made him pay for it Now theyre back to the manto man Shoot had those two shots early Hasnt even gotten a good look lately Low for two Wow Thats what they like Thats what theyve been missing He can make plays like that Whats not to like Well Stanford they got to get something going quickly Cory zips it to Young Geler passes up the shot Shoot was right there defensively Apara over Lewal Rebounded by Shu Hasnt been his night Hes one for the night Hes now one for 11 Has missed all four of his threepoint shots Five of his threepoint shots now Finds his position and takes cheering two more Hes got 20 He just takes the big guys and the little guys He backs down and scores over They have no answer for him tonight This is the Hokes largest lead Hanssberry with the defense Thats out of bounds Last touch by Heilte That touched about six hands and four feet before it went out of bounds Has been fun to watch Hes really battled Hes got eight points and 13 rebounds music Two points away from his first collegiate double double Well Cameron Grant just came in the game for Stanford and hes in there to do one thing and that is shoot the three Well right now Virginia Techs just taking over the game Just completely taken over and its been balanced Thats just done Ambitious pass that somehow worked out for the Hokes Bedford on the drive Hammond with seven Hammond rejected cleanly Down by 13 less than three minutes to go Cardinal got to go quick A par is on the bench Geler is out there and he nets the three Another either gets an assist or a bucket Well now they got to get a stop Hammond rejects the lal screen and hes fouled on the floor on his way to the rim But in the double bonus two more free throws coming for Hammond Abdales has been very good in the second half but Hammond did not score in the first half Hes got 12 in the second half And thats just really clever He uses his strength and he does not allow Geler to get back in front He just moves into him forces Gerard to foul They got two guys playing well at a high level And Stanfords got one guy What does it do when a team has a guy like Abdales whos 69 who can run the show and a guy like Hammond who can also trigger the offense with his speed and stature Theyre hard to guard because of the size He he can take a big guy and a little guy he backs down And Hammond is just a you know hes an explosive player gives him two guys that can make plays Stanfords got one guy and hes making plays but one guy cant do enough A Cory and hes going to try Hes hes been trying He has scored or assisted on 28 of Stanfords last 30 points And he goes away from the screen right here And Bedford when Bedford does not have some help off that screen hes had a hard time staying in front of him Even though Bedford has done everything I think a human being can do hes just a really really good player and a hard guy to stop And hes going away from the screen most of the time Two minutes to go Well the interesting thing if Virginia Tech gets this win tonight itll be win number 13 Thats as many games as they won all last year They asked Mike Young why theyre better this year He says they get better players Hes the same coach Hes a really good coach He always has been a good coach Here goes this guy all the way Carnell with a steal A Cororey with a bucket Two big guys Two guys waiting to block and they cant do it This kid has got some explosion Not over yet Cory continues to will the Cardinal within striking distance Can they get one more stop Aales for three No good Geler the rebound Now you got to push Iuka obligas Cameron Grant off the bench swatted by Lal but it comes back to him Aorei launches and hits Its a fourpoint game I think Virginia Tech should take a little bit more time down here in the last two minutes and not take a three when they have the ball Theres no Lets Lets make sure we take care of the ball and wait and use some clock up here He was an alltimer at Allen Fieldhouse last night Lawrence with Kansas coming back against TCU Mike Young hoping to avoid that similar fate that the Horn Frogs endured All they have to do is use the whole clock and maybe you know just get small Thats what they cant do They got lucky Pokeys ball They got lucky Kyle Smith might want to review it and hes asking if he has a timeout he can do it I worth a challenge Yeah Yeah Oh hes if hes got a challenge he should take it Well hes got a challenge and hes got two timeouts left but the referee is telling him you know if you want a challenge go ahead But were not going to change it No Well I dont I I dont think it was I think it was off Stanford Ive got a bad angle Just cuz youre all the way out two feet away from it he should be able to get that call But it looked like previous out of bounds plays being challenged by Stanford But in reality all you have to do for Virginia Tech is hold the ball until he gets in the third 40 35 and take a shot and then music when did the ball go out of bounds Well they ruled it wasnt out of bounds until music it was touched by Stanford Now what happens if they look and realize well the ball never did go out of bounds Yeah its out of bounds Its out of bounds But was it out of bounds before Grant touched it music Did Grant touch it when it was out of bounds Can we get the overhead look one more music time Its off stand I think so too Maybe we should ask Mike Young It looks like he has the best view music Was really close though But thats the ball was not out of bounds when Grant touched it But music I think in this situation you know its the end of the game Its a crucial out of bounds call If you have a challenge you may as well use it Oh yeah Its especially like a tie game where the ball goes out of bounds and youre not sure music You got to look at that You got to be able to look at that And the challenge is once you use one and two even if you get them shot clock at 14 Hanssbury gives to Abdollis Were going to play it out He should back this guy down Hes going to go by this guy Decent defense from Heay Shot missed Rebound of Cory Cardinal down four Going to score quickly Donovan Young to make it a onepoint game Yes sir 285 to go Unless you get a 10 count you got a foul Bold pass Shoot Makes the catch You got a foul Yes they do The foul of Dallas whos a 68 free throw shooter this season But even if he makes them both Sanfords got a chance Its not a bad play music to try to get the steal there That was that was a good play And now you just you know if you get a guy missing here this is McCury again What a what a play hes making Hes got assists or buckets What is it now 37 out of 40 points or something Crazy It is crazy But Im telling you Donovan Donovan Young has been fabulous Hes made three threepoint baskets And hes made threepoint baskets in big situations And he had scored two points in the 31 minutes he had played all season in just the three games since he returned from his Well now if youre Stanford you got to block out Now you see what weve been seeing Team with a big lead misses a free throw or something Now all of a sudden Stanford has a chance to win Dallas goes one for two Its a twopoint game with 162 remaining averages 15 a game but he struggled tonight Just one of 11 Well keep in mind that Geler is an outstanding threepoint shooter and a clutch threepoint shooter This is going to be the freshman Hes going to go and make it happen The freshman from Nasha New Hampshire Ibuka Okorei shoots for the lead Stanford would have won with 28 to go He was taking that the whole way He was never thinking about it when he came back over and they switched to the big guy hes taking that shot He never thought about anything else 31 for Oi And now the Hokes trail Well Dallas just is afraid to go out close to him because he can drive it so well music You realize they ran the same play the whole second half Either points three four assists in this half Wow Pokeis led by as many as 13 You want to catch it running away from your basket going toward the other basket if you can And gentlemen they were up 13 with 336 to go Same as Virginia and put Cam in to try to contest this pass of Dallas throwing the inbound Can run the baseline deflected by Hece and he scores at the buzzer and the foul as Virginia Tech stopped playing I dont know what happened there Why
