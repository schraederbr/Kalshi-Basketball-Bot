These two guys need to be on the floor for their respective basketball teams Clemson wearing their orange The home whites for the Cardinal The opening tip controlled by Clemson and Dylan Hunter has it first for the Tigers and a man for Stanford Theres Justin Porter way out top RJ Godfrey pulls his cheering way inside Steam rolls over AJ Rahosi and an offensive foul called on RJ Godfrey and that is a turnover on Clemson and Godfrey of course dad played 11 years in the NFL Yeah Not saying that influenced that play but hes not shy of contact now And when you take a charge for still trying to recover from taking that flush but thats a really big play for Stanford to step up and take a charge on the initial opening play of the game Heres Donovan Young for the Cardinal AJ Raosi down low and the grad transfer across the keep flip ends up short and its pulled down by Carter Welling and here comes Clemson and a whistle and thats against Stanford Yeah make no mistake early where Clemson wants to direct the basketball Theyre trying to go inside Theyve been dominant at times this year When they get the ball and score in the paint I think theyre theyve only lost one game when theyve outscored their opponents in the paint First on Ibuka Okorei Here is Justin Porter Mismatch down low if they can get it to Carter Welling for the Tigers Now Stanford switches back Shot clock at 10 Welling out top Step back three from Justin Porter A tough shot by Porter Stanford doing a good job pressuring the ball but Porter gets a shot as the shot clock dwindles down Transfer from Middle Tennessee Three years at Middle Tennessee after a couple of JC years And now in his final season of college basketball averaging 11 a game for Clemson Iuko Aorei Eight to shoot for the Cardinal Ryan Uggerwall answers with a three He does that Roxy A couple of guys in Stanford had opportunities but Aggerwall just knocks it down Pretty calm as a cucumber 40 on his threes and were tied at three RJ Godfrey powers his way inside and Clemson reclaims the lead Now theres that strength inside Brad Brownell really wants his team to attack the paint as many times as they can and they are Deep three from Agarwal Got it Second three for Ryan Agarwal Well I said come as a cucumber How about cool as a cucumber Either way hes found his range early Two for two First lead for the Cardinal Heres Jake Wall Straight on three And the rainbow off from Dylan Hunter and its last touch by Stanford will stay at this end and it stays with Clemson Yeah you Ryan Agal can get some Stanford Thats a second look and hes knocked them both down Hes a confident player and by the way who is out here before everybody else today shooting in the gym two hours and same for Clemson is Oscar Hilte the freshman from Belgium is in the game And then for Clemson our first look tonight at Nick Davidson the California native on the drive getting inside and a quick burst but it wouldnt go for Justin Porter and the rebound grabbed by Donovan Young and here comes Stanford I like Stanfords aggressiveness early Theyre really putting pressure on the ball Fuka Okori Ryan Uggerwall three rattles that on the rebound grab by Carter Welling for the Tigers That been a big time shot He That thing was down and out All the way down and popped out Stampers really putting ball pressure on the perimeter players The lob and the finish by Carter Welling Yeah just impressed with how Clemson continues to attack the paint Every possessions had a paint touch just about Donovan Young Heres Ibuko Cororey in the lane The pull up and Ibuka Okoris first points of the night Well hell take what the defense gives him I mean he can pull up in the twopoint in the midrange or knock down the three but hes really good at getting that shot in midrange Deflected out by Oscar Heel Tay No its off of Nick Davidson and it belongs to Stanford Both Miami and Florida State Yeah cant worry about those but youre right They had some opportunities but you youre only as good as your next opportunity They have a chance tonight to play against a nationally ranked team and and put them away which will be another huge huge signature win And Clemson has been so good on the road as Benny Geler lines up a three and a good job inside Chase Thompson the freshman with the rebound Here comes Clemson and Buddy Johnson Clemson whos won 12 consecutive road conference games streak that goes back to early in the ACC round last year when they lost to Louisville Shot clock down to five Nick Davidson gets inside Absorbs contact and finishes inside and gives Clemson the lead Yeah tough play I mean he got bumped pretty hard and laid a little on his own but scored it nonetheless Davidson who scores nine points per game coming off the bench for Brad Brownell Here is Oscar Hilte Ibuka Okorei forced way out Brian Ogarwall Tough step back on the baseline and a good defensive sequence by Clemson forcing a difficult shot The Tigers grab the rebound Nice job by Clemson Open three Nick Davidson from downtown Now that puts pressure on you when youve got your big guys from Clemson that can step out and knock down shots and try to shrink the floor defensively but Clemson makes the makes them pay Davidson the transfer from Nevada and the California native has 16 family and friends that are here Benny Geler from well behind the line and thats too strong And the rebound pushing it is Justin Porter for the Tigers Pull up three in transition by Porter Rims out and Oscar Heilte grabs the rebound Here is Geler Shot clock down to five cheering Appreciate the shout out from David Felman and Cory Williams across the bay Were on the farm at Maples Pavilion with Ben Braun and our ACC Network crew Roxy Bernstein with you from Maples Pavilion Number 20 Clemson An early 12A lead on the Stanford Cardinal Nick Davidson with five off the bench to lead Clemson Ryan Uggerwall a couple of threes has six of Stanfords eight Stanford trying to snap a fourgame losing streak against number 20 Clemson And the Tigers have won 12 consecutive road conference games That streak on the line here in the Bay Area this week Ibuko Cororey drives Okorei the floater and two strong in the rebound grab by Clemson and pushing Dylan Hunter Four on two attacks Hits the trailer Davidson the steal Benny Geler He leads Stanford in steals on the year and home free for the drop in Ibuka Okorei How about Benny Gayler with a slight of hand stepped in out of nowhere made the steal and Oscar Hilton that last play hitting the deck giving his team another possession Stanfords playing hard defensively Rox four for Okori and 10th in the country in scoring at almost 22 a game but its Johnson a tough pull up three and the rebound Ryan Uggerwall for Stanford controls it Benny Keeler thought about the three Aiden Cameron gets inside and missed the leaner and Clemson controls and its Dylan Hunter controlling things for Brad Brownell and the Tigers Had a chance to draw some contact Kind of shied away just a little bit Good play though defensively by Clemson Dylan Hunter to the basket High off the window by Hunter Thats a tough shot I mean he had the big fella all over him draped and he just kissed it high off the window Clemson six of their first 10 from the floor and up by four on the Cardinal as IO Cory drives and hes fouled and the contact from Justin Porter will send Ibuka Okori really really really needs to get if they want to stay in the conversation for the NCA tournament Well they love this win because its against a nationally ranked opponent which will put them back in the tournament talk And you can tell as evidenced by the way theyve played Roxy they forced four turnovers against a team like Clemson that doesnt turn it over very much So theyre very much playing at a high level and theyd love to try to get some easier baskets but this Clemson team is a stingy team Theyre good defensively You got to create ways to score and right now I think Stanfords playing with an edge and and the kind of edge that you need to upset a team like Clemson All 12 for Stanford have come from Ibuka Okori and Ryan Uggerwall each with six and a twopoint lead for the Tigers and stumbling inside but a foul on the Cardinal as Carter Welling was hacked and its on Jaylen Thompson Look at the ace elevates inside Thats a challenge now for Stanford but youre right If they can get just another win notch one more win against a ranked opponent put themselves back in the in the in the tournament picture that would be huge And a Stanford team that had some really good wins so far this year They beat North Carolina here They beat Louisville here They beat St Louis on a neutral floor And a good win at Virginia Tech as Jaylen Thompson with the pullup jumper Just his third mage field goal of the season Attacking quickly back the other way and Ace Buckner will get to the line for the Tigers Well the good news about playing the ACC rocks you get opportunities every night to get some signature wins against quality opponents But here you can see Jaylen Tom or you can see Jaylen Thompson on the pump fake and and the pullup I mean he has not logged a lot of minutes but every time hes gotten in for the Stanford Cardinal team hes played well and hes in a bigger role for Stanford Jaylen Thompson because of the injury to Chisum Para And the right knee injury is the free throw knocked in by Ace Buckner Next Wednesday nights ACC Network double header features these Clemson Tigers again They host Virginia Tech at 7 Eastern Then Wake Forest Atlanta to take on Damon Stymires Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Catch both games on ACC Network and the ESPN app And Georgia Tech gave Cal a run He just came off a tough game and accidentally a game where Georgia Tech led in the second half Cal was up big allowing Georgia Tech to come back Here is Thompson Attacks Ibuka Okorei for the Cardinal the center of attention for Clemson You can see Stanford trying to probe Thompson launching a deep three and that rattles out of the rebound secured Carter Welling for the Tigers And just saving it is Nick Davidson for Clemson inside 10 to shoot Ace Buckner deep three cheering with a shot clock winding down Missed by Carter Welling and the rebound Oscar Heilte And here comes Jeremy Dent Smith Grant transfer for the Cardinal from the elbow in and out and the offensive rebound and the put back Aiden Cam and theyre going to have to do more of that Roxy because Clemson not giving Stanford a lot of easy looks But nice job offensively climbed the glass and you saw Nick Davidson limping to the bench Not a good sign for the Tigers considering Davidson off to a terrific start with five points and a valuable member for Brad Brownell Theyre taking him right down the tunnel Davidson whos got 16 family and friends the Southern California native Hes from Mission Viejo Went to powerhouse modern day in Southern California as Welling gets his own miss and then throws it right to Jeremy Den Smith Stanford on the move The lob AJ Rozi pulls it away from the basket Down low for Rajosi and its ripped right away to steal Carter Welling Clemson running ace Buckner Dallas Thomas three Yeah great job in transition Another good defensive possession for Clemson Roxy they make the floor look awfully small on this end of the floor They cover ground They get in the paint Theyre helping Theyre two two guys to the ball One and a half to two men Everywhere you look they just really clog the defense And theyre big Dallas Thomas the red shirt freshman was highly recruited hasnt played all that much this year And going inside Aiden Came plus one for the Cardinal Yeah I love the aggression there of Aiden Keman I mean you got to stay aggressive against aggressive teams and youre playing not just around Stanford but a college baseball icon and Mark Marcus Yeah somebody well known as you mentioned connected obviously with David Eser who took over friend of ours I mean its got to be a tough loss for him and his teams his players He was like a father to David Esker played for him was on the 87 College World Series championship team and then succeeded his mentor Stanford down two 735 to go first half against number 20 Clemson Aiden Cam Ryan Uggerwall and a little too fancy there Throws it away going behind the back Yeah And thats the second giveaway by the Cardinals Well I thought he had a chance to pull and and get another attempt up but Clemsons on the threepoint shooters for Stanford Theyre not giving him any open looks and time to get ready RJ Gotfrey tries to turn the corner spins back middle and one What a move by RJ Godfrey for Clemson Yeah hes a loaded tough cover oneonone Hes going to get into your body and when you get into your the player gets into your body they can spin off of you to help gets there a little late in Benny Giler but you see the strength and quickness obviously of Godfrey Second foul Oscar Heilte and Godfrey a 67 foul shooter And interesting story is hell take heading to the bench with the two fouls But Godfrey played his first two years at Clemson transferred went to Georgia last year and came back for his senior year to play again for Brad Brownell Yeah that says something right there I mean he really is a player that gives them some efficiency How about 65 from the floor Thats a pretty good number Offensive foul on AJ Roi called for the offensive foul his first Thats a good figure You go back to RJ Godfrey Roxy and youre scoring at 65 efficiency from the floor Uh you cant get your hand in the hands of your player that can give you that kind of return enough Justin Porter in the lane just did keep his back foot down RJ Godfrey underneath and Godfrey wave it off He stepped on the end line and a turnover on Clemson Great move and he doesnt like the call but the official Michael Irving right there to make the call I mean thats a spin You can see his foot on the line Amazing how good the officials are from this feed refs You didnt have that same reaction when youre across the No No And I had Michael Orving many times Hes a better official I told him that in the parking lot today getting inside of Buo Cory couldnt finish cheering He was looking for a call and ripping the rebound down Chase Thompson for Clemson Yeah I thought there was some contact Jake Wallen fires and there is Ibuka Okori on the rebound for the Cardinal Stanford under 40 Theyre seven of 18 and two for seven from three and going up against a strong defensive club in Clemson as Benny Geler missed from deep and Godfrey called for the foul holding Aiden Cam and the second on RJ Godfield and Aiden Came did a great job of selling that He acted like his life was in danger I love it Yeah he got his arms around him and then Cam just kind of lunged like he hey let me go and got the call Great call by the official but Aiden Cameron nice one A good sign for the Tigers Nick Davidson back on the floor after appeared to roll his ankle earlier Here is AJ Roi Jeremy Dent Smith on a step back three and the offensive rebound Aiden Camman and then Camman again pulled away from contact Challenged by Chase Thompson Yeah you got to go up there and be willing to get hit Aiden did a nice job Just got to follow through but Clemson just shrinks the floor Theyre so good defensively They make this floor look so small Dylan Hunter and the drop off and the layin Chase Thompson Well if you charted this game its amazing how many times that Clemson has gotten into the paint and at the rim Its I mean thats their thats their motif Theyre trying to do it almost on every possession Largest lead for the Tigers Stanford has been scoreless for about three minutes Aiden Came powers his way inside Yeah thats much better Big fella took it to the basket kept his head up and finished Nice job Camman averages under five points a game He has seven already Yeah hes playing aggressively Good ball movement by the Tigers Justin Porter left open Missed the three And Aiden Camman the rebound Camman seven points four boards giving Kyle Smith some really good minutes Clemson doing a nice job on Ivokori He hasnt got loose very much Hadnt had many open looks Brad Rells determined to keep size on Okori as Ryan Agarwal missing a three and the long rebound Justin Porter for the Tigers But the length teams have used that on him like Duke like Notre Dame that have caused problems and frustrated him a bit Well hes also but hes got the ability to go around them but they they close the door quickly The help side defense by Clemson is excellent Five to shoot Jake Wallen has his three blocked by Aiden Cameron Pull down AJ Rozi Here is Okori And offbalance good defense from Justin Porter Yeah trying to draw draw the foul But Porter their best perimeter defender did an excellent job on a board Spinning in the lane Jake Wallen The Utah transfer comes up empty And another rebound grabbed by Stanford Okorei three Thats interesting because he just decided you know what Im going to take you on the perimeter A little stutter step and I dont think that Porter was ready for that But you better be if youre guarding the Buka Cory Timeout Clemson The Tigers are up seven Stanford has cut it to two As good as they are your players are going to give you their best shot They want to win Number 20 Clemson up two Late first half here on the farm their California road trip to the Bay Area as Nick Davidson driving and a foul whistled against Donovan Young of the Cardinal for a push Roxy to your point and I think we mentioned this earlier Clemson has eight different guys whove scored in this game So if youre Stanford you cant key on one guy You youve got to play their whole team and theyve got different guys that can hurt you Nice play Carter Welling and the jump hook and Donovan Young the rebound for the Cardinal Yeah Roen did a nice job pushing him off the block and out on the floor But Stanford just cant get an open look Not very few Donovan Young fires too strong on the three and the long rebound Here comes Justin Porter That was an open look for Donovan Young Clemsons been scoreless for about three and a half minutes and a block is called as Donovan Young was in the restricted circle underneath the basket Well he had he was set Roxy but as you mentioned you know Kyle Smith is asking for an explanation His man was set I thought Young did a great job But was he in that circle and you can see it looked like he was outside of that circle from here I I mean they want to review that and they are thats a good the value of your bench now and that video guy Roxy because Vladimir Voy Tidal who made the call pointed to the restricted area that is whats getting challenged here by Kyle Smith Fair challenge 30 second timeout You play referee You play video review here I got to go with the challenger He looked clean to me This is all right So this is a Stanford challenge that is getting reviewed The call on the floor was a block as they pointed to the restricted area saying Donovan Young was inside the restricted circle underneath the basket And keep an eye on the right foot of Donovan Young there for the Cardinal His foots up I mean did he put it down is the question If his toes on I mean his ball of his foots up and his heels not down then theyll win this challenge But I dont know if you can see that from this angle And again for our viewers you must be able to overturn this with you know definitively you cant Yeah it looks like it splits up in the air but now it looks like its back down But is it on that line Now its back up again when the contact takes place And thats what counts When the contact gets takes place then you got to call it I thought his foot was up but it was over that restricted area line Not if he was like a ballerina laughter Lets see it Heres another look at it this way And keep an eye on the right heel Yeah I thought it was up but thats a restricted area stands Yeah it looks like its up to Im sorry Stanford will lose their timeout and moving forward Two shots for Clemson And Kyles not going to like this Un unsuccessful challenge by Stanford as after video review for the challenge for the restricted area And again unsuccessful means it cost Stanford a timeout Plus they have lost the ability to challenge for the rest of the game Well thats a tough one Roxy I mean that I dont know you get any closer than that And as we mentioned already if you cant overwhelmingly overturn this then its got to stand And thats the case Then tomorrow night a womens basketball double header on ACC Network at 6 Eastern number 25 North Carolina hosting Clemson followed by Florida State and Raleigh to Vataly State The games are part of play for K initiative Uniting Universities and their fans in their fight against cancer Big womens hoops double header tomorrow night on ACC Network Both free throws nailed by Justin Porter and he has five and the lead is four for Clemson AJ Roi spinning down low Shot clock at five for the Cardinal Jeremy Dent Smith stepping back three and he can do that Thats a big time score at the end of the shot clock Wow And a nice screen to set that up AJ Rajosti cleared it out Leveled him Onepoint game Fourth made three for the Cardinal Davidson going back door Justin Porter missed a good look and a foul going for the rebound as Clemsons gone about four minutes without a made field goal And a foul is on Clemson going for the rebound Yeah Stanfords doing a nice job Theyre digging in defensively But theres that last play I mean how about that for a screen Give me a guy like Roi Ill get open Ill knock that one down Is this Stanford football coach to beat a Pritcharder in the building You better hide him I had Tony Gonzalez I couldnt hide him He was already on the football field But Ill tell you Roxy that was quite a screen and a delivery by Jeremy Den Smith who has proven he can knock down big threes Second foul on Carter Welling Final minute of the half Step back Ibuka Okorei gives Stanford the lead Their first since it was 87 Second time hes done that You give him some room hell get you on your heels and hell nail it 12 for Oy who averages just under 22 a game Ace Buckner turns the corner and the floater on the baseline from Buckner Yeah nice score by Buckner out under control Stanford though can play for the last shot and take a lead into the halftime if they can score or draw a foul 15 seconds left in the half Kyle Smith telling everybody get out of the way Let Okorey take this I like those odds Now gives it up to Aiden Cam on the baseline Tamman takes us to halftime against a Stanford team that has lost four in a row and in desperate need of a win And it could be another big win for them if they can get it tonight The three missed by Benny Geler Last touch by AJ Roi and it belongs to Clemson The officials may overturn this as Joe Lindseay comes running across talking to Michael Irving and they will change the call Now keep in mind Stanford does not have a challenge anymore because of the unsuccessful challenge late in the first half Well that was a great piece of officiating to come in and overturn that call because that was my opinion the the right call You can see it right there Ryan Uggerwall out of the double team Mismatch down low Aiden Camman who starts the second half for the Cardinal But Stanford a turnover and then a foul committed by Aiden Camman trying to get the basketball back His first Yeah tough post entry Aiden Keman had two guys on him defensively Both guys hand to hand across Its Clemson now picking up their defense playing from behind And thats what theyre known for Theyre such a good defensive squad Theyre connected and thats what Brad Brenells foundation is with this team is being tough and physical and terrific defense and getting everybody to buy in Yeah theyve made it tough on Stanford Stanford has not had many if any really easy looks tonight RJ Godfrey has it knocked away and a steal Ibuka Oy and Godfrey just picked up his third foul And speaking of good defense how about Ibuka Cororey We talk about his offense Rocku as we should I mean hes had monster games but hes always around the basketball Hes looking at this helpside defense He knows that this Clemson player is not seeing him Hes not in his vision He steps in makes the steal and draws a third foul AJ Roi to the bucket Has his shot blocked Aiden Camman picks it up Deep three Benny Geler breaks the seal for the second half of the first points of the night for Geler Gel with the seal Roxy he can do that He can knock down shots The former walkon the senior Benny Geler 42 on his threes Yeah hes not bashful nor should he be He can really knock down threepoint shots from deep The run is 164 for the Cardinal Back to the first half Cross the key The running floater rolls in for Nick Davidson Its a great look by Nick Davidson I mean he was defended well but he managed to get his shot up and over Another point in the paint He leads Clemson with seven Aiden Camman lost it right to AJ Rahosi Five to shoot for the Cardinal Camman fires a three and a good box out by Carter Welling and Clemson controls Yeah nice job getting Stanford on a short clock and theres a hold by Aiden Cameman battling with Nick Davidson to second on Cam number 52 You got an opportunity to see here a a a good block shot but then the kick out to Benny Ger You cant give him any open looks but Davidson on the on the nice move to the paint gets up and over a tough defender and AJ Roi Clemson does such a good job of attacking the paint Every possession they theyre looking to attack Justin Porter turns the corner on the drive The kick Justin Porter launches three Yeah hes pretty cool and collected That was no panic on that possession by Clemson Second three for Porter Were tied three minutes into half number two here is Jeremy Dent Smith for the Cardinal That pass broken up Justin Porter getting in the way Well you talk about a guy that delivers for his team Justin Porter has made huge shots for his team but I mean he just gets there on the perimeter Shot clock winding down he nails it Hes a good player He plays both ends Five to shoot for Stanford as Ryan Ugarwalls tripped cutting in and the foul is committed by Dylan Hunter of Clemson I like this play against aggressive defense The basket cut You want to put pressure on the defense Roxy Basket cut Its teams have to honor you to the basket and they couldnt get around Nice cut by Agaral And the pass intercepted Great anticipation Jake Wallen for Clemson again Shrinking the floor Giving you a pass lane Looks like its open Its not Its stolen right back Oscar Hilte Big men going oneonone The give AND GO AND THE FINISH BY HEA Cory with the slight of hand Houdini I mean you think hes going up He did The ball did not stay in his hands He got it right back to the big fella Easy dunk First points for Oscar Heelte tonight Getting inside and hell blocks the shot Then Ryan Agarwal and a foul is called on Dylan Hunter of Clemson Second on Hunter Yeah you want to talk about some action how about us Tigers Clemson 184 overall Theyve won 11 of their last 12 and they have been tremendous on the road 12 consecutive road conference victories for the Tigers Tied for the fourth longest road streak in ACC history Donovan Young missing a three and Dylan Hunter grabs the rebound for the Tigers Here is Carter Welling on the drive to the bucket The double pump missed by Justin Porter and Oscar Heelte pulls it down for Stanford on the push The miss Jeremy Den Smith with a follow on the weak side by Oscar Heilte Hes done that all year for the Cardinal Roxy Hes an off a tremendous offensive rebounder His stats per minutes play is pretty much off the chart Dylan Hunter steps in left it short and Oscar Helte pulls it down for the Cardinal Ryan Aggerwall transition missed the three and the rebound run down Carter Welling for Clemson Well you can say why did he take that shot Sometimes Roxy in transition an open three is an open three and so I can live with that with your best shooter getting an open shot A steal IO picked the pocket of Dylan Hunter and drops it in First points of the second half for Ibuka Okorei Yeah you must watch yourself when youre handling the basketball in front of Ibuka Cororei Thats the second one And I mean hes just defending Look at I his hand is right in between that crossover dribble Poked it loose and came up with the twopoint slam He plays both ends of the floor Largest lead of the night for the Cardinal And with that bucket Ibuka Okori has tied Casey Jacobson for the fourth most points scored by a Stanford freshman Yeah thats saying something cuz Ive coached against Casey Jacobson and he is truly one of the alltime greats at Stanford Shot clock rolling down with the Tigers but a Johnson from deep Missed a good look and the rebound Hustling for the offensive rebound Put back RJ Godrey and one Thats what Clemson needed to do Roxy They were about to get out of there with another missed shot but they attack the offensive glass Chance for a threepoint play Heres a missed shot Long hard rebound Den Smith gets pushed under and the offensive rebound put back Second foul AJ Roi RJ Godfrey rolls the free throw in and cuts the Stanford lead in half Yeah that was a shortlived lead You can see Clemson now trying to dial up their defense again after the big threepoint play And Benny Keeler with the errant pass Thats the one thing you dont want to do against Clemson Theyre good enough defensively You dont want to help them out and commit turnovers Thats a big swing now for Stanford to give Clemson an opportunity to either pull within two or tie Stanford had a sixpoint lead Step back by Ace Buckner Clemson has tied the game Well thats confidence Roxy Your teams down and you have an ability to step back and take that Thats what winning does You just play with a winning pedigree And the red shirt freshman with a step back Of course his dad Greg former Clemson great now coaching with the Bucks in the NBA 11 years as a player in the NBA So six straight for the Tigers to tie it Aiden Cam foulable Gets it to line first on Nick Davidson Well you go back again with Clemson and theyre playing from behind but Ace Buckner you know shows you the ability just to step back create space and with confident drain a shot A Chem has really put put a really nice effort on Dont miss the Tuesday premiere of a special edition of All Access the ACC Life This episode features ACC student athletes taking part in the 4th annual ACC Unity Tour which included visits to Montgomery and Selma Alabama See how the journey affected each of them this Tuesday 9 Eastern on ACC Network Stanfords got Aiden Cam hits both free throws Yeah hes hes really again put together a nice night giving Stanford a real big lift And here comes Jaylen Thompson out of the pack for the Cardinal Foul on the drive as Jeremy Dan Smith penetrating second on Justin Porter Weve mentioned Jaylen Thompson before but just hasnt logged minutes but hes really given his team a lift Oscar Hilt guys that havent played a lot of minutes Thompson off the inbound throws up a wild shot falling down and Clemson pushing but a Johnson in transition Chase Thompson and Johnson is clobbered will gets it alive Thats actually a good foul That was going to be a sure two Youve got Yeah the ability to get to the basket and draw the foul but you got to make it pay there Cant give it to him Third and Oscar heel Buddy Johnson 88 foul shooter Transfer from UAB and it pops out for Johnson I didnt say he was 88 Hes generally is a very good free throw shooter One of the tops Stanford fans getting into this one One out of two for Johnson and a onepoint lead for the Cardinal Abukco Cory slashes inside left it short and fighting for the rebound Still lose Oscar heel dives The arrow belongs to Clemson for a special team because its hard to do and these great teams do that and Clemsons accomplished that Last year Clemson 27 wins but lost in the first round of the NCA tournament to Mcnes as a foul committed by Stanford Then a couple of years ago Brad Brownell took Clemson all the way to the Elite Eight Yeah And if you look at the the common common denominator Roxy a lot of it defense You win games on the road by playing good defense You simply cant help shoot your opponents every night on the road You better be able to stop them hanging and one Impressive play by Chase Thompson for Clemson I think Jaylen Thompson had a chance to take a charge chose to block the shot absorb the foul the contact Lets see it Theres the drive and I think he could have stepped instead went for the shot block First lead of the second half for the Tigers and they had one free throw and Chase Thompson with five off the bench He had just a total of two points in the last six games for the Tigers Clemson led by as many as seven in the first half Aiden Camman thought about it Now does fire the three A careerhigh 14 for Aiden Cam Thats getting the job done I mean he knocked that down like hes belongs and and you got to have that confidence Roxy Hes got it tonight He averages less than five points per game Yeah hes hes hes teen it up Chase Thompson answers for Clemson Well theres these balance you talk about on Clemson Any given player can light it up for you and they have balance Eight guys eight different guys on the scoreboard Just the sixth made three for Thompson on the season and he has a new career best at eight The freshman from Minnesota Jeremy Dent Smith the floater HJ Rahuli in the offensive glass and a foul committed by Carter Welling his third You can see here Aiden Keman on the step back just measures it Shoots it with confidence But watch Clemson as well I mean theyre stepping up I made down shots You have to have that belief AJ Rozi has it stripped Picked up Ryan Ogarwall And here comes Clson The rebound Carter Welling And cheering a block on Betty Geler is ahead of steam for Buddy Johnson Thats an aggressive play offensively Benny Geler also moving But wow thats just a blow by and a lean in You know I dont know I know youre moving Ive always disagreed with that call Roxy I I dont care if youre set If youre moving alongside of your opponent and he leans in initiates contact Ive always thought that should be an offensive My My issue is always the opposite hand And it seemed that there was an extension there from Johnson but it didnt appear enough No but for the offensive foul And now one and one for Budda Johnson But who caused the contact Thats just my way of thinking But nonetheless Clemsons aggressive and they got the ball back in transition and drew the foul Theyre just doing what they need to do to get back in this game and maintain a lead Now one more for Johnson Two for three at the line Clemsons a hard team to play if youre coming from behind because they dont make it easy You really have to earn your strikes And now some pressure for the Tigers Yeah theyre theyre extending Theyre 94 ft Theyre giving you all they got Ryan Agawal too strong on the three Ace Buckner rips it down Here come the Tigers again Clemsons made their last four shots from the field The pump fake and a step back The tip counted and one Nick Davidson for the Tigers Thats a big time offensive rebound and finish I mean Nick Davidson gets contact and absorbs the contact and scores it Watch as he gets knocked back tips it in at the same time Huge play Third on Aiden Cameron Davidsons first free throw attempt of the night 73 on the year Eight straight points for the Tigers and theyve matched their largest lead Yeah good timeout by Kyle Smith Youre not going to wait for the TV timeout Eight nothing run for Clemson and theyre up seven on the road Well but theyve really suffocated Stanford The Cardinal just five of 16 from the field Well Stanford started out Roxy playing tremendous defense They they were really aggressive giving Clemson fits but Clemsons gotten back in this game defensively and now offensively Oscar Heilte down low and the freshman with the left hand drops it in Guy like that right out of a timeout you go right inside you establish yourself and score Great play call by Kyle Smith coming out of the timeout And for Clemson this run has been fueled by their bench Guys like Nick Davidson Chase Thompson Ace Buckner Here is Buckner with the runner and the rebound Jeremy Den Smith for the Cardinal Well youre right And thats the the strength of Clemson that their bench is their strength They play eight n eight deep and they they play guys that can give you something Jeremy Den Smith launches and the rebound but a Johnson for Clemson AJ Ro I mean I mean Oscar Hilt wanted that ball back uh inside He just wanted one more chance to get something to the rim And a steal by Jeremy Den Smith Oscar Hills brother Aiden Camman The step through the reverse Aiden Cam almost having an outof body experience tonight Id like to know what he had for pregame Roxy we saw him I just dont know what he had but Id eat some more of that I mean hes been on fire Tremendous tremendous performance by Aiden County career best 16 for Camman and a three back the other way Nick Davidson What a luxury having Nick Davidson back in this game playing with that kind of confidence I mean just when he thinks Stanfords going to make a run he just nails a three Come and and cool Aiden Cavin Why not Out of body Roxy I dont know if I was going to agree with you I do now I mean cheering we have not seen this from Aiden Cam at all As you mentioned a fivepoint a game scorer and hes putting it putting his team on the map Hed made four threes all season coming into tonight Hes got two in this game Well hes playing with confidence You think Yeah Confidence goes a long way But at Johnson the drop off the reverse missed by Chase Thompson but follows it up for Clemson Yeah big time plays That means Clemsons not leaving it to chance They are just really playing aggressively Theyre following their own shots and creating second chance opportunities Last years Minnesota Mr Basketball has a career best 10 off the bench for Brad Brownell This is a two possession game Roxy Stanfords right there Theyve been hanging tough and Corys been a little quiet lately Just two in the second half for the fantastic freshman Well theyre doing a good job defensively on him Benny Keeler left open three Yeah you cant give Benny Geler any kind of opportunity And who was it but Aiden Keman thats now playing point forward finding his senior sharp shooter Nine threes for the Cardinal crowd into it now Buckner the crossover step back and the rebound Oscar Heel secures it for Stanford Now dont look now Stanford has a chance to tie this back up or take the lead Theyre battling Jeremy Dent Smith weaves his way inside Off one foot Were tied Why not The veteran cheering division two player knocking down big shots Brad Brownell says Ive seen enough And he calls a timeout to settle his team down Yeah You want to talk about getting back in the game how about some Stanford standout here as well at Maples tonight Well they smell a heck of a game going on I mean this has been one heck of a basketball game Tied with 520 to play Stanford on their own 82 run after Clemson went on an 80 run Jay Godfrey steps through Blocked by Oscar Heelte but a foul will put Godfrey at the line Fourth on Oscar Heay Well watch the feet here Thats a little bit of a slide and step but no call in the travel And Oh that left foot stayed down Yeah a little bit of a stutter Not if youre Stanford Godfrey two for two from the line trying to give Clemson the lead again Next Wednesday nights cheering ACC Network double header features these Tigers again Clemson hosting Virginia Tech 7 Eastern and then Wake Forest in Atlanta taking on Damon Starttomires Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets Georgia Tech will be here by the way on Sun or Saturday to take on Stanford But both those games on ACC Network or the ESPN app as Godfrey goes one for two and its a onepoint lead for Clemson Iuka Okori forced way out Five to shoot Aiden Cam launches Cameman pulled down Benny Geler missing a put back and the rebound Clemson and a foul on Stanford And the discussion as Michael Irving talking to Joe Lindseay Stanford This is the rare occasion where theyre asking for a shot clock violation against them because then if they do deem it to be a shot clock violation theres no foul Yeah that doesnt happen very often But youre right if they can youd rather have that just a play on But I think if it does not hit anything looks like it did not hit anything that then would be did it get out of Gelers hands in time Theyll review this as they should This is a crucial call Onepoint game I mean both teams playing hard Stanford really hanging around Heres another look And Benny Geler had more time than he thought on this putback as he just flipped it thinking the shot clock was going to expire Then Carter Welling grabs the rebound And after the shot clock violation he was pushed But then so no foul shot clock violation Clemson basketball Yeah the right call and and Benny Giler was in a hurry and didnt draw And so when you dont hit the iron youre going to exhaust the shot clock So at least it saved this a foul and now Stanford gets to go back on the defensive end without having to give up free throws 440 to go onepoint lead The Clemson Tigers clinging to that margin here at Maples Thats the farm against the Stanford Cardinal ACC hoops for you late on this Wednesday night Yeah if youre Stanford you have to defend and keep Clemson off the glass And a steal by Aiden Cam took it away Yeah Who else Boy hes been active 10th Stanford steel tonight Jeremy Den Smith short on the three and the rebound out of the pack Here comes Ace Buckner Attacks Buckner to the basket Buckner in transition Hes hit some big baskets for his team Thats huge Hes Buckner racing up the floor and Clemson up three at the fourminute mark here of half number two Hey you talk about a player you know hes had a good game 14 points three assists and two steals but that 20 point mark might be a magic mark And if he can do that down the stretch hell help his team Theyre going to need him to get some assists guard some more points Oscar He turns middle and he gets the roll Yeah he can score in there Hes a real allpurpose player Hes long can go over the top Nice jump hook Onepoint lead for the Tigers applause with Ben Braun and our ACC Network crew Roxy Bernstein with you from Maples Game two of our West Coast double header for you on ACC Network Over the top for Davidson Stripped from the backside but a foul Boy Jeremy Den Smith thought he was off to the races He was but the officials stopped the race Tough play Tough call Yeah I I Thats a tough one Ah I dont usually be critical but lets move on Yeah sounds like a good idea Rox rather than be further incriminated I Two shots for Davidson What great heads up play Double bonus for the Tigers And it crawls in for Nick Davidson cheering Boy I place would have lit up if you let Jeremy D Smith go off to the races I think some good things would have happened but theres plenty of time left in this game Davidson who leads Clemson with 14 points Missed the second Oscar hell tell you the rebound The ball rebound Ball doesnt lie We used to say Cory drives Hes pushed on the way to the basket Theyre going to say before the shot it was on the floor and no continuation Now that new rule we got to look at this one The new rule says youre gathering and going up Fouls there Push doesnt dribble and takes it up A lot of referees will give you that continuation And Kyle Smith is pleading his case saying Look my player did not put the ball down and got fouled How does he not get the continuation Much like the NBA third on Justin Porter Ibuka Okori a one and one as that foul puts Stanford into the bonus One more for Oki And heres the danger If youre Clemson youve got to stop Okari because if hes not scoring on you from the perimeter he can get to the rim and he can draw fouls Stanford remains perfect at the line Theyre seven for seven Were tied 308 to play Right Corys after his hands cheering Ace Buckner drives off balance Benny Keeler The rebound for the Cardinal Shot clock at 10 Jeremy Den Smith bumped on his way to the bucket on the baseline and hell go to the line Thats smart basketball Jeremy Den Smith had an angle He had an angle Got by his defender and was able to draw the foul and sold it Thats great job Hell get a oneonone He wanted two Third on Dylan Hunter and Den Smith 85 from the line and he missed First miss for the Cardinal from the strike Thats usually a strength of Stanfords players Theyve been a pretty good free throw shooting team Dylan Hunter drives Step back by Hunter In and out And the rebound Last touch by Clemson cheering basketball Oh Clemsons checking that on their bench They may challenge this You dont have a lot of time And Kyle Smith saying Put the ball in play They cant delay the game here Come on And there is the challenge Nile Smith is hot Hes saying Look we we gave we gave Clemson a lot of time Clemson coaches challenge tie game The ruling on the floor with Stanford ball music So this is under review The call on the floor was Stanford ball Theres 206 to go in a tie game and it is challenged by Brad Brownell and Clemson I just dont see enough to change the call Theres another angle we have on it which shows it I think even a little better I I dont know Look as it was heading out I dont think Cam touched it again but I cant swear to Heres another angle Okay so watch the watch the right hand I dont see the right hand putting the touching the ball I I dont see it unless its there but I dont think it touched I I cant definitively say if it did or did not and it did not seem to change direction But referees as weve said earlier on previous challenges they must have enough evidence to overwhelmingly and definitively uh over I mean overrule this And I dont think theres enough And like the NBA rule theres the coachs challenge Now you get one per game If youre correct you get another Your limit is two You must have a timeout to be able to challenge a call Well and Kyle Smith was out there barking that he didnt think the challenge should even take place and and so theyre talking The officials are trying to say Look were weve given you the same luxury I know Ive been on the end of this argument Uh but I think if this thing doesnt get overturned you know Cal Smith pleading might have a little something to do Well see Theyre taking their time Roxy This is a long one and its got to be you know again when you take this much time that tells me maybe they dont have enough They want to make sure Youve got to make sure this call cant be changed unless youve got overwhelming evidence I dont know that theres overwhelming evidence And our officiating crew led by Joe Lindseay tonight with Michael Irving and Vladimir Voyard Tadal Thats a big call tied ball game going the other way Stanfords ball Thats huge Again the ruling on the floor the initial call was Stanford basketball on the baseline I think if it gets over ruled it wont just be Kyle Smith making a scene at Maples Brad Brownell though I think thats a good opportunity to challenge that because its a big possession Yet it gets the Coachs challenge by Clemson is unsuccessful Calling the floor stands back to Stanford Joe Lindseay saying the challenge was unsuccessful by Clemson All right play on So Kyle Smith I think made a case was heard and that cost Clemson a timeout and their ability to challenge They have one timeout remaining Stanford has a 30 and a full on the tie up It belongs to Stanford Clemson in the double bonus The Tigers have committed eight fouls and Ibuko Cory just lost it Diving for the loose ball trying to get a timeout He shovels it to an open Jeremy D Smith and the rebound Aiden Cman saves it right to Nick Davidson Clemson has it training sequence underneath the basket cheering inside 100 seconds in a tie game RJ Gotfrey bulldozes his way inside and draws the foul Hes given them a lift I mean when theyve needed to get to the rim hes gotten there Explosive play to the rim Sweep and drive Fourth on Aiden C Godfrey at the line Three for four nine points tonight Has played just 11 minutes Got early foul trouble in the first half Nothing but net wraps up the night in ACC hoops You can catch the show tonight after our game and tomorrow at 10 Eastern for the womens double header Nothing but net on ACC Network They got a block out here if youre Stanford Godfrey misses both and he missed everything cheering Ibuka Okori Aiden Cam and hustling for with the rebound and a foul on Clemson And its on Godfrey his fourth Thats a break for Stanford because Clemson looked like they were going to secure that their ball Heres a replay Theres a shot and the wrap around the hole And good call by the officials on that play One and one for Oscar Heel Team foul number nine on the Tigers Hells first trip to the line tonight Hes 58 on the year Eight points 10 rebounds for Heelte Hell averages 15 minutes and hes active Tied at 62 116 to play Stanford trying to snap a four game slide after a 144 start and they played their way to the bad side of the bubble in this recent stretch While Clemson has won 12 consecutive conference road games back to early last season and the Tigers have won 11 of their last 12 Theyre a game and a half behind Duke in sole possession of second right now in the ACC Clemsons done a great job This would be a huge win for Stanford over Brad Brownell and his team whos battling as well Great game too strong from Heel Tay and the rebound grabbed Dylan Hunter for the Tigers Yeah both teams leaving some points on the table at the free throw line Both Aiden Cam and Oscar Heay playing with four fouls Nick Davidson inside Step back in the key and the rebound grabbed by Oscar Hilte Well do you use a timeout here or you let him play Lets see if theyre going to let Stanford played through Somebodys better not to let the other team set up Roxbuka Okori splits the double team Jeremy Den Smith challenged on the shot and the loose ball diving for it Davidson and a foul on Stanford And Oscar Heelte is fouled out And Nick Davidson will shoot two at the other end What a sequence here Here we There was some contact No call Scramble for the ball Hilt underneath Nick Davidson Undercutting Davidson whos hustling Two shots for Davidson Two for three at the line tonight 249 remaining Davidson who leads Clemson with 14 points off the bench tonight for Brad Brownell Yeah Has had a big game Hes hit some big threes big shots These are big ones Clemson by one cheering Twopoint lead for the Tigers Stanford has timeouts if they want and theyre denying Clemson is Ibuka Okori who now gets it 15 seconds to go McCory on a step back Missed the three and the rebound and Buckner grabs it with 37 to go And hes played through rolling an ankle in the first half that had to get retained Well I saw the look in his eyes I said it at the time I didnt have much else to go on but I said hell be back Cuz he he gave a look to the trainer like Hurry up and get this thing wrapped up I got a game to play and he has played like his life depended on it Big free throws here Ace Buckner two for two at the line Nine points off the bench for the red shirt freshman One more for Buckner and this could seal it 37 to go and a chance to make it a twopossession game And Buckner does timeout Clemson 6662 Tigers Kyle Smith does have a timeout if he wants it IO Cory runs it up Well go to the basket lay it in and thatll take us to the end of the ball
