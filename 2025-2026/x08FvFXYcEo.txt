Steve didnt like that one You understand you want to stay aggressive but you dont want to foul 30 ft from the basket So heres Washington at the line And the free throw is no good By the way told you earlier in the first half that true Washington had 71 steals last year at New Mexico Ken Neil ACC legend provided that you had 150 in three years at Georgia Tech including 62 in your last season in Atlanta Lets go 62 steals for a guy who didnt raise his hands above his waist on defense How did that happen I didnt say I was a great on the ball defender I was a great offball defender Im going to call laughter Mike Finn See if we can get an update on the stats Im not sure you had 62 students Washington by the way gives Miami a onepoint lead Im glad we got that cleared up laughter tonight 62 No

back is good by Drew Washington That was a bad bounce but a happy bounce for Miami for Washington to finish that play And then a turnover Calm tried to feed Spillers He went looking for it Washington And a block is going to be called on Cal cheering and applause Itll be his second And true Washington is going to get another opportunity at the line He is three for five tonight Miamis eight nothing

game for true Washington You see this 221 is not trying to trap Its just trying to slow you down Yeah Coming up on two minutes to go in the ball game Spillers Drew Harris knocks down the open jumper Left it wide open Dennis Oh and now Wake gets the turnover calm and thought about it Harris will foul Oh boy you talk about confidence Juke Harris cheering said This is my joint tonight Hes on fire here Jay Lucas wants a timeout and Miami will get it with 96 seconds to go in the game cheering Heck of a sequence for Juke Harris First of all the open jump shot And then how about the deflection here He gets five points in 9 seconds And Coleman didnt force it A lot of guys get a steal like that You get caught up in the moment you force the shot No you go right back to the high hand And you see Matt Woodley hes working it isnt he Hes working it Especially with Spillers and Steve Forbes theyre going through this And heres Juke Harriss night How about this The numbers dont lie First half I thought he was being a good teammate but sometimes when youre that guy you got to be a little more aggressive but thats what your team needed in the second half So Harris tonight with 26 29 his career high applause and its his season high Hes been double figures every game Hes looking at his sixth 20point game of the year tonight tied of 75 with 136 to play Weve already had one lead game go to the extra session this year That was a triple overtime doozy Virginia Tech Virginia threw at us cheering Renew almost traveled and then Harris blocked it with 10 to shoot out of bounds to Miami A good job Spiller too staying down not fouling So Duke Harris to get that block right here No foul by Spiel under control Harris Good luck Renewed Is that going to be a foul It is The foul will be on Spillers Yeah thats a tough play for Spillers I thought at first he had good position but I think he was hooking as he was falling down Hooked his arm So here is Renew to the line He is three for three tonight from Miami Trying to break a 75 all time Miami 14 of 16 in the second half at the line And the free throw good Dont forget college football playoff semifinals start tomorrow night at the Vermo Fiesta Bowl Miami and Old Miss And then Friday night in Atlanta with Oregon and Indiana Coverage of both games kicks off at 730 Eastern 430 Pacific And the national championship game is a week from Monday night And Renu only bought one of them The door is a jaw 75 seconds to go in Winston Salem Spillers Foul line for Harris for the lead Left it short Mason the rebound Got to get out of trouble Tried to deflected out of bounds Itll stay with Wake Forest 18 to shoot Now that time they wanted Juke could drive the ball because the big fella stepped up Uday now you show and go by him with your quickness Here comes U in the game for Renew whos playing with four fouls Stephen that was Renew last play Y baseline for Juke Harris and knocked it out of bounds Thought the rim might be in the way And I think what Tony Henderson wants to do here is make sure the clock is set and theyre getting make sure the clocks right Yep So theyll put it in play Calm inbounds Harris to the basket and the foul applause So Harris will go to the line The foul is going to be on Ernest Uday Its his third But more importantly that is 10 on Miami Oh its on 88 Malovich It was originally now Stu Day So Malovich fouls out with three points and 587 to play Thats your threepoint shooting or spacer But more importantly for Wake Forest Juke Harris a chance to give the Digs the lead And under a minute to go here and two shots on the 10th foul against Wake against Miami right What was said at halftime to Juke Harris because we see two different players tonight Yeah great decision making when to shoot the three when to drive it Sophomore from Salsbury North Carolina Steve Forbes said in the off season Juke Harris is a worker And thats how you go from averaging 20 minutes and seven points against the ACC to scoring now 28 in a ball game tonight in conference play You are a warrior One of my favorite saying with these young men today if youre in the gym and nobodys watching you start playing the way hes playing the work dont lie Yep Onepoint lead for Wake applause Forest Donaldson into the front court to Renew Renew thought about it on the drive Spinners foul Thatll be four on Spillers before the shot I believe Jays asking for the continuation He say hes going up now Hes not winning that argument Fourth on Spillers So he drives in Theres the contact screaming Ah the little hesitation So Renew who missed the back end of a two shot chance a moment ago and he misses two in a row applause All right Now Wake Forest keep an eye on this Theyve got Belaloo four Harris four Spillers four Malovich is fouled out Renew has four for Miami applause And here is Renew And another free throw to tie the game Knocks it down And were locked up at 77 Mai Mason will check in for Omaha balloons And backcourt pressure offered here by Miami and Allen And look at the back Knocked it out of bounds First look at the coach behind the bench Everybody behind the bench says Diddy or Dy Look there we go The loop signs coming And now Harris with Look at Dantes tiny shoe being poised You kind of waste a little time partner Yeah And Jay Lucas go Come on Jay Lucas says I want to challenge again I won the first one Ill see if I can win this one So heres another look 3D and and watch Kisss uh reaction kind of how he puts his hands He kind of got real cool with it Oh boy Yep Well this shouldnt take long This shouldnt take long Partner Allen he was right on time He was there And meanwhile the review conducted at the table with AJ Desai Tony Henderson and Tommy Morrison Now partner as they figure this out once again I keep going back to shoot around this morning We know one thing about Steve Forbes He he has some stuff up his sleeve for situations And I asked him this morning how often do you get a chance to work on situations down one tie score up five wherever it may be And unless my glasses are wrong that looks like he gets off Calvin Yeah Yeah Yeah But the point Im trying to make here I just love what coach Steve Forbes does in these situations preparing his teams Trying to get it to Donaldson and does 19 to shoot for Miami Its tied at 77 Calvin defending him playing with three fouls Renew will shoot for the lead and it bounces out and followed home by Henderson Nine for Shelton Henderson And with 263 left to go Miamis got the lead at 7977 and a timeout taken by the Hurricanes Theyre out of timeouts Steve Forbes is going to have two left Yeah Jay pulled out an old NBA play with two high screens Miscommunication Thats why Hendersons way to sneak on the back door to get that rebound and finish it So remember the hero from Saturday started off like a house of fire tonight Nate Calvin Well one thing we know about Nate tonight hes making good decisions and right here the oldfashioned step back three off the dribble tonight Is it a music pick and roll Get some action Well and now one possession gains have become a by line for this Deacon team already Oh what I will say even those two losses coach Ford got a good shot They got a good shot So right here in this situation Im assuming again something goods going to happen Do they finish the play Its a twopoint lead for Miami Juke Harris has been redot Hes got the last nine for Wake Forest 13 of their last 17 and 16 of their last 22 Inbounds to Coleman Deacons have two timeouts Miami is empty Tom for Spillers Now for Harris against Donaldson And a foul will give Harris a couple of free throws with 114 left applause All your coaches watching you see how it was who I want the ball to be on the weak side of the floor misdirection handoff and get the ball to the best player to go score Hes at the free throw line Yep Harris at the line Hes got 28 tonight Hes one off his careerh high Hes had the last nine for Wake Forest And now likely has to intentionally miss this one Yeah its its a Im on the other side because were right at that 10 11 seconds If it was 6 or 7 seconds but go ahead and make this and put the pressure on Miami Make that a great shooting There you go partner There you go Oh that hurts Now that hurts And now you got a foul and Spillers will foul Henderson is shaken up on the play Spillers will foul out of the ball game with 90 to go and so theyre going to So heres the play Theyre going to walk to the monitors here because of the injury with Henderson Heres Henderson and Calvin collide Previous plays I did So nothing of more accidental running into each other Mark Armor the basketball trainer for Miami who used to be at Wake Forest for four seasons walks back to the locker room with Shelton Henderson So meanwhile Wake Forest has got to try and hope that Trey Donaldson misses a couple of free throws here or at least one of them At least one You need one thats trying to stay alive So you see the play This is from the other end of the floor Oh yeah this is fairly incidental I think Yeah And yep Miamis going to get free throws Miami number three two shots So incidental contact couple of free throws coming for Donaldson Tell you what one thing is uh being established Dennis that is if the first 19 conference games are any indication cheering were headed for some stuff The road teams have won the last four coming into the night and about half the ball games have been five or less or overtime All games have been good cheering Even the bottom teams are fighting even though theyre lo but theyre still fighting Donaldson at the line first to two perfect tonight and still is five for five screaming 80 to 77 cheering and applause and the second one good So that is 11 and a half and 21 in the game for Trey Donaldson tonight Cal needs to put it in play 7 seconds left Fourpoint lead for Miami And threw it away Heres Allen And hes just going to dribble this out And Miami snaps the 16game road losing streak in the ACC And the Canes are 20 and 132 overall
