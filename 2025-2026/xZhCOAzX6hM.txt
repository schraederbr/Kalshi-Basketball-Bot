ing shots for his teammates and he has a bigger role in this offense with Marcus Burton sidelined music since early December Thats Notre Dames best player Roger Ayers the head referee today along with Kip Kissinger and Tony Chiaza Notre Dame on offense first They have lost four straight and nine of 10 injuries have taken a toll One thing youll notice right away Anish is Ilu is going to spend the bulk of his time right at that ACC They dont have anybody that can space it out from the field But if this guy gets going Brady Kaylor a talented freshman from Indianapolis they need him to play well to space the floor Starting five for SMU all five average double figures in scoring Ruby Miller second in the ACC in assists Pierre coming off backto back 20point games Theres the seven foot turu Five to shoot Thats Washington with push in the house He gets a lot of uncontested looks because teams are so focused on the big three out in the back court But Washington a terrific player in his own right Transfer from Wah State can shoot it but a utility guy that does all the little things but he can knock it down from the perimeter as well Sera misfires Hes Notre Dames second leading scorer in conference play Andy Enfield the head coach for SMU second season as Mustangs head coach known as the shot doctor for a long time in basketball circles got into college coaching under Leonard Harrington at Florida State Hes done pretty well since then Here is Haroldson again One of the top freshman in the ACC Shot clock down to six Now its Serta leans into one left and short The rebound to Cory Washington Whoopy Miller The acceleration Its knocked out of bounds by SMU Micah Shrewberry in season three for the Irish One of the things he told us today SMU is an elite offense He said Hey you have to keep them out of transition The way to do that obviously avoid turnovers but good shots bad shots lead to fast breaks And he also goes Well itd be really nice if we didnt turn it over Yeah coach It was but I I think this guy right here is the key to everything that happens Hes the one guy that can create some looks and bang on Q and one You see the physicality that hes capable of playing with at 67 Uh and he loves this little Barkley dribble Were going to be able to take another look He gets down in the paint hes cut off you turn your back you make it happen And thats just pure athletic talent Hes got a lot of that are the fouls on Giron Pierre his first So Allisonson who was in foul trouble himself in a loss Saturday to Florida State still had 15 points in that game He completes the threepoint play Five 20point games this season for Haroldson averaging almost 16 a game in conference And thats going to be a problem for Notre Dame How do they handle SMUs size Theyre going to have to shift over on the help side a little bit further The problem with that though and weve already seen it with Washington out on the perimeter they have so many guys four of them that can knock it down from three You cant go over too far because hell beat you that way So this offense a welloiled machine for SMU but these things cant happen You got to keep them out of transition Live ball turnover Miller camps behind the arc and knocks down the three And this is where it gets dangerous for the Irish right Last game against Florida State Florida State got off to a 152 start to the game and youre constantly trying to dig yourself out of that hole You got to find ways to stop the bleeding early in the game Lot easier said than done when you have a point guard manning the ship at the point or a freshman point guard Harlson off the window Its cleaned by Igatoli Here comes Boopy Miller averaging 19 and almost seven Shot fake Pierre Extra pass Washington through the contact with two shots coming Little pick and roll action coming for Booby Miller coming off on the weak side That the help needs to come further over Cole Serta trying to get out to the corner You have to protect the basket first And then when youre out in transition you got to communicate to find guys Boopy Miller corner pocket will make you pay music Carson Tout who was the nations leading rebounder last year picks up the foul Hes a really good player at Northern Arizona Second team all big sky last year Big time defensive player Looks like a tight end is what he looks like Hes 68 250 and there is a less than zero chance that he might get a look by somebody when it comes to pro football One out of two for Washington rebounded by Tal averages nine and a half rebounds per game Top five in the ACC Sa short on the three Offensive rebound Kaylor Kaylor from 18 Brady Kaylor the freshman 610 from Fisers Indiana Went to Cathedral High School the same school as Micah Shrewberry So theres some familiarity there before he came to campus but you see the 610 frame with a 72 wingspan A lot to like but you better get out to a shooter Washington 49 from three in ACC play And for SMU they track all the advanced metrics When they reverse the ball their shooting percentage goes up by a big margin And a turnover by the Irish You got music to move it around the perimeter And SMU so far passing the rock sharing the sugar however you want that to happen BJ Edwards one more to Mr Wman accordingly just because of how the net fluctuates and Im not the biggest fan of the net but I feel like it needs to be talked about because the importance that the NCAA places on it but its a fluctuating scale You feel like you have to continue to remind people that what it is today is not necessarily what its going to be at the end of the season And if they get Cory Washington to keep scoring on a freshmans going to be just fine Yeah Washington eating early Hes got nine And a foul on Haroldson And it goes the other way Another turnover by Notre Dame This is just good positional defense by Cory Washington And you want to talk about a guy who does all the other things Get back in front of the play Legal guarding position Takes it to the chest Nice job Cory Washington Its a veteran play Theres a national team that gets the vast majority of its scoring from it starting five Throws it down You catch it up there you might as well finish it right Every bit of 72 and Jaylen Harlson on his way as well But now this tempo is getting going in SMUs favor SMU wants to play fast Miller off the screen to give and go put back Not there Tipped up A rebound to the freshman Harelson Harelson against Washington They get tangled up and the foul is on the senior Cory Washington his first You know I thought an interesting point when we talked to Micah Shrewsbury earlier today A lot of times when weve covered SMU earlier this season Anishh coaches are like Well we got to control tempo We got to control tempo Coach Rubberry was like We get a shot That bad boys got to go up because were not sure if were going to be able to create quality looks enough music So whenever they come open go ahead and take them Im not restricting my guys And theres a certain amount of freedom that comes with that but also a lot of responsibility Sir Mohamd takes a tough shot Yeah Sir Mohamd is someone this team feels can score He can create for others And Zo the bigger issue Marcus Burton wasnt just Notre Dames best player He was one of the best players in the ACC And the way this team was constructed the pieces were made to fit around Burton You take him out of the equation The whole thing almost implodes Miller screaming plus one Poopy Miller We talk about quick on quick Theres a few other sayings to talk about how quick he is but Im not going to say those Look how fast he gets on your hip And if youre Garrett Sundry you have to get over and then play vertically in legal guarding position Dont reach I know youre a sophomore I know its still the beginning of your college career These are the times Youre in February of year two You need to get out in front of the ball at 610 Give your guys some help Theres Marcus Burton Suffered a broken ankle on December 5th against TCU Last year he led the ACC in scoring Former ACC rookie of the year Logan in there Got Mohamd again Shot altered You know Anise you brought up a great point where when Burton gets hurt everybody on the roster was geared around him You set up your roster with a lot of shooters that can they can space the floor on the perimeter and you give a guy like Burton who can get downhill and you see the difference with and without I mean its massive just from a ball control standpoint But you have guys on the perimeter that can shoot it Shrewsbury Sunre is a terrific guy on the perimeter You were able to give him space He gets hurt and completely ruins Christmas as far as if youre a Notre Dame fan But now you kind of have to make it happen Opportunity knocks for some of these other guys It wasnt just Christmas It was Christmas New Years maybe Valentines Day Heres Tombs Talented freshman He is flashed off the bench and you can see why Its a big time move I saw him play for Drive Nation on the Nike EyL circuit and you could see the soft hands the want to on the defensive end He still has some things he has to work on positionally but this is a guy who has a bright future in a Mustangs uniform because he can do so much for you on the floor Talking to Braden Shrewsbury he wants to do a little more of that Be more aggressive off the bounce not just settle for outside threes TOMBS WITH A SIZE ADVANTAGE THIS SKIP PASS picked off by Mohhamd Sir Mohamd the son of longtime NBA player Nazi Mohamd Shrewberry hits the three Get five of those and 21 points against SMU last year And a much better start to this game for Shrewberry against an SMU team that can defend Last game against Florida State Struggled out of the gate Need them to get going and just keep it close Notre Dame has fought back in a lot of these contests just havent been able to music stay in it SMU eight field goals They And heres the thing I I think the understanding of hey we got to get the right coaches involved after So now you look at some of these new hires Jay Lucas you look at some like John S having success Andy Enfield going to SMU uh embracing the portal embracing all these new age of college basketball The ACCs back and I feel like its only begun as the reemergence If they do get eight teams that would be the most since 2018 when the ACC at nine Germaine ONeal Jr Son of a sixtime NBA Allstar in that last three Shrewsbury the coachs son stepped out of bounds You set up shots by continuing to move the ball Jeron Pierre you dont help from the strong side And Germaine ONeal Jr this is a guy that of course hes an NBA player son And theres Germaine right there Fantastic glasses by the way And I cant afford that chain Its as much as my car But I digress He was late to the game right But he has all these natural physical tools especially as a defensive player Hes a guy thats going to continue improving in his time in Dallas You can see the offensive strikes he started to make That guy can do that Cole Serto if you watch the Virginia game when he went for 34 points hes had at least four threes in three of the last four games Pierre rebound to Serta Hines looking to push Shrewberry over Miller Theres the front wing coming back out Serta and Pierre turns it over Ill say this about Cole Sera The man is confident and he will shoot him from deep and he always has his feet set Good size able to see over the top of the defense knock down three from the left 45 You mentioned 34 points over the last what four games over 18 points per This is a guy playing with a lot of confidence right now You cant give him daylight Midway point first half Shot clock down to two Mohamd launches and connects Why not Talk about NBA player sons Sir Mohamd making an impact on his game right now as well Yeah he and Germaine ONeal Azy Mohamd and Germaine ONeal contemporaries in the NBA Tombs taken away by Mohamd Five turnovers now for SMU Irish in the midst of a 60 run Sera finds on the back door Notre Dame within two Timeout Andy Enfield Back door to a freshman Those things cant happen Andy Infield music he needs a timeout Irish making an impact on this game Germaine ONeal Jr right corner Thats a three on the other side This was at the end of the shot clock Sir Muhammad terrific player in his own right Hes been dealing with some injury stuff earlier in his college career but is a guy from Myers Park High School in Charlotte right down the road from you Anish who can really play Hes got positional size Still getting comfortable Terrific pass by Yugato Thats Miller His second three Hes got nine Yollu is big We all get that 7 foot2 But to catch it in a roll see the help site come over and be able to swing to that opposite corner is next level stuff And if you can be a decision maker in that short role your opportunities at music the next level if the NBA fine in Europe fine youre going to have a shot just as a decision maker if nothing else Its a big time play Shot clock winding down Mohamd pass tipped Gets it back Shrewberry did not beat the clock Michael Shrewberry not happy but Yigolu short roll decisionmaking How quick can you make something happen He understands where the defense is coming from And Boopy Miller checks the wind and fires away Were seeing a pattern here SMU doesnt have the best defensive numbers Tio Notre Dames had to work deep into the shot clock often here in the first half Thats a great point and really just walling off the ball SMU likes to switch one through four and its been hurting Notre Dame Meanwhile Pierre born scorer Conference USA player of the year and scoring champ last year at Jacksonville State Wellveraveled and hes an isolation wizard Give it to him at the end of the clock Hell make something happen for you Harlson finding tout overu and the tip in is there Jaylen Harlson with seven backing downtown now on the kicking off three and its poopy again Third three of the half He leads all scores with a dozen I really like the composure by I keep going back to it But his ability to survey the defense understand where that second defender is coming from is huge for this Mustangs team Heres Tout down low what Andy Anfield and the coaches were telling us today but really the first time in Migolus career where the offense runs through him and theyre playing through him more Thats something he didnt get a lot when he was back in Turkey Here he is lost it on the way up Its tipped They get a foul and its going to be on Yigolu music Throw it into the post has been terrific so far between Higato and Boopy Miller One really tall music one really small but they work together in harmony Terrific passing between the two Theyve ended up in dunks theyve ended up in threes and they are playing really well together so far That twoman game special Im not saying Stockton M alone but theyre playing like it here early I thought you were going to go magic to Kareem but okay Kareem wasnt moving like that But he gets three assists His careerhigh is five I like his chances Now Buffy Miller picking up Haroldson full court Miller averages almost two steals per game Harelson with almost a 7 in size advantage I think the big thing with Harelson is is hes forced to move up a position and play the point Nice set up Shrewberry off the screen Man thats just really good footwork by Braden Shrewsbury to come off square his body and use that right foot as his pivot and swing into that shot Ter terrific after timeout play by Pops to get his son open Both teams shooting it well Notre Dame at 50 SMU 12 out of 18 six of nine from three He can wants it Shot clock at three at two Pierre instead the step back He gets over tries to keep it alive and its knocked out of bounds I like the decisive difference on the defensive end but Ill get to that in a second Look at Shrewsbury come off Fake flex screen goes off the down and that is just really nice work by Shrewberry to get his hips swiveled around You get your hips turned to the basket your shoulders follow Hes a big time shooter But on that defensive possession Anishh SMU gets the ball to Yigolu They trap right away And what happens there is theres no ambiguity as to what youre going to do on the defensive end People start to shift right away to where their spots are going to be And then it gives you a little bit more of an advantage because at least positionally you know exactly where youre going to be Foul on BJ Davis Ray his first team Wheeler with his hand in the passing lane comes back Shrewsbury using the pump fake Shot clock again Down to five Shrewberry over to Serta with three and pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the leprechaun Thats a big time shot Big time analogy by you My man shot it to the moon right there Washington wants to pick from that doesnt take it Miller thought about the long three Washington inside a foul against Notre Dame as he gets battled for the board Its on T Carson Touts got his hands full I think hes giving up about 6 to 8 ines in music height and hes going to have to grab and hold a little bit on the defensive end especially on the glass just to make things work But IU now checking out And Tout goes to the bench with two fouls And remember Kevin Jai who was the backup big a senior a backline communicator Hes out for the season with a knee injury So with Tout on the bench Notre Dame inexperienced somewhat vulnerable down low I think your point about backline communicator is the biggest one He understood all the coverages defensively of what the Irish music wanted to do there And then he had Carson Tal who needs to be that guy It makes it hard in the half courtyard screaming PUT THAT ON SPORTS CENTER This team is fun to watch when they get ahead when they get downhill Long three Sera with the answer And Notre Dame going punch for punch with SMU in this opening half Both teams shooting the cover off the ball combined 12 of 22 between both Been an offensive explosion Theres Miller Hes got a dozen Foot on the line Davis Ray too strong Now Notre Dame with a chance to take the lead Irish six of 11 from three today Their only lead in this game was at two nothing SMUs led by as many as 10 and Tombs picks up the foul And if youre Notre Dame you cant take bad shots because if SMU gets out in transition you can forget about it Hey Boopy throw it out Jam Pierre can finish way above the rim Terrific music play Weve got a ball game here in Dallas Fortunately he did it to his own guy Dunks on Germaine ONeal Jr in a game against Florida State You can music see ONeals expression He caught a body but the wrong one this time Little throw down in transition off the great feed from Poopy Miller 20 points in backtoback games He had 28 recently Eight 20point games on the season He is a scorer He absolutely is And hes been that his entire career And I believe he needs five more points to reach 2000 for his career Thats a lot of buckets I enjoy the alley variety Four points three rebounds three assists in this opening half for Pierre Now hes defending Harlson I get comes over to help Shrewsbury has a shot blocked by Washington Here comes Pierre RIGHT DOWN THE HILL Lost it out of bounds You know what I I think Notre Dames willingness to embrace the pace and the tempo of what SMU is liking to do has actually opened up their game a little bit because theyre playing with a little bit more confidence a little bit more free And we talked to coach Ruseberry about that Hey take that first best look available Just dont turn the basketball over and youre seeing a Notre Dame Fighting Irish team thats playing well early as a result And if thats Eglu thats three or two excuse me That is his second So both starting big men Tout with two fouls for the Irish IU with two for SMU Tombs the backup big for SMU also has two fouls Itll be a one and one for Shrewsbury Tomorrow night an ACC Network basketball double header Number 20 Clemson hosting Virginia Tech Then its Wake Forest and Georgia Tech in Atlanta I kind of get the sense to you and I and I know youre youre not one of these people but Clemsons not being talked about enough in the ACC Well what they do is not necessarily the sexiest thing right Well they win They win Thats pretty sexy I Yeah youre absolutely right there But I mean the manner in which they do it very balanced offense Nobody averages more than 13 a game Its kind of the antithesis of what SMU is right SMU is playing with the floor trying to force on the other side of that Terrific positionally the best defensive team in the conference in terms of defensive efficiency metrics and they share the basketball Haroldson going at Sam Walters who hit the last three for SMU Walters former Alabama Michigan player back to Pierre too much Irish can take the lead here They have not led since early in this game Two minutes to go Opening half Both teams have shot it well Haroldson draws the foul on Walters Jaylen Harelsons been assertive If if theres anything we can say its that four of six from the field but just continuing to attack He pulls up he reengages and hes so strong physically Hes a load to contain Hes not a guy thats going to blow past you with his quickness Hes going to use that frame to put his shoulder on you and try to find opportunities around the rim Its hard these days to project one year to the next because player movement is a free throw But if Marcus Burton comes back next year and Jaylen Harlson comes back the experience Haroldson has gained by playing point guard being the initiator now you add Burton back to the mix How much does that help Notre Dame a year from now Its going to be huge Just have a secondary creator on the floor and they also have one more player coming in than John Sanderson son of strength coach John Sanderson over on the Notre Dame bench who could really go So youre going to add some more decision making both returning from injury and in the freshman class of next season to go along with all these shooters out on the perimeter that Notre Dame has And its different at Notre Dame Theyre looking to hang on to players for 2 three four years because of the type of institution it is And if theyre able to do that they could be dangerous with the talent coming back and coming in Edwards has had a quiet first half Big Mitchell Holmes 13 and white in the game Pierre tries to drop it off and it goes off Walters And Notre Dame a team that came in having lost four in a row nine of 10 has played SMU to a stalemate with 128 to go in the first half And there is the aforementioned Notre Dame strength coach John Sanderson was my strength coach and hes got a son that can really go Plays at La Lumiere and hes going to help this Notre Dame team with their decision making in their toughness and they need more of that cuz they have guys that are skilled and can play Theyre good players Whos their setup guy when Marcus Burton went out of the lineup You get Burton back You get John John back Changes it Miller slithering and surgical Just an unbelievable play from an unbelievable player And hes been an unbelievable player all season long The quickness is almost impossible to keep in front even for the help side 14 points and several of them with a high degree of difficulty And the efficiency five of six from the field three of three from beyond the arc Perfect at the strike Four assists just one turnover for Poopy who in the win Saturday against Pit has 20 points nine assists and most importantly no turnovers Allisons got 10 to lead the Irish Serta picked up by Holmes 10 to shoot Taylor off bounce by Holmes Edwards triggers transition Knocked out of bounds Last touch Notre Dame You know I think an interesting point about this Notre Dame team Anishh is the fact that they have so many younger music players They drive without necessarily a plan right So as youre going in you need to know where the help side could potentially come from first Harelson doesnt know that quite yet Hes young Same with Caleb Why not Miller over Sundra is feeling it 18 in the first half on six of seven shooting That ball spun sideways It doesnt matter Boopy is a bucket and music Micah Shrewsburg Is that good I think so Hey defense optional today in Dallas Just like when Donic was down the road I tell you what Andy Enfield told us he wants to play games in the 80s in the 90s They want to run Harlson puts it on the floor and another turnover Its three turnovers for Harelson Seven on the Irish 47 music seconds Give it to Boopy and get out of the way The Virginia Tech game A Boopy hit the game winner Here comes Boopy Deep three And that would have been the piece resistance to close the half It was almost a perfect half I mean security Well the halfs about to start No more pictures for a little while Bob inside You lost it Tout Reeves Ill say this when I went out of the game in the first half with two fouls That was a massive change in how SMU attacked Notre Dames defense Keep an eye out for how physical he allows himself to be on the defensive end of the floor Both he and playing with two fouls to begin the second half tried to shoot again Working late in the shot clock Alex Kaylor with two 11 on the shot clock I think Brady Kaylor you you see him in your picture Number six Hes got a lot of longterm potential Anish its about putting it together adding some more weight in the weight room Something hes capable of Hes got the frame hes got the skill Those things get even better with time Harlson looking for help Almost a 5second violation and Kaylor uncontested beats the shot clock Then thats a killer Andy Infield and his staff worked exclusively on that sagger screen off the baseline And a slight lapse in concentration leads to a dunk Thats got to drive you crazy as a staff Edwards scoreless in the opening half Now you get three assists Theres the double Theres the skip One more and Miller cant save it That time the welltimed double by Notre Dame leads to the turnover And if youre asking me you almost guard this Perfect Look at Shrewsbury coming off the stagger Quick switch with Yigolu and then you lose sight of where the balls at Cory Washington turns his head Brady Kaylor finishes with two Just a nice job by Harelson not losing his composure about 4 and 12 seconds into the five count Carlson against the smaller Miller Harrison trying to draw the foul Uses the body Hes got a dozen Believe thats called bully ball for two How strong Harelson 67 220 Only a freshman Washington over Shlbury Theres tout to secure the count Not can take the lead with a three Tie with a two Serta too much offensive rebound Haroldson screaming the put back by Tout cheering and now the hard part Carson Tout to the free throw line where he has missed 10 in a row He is 0 for7 Saturday against Florida State and on the season just 37 An interesting thing here Carson Tout looks to bank in all of his free throws And we were watching him warm up today And this came from coach Shrewsbury and his staff looking at the Korean Basketball League I know this is way out of left field but follow me They you exclusively use the backboard and players that do that in that league were shooting 80 And with Carson Tout they figured lets give it a go to no avail Now missed 11 in a row But youre trying to switch things out and giving him a definite point of contact when shooting free throws Im okay with it now at this point You know theyre willing to try anything with talent 0 for seven Saturday at the line against Florida State 11 straight misses Now Germaine ONeal Junior No Taylor is there as a freshman 51 from the line Numbers have steadily gone down from there The outfield has got to his bench early in the second half Roseberry turns it over Edwards the ACC leader in steals That was a kick Edwards was open ONeal down low It is a held ball Possession arrow to Notre Dame As hot as SMU was in the music first half it has been frigid once the doors open to come out here for the second Andy Infield got to find a way to get a decent look Theyve missed a couple of easy ones sure but feels like the floodgates will open You just need to get one to go through And this is the type of game where if SMU loses to Notre Dame at home thats a quad three loss That is a scar on your resume Its a killer Right now SMU projected nine seed A loss might put you on the bubble Thats a huge point And heres the thing If its a quad three loss cant have that when youre currently sitting as Joe Lards nine seat So you lose this one Youre constantly in catchup Need to find a way to find some rhythm And Notre Dames here to play man They call a health ball again this time to SMU Yeah And the Irish theyve lost four in a row Theyve lost nine of 10 As you look at the resume for SMU three quad one wins They are undefeated against quad three and quad four Really no scars on their resume today And theyve already played the hard teams in the ACC Lake Duke Clemson Virginia NC State Louisville They waxed North Carolina in their ACC opener That was the Bookie Miller invitation He was awesome that game Been awesome this game Second half a little bit of a stall Dont give him a That was close They waving it off Basket interference on Yiglu And Yiglu heres the thing When youre in Europe and that ball sits on the rim you can put it in This was a nice move by Boopy Miller You need to finish it though But you look at it Does it come off the cylinder It was still right there on it It was close Man offense has been hard to come by here SMU 0 for three with three turnovers through about four minutes in this second half Sort of puts it on the floor Out down low puts it in over Miller And the Irish have the lead 4543 I think switching defense by no name has been tough for SMU to kind of find out because SMU is at their best on offense when the ball changes sides Well SMU switching or switching makes it hard Miller using a turbo boost ONeal gathers taken away by Taylor called timeout music by Notre Dame Theyre going to get the ball but you send two to the ball You got to find somebody around the rim Carson Tout music not your offensive player Finds two I was hoping Cory Washington would be on the court but he is not at the moment for SMU Tag the whole team together Shrewberry with a three Thats his third triple Hes got 10 and Notre Dame seven of 14 from three And two of those threes have come off pin downs from different angles So you can always tell when a kids been coached by his dad at any level because those fundamentals are really solid and his ability to get his weight distribution correct before the shot is elite No follows No third time is a charm They say the postman rings twice He rang more than twice that time Just big music time work from a really big guy Anish Just a really solid player The effort certainly helps It also helps when youre 72 Sure But the Turkish music bigman his third foul as we went to break My mans battling but when youre going up against 7 foot2 and youre standing about 67 and a half you have your hands full and it goes back in these to not having depth in the front court because of Kev Jai being out for the music season with injury Kev Jai out with a knee injury His career is over Touts got three fouls And Micah Shrewsbury said they got some big players Theyre young Theyre inexperienced And they missed the communication aspect No good Golu follows his miss Heres Washington He knocks down the three His third three Hes got a cousin He came in shooting 49 for three in this game They went from down three to up two in one possession And thats a killer if youre guys are hanging in Nice slip Haroldson beats the defense down low Thats twice Notre Dame has been able to get behind that SMU defense this half SMU switching one through four out on the perimeter You have to put pressure on the rim in different ways Terrific pass Better finish I toldu hes going to have a mismatch here No J t on the bench right using his big broad shoulders to see over the top But hes listed at 72 music Hes every bit of it There was a player at West Virginia many years ago that West Virginia playbyplay man Tony Kedi affectionately nicknamed the Istanbull Denny Kitla from Turkey We got another Istanbul here and cement Yigola Sundra on the three The rebound Go right back to the big guy Fouled right now with Tout on the bench No Kebai It looks like hes going to have his way Absolutely And theres Kebai right there at the end of the Notre Dame bench But on the other side when youre SMU and youre switching everything Notre Dame needs to find creative ways to get open Quick down screen on the top side Late in your help You got to get underneath the guy thats looking to slip or screen if you are switching Thats just really good offensive basketball by the Irish finding the slip man for an easy dunk And you notice too small detail here how spaced out the floor was Five out five wide Yigu away from the rim Really opens up some chances at the basket Only a 55 free throw shooter Jaden Tunes getting ready to check in So again Notre Dame a lack of size SMU perhaps going big Yeah well see who hes coming in for I I just my thing right now is you got to finish box out rebounds Thats twice now off free throw misses Edwards still without a point And you wonder why are they going to so consistently thats I dont love that foul Notre Dame Yeah Notre Dames switching everything as well So whats happening is as IOU goes out of the game Youre creating an advantage by having to bring multiple music people to the ball And thats where SMU has been getting shots in the second half because he requires so much attention since youre unders sized So tombs now in the 610 freshman from Amarillo Texas Deflected out by Miller No Haroldson on the floor How does Notre offense I I think the big thing is is especially with the lineup thats in the game right now for SMU you need to try to get after Jaden Tombs a little bit Hes a guy that struggles guarding ball screens and here we are in that action You get him away from the rim Got to be able to finish Miller off balance able to draw the foul and he is an excellent free throw shooter How tough is he physically I I mean they almost ran him over two three times Look at his pursuit of this basketball I want it more than you do And then hes got to battle two people off to get it to the foul line Well they called it on the ground I apologize Poopy Miller Roger Andrews got to take care of Have no fear Rogers got it Pierre gets the corner three Hes got 72 points away from 2000 for his career Harrison back in there going right at Washington and a blocking foul No basket a freshman against the senior Were going to be able to take another look at this one Nation I want your opinion before I put mine out there Cory Washington getting over in front of the defense What do you think Not sure he had legal guarding position Looked like he was moving Im 100 with you That was a good call by the officiating crew Hes about 6 in away from legal guarding position but good call SMU faithful disagrees Boine fertilizer got popular real quick Yeah it did And that was a point of emphasis today too I mean we were at shootound and one of the key takeaways was hey Jay Jaylen Harelson hes not going to blow by you but he is going to try to muscle through you Get their legal guarding position youre going to be able to take a charge and get him in foul trouble I dont know if Kaylor thought that ball was tipped Thats another turnover Micah Shersbury looks like hes about to lose his mind Got a lot of young players handling the ball and this is what happens right Not makes that run SMU with an answer The Irish right there at 5050 A 60 run by SMU since and we get a foul down low And again thats trying to defend this It feels like SMU knows that theyve got a size music advantage and theyre about to at least attempt to exploit it thousand And thats where IU has gotten some success for this team And not only that it helps with your offensive rebounding as well Thats a big bucket for Jeron Pierre 2000 career points for Pierre 80 run for SMU 132 run overall Sha on the drive The may have bothered it Ill say this Notre Dames offense when its functioning well theres a lot more space And over the last couple of possessions SMUs been diligent screaming An impetus to go inside Thats Jaden Tombs I mean thats just a grown man finish set up by Boopy music Miller Little step up ball screen Nice roll and help A little bit too late Jaylen Harlson you got to get outside that charge circle Thats three now on the freshman Harelson I I really like the lineup versatility for SMU being able to go big at the 45 with Tombs and Nigatu because it helps your backboard a lot in terms of rebounding on both sides of the ball and whenever theyre asserting themselves inside 15 ft because they have shooters Sometimes you can settle It really changes how they play You can really jump their physicality level Haroldson spin cycle blocked Edwards Pierre catch 14 unanswered by SMU The last 3 minutes and 50 something seconds But what a block that leads to transition And sometimes theyre not turnovers theyre bad shots and they lead to open looks like this And for a guy like Jeron Pierre thats target practice in the corner celebrating with his guys Pierre the block on one end the triple on the other SMU 11 for 20 from three 14 unanswered Its a 192 run over about four minutes Meanwhile the Irish have gone three and a half minutes since their last score music It all started with being assertive in the paint And they started out slow in the second half settling for jump shots not playing physically And that guy right there Higato was the guy who was the catalyst to playing with a little bit more force So what ended up happening that translated to the defensive end of the floor Now theyre getting stops Theyre getting out of running And crew is low Open with a three Trap continues for the Irish Edwards down to Shrewsbury Shrewberry off the dribble His fourth three Hes got 13 find that guy in transition Interesting play here by the Irish going two3 zone You still got to box up Edwards without a point but he has six rebounds four assists today And listen this is good patience by Braden Shrewberry We talk about his footwork all the time Quick swing Tombs day late a dollar short getting back on defense and Shrewberry knocks it through Big time shooter Four threes six attempts for Shrewsbury The last foul on Boopy Miller his first SMU 122 at home this season Notre Dame reeling Theyve lost four in a row Theyve lost nine of 10 And injuries a big part of their season story A little bit of a chess match happening right now Now SMU sees Notre Dame going zone They switch to a smaller lineup with only Tombs on the floor But more shooting out there Carlson over Pierre 16 for Jaylen Haroldson Now you see Notre Dame staying in this matchup zone Look how extended out and open looks Youre starting to feel it scene for Gerard Pier Doesnt get much easier than that And you have to communicate if youre in those top two spots in a two3 zone because if two guys are on the ball that is depth Pierre commits the foul his third I mean just moving the basketball against the zone will get you a million miles And heres the deal If youre colderted you have to get up there quicker And the communication has to be at a higher level And if youre in that back middle whether youre Carson Tout or whoevers in the game playing the middle of that two3 zone you have to be orchestrating your wings and letting those guys know where the matchup is at The communication is essential on that side of the floor Whenever you have a young bunch out there playing with Irish just three of seven from the free throw line tomorrow night its an ACC Network double header number 20 Clemson hosting bubble bound Virginia Tech Then Wake goes to Georgia Tech You know its easy to keep coming back to well theres no Marcus Burton What compounds the challenge for Notre Dame Harold again a freshman 64 from the free throw line So Burton was a guy who could get to the free throw line often whenever he wanted He was one of the best free throw shooters in the country 80 90 But now missed that So Notre Dame for the first time in a long time a four free throw shooting team because the guys getting to the free throw line are as skilled as Demarcus Burton sure would get the bulk of the free throw attempts Shrewberry no is there Mustangs run puts it on the floor away by Haroldson Volleyball spike Good transition defense Notre Dame continuing to communicate That might be one that I dish off to Egolu right there Let the big fell big fella finish Miller for three Ill say this Carson Tal hes giving up about seven inches in height Hes battling his backside off and hes doing all he can Hes got his hands full with Yigu Tout began his career as a walkon last year at Northern Arizona Averaged a double double led the nation in rebounding like the substitution Well be out of the game for about 30ish seconds screaming Harrison stripped and a foul Shiron Pierre nearly brought the roof music of Moody Coliseum crashing down Unbelievable BJ Edwards gets one Lets go around the world and back again Geron Pierre are you kidding me Dun dogs This was in the first half and then he brought sonic chaos to Big D in transition channeling his inner Dominique Wilkins I mean thats just incredible I almost knocked you over to you Yeah you did I mean his ability to get out in transition 2008 points What a way to go My goodness That was a wham bam thank you maam jam is what that was Unbelievable little rocket by baby Fourth school in six years Southern Miss for two years Witchah State for two Jacksonville State Now SMU Allison at the free throw line Hes led the way for the Irish with 18 Closing in on his sixth 20point game of the season from the former McDonalds AllAmerican Hey hes been good And heres the thing Burton goes out Hes given all this responsibility 18 points on an efficient night shooting six turnovers Thats where the issue is right And everybody wants to handle the ball all the time until youre forced to handle the ball all the time And hes capable Theres a lot on his plate and a lot of decision making on his plate whos having to play through some of these difficult decision making comebacks if you will Washington contested He makes the little player down the road No question But these are the growing pains now And you know this is the sixth time where hes had at least five turnovers in a game this season And as we said earlier that was not supposed to be his goal when the season began Certain knocks down a three Again you can see the pieces Yeah I think the challenge for Michael Shrewsbury and his staff is okay can we keep some of these guys together bring Burton back they have the makings of a pretty good foundation for next year In the near term its a different outlook as Edwards knocks down a three his first points of the night Theyre really knocking down shots And I mean heres the thing Its just simple creation Notre Dames in the gaps and thats a shot that right now the way college music defense is out of different ways whether its an isolation as a catch and shoot three guys more than 2000 points You cant do it one way and hes been spectacular out in transition finding spots his teammates are looking for him and he is shot off the ball today and of course when you do things like this add a little seasoning to your offensive music performance and the scouting report on him and weve heard this from other coaches when hes got the ball hes going to shoot and hes dished out five assists today Theyve overcommitted to him at times today and for good reason you you almost want some of these other guys to score but he has that capability of being that unselfish playmaker But lets not get it twisted He knows why hes in Dallas He has to get a couple He is three points away from his third straight 20point game Taylor tries to split the double The defensive intensity has really turned up Sera with no room Mohamd no call over tombs beats the shot clock He wanted a foul No home runs against SMU Thats getting right back up That was a check for Pierre Foul on the floor Thats T Thats his fourth What about Sir Mohamd though I mean getting to the middle at the end of the shot clock Little left knee slide to the face Its a tough look Meanwhile Tout picks up his fourth He exits Garrett Sundra 611 sophomore from Ashurn Virginia is in Sun comes in a little three Communications got to be great right now Tons Double big lineups a beast especially with tout out of the game Mohamd wants the screen on the switch Serta through the contact with a chance for a threepoint play Cole Sera has been assertive pretty much all game long and hes got the smaller Boopy Miller who Boopy has done a nice job on him defensively but you know this is a guy who can score it and confidence is never an issue for him Five of 12 from the field 14 points understands his role as a guy whos really going to attack on the offensive end That is a rare free throw miss by Serta who was at 91 entering play Miller step back baseline He controlled the offensive rebound Pierre working the baseline Ran out of real estate which is expensive in these parts especially You know when you go on Zillow and just cuz youre curious Dont do that in Highland Park Texas Just save yourself the trouble and the heartache What a what an area is located Get a good fixer upper around here You can set up some music to skip Taylor has the three rattle in I keep going back to it and but you see the pieces This games not over eight but this is where SMU found some success going to the big guy Taylor Kaylor all of a sudden a two possession game Lot of size right there Not a lot of girth but a lot of height And music those guys have length And Kaylor Im telling you 610 handling in an open floor Nice bounce pass music Thats big time They got to keep it out of this guys hands Boopy Miller is a problem jumping on one side finishing music on the other That is silky smooth Miller came into the game sixth in the ACC in points second in assists top 10 in steals and hes now authored his 12th 20point game of the season Is he a first team allconerence player in your book I had Quadier Copeland there the other day I dont know what I was thinking I I think Boopy Millers right there You know heres my thing when it come and I have a vote for all conference Like its a its very much a team music award as well I I feel like with 18 teams in the league you know you going full Eric Green like he did at Virginia Tech and scoring all those points that doesnt really impress me You you have to win as a team in order to be recognized at the end of the season If SMU makes the tournament and he makes some noise in the ACC tournament like to me hes very deserving Edwards you know you have to get that You have to get that ballad in before the ACC tournament 100 100 And that slipped my mind from that Im sure youre both counted Thats No 100 And that did slip my mind So thank you for that But they dont do mailins for ACC tournaments Exactly right Exactly right No I just think if SMU finishes in the top six to seven of this league I think hes certainly deserving Um as it stands now I would have him on second team just because of where SMU is on the top of the conference standing at 500 prior to the end of this game Big win tonight but its only a quart three win I just off the remaining schedule for SMU fourth easiest amongst ACC teams Edwards has had a tough night shoot but hes done everything else Two down low going right at Sundra The lead is eight McGuire got last missed by five in a row Washington on the switch That goes to Taylor We step aside under four music media timeout 324 left Basketball is presented by Tro Price Invest with confidence Giron Pierre Jr playing with confidence music tonight 17 points including a couple of showstopper dunks Notre Dame offensively for the most part has tried to go toetotoe with SMU shooting 54 for the game They have not shot better than 50 since December 10th against Idaho That was their first game without Marcus Burton down Short of fage and banks deposit slip for the sophomore Theyre playing him really tight on the perimeter Hes having to put it on the deck and hes showing a little bit of versatility and how he can attack you on the offensive end of the floor Known as a shooter doing a nice job being creative off 78 of his shots and threes Hes got 16 Edwards cool Hes now one for six on the offensive rebound Now a tie up and a foul and the Irish cant believe it Its on IS and that puts SMU with a bonus The Irish need to be careful here because theyre arguing a lot of foul calls right now and theyre still very much in this game And if youre IMS you cant belly flop on the guy who has the ball What are we What are we confused about here Clearly a foul certain needs to be careful He he approached approached the officials Im not going to say aggressively Might not be the long the right turn but with a lot of enthusiasm You got to be careful at this point Down six on the way A timeout by Andy Enfield Thats the third offensive rebound for SMU off of a missed free throw Thats a killer Got to take care of those And its just them being overpowered on that end of the floor 14 offensive rebounds for the Mustangs Just sixing up against 72 against Tout whos listed at 68 Miller and Yugato Thats been a good combo tonight Washington puts it on the floor over top who had the four fouls and thats 14 for Cory Washington Its interesting Washington started out this game on fire but like weve mentioned hes been a guy thats always willing to do the other things Big time move to his end picks up his dribble to shoot and Edwards with his eighth rebound Now take some air out of out of the ball right now Take your time Get a good offensive possession Who do you use in a ball screen to get open I think Pierres going to go down screen for Yuto You got a ball screen coming up I dont like that by Edwards baseline drive Heres Pierre fouled on the threepoint shot Thats on Sir Mohamd and three shots coming for Pierre And Pierre did jump forward but you have to be in control of your close out if youre Sir Muhammad Were going to take a look right here Closing out Is he jumping forward Yes Jump off to the side You You cant run that risk at the end of a game I know hes been knocking down shots but got to be a little bit smarter with your closeouts Close out off to the side right You know the shots going up Get out to the side So just as Notre Dame have closed to within a twopossession game SMU answers and Pierre music knocks down this free throw Thatll make it three straight 20point games Hes so talented I mean just a really good player Sir Muhammad looks a bit dejected Hes had a tough night Hes had some good moments Just a couple of mistakes music tonight 20 points again for Pierre The lead is 11 Haroldson turbines to the rim Thats the basket Its 8374 Serta has been so good that he commands so much attention Simple stagger away Gets rid of the help side Strong finish by Harelson Miller against comes out Shrewberry lets it fly and hits Five threes for Shrewberry They over two possession game They just wont go away Pierre too easy just so good Our game high 22 most of it in cheering the second half The three rattles out by Es knocks it out of bounds SMU ball I mean Jerier has can beat you in so music many different ways He can do it in isolation He can do it as a catch and shoot guy He can get downhill and finish Weve seen that Just an outstanding game for this young man who eclipses 2000 points in the process 22 to go along with seven rebounds six assists They foul Boopy Miller 87 on the season 83 for his career Out of bounds call Out of bounds Excuse me music Shrewsbury double lets it go Rebound to Pierre Edwards fouled by Haroldson Itll be a one and one for Edwards a 75 free throw shooter Yeah thats one thing SMU has on this team Miller Edwards a pretty good free throw shooter So is Pierre Washington above 80 They have guys at the end of the game that can make the shots at the line No question This crazier things have happened down eight points whatever But for all intents and purposes SMU has handled this game handled the runs and then they have enough guys that could beat you on a given night whether its or Jeron or even BJ whos at the line music But credit to Notre Dame I mean they have gotten theyre theyre decimated with injuries to their most important pieces Their most important offensive player with Burton their most important defensive player with Jai and theyre in games and theyre battling just not enough there a little bit too much youth in the back court to be able to compete on a consistent basis Haroldson with a chance for an add one 23 points for Jaylen Harlson three off a careerh high for SMU If they get the win tonight he gets Syracuse on the road A struggling Syracuse team as of now That is a quad one game in Little BC Youve got the West Coast trip and Stanford which can be tricky North Carolina found that out And then they close with Miami and Florida State Its a deeper ACC this year but there is an opportunity for SMU to move up in the standings and even have a shot at one of those top four seeds which comes with a double buy Right now theyre at eight Theres no question And you talk about their schedule a few hard games left Favored to win all except one against Louisville Cardinals And that games here They played Louisville once at the Yum Center Lost that game Going to go in that West Coast swing which for a Dallas team not quite as far Great point Edwards fouled quickly by Serta And that now puts SMU in the double bonus Im going to be honest with you Anisha You and I do a lot of ACC games together This SMU teams about as fun as youre going to find in college basketball Every time we watch them play somebody has a massive game Somebodys dunking on somebody Somebodys getting eight steals like it was whenever they played Wake Forest BJ Edwards went bananas Boopy Miller can go crazy and hit a full court I mean they are electric and they are so fun to watch Again you go back to Andy Enfields history Where did it start Dunk City baby Dunk City Florida G Coast 2013 Sweet 16 run as a 15 seed and then 11 seasons as USCs head coach Had an elite eight run in 2021 Thursday final six Pierre that doesnt count but just for show to Germaine ONeal
