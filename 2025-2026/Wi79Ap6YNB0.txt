and to see if they can take care of business here today And a pretty darn good crowd too on hand as well this afternoon Eric here from the dome Well its not a 900 pm start so laughter that helps right Hostra themselves have been playing very well You talked about they had the win over Pittsburgh earlier when Cruz Davis you just talked about an incredible game Yeah Hostra is coming in here confident and they think they can win this game for Syracuse was Preston Edme and got it knocked away And here come the Orange now with JJ Stalin Starting five for Syracuse Hows this group been working together from what youve seen this year Well defensively thats what theyve been hanging their hat on Theyve been a really good job with ball pressure and being active defensively Offensively most of the points have been coming out of transition When theyre in the half court they have to execute move the ball move bodies and get cleaner looks 4 seconds to shoot Starling got it And Mike I said it in the back court with the interview before the game If JJ Starling hits his first basket hes a totally different player Great sign for Syracuse Orange Starting starting five here for the Host Pride besides Cruz Davis Got to keep an eye on Edme number one the guard Hes got 58 assists on the season Theyre the top 30 in the country Theres a lightning bug out there He he gets to spots on the floor and then hes a good decision maker Davis to the hole Does it go a fight for the offensive rebound and hes got it Theres a need and on Q knocking down a three We saw last game for St Joes Syracuse was out rebounded by 10 Right there you see the offensive rebound ended up in a wide open threepoint shot for Hostra Up to the top here for Nate Kings Starling now for three That ones good And he comes right back for the Orange And I had to call it Mike If he hits his first shot the other shots are just going to be a little bit cleaner He went into that shot and the followrough looks smooth Great sign for Syracuse once again Thats great play Now you really got to get on him here if youre the host for Pride As he said the first couple five to three early Syracuse Two minutes gone by here in this first half Its in the victory onetu back over to Enmeid running on the baseline is short offensive rebound and getting pushed from the back there a couple of times was unled to but they call him for the traveling violation and again Syracuse has to do a better job defensive rebounding they cant give Hostra second and third chance opportunities Theres George coming up the floor now for Syracuse Nathan George Kings wide open for three and rebounded by Anu Thats a great look right there for Syracuse Get your best shooter a wide open look Davis on the kick out Three ball Thats no good by Emme in a hurry again Starlane rejected coming back on D by Davis Talk all about his offense How about that defensive play by him Well its a great job of JJ pushing the pace and getting out in transition But how about Cruz Davis getting up there with the left hand and blocking it against the backboard Great defensive effort right there screaming Heres George on the fade away the baseline Doesnt go rebound onetui All right Davos Dimes here today What do we got man Yeah Well I think we have two important things for Syracuse Contain Cruz Davis He had 36 points against Pittsburgh Make sure you take him out of rhythm Make somebody else beat you And then ball movement Theyve struggled the last two games only averaging eight assists They have to execute better in the half court Better movement equals better shots Ed for three Then for Hostra Hostra they have to be able to limit SU guards paint touches Make them a halfcourt team jump shooting team and then make threes If theyre able to make shots out on the perimeter theyre going to extend that Syracuse defense and open up more driving lanes to the rim Thats exactly what they just did right there knocking down the three ball And its for six and Syracuse five here And a three ball by Kings goes in and the Orange go right back in front When Syracuse is making jump shots theyre a totally different team Their strength is getting downhill getting to the rim Now when theyre hitting shots on the perimeter the defense extends out Driving lanes open up Davis coming off a screen kicks it to the corner Wide open shot from Joshua to Katy No good but the offensive rebound back out to Edme Davis able to create does it again Host has three offensive rebounds already Again second third chance opportunities When youre playing college basketball those teams are going to take advantage Tied up at eight here Four and a half gone by Timeout coming at the next whistle Our next stoppage Heres George in the corner for three Doesnt go Rebound unlete But again a good look for Syracuse getting into the paint Two feet drawing the defense kick Its a good look there by Nate George Speaking of good looks and the feed from Davis to Anuatu for the easy two Hes not just a scorer Mike We talked about him being a playmaker Hes second on the team in assist Great find right there for the finish at the rim Yeah you called it 55 assists coming in there Three behind Edme for the team high And once again for the second consecutive night the opponent with a good start here inside the dome And its a great sign for Syracuse when JJ Starling starts off early knocking down the midrange jump shot And you see him coming off the screen hitting the three All right Sweet area And thats one high level program or a mid mid major program Whatever it is especially in this area with NIL and a transfer these guys have done a stellar job with their respective programs Kings kicks it over to the corner for Anthony and hes rejected it inside by Anduetu Thats a couple of blocks already for this host team Okayenne Hes a skilled guy He has to be able to get in there and get it off a little bit quicker You see him right here trying to draw the foul but Anowatu was right there waiting for it Stland puts up another three Its good And JJ Stland what a hot start for him for Syracuse And all the shooting struggles hes been having early in this season Its about confidence as a shooter Come out be confident and shoot the ball Hes been there Hes done it before Great start for starters You called it Eric Hes done it here today Hes got eight of their first 11 points Back to Edney for three Thats no good And Kings has the rebound for Syracuse And when Hostra shoots those quick shots its in favor of Syracuse Theyre able to get out play fast and play at a good pace Get out in transition Good job by Hostra getting back and making a play in the half court though Pier Suare is in returning side for Syracuse driving again and he cant be stopped so far here in this first half with 10 points throughout the first six minutes Confidence is something else When you see those first few shots go down now youre going to be ultra aggressive JJ Stling set the tone early Look for him to be like that throughout the game Theres going to be a foul up high Its going to be on Suare and thats going to be his first I want to see how theyre defending Stling when we come back here and what Hawks has got to do better defensively cuz hes getting whatever he wants right now Well you see him starting out hitting a few jump shots They got to press up and and make him put the ball on the ground But thats his strength putting the ball on the ground and getting to the getting to the hoop Theyre going to have to be able to have help side defenders in there waiting for him if hes trying to get to the rim Uh oh Then because hes hitting the outside shots now too So Im not quite sure what you do Absolutely If he if hes hitting that then watch out He opens up his whole game Cruz Davis here for Hostra Two points for him so far Has a nice assist and now drives in and gets fouled And well head to the line here Hes a guy thats averaging 206 points a game good for 24th in the country Well it was a good initial defense right there by Nate Kings but once you get into the paint two feet like Cruz Davis did hes a good enough player to be able to get his shot off and draw fouls and thats what he did there Posture knows that they need Davis to be the guy thats looking to score He was a little bit more reserved last year Hes not really a a vocal guy but has certainly been getting the job done this season as you said especially with that 36 versus Pit a couple games ago Well I guess he doesnt talk the talk but he sure walks the walk but he he shows it by his play and Syracuse has to make somebody else beat him We talked about his 36 points against Pittsburgh Hes not scared coming in playing against the ACC team Hes ready to play always He is Lets keep an eye on the defense here on number two JJ Stling for Syracuse Here cheering we go goes right by two defenders and takes it in for the score And we talked about confidence Im going to keep saying it Hes been struggling shooting the ball but hes knocked down his first three jump shot Now hes in cruise control getting down to the basket being aggressive finishing at the rim Eric hes already tied his season high with 12 points This could be his coming out party right here for the season Confidence again turns you into a whole different player Thats Chairman Watnikov as he misses Second rebound of the game for Kings And heres Ken Anthony Starling for three Just off on that one Rebound by Davis Fires to the corner Its Biggie Patterson now for Hashra Tough fade away and save going out of bounds and right in the hands of Kings cheering and hes going to be fouled by Preston Edme and thats his second for Hostra So theyre going to have to take him out Well tell you about Duke and North Carolina in action coming up on Tuesday night right here on the ACC network on a double header Booser and company thats at six and then North Carolina at eight Duke 10 and0 this season and Eric theyd be in ranked Kansas Arkansas Florida Michigan State Not a bad way to start Two of the best coaches in the country and John Shy and Hubert Davis And they got some NBA prospects on their squad like always And Boozer and Caleb Wilson Kings for three and air mails that one and its rebounded underneath And then the ball is lost and it finally gets tipped to the hands of Davis Davis in a crossover to the hole and he scores it But if youre Syracuse you cant let him drive all the way from half court and get an easy opportunity at the rim That help side has to be able to come across You lose your timeout and you lose the ability to challenge for the rest of the game Why would you do that I I wouldnt I I think its a bad move on Hopsters part I mean its 17 to 14 Theres no reason to use that challenge this early in the game So Hostra is down to three timeouts They cant challenge for the rest of the way Down three inside make it one on Silus Sundays first basket of the afternoon Well you could just see all the attention that Davis is All eyes are on Davis and that allows Sunday just to slip to the rim and get an easy finish Orange by a point here coming up at 11 minutes to play in this first half Betsy relocates for three and nails it He had a good game on Thursday night and hits his first shot of the day here today Hes a super confident player Hes picking up right where he left off And he even said in the postgame interviews if he misses the first four it doesnt matter Hes thinking hes going to make the next four Syracuse has made five of their last seven from the field And they lead it 20 to 16 Patterson turns it into a road block Thats Betsy over to Sunday Sunday working in on William Kyle Thats short cheering applause Nathan George brings it over George wants to go Lost the handle Taken away by the Pride Well that was one where the defense was set and youre going there against two three guys Probably didnt need that right there Patterson scores it for Hostra and hes a key to them being successful Hes got a high motor Does a lot of things well You got to put up with some things as well too Eric But right there that was a big bucket Well usually thats how it happens Turn over on one end come back and take advantage Bucket on the other Played at a division two school Then Iona as well And now here at Hostra as driving in for the bucket is Cayenne Anthony And Syracuse is back up four here They hit six of the last eight from the field I was just talking about Cayenne the other day He he just has to make quicker decisions Hes so skilled He can do it on all three levels He just has to make quicker decisions and just go when he has an opportunity to go 11 See right here just a little head fake boot Get him up in the air going under with the left hand Talked to his father Carmelo Anthony earlier this week him here the last game of course of Thursday night here today and I said you know all about the pressure right you know for your son He goes man theres no pressure Hes like hes like you only put the pressure on yourself right Hes like hes a freshman hes been here for two months playing pretty well Well hes like thats what I tell him right Just go out and play ball And hes off to a pretty darn good start here in his freshman season Thats And I mean thats all you have to do Go out and play ball The the expectations thats from the outside Thats really a distraction And there you see him right there knocking down a deep three Look hes had an exceptional freshman year by any standards right For him to come in and play how hes playing early on hes having a stellar freshman year early on Yes he is Averaging over 10 points a game hits that three to put him up five trying to counter and they do Jaden Roberts hits a three ball Roberts is a guy who last game against Westbury came out and had a really efficient game attacking the rim Hes another guy whos a jitterbug can get to his spots and he also as you can see right there knocked down the open three Freshman and freshman for the last two baskets one for each team Anthony goes back on top for George Shot clocks inside 10 got to knock down his hands when a fouls called and its going to be on Patterson And these are the situations for Syracuse where they got to open up the floor a little bit more get better spacing move the ball move bodies and get cleaner looks If youre driving the basketball and you have three four guys in there its probably going to be a hard shot Challen Cruz Davis is first Kyle powers his way inside Theyre going to call that a jump ball and its going to stay with Syracuse on the arrow Last game Kyle was able to get away with that drive and and finish that But Anowatu is just as athletic as Kyle is He stood his ground hands up and tied it up Betsy bounces it in for Anthony Nice inbounds play for the two Its a great job cutting back Hosture got caught looking at the ball Anthony cut behind Finished it at the rim Theres Cruz Davis who we featured at the start of the broadcast 20 points a game Hes got eight so far for the Pride Finds Roberts Another geek is good again Well we talked about early on you have to be able to contain Cruz Davis Other guys are going to have to step up and Hostra has those guys doing it right now early in the first half Roberts has six on those two threepointers that hes made and Hostra knocked it out Itll stay on Syracuse when we return Another close game here from inside the dome on this Saturday afternoon Onepoint lead for the Orange Well be back one with just under eight minutes to play here in this first half Suarezs got IT FOR BETSY Anonys in along with Kings and Starling Jumper from Kings No good Thats knocked out and its going to be Hra possession and theyve got a chance to go back in front How about Suare and what hes done this season Not showing up on the scoring column but a lot of other things he does when hes in there Look at this stat The only player in division one with no field goal attempts and hes played almost 80 minutes Yeah Well thats his role isnt to get shots Its to be active and fly around defensively alter shots at the rim And hes playing his role and doing what coach Coach Ren needs him to do But how would you not sneak in at least one shot here or there right I mean well he might be scared that hes going to get took off the floor High field goal percentage this year early for both teams Coming up on seven minutes left Davis to the hole a little bit too strong And on the run is Stling whos had a spectacular first half with 12 points on five of seven from the field and he cant add to it cheering You see the versatility in in Betsy guarding Cruz Davis Betsy s right here on the ACC network Roberts has had two threes already Number seven for Hostra And this one is blocked by Starling cheering Kings shut off on the baseline as they work it back to the top Sadique White roll for two And thats a mistake right there by Anowatu right there Sadique White is not a great threepoint shooter Ran out on the threepoint shooter Pump fake Sadique White going to his strength driving to the basket Threepoint Hughes advantage Out of six minutes remaining first half from the foul line Patterson finds it Rebound Starling Great job by Syracuse making Cruz Davis play far away from the hoop THREE BOARDS FOR STARLAND as well to go along with his 12 points Crosscourt to a one of a Kings misses on the three Kyle almost ted it down but it got tipped out to Anthony Thats a great look there by Syracuse They just have to play with a little bit more pace When you see it go right into it Attack Starling He attacks Floating runner doesnt go Hes down And a five on four for the time being Hes right back up as Davis brings it over cheering and the pass was deflected there by Anthony So now back court for Davis somehow trying to force his way through over that screen There was no hole there but they get it back Shot clock does not reset and did not take a shot yet They finally do And knocking down a three is Qunnikov And you got to be aware of the best threepoint shooter on the team for Hostra Hes shooting nearly 38 from the three If hes open hes more than likely going to knock it down We are tied at 29 with 445 to play in the first half Reminds you a little bit of Thursday night Yeah Hopsters a scrappy team They obviously they thrive off their guards but right now they got guys stepping up Heres White Nice job to hold his ground as Roberts of the defense but White ends up getting it back He misses Kings had a chance on it They call foul as bodies are all over the place And its a great effort by both teams Theyre fighting Theyre competing We saw this Thursday night versus St Joes Both teams were competing at a high level If Hostra wants to come in here and stay in the game and win the game they have to play with that energy and effort throughout Was called for the foul his first And uh not that we want to harp on it cuz I know everybody knows about all Syracuse fans and coach and they watch this game back but uh its got to be said they are last in the nation at the free throw line under 58 and one of two has made it a onepoint game Well really its its a strategy for these teams coming in here you know dont let them get an open look foul them make them make them make free throws Yeah no doubt Theres Davis double team up high over to Roberts Patterson with a spin on the baseline and he got fouled by White Oh got to be careful there Doesnt love the call but you know I tell you what he almost kind of got bailed out He was going to go in and get a bucket there after that spin move Well well Pattersons playing at the four right now but hes almost like a three Sorry He can handle the ball And you see him right there getting his getting to his spot And that was a ticky tack foul right there but we play on Yeah not too much there but lets see what theyre thinking Instead Hashra back insideu that doesnt go and rebounded by White and hes fired up and now he got fouled applause And its going to be on Patterson who picks up his first for Hostra scrappy one again here He wants to do after basketball whenever that may be He say I want to get back to my hometown Sale Morgan help those kids that are also in group homes that dont have a home dont have a place help maybe get them through athletics and kind of similar to what youre doing here Uh giving back to a place where youve known a long time your alma mater here in Syracuse Not easy and its admirable what you guys are doing You see Syracuse with the turnover right there But I love the mindset especially at this age Not a lot of kids are thick and selfless And this is what were trying to do with the ED23 Foundation Help underprivileged kids in the community through turkey drives back to school events toy drives whatever it is We just want to help out as much as we can in the community of Syracuse Three ball is up and in by Roberts and Hostra has the lead Hes knocked down three of them so far here in this first frame for the pride Well talking about taking advantage of your opportunity when your name is called Roberts hasnt played a lot this season Hes a freshman but you see him out here confident and ready to play Thats a great fake by White and was fouled by Anuetu And Whites a guy who excels on the defensive side of the ball Hes a super athlete but offensively especially with Donnie Freeman out Syracuse needs him to be an impact on the offensive side of the ball They called the foul on Patterson Zero for Hostra Was interesting Thought it was Anulet there Number six but look says Patterson with the foul Well take a look at that at the half here Free throws for Sadi White cheering And its a onepoint game here Still in favor of the Pride who have the ball How about Dicky V back here with Charles Barkley and our man Dave OBrien OB Theyll have the call tonight of the Indiana Kentucky game Looking forward to watching that one at 730 on ESPN Charles Barkley and Dicky V in the same game Watch out Yep And you know everything that Dicky V has got to go through right throughout his amazing career and always been wishing him the best So excited to have him back on the air I mean think about the supporter that he was of Jimmy V And here it is V week and a you hear him on the call Hes positive Hes upbeat He has high energy Thats a lot to say for Dicky V How about whats going on in Rup Arena getting ready for this one today in Kentucky with Indiana The fans outside some of the quotes right I mean think about all the liners that youve heard from both of those guys over the years Well you talk about Indiana you you talk about Kentucky I mean those are basketball states right there I mean you go to Indiana theres 10000 people at the high school game selling out Tied at 32 Good one here today from Syracuse New York Coming up on 2 minutes left And they force a bad pass out of the hands of Cruz Davis And its also cheering cover and Mike thats defense into offense And JJ Starling pushing the pace and it doesnt matter where you throw it on around the rim William Kyles going to go up there and get it Maybe thatll spark the Orange and this crowd here late in this first half as theyre back up two Davis Hes tough and and you just said it tough shot maker going one on five almost or one on four and just taking it to the rim Finishing with the strong hand Even Steven here as you would imagine to see it 14 points to the paint for each team Tied at 34 Minute and a half to go George for three No good A great strategy by Hoster going back to the zone Making this Syracuse Orange team into a jump shooting team What about youre seeing so far here offensively by Hoffra today Well theyve had some good flow and some good movement but theyre making tough shots We talked about Reynolds and we talked about Cruz Davis Even right here at this play thats a thats a tough shot going one Youre not going to be able to sustain like that but theyve been able to hit tough shots here in this first half against Syracuse White took it away down there inside and then the right to understand okay we got it We can play here We can play with this team I mean Its tied at 34 the minute one to go here in the first half And we talked about the free throws here for the Syracuse team You got to track it You got to stay on top of it because its going to be a factor one way or the other down the stretch And you love to see JJ knocking down his free throws And I was listening to Melo talk to JJ after practice yesterday He was just telling him Go out there and play ball Youve done it before Youve been in these situations be confident in your ability to go out there and hoop Four of nine now from the free throw line for the Orange as they lead it by one And were under a minute to go here in the first half Davis off a pair of screens Patterson nowhere to go there against White Feeds Roberts Theres the fade away and Hostra has regained the lead and Roberts thats he did the exact thing that youre supposed to do All eyes were on Biggie Patterson Great weak side cut right there to the middle Found him Knocked down the midrange jump shot Proverbs has 11 We already have nine lead changes in this game And the shot clock to game clock differential is exactly 3 seconds Timeout Syracuse will return They trail it by one Side hustra is coming in confident Theyre going in there attacking the rim being aggressive much like St Joes did Thursday night And you see other guys stepping up Roberts has three threes You see him just get in the mid midrange and hit that open jump shot Syracuse has to be able to lock down defensively and move the ball on this end against the zone George gets it over to White inside The hook is good And the clock running here 3 seconds to go They get it in Heres Roberts Thats good if it goes And just a little short and thatll be the first 20 minutes to play and Syracuse will take it to the locker room by one Rebounding numbers are the same assist numbers are the same Somethings going to have to give they have to lock down defensively in this second half Both teams postra possession here with Preston Edme who you said who had two personal fouls and had a sit for most of that first half Hes back in to start the second frame Katie and blocked inside by White cheering and applause And you see again Hashra starting the second half in the two three zone trying to make Syracuse into a jump shooting team Syracuse has to look at that free throw line and short corner options Heres Kings for three Yes or that Nate Kings knocking it down from the wing and that and look those shots are going to be there I dont think Hopster is going to extend all the way out but if Nate Kings can knock that down theyre going to make them come out and now youre going to have open driving lanes Six points on two and six from threepoint range Little fade away doesnt go by but an offensive lead inside and a block as well by Kyle still loose as you had it and now that orange had it Kings again shut off of the baseline and its knocked out off of Hoffra And its in Syracuses favor if they can play with that pace get out ahead of the zone before it sets up and try to get a look at the rim before Well cuz I was going to kind of watch what they were doing offensively with the ball movement which you talked about as one of the factors for them when theyre playing well And what do they do now against the zone Yeah Well ball movement again youre looking for the high post opportunities Once that come goes in the high post all eyes on the defense and then thats when you look at the high low or that reversal into a shot There you have it Right White trying to get to the high post here at the foul line Shores beats it inside to White Shot clock would have went off anyhow Its intercepted Ed me and a three partners going over to the orange And again Syracuse rebounding the basketball They have to be able to be on the defensive boards limiting Hopster second and third chance opportunities Right now its 19 17 in terms of the rebounds in favor of Syracuse by two Another three and its Kings and he does it again Well and thats an example of not being aware of the shooter Nate Kings just hit a three You have to know where the best shooter on Syracuse team is at all times Quotnikov gets it up here for Ed me Bounces it inside and got cheering it again asu trying to get it in there And White playing outstanding defense in the interior with 1732 to go in the second half Eric and leading by seven Yeah it was a pretty easy call right there Thank goodness for replay Well and in that scenario too its clear enough that youre like were going to challenge this We get one more challenge for the rest of the game And theyre on momentum right now with a sevenpoint lead Yeah absolutely And Syracuse right now going against this two3 zone of Hostra They got to do a better job of moving the ball and playing with Hast Quick George to the foul line White partially blocked Kennys got it back Its going to be What do we got Violation or a foul Referees are going to confer Good job by Hughes getting into the free throw line area Called a foul there Theres the foul Its on one And thats who they called it on So at the tail end of that prior to a shot clock violation no foul Shot clock violation first Hofster ball down seven See Syracuse with a little fullcourt pressure You got to be able to protect the rim Davis runners good And now its a fivepoint game And thats the thing with the press If if theyre able to break it its going to be an opportunity for a a twoon one And Davis good job stopping before Kyle could get to the shot Kra really caught a break there cuz instead of the third personal foul on Edme and free throws for Syracuse they got the ball back They go down they score and they made it a fivepoint game Starling trying to find an opening They cant do so Oh theres a foul and then Kyle shoves Joshua Decati who was called for the initial foul here number four first on Hostra but then a little push back at the end there by William Kyle You cant dribble that much against his own JJ was doing too much dribble in that corner and ended up being a tough shot But thats just two guys being competitive and the officials dont even go over to take any more of a look at it So its going to be Katie with a foul Now its Kyle Bale in style cheering and fighting Sadique White William Kyle is is one of the best interior passes that Syracuse has had in a long time called here A technical foul has been assessed to Sadique White for Syracuse Sorry to interrupt you there Eric A lot going on in this last sequence Well I love the intensity of Sadi White but you have to be able to reel it in a little bit and control your emotions and he went up there and get it We know hes an athlete He he put it on his head but then you just got to let it go and get back on the other end and play defense And this is what we call a class A technical foul Unsportsmanlike arguing taunting profanity And thats kind of what it was there on White Trash talking at the end of that So its two shots point of interruption which was hostra possession So they get the free throws They have the ball here Theyre down by five Whites out of the game And we have just over 16 minutes to go in the contest And look he hes a passionate player Plays with high energy I cant really talk much cuz I know back in my day I talked a lot of trash as well but you know its something its a learning experience for the freshman Cruz Davis heavily guarded there by Kyle Puts up a jumper Its good And its a three for the top player for the Pride Well how about the patience right there by Davis Great job by Kyle hedging out As soon as Davis seen Kyle back up hes letting that go Knocking down the trifecta 17 points for Davis Number five for Hostage His first three of the afternoon on his first three attempt Hes three off of his average And Starling lost it Kyles got it and cleans it up Thats a great job by Kyle just to continue to play but Hopster is doing a great job of making it tough for Syracuse against that zone They have a little eye thing going up top The blocking foul and William Kyle as victory onu is working his way in Easier opportunities Fourth ever meeting between these two teams The first since 2006 Orange won the previous three Offensive rebound by Anuatu and a put back for two Syracuse has been struggling ever since Thursday against St Joes Defensive rebounding When you give teams second and third chance opportunities eventually theyre going to take advantage of it Seven second chance points now for Hostra eight for Syracuse Five minutes gone by in the second frame Its a twopoint contest George inside A lot of battling going on there with William Kyle and Kyle dribbles it off his leg out of bounds over to Hodford Well that whole possession for Syracuse it was just side to side passing You got to be able to move the ball with pace and then youll have an advantage getting downhill to the basket Anonys back in for Syracuse and Coach Carmelo on the sidelines right Its a he heck of a guy to learn from I tell you that Yeah to the corner and near me Its a three Its good and Hostra has regained the lead 14 and a half minutes left in the second half All the jitters are gone for Hostra if they had any These guys are playing with confidence Syracuse has to find a way to be able to get inside this zone Edme is three of five from threepoint range and Hostra has hit four of their last five from the field to take a onepoint lead They got to play with more pace Theyre just swinging the ball around Get get into that pick and roll Go off it You saw coach Autry over there Eric and he was upset and rightfully so And Starling dribbles it back on December 7th was their first win over an ACC member since defeating Florida State back in 2015 Now theyre trying to get another one here today And really thats all they needed They know they can compete with teams in the ACC conference Getting a win on the road at pit challenging Syracuse right here and giving them everything they got inside Katie cheering Got it If you look at Hasha theyre playing with pace Theyre not letting the ball stick Theyre moving it Theyre moving it which is creating opportunities at the rim No call there as Cruz trying to take a charge Its up to Anthony Threepoint Ha lead This is their largest of the day William Kyle and rebounded by Anuetsu Hasha is doing a great job in that zone keeping him out on the perimeter And again Im okay with Kyle getting the ball but hes not a guy whos going to get the ball every possession down there like that Kyle a little bit an elbow swing there The Hostra bench want a foul The Orange have it Carlin three ball kings But out to Anthony and Hasser will live with those shots You said it Eric Its been a kind of a slowm moving operation here offensively as White puts it up and in And thats a great job by White just operating in the high post but he has to make a quicker decision He had the kick out right there in the corner But a great job driving and finishing at the hoop Whites got 11 points Theres Davis off the screen Trying to get by Kings Nice little jump stop and puts cheering it down Clangs off the back iron Pops back up three with the off hand The lefty going righty Hes just doing a great job of keeping his dribble alive getting to his spots and then making some tough shots I mean Cruz Davis right I mean we we knew coming in here Hes got 19 points Eric One off of his season average We still have almost 12 minutes to go Well he was at St Johns High level basketball is nothing new to him And obviously hes coming in with supreme confidence And Katie gets a steal Seven turnovers by Syracuse Hostra ball threepoint lead That that Hostra zone has changed the game completely cheering and applause Davis Tough shot over Kings No for the Katy the offensive rebound cheering traffic and the pride coming in Fired up today Theyve got a fivepoint lead But the shoulders by the Katy right there just going up strong to the rim But it all happened because of Davis All eyes are on Davis when he has the basketball The Katy comes in from the weak side gets the rebound and finishes Little tense here with 11 minutes to go and Syracuse down five Out to Starling A wide open three but he couldnt get it to go and its rebounded by Anulet But those are the opportunities you want You go ahead attack the zone get in the paint draw the defense kick and just got to knock it down Syracuse has got three subs to check in Were going to have a timeout anyhow for the media at the next whistle They cant have that come fast enough right now as can extend the lead to seven maybe eight with a three And they try just that And he does Threepointer eightpoint lead and a timeout is taken with 1031 to go And Ha is coming in and playing no games Cruz Davis Yeah I can do it with my right hand as well And on the other end right here knocking down the corner three Ask you this If youre Syracuse they had to call a timeout there but they were going to get one the minute the ball had went out of bounds We had a dead ball situation because of the media Now it leaves them with only one timeout left for the rest of the game And we still got 10 minutes plus Thats something that the staff has to let coach Red know And obviously with Hostra playing how they playing he wanted to get a timeout and and get his guys under control But the coaching staff for Syracuse has to be aware of that and let coach Red know Well and the other thing thats a little disconcerning is too they actually challenged a play earlier that they got right So they retain their timeout They have one challenge left but you have to have a timeout to be able to challenge late And think about if you do that and you dont get it then youre out of timeouts Youre out of challenges in the next Theres a lot of issues that could happen here with only one timeout remaining in 948 left And we talked about calling the challenge too early just in case you need it for late game situation You might come back to haunt Sarah Well that was on Hostras side cuz remember they challenged earlier and they didnt get it So Hostra has no more challenges for the rest of the game They have though three timeouts left cheering Correct Mike Thats my fault Syracuse won their challenge Right Three ball by George doesnt go and the rebound by Anuetu for Hofra with an eightpoint lead and possession Syracuse shoots under 30 from three on the season Hostra is okay with them taking those shots right No reason for them to have to put those up right now Plenty of time left Edme over to Cruz cheering Hes got a game high 19 points He averages 206 a game Five to shoot screaming Lost the handle Loose ball Syracuse has it Anthony Nice Thats what you have to do if youre Syracuse You have to attack before they can set up in that two3 zone Great job by George pushing the pace getting ahead to Anthony Anthony seeing the opening and attacking Thats nine for Cayenne Anthony Syracuse is within six cheering Edme goes inside Anuatu and thats going to be a traveling violation Well how about the recovery from the guy they call ski hedge all the way out there past the threepoint line gets all the way back to be able to cause that turnover Yeah its a great observation Eric You called it 825 remaining here What about Syracuse now Offensively dont need to be jacking threes up at this point They have to move the ball but you got to move the ball with pace And and now when you see Hostra out of position you got to be able to attack that and then once you get in the paint you got to be able to make a good decision Hostra has not beaten an ACC team since 2015 And now theyre trying to make it two in one week Pittsburgh and then here today Syracuse has to get a guy in the high post who can make a play Great job by Betsy Bean in the short corner A little short flash Great recognition right there by George lead is down to four here now cheering Got to try to get the crowd alive here today as well in the dome And lets see how Hostra reacts to this Davis up for Patterson Dropped inside by Betsy but he got it back Blocked again And the foul is called Suare Lets see who they call it on here And it will be on Suare Thats his third And its from threepoint land Hostra is doing a efficient job offensively of moving the ball and getting good looks at the rim Yeah thats the word right there You said it efficient as Patterson is at the line here Has extended it to a fivepoint lead cheering cheering Sixpoint lead for Hostra cheering again Three timeouts remaining for the Pride One for Syracuse Possession arrow favors Syracuse if we get a jump Still a lot of time Alan cheering says Anthony and finds William Kyle You got to play with pace You got to attack the press If you can get past that first line of defense youre going to have an opportunity to have an advantage And there you see the lob by Anthony Dyle Could that be a spark here for the Orange Heres Davis off the screen crosses over comes back dumps it inside somehow on you No and its out of bounds off of Hostra And that was a missed opportunity right there from Hostra missing a bunny at the rim Great job by Davis just continuing to play He has seven assists That would have been his eight assists right there Hes a scorer and a playmaker cheering I like the idea right here putting Anthony in the high post He can turn and make a play Anonys got it Kings five to shoot Starling gets it off in time Its no good And a fake for this one And thats out of bounds Last touch by Hofra 50 Well Mike the ball stayed on one side that whole possession for Syracuse and it was too slow The passes were too slow and its just going to end up being in a hard contested shot every single time Anthony checked now by Germannikov off the screen from Kyle The floating runner is no good And inside and hes had a really good game there The 610 junior from Spain for Hassra And they have it with a fourpoint lead and a three ball indeed Weve been talking about Cruz Davis You know 36 against Pittsburgh and 19 tonight But how about these other guys stepping up and me knocking it down for his fourth three and hes giving this Syracuse team all that they can handle Hop is led by as many as eight Its seven right now 62 to 55 Ball knocked away Betsy on the floor to get it back Fight for it Its going to be a jump and its going to stay with Syracuse as they have the arrow but theres only six on the shot clock over the last two three possessions theyve been getting their shots with 5 seconds or less on the shot clock Offensively they just dont know They dont look like they know what theyre doing against this zone They got to get a guy in that high post area Once you catch it there now its easier to make a decision closer to the rim Starling got it Or get by your defender play off two feet in control and knock down a jumper cheering and applause Fivepoint lead for the product cheering Three ball Davis Yes he scores it Hes over his average now over 20 points for the game and its 65 to 57 And the little things What about that screen right there Bowatu right there getting the best one of the best shooters on HRA open If hes that open hes going to knock it down 22 for Davis and a missed three at the top by Betsy but an offensive rebound and a steal Unreal play by Patterson cheering then Davis then Plotnikov and its into the hands of Ed me and Hostra has it Mike thats what you say Bodies on the floor Two guys diving after that loose ball Host coming here trying to win Thats one you go back and you show in the film room later this week Thats an inspiring play Davis on two He cheering scores it and the Pride lead it by 10 And Davis said Dont worry big fella I got YOUR BACK I GOT YOU ONE more time Finish this one for me Kings Anthony Good look count And again its too slow offensively for Syracuse Theyre not playing with any pace does a great job just have an open shot knocking it down by Anthony But they got to figure out a way to be more effective offensively against that zone I was going to say right there what about some more pressure in the backboard Kind of make Hopster work a little bit more for it here You want to be able to get up You dont want to give a guy like Davis any space and no room to make a good decision Under four minutes to go and Davis sails it out Here you go And they force him into a bad pass And weve got a time Fox if you can see that And dear Fox another lefty whos just quick with the ball in his hands and they have a lot of similarities in their games as well Well you are correct Hes got eight assists tonight Edme has one So now 63 total on the season for Davis and 59 for Edme So your top score is also your top assist guy as well Blocked for Host inside He cheering scores and hes foul William Mike Kyle is a guy whos hes never going to stop High energy high motor Hes just going to keep going Hes going to keep competing until that final whistle is blown and hes done a better job at the free throw line as well We were here at practice yesterday for Syracuse Youre right Okay Dont dont get the jinx going here game Yeah laughter And we were talking with your former coach of the alltime great Jim Beaheim here and he said that cheering Kyle is the hardest working player hes seen throughout his career and he comes up with a block on the defensive end He was comparing him to Jay Crowder the great player from back at Marquette William Kyle has been the best player this season for this Syracuse basketball team 42 and white just did it on the offensive and the defensive end Fivepoint game here Orange control it Starlings got it Anthony tough shot No there is a foul called cheering off was called for the foul 25 for Hostra Cen Anthony to the free throw line here This is where theyre going to be really crucial with three minutes to go And Mike if youre Syracuse you cant be hesitant against the zone You you got to look to take advantage of those open gaps and attack them right away quick If you play slow the defense is able to get back into position Well and and with time also starting to become a factor as well too To your point one of two for Anthony Syracuse six of 12 from the free throw line today Theyre down four Davis with a game high 22 And now if Im Im Hashra I dont want to be hesitant but I do want to execute offensively and get a good shot Davis onetu No And a rebound by White as he comes storming in And and Davis has had three great passes to him Anawatu has missed two bunnies at the rim Kingsley cheering assist having trouble getting it in Bondovs on the deck and somehow got it up to Edmme cheering And on the run is Patterson Oh its an offensive foul And how about who took up for charge for William Kyle these last four or five possessions he has been everywhere on both ends cleaning up misses and then giving up his body cheering again you cant be hesitant you got to be aggressive Nate Kings he knows what to do with it the lefty knocking it down in the corner and then weve been talking about William Kyle all year long giving up his body for his team drawing the charge Syracuse is back in this thing hes scoring hes rebounding hes blocking shots hes taking charges Thats 42 and white for Syracuse And he has affected this game and helped on the comeback run here Its a nine nothing run over the last 2 minutes and 20 seconds Hostra has been scoreless over the last 240 Minute 45 to go Anthony for the lead cheering White trying to get the rebound if he still can Its a jump and its going to be Hostra possession It looks like they take care of the basketball right when they get it over in half court They have to be able to execute again Dont be hesitant but execute and get a good opportunity Cruz in the back court gets it over the half court line for Potnikov cheering Hes being trapped Hosts got timeouts they could use instead He hoisted it to the middle and its stolen away by William Kyle He had three timeouts left Eric awareness Thats the last thing that Sweeney Plast and this Hopster group want to do is head back to Hempstead New York with three timeouts in their pocket not winning a ball game that they played well enough to win In the corner its a three Its Betsy and its in and out Fight for it again WHAT A MONSTER INSIDE TODAY FOR Syracuse and he got fouled applause Trying to will this team to victory today No pun intended How about this guy just fighting it He really didnt have the rebound I dont want to have the had the rebound but Kyle just took it from him This guy right here is a fighter the passion the energy the activity that he plays with Syracuse would not be in the game without William Kyle from Belleview Nebraska at the San Diego State UCLA cheering And now here in Syracuse New York and his next free throw could put the Orange in front for the first time since 1517 left in the second half when they were up 474 And he does just that And Mike just like you talked about Hostra has to be aware of the timeouts that they have if they get in a situation where they get trapped Its an 11 nothing run for Syracuse The drought 345 in tech for Hostra as they have a double digit lead cheering Cruz 24th leading scoreer in the nation 22 today cut off to the baseline picks it up A wide open three goes down and a timeout by Hostra with 319 seconds remaining They lead it by two cheering Cruz Davis all eyes on me every single time he has the basketball Look at how many white jerseys are right there and 25 is wide open Hes going to dial that up every single time from distance Cruz is one assist away from a double double tonight with points And you got to credit Hostra defensively Theyve been doing a great job Sadique White gets it in Here is Kayen Anthony Hes going to bring it over cheering 20 seconds on the shot clock Two and a half second differential inside here Heres White He does go and hes fouled And its right on Q what you just said Eric 186 to go and White got fouled Yeah that I mean again you want to get the ball in the high post area Great job Anthony recognizing getting it to him quick turn and be aggressive Opportunity to knock down two free throws All right so Platnikov was called for the foul His second and White with one more could only bring him within one now Mike we talked about late game situations When Syracuse gets in these in these situations you have to be able to make free throws Its coming back to haunt him Last in the nation coming in at under 58 at the free throw line today 53 eight of 15 White is three of seven Has one more free throw here with 186 to go Yeah onepoint game Bets in for Suare Offense defense substitution here Well if you dont do it you got to foul cuz you got three to give here with 186 to go and Hostra leads by one cheering Five ties 13 lead changes in this one Pride Patterson in the cruise as White went down and then Betsy had to commit the foul Mike Davis is four for four from the foul line today So theyre looking to get him the ball Hes a knockdown free throw shooter And that is actually just their fourth team foul So they got a foul three more times Theres actually four that they had to get as Patterson and they get the steal do they Referees theyre going to call it Hostra ball Now Syracuse who has a timeout remaining is going to challenge it and see if they get it back They had called for a challenge earlier today which they got right So they kept their timeout and had one more challenge left and theyre using it right now with 157 to go Tell you what thank goodness for Syracuse that they won that challenge early on The previous play has been challenged by Syracuse Oh Im not sure if anybody even touched that ball What do you think there So obviously it would be Hostra ball if nobody Yeah its got to be Thats tough That is so tough That is tough right there It It looks like Starling may have tipped the ball Thats a tough call right there I do not want to be the officials right now at this moment Did Stling did Stling get a hand on I think thats what they might have initially saw Ill look at it from the other side to see if the ball changed direction Right Like right here Right Eric Yeah I I You know what I dont think it did If Sterling didnt touch it if Preston Edmme number one for Hostra didnt touch it then its thrown out of bounds by the Pride and its going to be Syracuse ball here Well spot now taking the ball out instead of directly under the basket cheering Patterson offers got one timer remaining and he uses it No its a 5second violation He didnt get it in time Justin Porterfield was right there saying Syracuse ball The timeout came after the violation and Syracuse has possession How about that Two times not getting the ball in bounds from Hostra Syracuse is out of timeouts Anthony to put it in Down one 157 to go into Kyle William Kyle clock at 10 Back to Anthony Anthony to the hole HES BLOCKED INSIDE AND HOSTER with the rebound is ONU WITH A BLOCK and it goes down to Patterson And with 36 6 seconds to go It is just a 15 foul committed by Syracuse And Hostra is in the drivers seat Anthony got that arm Patterson got away with putting his arm in there right there Kind of got hit on the arm Its tough 7069 Pride still going to get it in here though And no foul now Finally they get the foul but the clock goes down to 17 Theyre going to look at it and they may add some time here Team fouls for Syracuse Six team fouls They can foul here Get him on the line but they cant do it Its in Edme Hes going to run cheering it out And Hostra has their second ACC win in one week here in 2025
