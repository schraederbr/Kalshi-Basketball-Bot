Armstrong Syracuse in white Cal in the Navy and gold And we are underway on a Wednesday night Double header of ACC games right here on ESPNU And Syracuse starts in a two3 zone Take a look at the Golden Bears starting five You mentioned the back court of Ames at Pippen as Syracuse cheering the turnover on the opening possession TJ Syracuse starting five The Orange comes in four and seven in ACC play Theyve lost six of their last seven How do they get back to winning ways tonight First thing they got to do is take care of the basketball They make more of these threes right on Q JJ Stling opens the scoring Great first possession by the Orange defensively creating a turnover and then knocking down the three Didnt get a lot of them up against Virginia in their last game Only 11 and off to a fast start here knocking down first STARLING THAT DROPS RIGHT OFF the rim Rolled around It was halfway down Did not fall for Starling cheering Thats a great drive Got to the rim and shot a pull up there Pippen draws contact Hell get two at the line Coming out the two3 zone Kyle has a lot of sets and runs a lot of action So this eliminates a lot of thought process But one thing they have to do is rebound out of this zone and run the shooters off the threepoint line Mark Madsons team comes in five and six in ACC play 177 overall lost over the weekend to Clemson last time out Trying to bounce back on the road tonight at Syracuse Pimping knocks them both down from the line Both teams looking to establish some type of pressure on both ends of the floor and control the tempo of the game Little light pressure for both groups Kyle just falling back to their man while the Orange is falling back into their zone shot clock ticks down to seven Nate George finds Starling Shot clock down to one He has to hoist it up Way off the mark cheering Nate George has to make a play a lot early on the shot clock there You dont want to give what we call a grenade to a teammate Two seconds left Not much for him to do Orange in there Two three zone there Pippen shoots right over it and buries it Hes got all five for Cal early You got to extend the zone against Pippen He and Ames are really good threepoint shooters And you think about Chris Bell being there in Cand has to run Kyle off the line Kings goes right to the block and draws a foul Well theres Andre and Audrey Syracuse head coach just showed Mark Madson a moment ago Both coaches in year number three And we were speaking with coach Audrey before the game And nobody knows more than he does how important a win would be just to keep this group together And look he said anything can happen You look at what NC State did two years ago in this conference You go into the ACC tournament win five games in 5 days anything is possible But you got to be in the ACC tournament and thats going to require some more wins here down the stretch Yeah coming down the stretch here theyve got to figure out a way to close games Right now theyre coming out in a two three zone It eliminates having to guard all the actions for Kyle but theyve got to do a better job of getting out against these shooters like Ames Ames got a good look there Couldnt connect Donnie Freeman coming off a season low five points at Virginia He had been so consistent offensively since coming back from his injury but in the last four games hes been on and off Kings nothing but the bottom of the net Connects on a three Hey Kings has shot the three ball really well in ACC play He struggled prior to conference play starting but since then hes been over 40 Gets a good look there and knocks it down One thing the zone does to you too You see the ball spending so much time on the perimeter Works in Syracuses favor If youre just going to pass it around and dribble it around the threepoint line and take threes not penetrate the paint at all Youre playing right into the orange hands cheering Pimping had Freeman in his face and left it short Long outlet pass well defended by Day Ames getting back and forcing the turnover cheering The one thing Syracuse wanted to limit coming into tonight those live ball turnovers that lead to points Virginia had 17 points off turnovers So theres three They belong to John Camden They had numbers early They just didnt recognize it Camden was standing on the wing open the entire time They finally were able to reverse the basketball And George pull up pop misfires Balls going to stay with Syracuse underneath their own hoop Two teams still feeling each other out early on a Wednesday night Cal the early lead Nothing like being a shooter getting your first look to go down John Camden with the three ball really is starting to dominate the portal which in todays landscape of college basketball you need to do Well what hes shown you was that you come there and its a fit And when he recruits guys like that you see the uptick in all of their offensive production when he comes Hes a really good offensive mind and you can see the respect that Syracuse is paying to him because theyre coming out and theyre zoning them When under coach Autrys watch theyve been mostly mantoman defense The one thing that has hurt Cal this season is consistency in the front court and theyre without big man Lee Dort tonight Something to keep an eye on Both teams rely on their back court right on Q George off the mark Syracuse back to their manto man which I think will be critical for them and neutralize this penetration Now they got to guard all the actions and make sure they get out to the shooters Camden good look inside and an easy finish for E Leech Great job there running a four five ball screen That communication on the defense again Got to be better for the Freeman Hell make you pay from there after the season though Five points at Virginia Freeman strokes home the three All nine points for Syracuse tonight Half inch from beyond the arc Good take Scoop to the hoop for Day Ames Hes unafraid at 62 Hell go right into the trees Someone finally made a twopoint field goal Other than that we had free throws and threes I know were in analytical times but layups still work Freeman from the same spot to time A lot of movement a lot of back door cutting with Cal When they dribble at you you got to know someones going to go back door Camden pull up contested and drains him Everyone on the perimeter for the Orange has got to be solid guarding Youve got to contain the dribble because if you get in rotation with Kyle you really open up threepoint shooting and then they become a really difficult team to guard right down the lane Everything but the finish Kyle cleans up the spill William Kyle in perfect position to put that home I think both teams are vulnerable off that What happens is that doing dribble penetration big rotates over Neither team is strong rebounding the basketball Theyre going to have trouble doing that if the bigs rotate floater does not fall for names Cal doing a much better job getting to the basket against the manto man instead of settling for those lower percentage shots against the zone Flying to the rim William Kyle on a rack attack I think thats the recipe for both of these teams Get in the paint off the dribble for the dribble penetration and just continue to share and move the basketball Step in and out No good Theres Donnie Freeman in attack mode Loses the handle cheering Great job there defensively by the Orange closing out finding shooters You got to get back and run to the paint but you got to close out quickly Good defense Nate George got the better of Pippen Stays cow ball Camden fires the three Res out cheering This the effort you want to see Your team has lost six or seven Theyre coming out right now A lob finds Nate Kings fouled Thats the one thing Adrien Autry told us right before tip off He feels like this team is still fighting to go down big against North Carolina and still find a way to battle that albe it a losing effort and then on the road against Virginia was right there with the ranked team Can you find a way to win tonight at home Just bring the feelood factor at least for the players a little back Coming up 9 Eastern over on ESPN 2 Nate Aean Jacobe Gillespie of Tennessee taking on Josh Hubard Mississippi State in an all SEC showdown He needs to take his jacket off laughter Ky Anthony was at the scorers table there before the Nate Kings free throw And as Randolph just said he was about to come in with a jacket on He obviously did not play over the weekend against Virginia There was a lot made of it Adrien Entry made it very simple He said Coachs decision didnt like the matchup with the physicality that Virginia presents And where he helps immediately is this team has struggled with bench production doing this losing streak And they like to see nothing better than seeing Kai and Anthony come in the game and knock down a couple shots Bell down the lane Good defense again Nate Kings cheering Syracuse has owned their defensive assignments in the manto man George the floater falls Hes in attack mode Hes a much better player when he gets to that right hand but he has unbelievable vision A really gifted pass over the basketball You got to corral him when he gets off ball screens and cut off his vision Campbell pass up the good look for three Went inside and well go to the line to shoot two when we come back Well Syracuse turning some defense into offense getting some stops and theyve dozed in front a threepoint lead with 1134 left in the first 17 for the first time tonight One thing that Orange fans are hoping doesnt happen is that this game turns in to a free throw shooting contest because Cal one of the best in the country top 10 in free throw percentage and Syracuse in the bottom 10 One thing we can see that I think critical for the Orange here and why they have this lead here early is that on their six made field goals they have four of those Theyve been assisted So theyve assisted four of their six field goals So right now for a team that had issues of sharing the basketball and getting assists I think thats led to some of their scoring droughts Off to a really good start here of making shots but I think its coming because theyre sharing the basketball playing for someone else And of course were talking about how good Cal is at shooting free throws They missed both of them And then Chris Bell the former Orange hits the three Well you jinx them soon as you brought it up about how good a free throw shooter they are Theyll miss one he missed both of them But Bell atones for those misses and creates his first shot against his former team to tie it at 17 Thats one thing I think that is hurt the orange is that right there Turnovers and an inability to cleanly rebound the basketball I think theyve given up too many offensive rebounds doing this losing streak and you go by against Virginia they gave up 17 against Carolina they gave up 12 only four against Notre Dame is which they won and then they gave up 15 against NC State and so again theyve got to defensively get to one and done rebound good block by Suare on the inside George into the paint kicks it out Kayen Anthony cheering Really good job on the ball screen Really aggressive on Nate George Tyler Betsy miss fires from three Offensive rebound White knocks it off the freshman TT Carr to keep possession with the Orange Theyre really aggressive with Nate George coming off ball screens Hes coming out of the game right now for JJ Stings But you can see the offensive rebound there Really good effort by Sadique White White who has the ball here also had limited minutes against Virginia A lot of attention made about cheering Anthony not playing but White only played two minutes against the Cavaliers Syracuse turns it over there If youre the orange in that situation you want to grab it Theyll just call a violation The ball will be played at half court Now Cal gets to run the baseline out of bounds because thats where the ball went out of bounds Yeah the turnovers momentum killers particularly if Cal cashes in which they do And Adrien said you know points off turnovers killed them against Virginia Theyve been a bugaboo all season for the Orange Well had you touched it it would have been inbounded at the half court You let him go underneath Now theyre running a scoring play on the baseline out of bounds White powers it home Good move from the freshman Sadique White Great job there not settling behind the threepoint line Hes capable of making the three but hes much better and scarier and hes coming at you getting downhill Campbell trying to blow by Betsy into the paint Shot clock down to seven Camden fires the three Cant connect Sari got away with one there John Camden known its a really good threepoint shooter You cannot be in the lane Closing out late The lob to White Backto back baskets for Sadique White again And also another assisted basket there Syracuse guards Their strength is attacking the basket downhill Theyre getting high percentage looks right now The Cus made five of their last six shots Ames lost the handle Really quick hands there by Suare reaching in on the ball screen He knows his role Hes an active defender and rebounder Cant see couldnt get it off cleanly Campbell on a great close out for Cal Already five points off turnovers tonight for the Golden Bears Their best in transition They want this game I think at a higher pace Ames fading away Oh the master of the midrange Day Ames Good off the bouncy These guards Pippen and Ames are really shifty Stlingley Great touch on the floater The immediate answer I think thats the best shot in his repertoire there And hes so fast off the bounce Combo guard He has mastered that floater Well you said it right A tip off A battle of the back courts tonight Camden fires in the three from long range It puts Cal back in front by one They got away with that rotation the last possession I told you you cannot leave John Camden open for three on the catch You got to be there Cant be in the paint trying to rotate out They got to be there on the catch Runs off Feel good Camden who has a hot hand right now Foul called Well John Camden he was massive in a row for their first NFL game in 1987 Wow Sounds like you guys got a lot of work ahead All you New House grads laughter interviewing candidates Well the the school needs a new chancellor and now a new athletic director So a lot of leadership changes here in Central New York You guys got to get going man Right now in a good battle back and forth first half between Syracuse and Cal Donnie Freeman in a double team and its ripped away Campbell with a head of steam Everything but the finish and Pippets there to clean up the spill Thats the one thing that we coach Archie talked to us about again Another live ball turnover and theyre going to double Donnie Freeman Every time he touches it in the post So now thats happened He knows its coming Hes got to make his decisions a lot quicker One thing thatll help him against that trap hes got to turn and face And another turnover Cal has numbers Campbell throws it in Backto back baskets for the Golden Bears off a Syracuse turnover Has been there Achilles Hill Just live ball turnovers They can got to find a way to at least get a shot up Freeman double teamed again Passes out of it this time Kyle goes up strong and knocks it home Thats how you handle it Double team comes Hes got to spread it out to an open teammate That time William Cow right at the rim had to gather himself and finish Kick to the corner Nolan Dorsey and that rims in a friendly roll for the road team And Nolan Dorsey has his first basket of cheering the night Its always a difficult play for a defender to guard Balls on the weak side Youre underneath the rim and help side Now as it changes angle you go from weak side to strong side youve got to close out to that shooter Shot clock ticks down to 10 Freeman picked up his dribble in no mans land Has to hand it off for Starling Far away from the rim Settles for a step back contested three Goes off Cal So itll be Syracuse ball with two seconds on the shot clock What can you draw up here Well you got any play you have Two seconds is a lifetime on a baseline out of bounds play Always energetic Mark Madson barking orders for his out of bounds defense here right in front of the Cal bench Look for Nate Kings coming off a back screen Little screen to screener action Something like that Getting Nick Kings coming towards the corner for a three Kings not opening a contested corner Freeman has to fire it up cheering Kyle saw that too There was no way they were going to allow him come off that screen wide open Benches coaches everyone was yelling out the play The Cal defense has really clamped down Largest lead of the night for the Golden Bears Calc contested look No good cheering Now could Syracuse turn some defense into offense Deep three Kings way off the mark They like to see him They had numbers there again Attack Think Kings as we said has been shooting it well Hes got it swiped away Kyle and Freeman with cheering the active hands Up ahead Kayen Anthony spins his way in and draws the foul Thats what you want to see more Syracuse Get up clean rebound with the athletes and the ability to attack off the bounce This is a really good defensive team And Ken Anthony there drives and gets the spin move Takes it goes to the line for two Well a lot was made of Kenne Anthony not playing over the weekend in the loss to Virginia and he has played extended minutes of this first half Been on the court for now more than eight minutes of game action you see his production from nonconference to conference and you that DNP was a coachs decision and what youll see next year is that number significantly jump because hes going to physically mature Hes going to hes going to get in the weight room have a really good summer as you see dad looking on the skill sets there the original block elach in perfect position And Cal regains a sixpoint lead 14 points in the paint for the Golden Bears Anthony right in front of dad Left it short Offensive rebound Freeman has it Thats what Donnie Freemans going to have to be prepared to do is play facing the basket Theyre not going to double him until he goes inside the post Launches a three Now I think he needs to go inside accept the double team and open things up for a teammate Force Kyle to play in single cover Leech misses the dunk cheering He just found himself open there I think he surprised himself Good ball movement finds Starling Good take from JJ Stling And thats more like it for the Orange offense Great catch on the short roll and pass out of it by William Cow Thats what you do against a hard hedge in the ball screen You can get it big that can catch it on the move and and make that weak side pass You get open looks We got Pippen against Anthony here Two Hall of Fame fathers cheering storied NBA careers going at it Pippen has the switch Gets Kyle in the air Shot clock down to two Jes has to hurry and Kyle owned that defensive possession William Kyle all over that one The Orange battling at home Cal desperate opportunities here But getting this win as again it quite is a quad one win When youre coming down a home stretch these type of wins matter Winning on a road is challenging And this team is right there on the cusp of being on the right side of the bubble including tonight Cal has seven games remaining before the ACC tournament Would five and two be enough when you look at their remaining schedule I think it all depends on your scheduling Things you cant lose And what you cant do in situations like this is lose to the teams at the bottom of your league You got to find a way if youre going to drop some You got to win some against some opponents at the top and try to avoid losing the ones at the bottom Back door open for Bell who is fouled You take a look at the remaining schedule Not a lot of quality opportunities left You have SMU at home a rivalry game against Stanford But in terms of road conference wins its tonight against Syracuse and then Wake in the final game of the regular season Yeah theres a lot But you got to take care of business at home again beating SMU will be a good win for these guys where no matter where that is and having the opportunity to take care of business here in the dome and then heading to Winston trying to get that one in the final game of the season before the ACC tournament Chris Bell trying to go to the NCAA tournament for the first time Something he wasnt able to do in the three years in his Syracuse uniform and his return to the dome tonight as he checks out Five points to show for it so far but more importantly his team in front by four And what you want to see out of Cal here early is you dont want to lose early to the Orange desperation Theyre coming out losing six or seven Theyre competing Theyre playing hard Theyre fighting Youre cow You have to match that intensity So far weve got a really good first half here Both teams are competing at high level Shots are falling gives it a great back and forth first half Kings with backto back baskets now for Syracuse Stolen away and its Kings again Hes making a big impact right now Right to the rim for another two And Nate Kings ties it at 35 Great job there by Nate Kings finishing the last two baskets at the rim but it was Nate George on the weak side rotating over on a back door cut And another turnover 50 seconds left in the first half Trailing three Kings Good opportunity to fire the Orange in front ahead of halftime Really good look there by Nate Kings Good unselfish play too by the Orange in transition Have a mismatch in size if they decide to look at it Heres the freshman TT Carr cheering and a foul called on an illegal screen against Campbell will give Syracuse the ball back with an opportunity to take the last shot of this first half DJ Campbell tried to set a ball screen there and no need wasnt quite set Ends up creating a turnover Syracuses last lead was 2321 eight minutes ago Cal led by as many as six And now the Orange an opportunity to nose in front going into halftime Cows in his zone Clock ticks down to seven Heres JJ Stling The floater No good Itll stay Syracuse ball 18 Eight seconds but Adrian Autry has a use it or lose it timeout and he elects to use it cheering Well step aside for 30 seconds Final play of the first half coming your way Its been a good one so music far Noted at 35 Well if you were trying to beat the bathroom line at halftime you havent missed any game action here Youre probably back and were still trying to inbound the ball after both coaches elected to use a timeout with 18 seconds left Nate George the inbounder eyeing a lob Nobody there finds Kings He had it swiped off his hands by Pippen to finish this first half Well good back at this win for two very different reasons Syracuse just desperate for any victory They have lost six of their last seven Now this could be a win that gets you into the NCAA tournament Yeah both teams are still playing for a lot competing at a high level I thought the Orange did a really good job clawing back into this thing changing defenses and really playing physical and really driving the ball to the rim Nate George called for a reach in denying the big man Milo Sheil inside Chicago very close and competitive first half Youre right Cal had that separation led by as many as six and Syracuse closed the gap cheering Heres Chris Bell former Orange Hands off for Pippen Justin Pippen Hes been the catalyst this season on the offensive end for Cal feeds it inside and with the shot clock under a second Els gets the finish You got to front If youre a guard and you switch I know what youre thinking You thought the shot was going to go up and you wanted to get behind and box out but until that shot goes up youre giving up so much size front Freemans been double teamed all night and he turns it over Now Cal has forced Freeman into uncomfortable decisions passing out of the double team or trying to fight through traffic And thats his third turnover Jay when a double team comes and youre on a post and him hes taking his dribble and hes dribbling out near half court and hes picking it up Just turn and face while you have a live dribble Theyre coming before he puts it on the floor Turn face so you can see the defense Hes keeping his back to the basket and dribbling the half court and throwing it away Hes got to do a better job of handling that because theyre going to trap him every time he touches it in the post And Freeman only three points in the first half after a season low five at Virginia over the weekend George fires the three Cant connect Syracuse has now missed 11 straight threes as Cal goes inside Crafty move for Justin Pippen Thats the hard part about this game Pitman and Day Ames are so shifty and crafty and it finishes Starling the immediate answer Hes been the consistent bright spot in the last few games for Syracuse offensively He knows what he is Get downhill Dont settle for jump shots Use your size and quickness Get in the paint Shoot your floaters and your runners Kings and Starling have combined for 20 And that rims out Cals getting good looks and just cant finish him More importantly if youre the orange youre limited with one shot Just make sure you rebound it Kyle corrals it Dumps it down low to Donnie Freeman Give and go Kyle nothing Jay A could do but foul He was given up 8 in in that matchup Double team came in late that time Gave enough time for Donnie Freeman to see it You got to take away the easiest pass is to see Will Cal in the dunking spot Got to rotate Take that away That time Cal Bear is one step late Kyle has struggled at the free throw line all season long 49 This is the first A terrific ABC double header Sunday afternoon Womens hoops North Carolina at Duke in a ranked tobacco road matchup And then Texas at Tennessee Tips off at 1 Eastern and 3 Eastern Sunday on ABC Syracuse period Thats a win if youre Syracuse You want one out of every two when William Cal goes to the free throw line Shoots about 49 on the year Pippen lost the handle Kings has been very disruptive on the defensive end for Syracuse Every time Ive watched him hes been impressive defensively Just really active with his hands gets in the passing lanes does a really good job chasing down blocking shots I think hes an really underrated defender Not many teams talk about how good he is but every time Ive watched him hes been really impressive on that end of the floor George splits the double team loves it up for an easy finish Sadique White great job One of the few mistakes Cal Bears have made in their ball screen defense When youre really aggressive and youre showing up top you cannot get split And Kyle denies the alleyoop attempt on the other end George has a dispossessed Ames Goes right at Starling Loses the handle The extra pass Bell wide open Hell make him pay nothing but the bottom of the net against his former team Yeah they had numbers once they secured the ball Great job of spacing and Chris Bale the beneficiary of that one Spent three seasons in the Syracuse uniform in his first trip back to the dome Been quiet until that three Kings not a good shot Nothing but air Thats not a good shot Thats a settle Those are some of the threes we talk about there Drive it Get in the paint Close rotation Theres no shot blockers on the floor for Kyle And after starting this game three of six from three Syracuse has now missed their last 12 attempts from three Good steal George Having fun with it out the window for two Second time Justin Pitman a little loose with the ball Hes talking to the official saying hes got fouled Hes got to be a little tougher with it Camden the immediate answer Syracuse got it tied at 42 Cal has had some big punchback shots and Camden two big threes to regain momentum Starling hes had good touch tonight on the inside Yeah Cal not as sharp in the in their ball screen action here Syracuse is doing a really good job of attacking them in the middle earlier in the game Bears did a really good job showing and recovering on the ball Last two possessions against ball screen squeeze action They little slots misfires that time Got a good look Pippen stays WITH THE PLAY THREADED perfectly and cashes in for two Great hustle paying off Great job sneaking into the passing lane He had those two careless turnovers early Got one back there Sadique White highf flying Another rim rocker from the freshman Eich is really struggling now on the ball screen action Matson is going to have to either change ball screen touchs coverage or hes going to have to do some type of substitutions because right now they are really shredding this cow defense particularly in his action and that time hes had enough Hes like Im going to get a foul on this one A frustration foul Its Sadique White Hes had highlight reel worthy dunks all season long Hes got four of them tonight Thats what you want to do here Chris Bell shows his former team I can knock down three I can still shoot it baby You got to guard me And here look at the split by Nate George and Alioop A deep white So this is the first Randolph We had a power outage at the dome during the commercial break Everything went dark at the dome Generator fired back up Took a little while to get our audio back but were looking forward to the finish here in Syracuse And whats been a terrific close competitive game so far Hello Takes a little bit more than a power surge to shut me up man Talking about like dunks like that by William Cal coming out in transition Get out the way of that free train Now the one thing that still hasnt come back is our scoreboard and the scoreboard in the dome JJ Starling rips it away Syracuse is up to 50 points Make it 52 And Mark Madson says Give me a timeout So Syracuse back in front on a 6 nothing run And Mark Madson takes a timeout as the Orange have swung the momentum 47 We lost lights We lost power for a good 5 10 seconds and things are slowly getting back But with the power outage came the Syracuse surge The Orange lead by five 5247 1230 remaining in this second half Now our score bug at the bottom of the screen is tied to the dome scoreboard which is still trying to boot back up The Orange taking control of this game on the defensive end of the floor They are really getting physical getting through screens Bell going against Kings Forced into a fadeaway misfires Cal has missed their last five shots Trailing by five 5247 Good take by the freshman TT Carr And hell try and earn two from the free throw line Thats what you do when youre struggling from the field Hadnt scored a field goal in the last two and a half minutes Stop Continue to settle for jump shots Get in the paint play off two draw fouls Good way to get yourself back in the rhythm of a game Randolph I look over my left shoulder and I see the student radio at WER where I learned playbyplay and theyve got to give the time and the score because you cant see it but weve got our score bug back I was ready to go full radio for the last 12 minutes here if I had to Its good prep and good training for those guys man Thats what you guys do over there in the new house Get these guys ready Back to a onep possession game Syracuse with the momentum Great ball handling George lacked the finish though Good recovery defensively by Cal Heres Carr with a head of steam He goes coast to coast for two How about the freshman TT Carr lead finish there with contact I thought Nate George had an opportunity to stop playoff two and read the defense and thought he dove into the defender hoping to get a call They didnt make make the call Betsy that rims him Good take by Tyler Betsy No more is a threepoint shooter but gets two there Yeah there hes scouting quarters to run him off the line He did a great job there just getting in the lane and playing off two Taking what the defense has given him Syracuse has connected on seven of their last eight shots They have swung momentum in this second half Bell for the tie Hell get an opportunity to hit three free throws and tie this game at 54 when we come back Happy to have the score bug back and Syracuse happy music to be in front by three and then to give them some of that rim protection Syracuse guards are just taking advantage of it getting to the rim forcing rotation throwing lobs and finishing themselves We got three shots here Chris Bell at the line Three shots Chris Bell facing his former team tonight Misses cheering the first of three as he was fouled before the break Bell a terrific free throw shooter at 88 on the season but misses the first makes the second Cal as a team a top 10 team in the nation in free throw shooting Syracuse at the bottom 10 That could be critical down the stretch of a close competitive game Kyle has slowly fought their way back Jay Syracuse is on the 80 run early and got it Kyle got an offensive rebound and then got themselves to the free throw line Since then theyve been slowly chipping away getting more comfortable and they closed this gap Two teams desperate for a win on a Wednesday night Syracuse has lost six of seven cheering as Nate Kings has fouled and will get two at the line So they just want to get back to winning ways down the stretch of this season Whereas Cal theyre desperate to win to bolster an NCAA tournament resume that could use a boost of a road conference win Right now theyre first four out according to ESPNs brackettologist Joe Lonardi Both teams are desperate Playing for a little bit different reasons right now and I think youve seen that so far and thats why its such a close competitive game Absolutely Neither team can find that separation with the heart and desperation that both teams have played with Syracuse back up by three after Kings drains both from the line What is going to separate these two teams in the final 11 minutes For Syracuse you got to take care of the basketball Continue to put the ball in the paint For Kyle can you dribble penetration and spread it out to shoot Elach drops it in Elach has got to solidify that spot Hes got to do a better job in the ball screen defense He came out of the game because he struggled William Kyle went for the onehanded jam and lost the handle I dont know if you call that a jam Jay That might be a Jay Alterra onehanded dunk Thats Thats what I call that Well weve seen William Kyle do some pretty spectacular things trying to dunk the basketball He has And thats not one of his finer moments there He was about 4 feet away He looked like a like a Sprite commercial ad or something like that for that one He wasnt close to making that dump Aes fade away He is so good in the midrange And that fires Cal in front He is Hes really good scorer on all three levels but I think he is at his best cheering pulling up and shooting off the bounce in the midrange Stling Nobody picked him up An easy layin for JJ Stling Thats just a great reject to the ball screen As youre a guard you get run into it so many times you start cheating it And with JJ Stling size and speed you cant guess Syracuse has made eight of their last 10 shots And the master of the midrange continues Backto back baskets for day cheering aims Look up now Cals right back in the lead of this And pace is starting to pick up for both teams Kyle backing down Elich trying to spin his way free Roll throws around Does not drop Reathers Hes trying to muscle it down and he does screaming cheering ONEHANDED HAMMER WILLIAM KYLE William Kyle senses Bears have a difficult challenge defending the front line guys inside And hes really aggressive right now AMES HAS TAKEN OVER Day day Ames count it plus the foul He scored the last six for Cal and a chance for an and one He was quiet early here Takes the dribble handoff turns the corner takes the contact Its his third basket in a row He was quiet in the first half He needs to pick it up Number seven Kyon cheering Kayen Anthony back into the game Controversial coachs decision Did not play over the weekend against Virginia He did cheering play in the first half 10 minutes for coach Autry at earning time in a critical game down the stretch Twopoint game George draws the foul Been a very physical second half as well It is Both teams know again Syracuse has the ability to protect the rim with their shot blocking ability but I dont think Kyle has And you can see their guards here with Nate George putting his head down getting to the rim forcing officials to blow to us Its funny right before tip off you said this is going to be a backcourt battle that decides the outcome We have seen that Nate George and JJ Starling against Justin Pippen and Day Ames Right now its Ames and George that have taken center stage Good time to remind you college game day on the womens side coming your way on Saturday ahead of South Carolina and LSU A top six matchup in the SEC and the College Game Day crew Well have you covered from Baton Rouge Dont want to miss that Saturday on ABC That should be a great game Two programs that just absolutely love each other Two Hall of Fame head coaches two talented teams Thats what its all about Yeah thatll be a great one As we continue our march to Madness Cals hoping they can book their first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade havent been dancing since 2016 They built a very strong resume 17 and seven Joe Lonardi has them first four out This could be the difference of getting into the dance or not If you can get a road conference win tonight it still counts as a quad one win Sure If hes in the top 75 in the net the Orange going to make them earn it Uh no Look you talk to Adrien Autry you talk to the athletic director John Wild Hack you talk to the fans nobodys happy with how this season has gone to this point but they have continued to battle Give them credit Jay Theres no quit I mean a lot of teams this late in the year you lose six or seven The energy and the efforts there They just got to continue to improve ball movement and shot making just like that I That right there is the key to Syracuse winning Not just tonight any game Just unselfish play When a basketball moves everyone touches it They share it Let the open man take the shot Elach good answer on the inside Youve often said Randolph you can judge how Syracuse is performing based off the assist numbers Just the ball movement You know when they dont have shots like that the ball doesnt move And that inherent pass leads to a turnover Ames into the attack Everything going through Day Ames right now for Pal and for good reason Hes got the hot hand down the lane Ames fading away Missed it Anthony has the rebound from Syracuse This lineup that Syracuse has Elix has struggled to finish inside So now Syracuse is really athletic and really can spread you out right now with Suare with his ability to to screen and roll Kings did that time Got a shove called against Nate George Itll be Cal basketball trailing by one Weve got a fun finish coming on a Wednesday night in the ACC No quitting the Orange here Relentless play by William Cow chasing down his own miss with the strong finish here Orange sensing a chance they could win Kenne Anthony with the one more Nate Kings knocking down a three Cuse up one Wednesday night ACC double header Weve got a good one here at the dome Syracuse clinging to a onepoint lead 6564 The backcourt battle has stolen the show Pippen and Ames against Starling and George Camden at the line Right before we went away Syracuse committed a foul It sends Cal to a one and one Camden makes the first so earns the second and ties this game at 65 And thats something to watch as we go down home stretch here of this game You got the best free throw shooting team in the ACC versus the worst And see how this pans out Stagger Town noses in front by one Donnie Freeman hammers it home and fires the Orange back in front Thats the easiest look Donnie Freeman has seen all night long touching the basketball that close Only thing he has to do is just like that Hes got to make a quick decision when he gets it inside because he knows the double teams coming Only five points tonight for Freeman Cal very balanced scoring Five players in double digit points including a redhot John Camden Drains it from downtown There was no doubt in his mind when he caught that I thought Cayenne Anthony did a great job closing out Just a heck of a shot by a veteran forward John Cam But Camden had a season high on the road and a big win against Miami a couple of weeks ago He has showed up on the road in a critical conference game again Heres George Oh my Went right into Pippen whos called for a foul Justin Pippen doesnt like the call Nate George has an opportunity to tie this game at 69 from the free throw line Syracuse has got to be careful I think this is sometimes where they get a little in trouble They get predictable with Nate George Late shot clock trying to go oneonone Well you thought that the free throw comparison would be in favor of Cal Thats what its shown this season but tonight Syracuse has hung with the best shooting free throw team in the ACC Well most of the time Jay its about who takes him George knocks them both down Hes the best free throw shooter for the Orange So were tied again Back and forth we go on a Wednesday night in the ACC Watch out for John Cam Bell against his former team Buries it Great execution coming in Bells third three against his former team That one the biggest of the bunch George swatted from behind Back up to Bell Hes fouled and hell shoot two Syracuse got to get back and set your defense You do a really good job when its set Quick turnover there Unable to set your defense You had the foul here Great play coming down and running half court execution Running a second Chris Bell steps into one Bell usually a terrific free throw shooter 88 on the season has missed his second of the night cheering But right now that big three the difference cheering for Chris Bell playing the team that he spent three years playing for here at the dome Shocking to see him go 0 for two at the line Absolutely And hes 87 from the line Didnt expect an empty possession from him King trying to spin free lobbs to Kyle who gathers and draws the foul That is the fourth foul against Justin Pippen Mark Madson a decision to make Do you leave your sophomore guard in with four fouls or do you give him a breather here with 454 to play Youre going to learn a lot about his trust in Justin Pippen I think whats on whats at stake here You leave him in maybe try to move him to someone off the ball The problem is when youre playing Syracuse theres no guards that are not aggressive and attacking Its Nate Kings JJ Stling and Nate George for Syracuse in the final five minutes A team thats lost six of their last seven and a struggle to find ways to win How do you find a way to win this one against a team thats desperate knocking on the door of the NCAA tournament in Cal One thing thatll help is if that your 49 free throw shooter knocks down two Just one of two that time El lost the ball He lost his footing and Syracuse retains possession here trailing by two Cal trying to see if they should challenge Helix was asking for a challenge there thinking Donnie Freeman touched it last James misses the three Another offensive rebound for Syracuse Maybe third times the charm on this possession for the Orange Jay Williams got to start and take over this game with his activity Freeman wide open In and out No good Syracuse is one of their last 16 for three after starting this game three of six Pimping

has been the catalyst for Syracuse particularly in this second half 12 points 12 rebounds two blocks for him willing the Orange to the finish line here It has Its been his activity things that dont even show up on his stat sheet The last time he deflected an offensive rebound even for this possession that allowed JJ Stling to get the ball and then go to the free throw line here Hes been involved in the last three baskets Stling has struggled from the line this season at just under 55 This is the first cheering Hey WE GOT ONE SHOT HERE STRAIGHT IN Stling got the second Its hard to feel comfortable Jay in close games which youre going to be in when youre not a really good free throw shooting team Cal the best free throw shooting team in the ACC Syracuse the worst Could that play the difference in the final 3 minutes and 40 seconds He leads hands off for Bell cheering Shot clock down to seven Pippen calling for a clear out Pull up pop Missed it Freeman wins the rebound Thats a great rebound there by Freeman in traffic cheering Cal clinging to a onepoint lead Little more than three minutes left to play Heres Donnie Freeman Hes fouled Randolph you mentioned it Hes making quick decisions now before that double team can come in Freeman one of the adjustments they made is that having William Cal at the top Theyre doubling with the big Theyre coming big big on a double So

have ourselves a game free throws and big part of it Ames the crossover cheering didnt get the finish Syracuse gets the stop Timeout Adrien Autry Buckle up for a fun finish cheering JJ starting with

CHANCE FOR AN end one go Great job opening up the lane again And watch William Cow inside You see the weave They fake the go screen and William Kyle uses his body to seal Elish and he cant rotate over

cheering Chris Bell back in the game William Kyle back in the game Bell obviously the sharp shooter One straight in ball one You want William Carol in the game because he provides you an ability to switch with five which Syracuse will do whether were up three or four Missed it It stays a threepoint lead Cal can tie it with a three 15 seconds left in overtime You foul Ames deep two Got it Its a onepoint game with 95 seconds remaining Ames I think attempted a step back three but lost his footing so had to settle for the deep two Somehow managed to make a tough shot Look at this shot here Syracuse opting not to foul And here Ames drives and falls Tries to step back right inside the line and answers the call that he asks Hes calling asking the officials for the foul Little contact there Thats just a great shot Loses his balance gets back to his feet hits nothing but net in a dimly lit dome on a Wednesday night power outage in the city Moving overtime but right now its Syracuse ball Onepoint lead for the Orange Plenty of time Again its just Syracuse You are allowed to run the baseline now Theyre going to get into their football formation but everyone lining up out of bounds And Cal is out of timeouts Mark Madson just took his final one What are you looking to accomplish when you have the football formation like this Randolph Just confusion spreading you out getting some confusion because youre allowed to run the baseline Starling gets it in safely to Kings who is fouled But the best Nate Kings can do in this situation is make it a threepoint game Theres plenty of time left 95 seconds left to work with for Cal once they get the ball back after these two free throw attempts Nate Kings initially fell once he came in bounds and tried to get open Great job of not panicking by JJ Stling and finding him Kings he will be at the line for Syracuse Oh Kings leads all scorers with 22 points tonight Steps to the line with the weight of the game on his shoulders Six of 10 free throw shooting and the two biggest ones of the night coming now from Audrey I try to get William Cal back in the game cheering Theres an opportunity here Even if its missed he may get the rebound He goes to the scores table now Yeah The officials are just making sure they got the clock right and understandably so Its been very difficult to keep track of the score with the scoreboard

A game that has had it all Overtime A power outage Two And a thrilling nine seconds remaining at overtime Kings misses the first Cal no timeouts remaining Syracuse has one cheering The best Kings can do is make it a twopoint game And he does Whats Cal looking for here Day Ames putting his head down headed left Hes going to throw it right back to him and let him go Here we go 7 seconds in overtime Ames working against Kyle step back FOR THE TIE MISSED IT ELACH CLEANS UP THE SPILL AND WERE HEADED TO DOUBLE OVERTIME Road to boost their resume The difference between making and missing March Madness One thing to watch out for again when you get the double overtime watch fouls And we talked about it heading into overtime Nate George had four Kyle didnt attack him as much as Syracuse did Justin Pitman and fouled him out immediately when they went after him And be interested if Cal Bears attack him on the defensive end of the floor George pull a pop Brings out no good Kyle trying to rip away the rebound and a foul called Elach and Kyle applause battling for that ball Elach needs help He needs help The guards got to come down to help him And he he does his job He comes over to help He is fighting with the motor and the strength and the power of William Cal And that is the fourth foul against Milos Elich who right now is the hero for Cal forcing the second overtime They have a depleted front court Elach has had to play big minutes 14 points 13 rebounds for him Kyle puts Syracuse in front One of two at the line Syracuse is not an empty possession You get one out of two with the William Cow Thats what you take Cal has played through Day Ames throughout the second half of the first overtime TT CARR THE FRESHMAN FINDS Ames working against Freeman trying to shake free He lost the handle Syracuse has numbers Starling Lot of contact No call Freeman puts it home Donnie Freeman And the Orange leads by three Cal has some concerns right now on the offensive end of the floor Day cheering Ames looks fatigued Hes played a lot of minutes and hes put this team on his back in the second half in overtime right now and hes looking for a teammate to step up and help him And Justin Pippen is fouled out of this game Thats a dynamic duo in the back court Car three no good Elach another offensive rebound And he cleans up the spill Elach dominant on the offensive glass Hes continued to play play hard Five offensive rebounds for El Le himself Its a onepoint game Little more than three minutes left in overtime Freeman Missed it But it stays Syracuse ball William Kyle Heads up play there Saves his ball and deflects it right off TT Carr Hes just going to get it I mean hes accounted for so many possessions Extra possessions for Syracuse 15 points 15 rebounds for William Kyle FREEMAN CONTACT Donnie Freeman He is starting to take over this second overtime The double team is not coming anymore So now hes back in his comfort zone attacking the paint Something that coach Mattis and the Cow Bears are going to have to think about The next time he touches it you got to come cheering Ames picked up his dribble Heres TT Carr playing critical minutes with Justin Pippen fouled out Carr hoisted up off the mark Shot clock violation And this will be Syracuse basketball leading by three cheering and applause Syracuse is just out hustling right now the Cal Bears and you got to imagine fatigue is setting in Theyve lost Justin Pippen Jay Ames just gassing right now who else is going to step up and Mark Madson I think realizes his team in the middle and hes been attacking oneonone and hes been delivering Well were playing this game off a generator William Kyle and Donnie Freeman theyve been the generators laughter at this second overtime They have William Kyles been special cheering He has seven offensive rebounds and he le has had his hand full keeping him off the glass And Nate George has made good decisions 10 assists to go along with 12 points Hes got the ball here cheering Calls for Stling floats it to Freeman Starling good pass Kings a three Got it cheering Cal in the danger zone A minute 45 in the second overtime Golden Bears down six Could not ask for a better possession if youre Syracuse Donnie Freeman that time sees the double team dribbles out passes to JJ Stling He won more than Nate Kings And the bench is sensing an opportunity to close one out Still a ton of time left Camden makes the first Just does feel like Cal might be running out of gas here They dont have a deep bench and they have asked a lot of their poor group tonight Thats where they miss Justin Pippen is because Syracuse is switching everything one through five and its forcing guys to break you down and they Ames done a great job of that but hes just running out of gas There still is plenty of time at this second overtime A minute 39 Two free throws coming for Syracuse cheering And Jay I like the option of that too I know youre looking at the score Youre going Its a minute and 39 seconds left We dont need to foul But coach Match is playing the long game I think hes looking at the way Syracuse to shot free throws and they miss And instead of waiting and running the shot clock down now you dont have to have a three Kings one of two Syracuse hits a 100 Fivepoint lead here in double overtime The Orange desperate to close this game out and end the skid Theyve lost six of seven Day Ames has other ideas Missed it though Ames whos been clutch all night Running out of legs here in double overtime Yeah fatigue And hes settling in there Youd like to see them run something for one of their shooters either Camden or Bell maybe try to get him on the go screen since Syracuse is switching everything You just said Cal didnt even need the three there Could have gone inside Still a lot of time left cheering One minute remaining George cant connect They got numbers if they push it Lacking energy Tough to push it Ames doing the best he can Ball on the floor Camden cheering rejected OH DONNIE FREEMAN CAME OVER and closed out UP AHEAD Freeman puts it home cheering and Syracuse can start to feel it This is a great defensive effort by on the Orange CAMDEN NOT SO FAST A big three to make it a fourpoint game John Camden and Cal not going quietly And William Kyle stays down after the Camden three Theres a stoppage in play Look at this defensive effort Donnie Freeman comes running from out of your screen Gets the clean block and William Cal again Look at his motive Hes not near Hes not the closest one to that basketball He gets it Throws it to a teammate and Donnie Freeman finishes it off Syracuse relying on what has gotten them to this point all year long and thats their defense and William Carol is sitting there dealing with cramps and he has played so hard and I think hes the reason the orange going back to the football formation for the inbounds here Yeah they know whats coming I just would not allow Nate Kings or Nate James to get this basketball Cal was reluctant to foul George whos been outstanding tonight 10 assists 12 points five of six from the free throw line And most importantly hit that three after Syracuse was one for 16 from three during that stretch He decides to take and make a big shot at the end of regulation Two shot Here we go Now a chance to fire the Orange up by six with 30 seconds remaining in this second overtime session applause 17 assists for Syracuse And again Nate George is the catalyst of that He has 10 assists So everyone has chipped in and had their moments And they George with a double double at 13 and 10 so far Can he get to 14 and push this lead up to six Got them both Cal got a quick three from Camden on the previous possession Can they get another one here You got to go quick Precious seconds ticking off this clock Only 20 of them left Bell has to heave it and draws the foul So he will get three at the line with an opportunity to cut this lead in half But that is the last thing you could afford to do if youre Syracuse No its at that point just run him off the line and make him shoot a two Last thing you wanted to do there was commit a foul And its the fourth foul against JJ Starling Bell in his return to the dome has struggled from the free throw line tonight Hes an 88 shooter on the season He is four cheering of eight Makes that one One more coming Best he can do is make this a fourpoint game cheering Bell makes two of three but its still a twop possession game and Syracuse has the basketball And again Im not going to let either Nate get the ball George or Kings as the Orange call timeout Yeah Adrien Entree a timeout JJ Starling the inbounder into Donnie Freeman who has struggled from the free throw line tonight He is just one for six Well below his season average of 79 You look at the tough road ahead to finish this season if youre Syracuse If you can hang on here in the final 18 seconds of the second overtime you got SMU Duke Carolina Louisville Hey man dont leave out the Deaks down there Like come on man laughter Well hey the Deaks just trying to win their way into the ACC tournament Yeah cheering a lot of teams five of them battling at the bottom of the conference Three will miss out on postseason play entirely Freeman a big make there after he was one for six Lets go Really solid performance from him They game plan was to take him out of the game They doubled him a bunch early He found himself in a little bit more sing single coverage here in the second half and he was able to take cheering advantage of it Sixpoint lead at 17 seconds left for Cal The freshman Carr cheering finds Bell A good look Missed it Stling has the rebound and Syracuse could close this out in double overtime applause Great fight by the Orange You lose six or seven Dont say these kids arent competing and these coaching staff doesnt want it Great play and execution here Dribbling in the paint set the fade screen on the weak side Gave give a great look to Chris Bale He had just knocked down a three from there and JJ Stling finds himself going to the free throw line prepared to ice this game And certainly nobody is saying that this is likely but we just saw two years ago in this conference a very improbable thing happen NC State going to the ACC tournament winning five games in five days as a double digit seed And I think if youre Syracuse you can use that as motivation to find something down the stretch of this season And maybe tonight could be a turning point And you hope it is if youre Adrien Autry and the Orange Faithful Ugly free throw there from Starling Just a little short cheering Sevenpoint lead with 8 seconds though Should be enough Cal emptied the tank on the road Just ran out of legs in this second overtime in a gutsy hardfought effort Syracuse takes it 107 100 and
