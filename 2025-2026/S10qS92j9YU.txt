Eric and we welcome those of you joining us here in Blackburg Virginia Cal and Virginia Tech Really a crucial early season game in the ACC Both teams on the fringe of the NCA tournament conversation as the opening music tip is knocked out of bounds in the Virginia Tech bench area And we are underway as both teams looking to bounce back from Wednesday night losses here in the state of Virginia A tough one in particular for the Hokes as they lost on a last second threepointer to Stanford Pat Okeefee Eric Dondorf with you Cal meanwhile just their third true road game of the season and Justin Pippen finds the former Hokei John Candid who short arms his first attempt And Pat thats what Cal is going to look to do Set good screens music and get their open shooters good looks but they have to be able to knock them down Jaylen Bedford into the corner Jaden Shoot the appropriately named wing for Virginia Tech And weve got a music whistle inside And thats an offensive foul The freshman big man Christian Gerdak A little too much inside Yeah for Tech they they music got to look to impose their will inside and and really be super aggressive at the basket Yeah correct myself Its Ammani Hanssbury So an early foul for the best player music on Virginia One minute into the game the Cal starting five Talked about Justin Pippen music the Los Angeles native son of the Basketball Hall of Famer Scotty getting better and better in this his sophomore season Heres Camden again Two years here in a Hoke uniform over his first two as Bedford music pulls the board A great job by him pump fake and looking to attack the rim Thats a finish music Dont go away from the rim go towards it Nice backdoor feed Freshman to freshman Abdales to Christian Gerick inside Hey Pat I have a feeling were going to say Abdales name a whole lot He has great vision music Hes an NBA prospect Great look right there on a lot of mock drafts as a projected first round pick Freshman from Greece Heres Pippen trying to penetrate music this Hokes defense Cut off by shoot Shot clock winding under 10 Day Ames the leading scorer this year for Cal at just over 17 a game Hes going to have to create the Chicago native losses it one second to fire something up and he knocks it down You cant you cant play much better defense than that Beer did a great job but Day Ames hes known for being creative and taking and making tough shots as you can see it right there Played in the Commonwealth last year at the University of Virginia Throw a double music team out of Dallas And now Bedford bobbled up inside the in front of the Cal bench Gerak driving against Lee Dort Lefthanded flip is no good But Hansbury on the offensive boards They find shoot Another one for Hanssberry Third times a charm Not yet Itll go to the line for two John Camden the foul Mike Young the head coach his seventh season in Blackburg Blackburg excuse me prior to that Lot of success in his 17year tender at the Waford as the head coach He couldnt be a nicer guy right We sat down with him today at shoot around and you know we can just ask some questions and hes hes an open book and hes been around this game 24 seasons and hes done an incredible job at everywhere hes went Had a rough season last year high hopes this year and so far so good despite that tough loss here the other night to Stanford When you ask everybody involved with the Virginia Tech program this year its simple they have better players you know so hes hes having much more success and you see on that last possession second and third chance opportunities Thats something Cal wants music to limit Virginia Tech if they want to win this basketball game Cal is the worst rebounding team in the ACC Pippen turns it over here A little transition opportunity Bedford bobbled up cheering and theres a whistle as he took it to the basket Its against Dayday Ames his first But Jaylen Bedford will go to the line And Mark Madson the Stanford grad his third season coaching the rivals of his alma moater one of four NCAA music D1 head coaches to have won an NBA championship He won he won two of them with the LA Lakers And both of these coaches I mean unbelievable coaches but even better people And we talked to both at shoot around and I was able to get here a day ahead and go to the practices I mean more than open to willing to talk and and just not even about the game just about basketball And it was great to be able to do that with two guys who really know the game See the start that Cal is off to their best in nearly 20 years Tough start to this one Dort though aggressive move to the basket pulls Cal within two Thats a great sign for Cal Dorts averaging eight and seven Hes not going to do that much but you know its an extra thing for Cal if hes able to drive put his head down and score at music the rim Montas coachinus is already in off the bench for Cal replacing John Camden Gives the Bears a little more size on the floor Heres Bedford trying to create Hanssbury high arctic shot Pippid grabs the rebound and hes capable of hitting that jumper But for Cal I think theyll settle for that rather than him being around the rim Hes an efficient player around the rim He has to be able to look to play inside out Coaches sets a screen for Pippen Hes got some range have Dallas 69 music can create inside Look at the moves by the freshman Second field goal for Christian Gerk How about the footwork right there by the big man Gerk but you already see what Cal is doing defensively Z theyre trying to hedge it high and make him play side to side and away from the rim But hes such a great passer Great job getting in there Great finish Gerak making his fifth start of the season Theyre trying to get Chris Bell free along the baseline Thats got to feel good Last game for Chris Bell His first scoreless game of the season Not only did he not score the ball but he music didnt get a rebound at 67 You have to be able to get at least four or five rebounds He has to be aggressive on the gra on the glass and looked to be aggressive getting to the basket Spent his last three years playing for Syracuse your alma mater And heres Shu trying to get free And if you give him any amount of space he can do that to you And Pat usually hes just a catch and shoot guy but right there a little pump fake up and under getting his feet under and knocking it down And you hear him talking a little bit Fivepoint advantage for Virginia Tech their largest so far Pippen trying to turn the corner to the rack and a strong finish inside with the right hand Pippen really excels at getting to the basket Hes a great playmaker Great job getting to the bucket finishing with the right Dad an NBA legend and son an NBA player So weve got a timeout on the floor and a good start here for the home team And how about Gerak big fella showing the spin cycle finishing music with the right hand And how about Shu Hes not just a catch and shoot Knocking it down That led to our first media timeout that has been resolved and we are back to action Virginia Tech Ben Hammond in the game off the bench along with Toby Mau and Pippet a little overzealous there The reachin against Abdales and Pat if youre Pippy you want to be physical with AD Dallas You want to be able to get up in them and and be physical but obviously you got to watch your hands And for Virginia Tech you see Hammond coming in the game It allows Abdales to play off the ball and become more of a score and look to attack Of Dallas is 69 He can score He can play make Shoots already knocked down one make it two from the corner right in front of the Bears bench And how about that set right there from Tech A little misdirection And while that shoots running the baseline great find by Hammond And you got to know where Shoot is cuz hes a knockdown shooter Mike Young told us this morning they want to find shoot some good rhythm shots today Theyve already found him too as Days right to the heart of the defense And I tell you what Pat that crossover right there was lethal He left Hammond in the dust and hes one of the best in the ACC with the ball in his hands inside and outside Averaging over 17 points a game 43 on threes as well Hes really found a home in Northern California Hammond splits the defense Lw thats not really his game to shoot the open shot as his pocket picked and a foul against Dayday Ames And that could be his second Day A Second foul against Dayday Ames And heres that previous threepointer where they set up shoot And a great misdirection right there And swinging it back to Hammond And Hammond finding Shoot running the baseline And like we said before if you leave him open you might as well count it Hes off to a great start for Virginia Tech He scored the Hokes last six points Now heres Lwal at the free throw line Hes been a big story for the Hokes music this season When hes in and when hes out he as he hits the first free throw returned on Wednesday for the first time since November 26 You see what they do with him and what they did without him Hes usually in the starting lineup Theyre still working him back into the rotation but they are a much different team with the uber athletic Toby Lau Well Ill take a guy that has a 50in vertical all day Hes averaging nine rebounds his head and shoulders above the rim and hes an improved shooter but what he does best is attack the rim and and play around and Virginia Tech is super happy to have him back on the floor playing DJ Campbell just in the game a senior from Hampton Virginia knocked out of the hands of Lau on the putback by Dort And last game for Cal against Virginia they had zero offensive rebounds So its a good sign when Dort is active on the glass and able to finish it with the putback Thats a huge point of emphasis for Mark Madson today hitting the boards on both ends of the floor because they were outrebounded and out muscled by Virginia on Wednesday Local is the worst rebounding team in the ACC and Virginia Tech is one of the best Now Dallas using that 69 in frame of his too strong out of bounds to count cheering So Hansbury obviously a load to contain on the boards Theres the numbers youre talking about in ACC play A minus 16 rebound margin for the Bears and plus three for the Hokes Ames 43 downtown and he gets the roll Pat Ames is feeling comfortable back in his home state Virginia Well hes from Chicago but he played in Virginia and hes just doing a great job attacking the basket and then when you lay off a little bit hes able to knock down that threepoint shot That ones thrown into the Cal bench area Over it out of bounds a turnover Dayday Ames came back to face his former team the other night Dropped 18 on them and hes picking up where he left off this afternoon Hes having an unbelievable season He hes upped his scoring average from last season almost 10 points Hes crafty with the ball Hes able to get to the rim and also knock down the threepoint shot Ames has been having a great year for Cal Quick trip to the bench for Day Ames averages about 31 and a half minutes a game Cal after a slow shooting start two for their first five Theyve made five of their last six TT Carr impressive looking freshman point guard He and Campbell sharing the back court right now Its been a good start for Lee Dort What what uh TT Carr does for Cal is let Pippen play off the ball and be more of a scorer instead of a playmaker Coachinis trying to be a playmaker there Finds Carr Shot clock dwindling and Campbell knocks down the three An eight nothing run to give the Bears the lead And how about Campbell coming in and hes been playing limited minutes but hes aggressive looking to get to the basket And right there you see him knocking down the open threepoint shot Nearly 8 minutes gone by here First half and theres a whistle inside against the Bears Its against Montas Coachinus a sophomore from Lithuania Christian Gerak taking the brunt of that already Five team fouls for Cal So you could see how much more physically theyre playing We talked about it in the beginning They have to match Virginia Techs physicality and theyve done that so far Bedford off a curl Probably not the best look for Bedford You trailing defenders trailing You want to look to attack the rim and get to the basket Cal the momentum right now The back door feed Pippen left open Step behind the arc Burries it Justin Pippen Cal 11 straight points They have their largest lead And TT Carr made that happen Hello probing on the baseline kicking to the corner Great extra pass to Pippen and Pippen knows what to do with it Knocking it down Crowd here in Blackburg trying to spur on their Hokes during this slow start Lal cut off Bedford will try again Nearly the same spot and theyre going to let that one run A good start for the Bears coming off a lob and shoot Off to a good start from beyond the ark for Virginia Tech But you see what Cal has done since the 1349 mark They have the basketball out of that timeout Montes coachinus has given Mark Madson some good minutes early on Milos Elich has also checked in off the bench for the Bears As Madson continues to go with the two big man alignment and thats out of bounds off the foot of Carr He wants Madson to review and they are going to challenge it Out of bounds So Mark Madson obliging the request of his freshman guard TT Carr is challenging the out of bounds out of bounds is under review So Cal wanted to keep this early momentum You know we spoke with Mark Madson after their shoot around this morning which was a very short shootound And the reason for that look they came east Obviously not easy to do As we take another look at this last play and right there it looks to me anyway like it hits the left ankle of Lal Yeah thats California ball Thats thats off Toby right there And you you dont see guys use challenges this early often but when its that clear you better be right You dont want to lose it this early But Cal comes east for the first time this year Theyve been playing well They lose to Virginia 84 to 60 And Madson told us they got after it the last two days Hard practices practicing crashing the boards being more physical And I think weve seen that so far this afternoon Theyve done a great job of batting Texas Previous play the challenge is successful It will be Californias ball on the baseline 9 seconds left on the shot clock Still keep it 9 seconds on the shot clock Mark Madson a successful challenge for him Madson his third year at Cal after four years as the head coach at Utah Valley And off the inbounds Pippen shortarms it Now the shot clock doesnt reset Theyve got to get it off Do they recognize three seconds to get it up and coaches fires and thats not going to hit the rim either So a shot clock violation after all that And besides that possession Kales been doing a great job offensively moving the ball and off those closeouts attacking music the rim drawing the defender and then being able to kick it for open looks Great job right there by DTEK Hooks have gone cold They have not had a field goal in over four minutes Cals doing a great job of hedging making VTEC play further away from the rim cheering Second over 41 The turnover by the Hookies will give it back to Cal And again off the appendage of Lau but this time its a little more clear No review necessary Thats just K being aggressive Theyre being active defensively Theyre music getting up in in tech stuff and and theyre making a play Carr penetrating stops at the foul line Again weve seen the range that Pippen has on that jumper They leave him wide open Rushed it a little perhaps Good back tap though And a fresh 20 Pippen all the way to the basket Cant finish Lau comes down with it and its taken from him Saved Coachess What a play inside Pippen no Coachinis no And a late whistle and a foul call And unlike the other night it is Cal all over the offensive boards And even though they didnt finish youre going to get those foul calls because youre being consistent with the physicality and being aggressive at the rim Great job by Pippen even though he didnt finish of being aggressive attacking the basket drawing the defense and great job by Kales big man to be able to get that offensive rebound Montis Coachinus heads to the line Hes only attempted two free throws all season 611 sophomore from Lithuania cheering And were excited about this Coming up next freshman phenom Caleb Wilson and 17th Dre music North Carolina host Wake Forest Thats at 6 Eastern And then immediately following that game we music will debut our documentary chronicling the 1993 national championship winning UNCC team led by Dean Smith Youll get neverbeforeseen footage and music interviews of players and coaches both right here on ACCN and the ESPN app Theres the matchup tonight Wake UNC music I would say its a big game in the ACC The way things are shaping up this year Eric they are all big games The ACC has definitely stepped up their play overall as a conference this year And every game is brutal So when you go on the road and youre thinking you got to win you better think again Its going to be a tough one Virginia Tech scoreless with three turnovers over the last four minutes of game action Thats a sixpoint lead Hammond pestered by Carr They would love to get shoot another open look Shot clock under 10 And Hanssburs got to let it fly Thats not the shot I got to think Eric they want doing a great job of pushing him away from the rim Virginia Tech has to find a way to get Hansbury the ball closer to the basket way out underneath Dort to the basket Pippen found him and thats on Bedford music right there He has to be able to see that from the weak side and come over earlier and Dort wouldnt have a wide open dunk It is a 14 to nothing run for Cal Lot of action there Nothing doing it for Hammond The Bears on the run Twoon two Crowd not liking the officiating at the moment Pippen no And this ones going the other way against John Camden And this last play with Pippen and Dor was a thing of beauty And how about the read right there by Pippen but Bedford has to come over earlier and look to stop Dort He was late And Dor has the wide open dunk Meanwhile that was the second foul against John Camden Came out missed his first two music shots went to the bench now he has two fouls So not the return to Blackburg he was looking for so far A little a little pressure by Cal right there But I like what theyre doing so far defensively pushing Virginia Tech away from the rim And thats what Virginia Tech has to do right there Get hands buried the ball inside music the paint Dallas has been quiet so far Bedfords going to let it fly Bears are all over the glass And thats Bedfords third threepoint music attempt at the zero bank makes He has to do a better job of looking to attack the basket and create some off the drive Carr running the offense right now with Pippen on the bench Heres Camden music This is what he does Sets his feet No good Theres a whistle underneath And this is again the Bears Pat who would have thought that we were saying maybe Cals music being a little bit too too physical but great job by coach Madson really emphasizing that to his team and theyve been doing a great job so far in this first half Yeah perhaps too physical because thats their seventh team foul And now Virginia Tech music in the bonus for the remaining eight plus minutes of this first half Jaden shoot not a frequent visitor to the free throw line this season music 11 out of 14 So that ends the run tonight at 9 Eastern music right here on ACC network and the ESPN app The Nothing But Net Proof Well break down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every mens game and look ahead to all the best matchups on the schedule in the upcoming week First points for Virginia Tech in over six minutes courtesy of Jaden Shoot at the free throw line Crowd trying to spur on the Hokes Theyre one and two in conference play And this one is going to go against Bedford Foul on the floor Frustrations inside the arena for the home crowd so far but all good as far as Mark music Madson and the Cal Bears go as they have a sixpoint lead on the road here in the first half here And now a slow start 24 18 Cal on top And you see what has gone on their last four games These games not for the faint of heart for Virginia Tech fans Meanwhile going to break there was a music foul against Jaylen Bedford They did take a look at it to see if it would be upgraded to a flagrant foul It remained a common foul And out of the timeout Cal stays redot as Nolan Dorsy buries the three And thats how Cal is going to win games on the road Everybody has to step up and contribute as a unit Dorsy coming in off the bench and knocking down the corner three music A ninepoint lead Hanssbury hasnt gotten on track Shoot has a couple of threes One and done for the Hokes But it was a good possession for Tech getting the ball music into the high post to Hansbury where hes a good decision maker kicking it out to shoot whos been hot so far in this first half Just not knocking that one down Camden with two fouls Back out there for Cal Shot clock winds under 10 Shoot jumps out at Ames and Carr pulls the offensive rebound Keeps it on the baseline himself Hanssbury will send him to the free throw line How about TT Carr getting the offensive rebound and then going back attacking Hansbury Great job by Ames right there penetrating touching the paint and getting music it out the door as he was coming off the bench and hes ready to go knocking down the corner three Then TT Carr right there off the offensive rebound just aggressive to the rim looking to attack drawing the foul opportunity for two shots and quite notably the second personal foul for Ammani Hanssbury So hes going back to the bench Toby Lel replaces him So Hansbury a quiet start for him this afternoon coming in on that stretch of four consecutive double doubles 192 extended run here for Cal has given them their largest lead of the game And after Carr grabs the offensive music rebound and hits two free throws he goes to the bench for Pippen Really the difference for Cal is just the energy and effort in the activity You see right here in the fullcourt press theyre active Theyre flying around and theyre making it hard for Virginia Tech offensively Hammond now running point Scored 14 points Wednesday against Stanford Tech has to find a way to get this guy more involved And thats a good aggressive drive by Neil Abdales Theyre going to count the basket and a chance at a threepoint play Pat we know he hes a great distributor but at points in the game when you see the offensive struggling you see him turning the corner using that 69 frame playing through the contact finishing with an opportunity for an and one They have to look for him to be more aggressive scoring the basketball which opens up opportunities for his teammates Second foul music against Nolan Dorson More than anything it gets Virginia Tech back on some stable ground after that 192 run Absolutely And again College has been doing a great job defensively making Virginia Tech play far music away from the basket Hammond picks the pocket to the basket Counted in one and another chance at a threepoint play Some signs of life for the home team late in the first half And thats the spark you need if youre Virginia Tech Turn defense into offense And Hammond is one of the quickest guards out there Great job getting in the passing lane with the off hand And then hes 510 but hes finishing like hes 65 An opportunity for an and one Foul starting to music mount on both sides Thats the second foul against Justin Pippen So two fouls on some key personnel on both sides Now see if Hammond can finish the threepoint play He can one of the leading free throw shooters in the ACC Crowd starting to get loud Back to a sixpoint Cal lead Has to look to get back to moving the basketball and getting cleaner looks for the shooters Bell coming off that curl wants to use the dork screen throws it away of Dallas Lets watch him create in open space right at Pippen whos got two fouls and thats a goend Count the basket Madson wants to know if he should challenge this one Theyre going to give him a little grace period taking a quick look at the iPad on the Stanford music bench and you play on Boy hes animated just like as a player Youre not going to have two challenges in the first half But if youre Virginia Tech and youre struggling in the half court now youre turning defense and offense getting out in transition and not having to play against that set half court defense every single time Okis answering that 192 Cal run with a seven nothing run of their own And thats an offensive foul going the other way Lee Dorton moving on the screen Turns the ball over to the Hookies Pat I dont know what Mike Young said to his players but the momentum has shifted a little bit You could feel it here in the arena and the energy and effort on Virginia Techs side has definitely changed and went up a couple notches Campbell in Ames out Pippens on the floor guarding of Dallas with two fouls Being very aggressive here Close out music by Bell on shoot Dallas checks his feet Plenty of time on the shot clock Dallas again Slip pass L Look out music cheering How about that right there 50in vertical shown off live and in person Great find by Neo right there And Toby L knows what to do with it If the crowd wasnt back into it before that theyre all the way back now A nine nothing run Virginia Tech Campbell trying to keep the handle in the hands of Pippen And this one is against music the Hokes No its not Excuse me Pat if this one doesnt get you off your feet I dont know what to tell you Youre not a basketball fan Great read right there by Neo music and Toby Lau You get in the way of that youre going to get dunked on looking in the rim You round it up and I music think thats okay Officially its a 49 and a half inch vertical Hes got time to work on that other half inch Meanwhile was another offensive music foul against Montas Coach His second twopoint game Fouls mounting up And as I say that theres another And Virginia Tech in the double bonus Coachinus called music for his third in his limited action so far off the bench And Lu doing a great job of not settling And the whole Virginia Tech team for this rest of this half should look to attack the basket music Dont settle for a threepoint shot or any jumpers Youre in the bonus Attack the closeouts and look to get to the rim strong So Lwal 68 senior from London England has a chance to tie the game Cal led by as many as 11 points here in the first half And I tell you what I I played with a guy or against a guy named Daryl Green who played in the NBA for a while and he was probably the highest jumper I ever saw in person But this guy told me lau I mean I tell you what he probably beats Gary Green out for that First tie since it was 2 to2 2929 4 minutes to go here in the first half Heres Pippen trying to get that music momentum back for his team working the twoman game with Door who rolls off target there Gerak comes away with it Pippen probably could music have took the shot himself right there and did a good job of just getting in the paint Hammond underneath Gerak mismatch turns Cant finish Campbell looking to push Hes got Pippen wide open on the left wing Finally finds him perhaps a little too late Look at the effort inside Leads to a door follow But again it was TT Carr getting up to keep the possession alive after a sluggish start for the home team Weve got a ball game as Virginia Tech has pulled even with Calc in turnovers only averaging nine and a half turnovers a game You already have five or excuse me seven in the first half So Lee Dort senior from Dallas puts an end to that 11 nothing run Puts Cal back on top for the moment A 69 free throw shooter Pat when youre on the road if youre Kale you got to expect this right Basketball is a game of runs Theres going to be a lot of highs and lows but you got to be able to stay steady and continue to move the ball on the offensive side Heres some fullcourt pressure And this proved to be successful earlier for Cal So Justin Pippen is out there with two fouls Hammond trying to create Hes cut off Campbell trying to run with Abdales They throw two at him Great job right there by Cal by pushing him all the way out by half court and forcing the turnover And Tech has done a great job of settling down but that was a bad offensive possession right there But good defensively by Cal Pippen looking to push it up trying to catch the Hokes defense napping Perhaps we just have to have more pace with the ball Snap the ball Dont pass and let it stick Another offensive rebound Elich put back No but he goes to the line How about these Cal pad We already have eight offensive rebounds in the first half coming against Virginia where they didnt have any Great job by Cals front court of just being aggressive and being active around the basket Its not just the bigs TT Carrs got a couple himself Yeah 510 getting in there against the big guy the big dogs He snuck inside a few times kept possessions alive Its just about being active right And not being stagnant Dont watch the ball You want to be able to attack the ball and and just doing that youre going to create opportunities for yourself and your teammates Hansbury Ammani Hanssbury back in Hes got two fouls Worth watching Its been a quiet start to the game for Hansberry Just two points and three rebounds Elich hits them both but Callas scored the last four from the free throw line And if Im tech right now Im looking to get Hanssberry involved right away Whether it be a flash to the high post where he can make a decision or a cross screen that can get him closer to the hoop Nice find there Bedford hasnt had the shot going until now as he cans the three You got to love the confidence of Bedford He didnt make his first three but he doesnt lack any confidence in knocking down the corner here UNLV last year Carr a little hesitation Lets see if Pippen looks for Dort again Dor shielding off the defender Campbell couldnt finish but Dors wide body making things happen inside And even though Campbell hasnt been finishing at the rim Ive been super impressed of him just head down being aggressive to the basket Hes drawing the defender and then hes letting his big fellas clean up for him Less than two minutes until halftime And this illegal screen is going the other way against Toby Lau And thats all caused by the pressure that Campbell is putting on Neo right there up top Not letting him have any space Its a great job by Cal defensively pushing him out but Bedford who hasnt hit a three like we said doesnt lack any confidence knocking it down And how about Campbell just being aggressive to the rim drawing defenders and letting his big guys clean up for him Big minutes in the first half for TT Carr Passed on the open look Pippen penetrating left open basket Pippens done a great job of being aggressive Hes getting some open opportunities He just hasnt been able to knock them down And I really like what TT Carr is doing them is doing letting him play off the ball Being more aggressive looking to score Seven points Hes had to work for it Justin Pippen on 10 field goal attempts I think theres another issue with the clock They ran one second off of the shot clock so LW will inbound again Had a lot of issues so far in this first half with the clock Under 90 seconds until halftime Hammond run into knocked out of bounds by Elich Cals Bigs are doing a great job of not letting Hammond turn that corner Great extra step just pushing him to that sideline Second for Cal 21 Look right now for Tech to get some high low action with with Low and hands where you see him in the horn set right now The dive and pop Hes too far away from the rim And thats what you need sometimes from your star player And look it its a tough shot and he can make those but you cant sustain playing like that a whole game Stepped on the sideline TT Carr turns it over cheering Gives it back to Virginia Tech with an even 45 seconds to play Hanssburys Hes make theyve been making it tough for him all game He really hasnt had any opportunities at the basket but great job right there just making a tough foul line jump shot Hammond splits the defenders right to the basket All Ben Hammond there That really that was the first time Cal Virginia Tech guard split Great job right there Hammond is just so quick and I tell you what he shrugs his shoulders a little bit and he is fearless getting to the rim finishing with that left hand Another opportunity for and one for this has been a fun first half It its theyve really been equal as far as the physicality goes and and the runs Both teams have gone on some runs and this is setting up to be a a great game going into the second half Well were tied at 37 John Camden back in for this offensive possession for the Bears Camden scoreless in six minutes so far Hes made a threepointer in every game so far this season And for music a shooter to get open shots turn yourself into a screener your defender helps Now you can pop and get an open look for three Hes in that position right now at the top of the key Pippen running some clock Were under 10 on the shot clock as he gets into his move They force him out wide Camden trying to get free Theyre doing a good job bottling him up 1 second to shoot Hes got to fire Nearly hits Shot clock is off 1 second shoot at the horn In and out Boy wouldnt that have been appropriate the way this first half went Thats big first half for Lee Dor 10 points and music four rebounds Jaden Shu hit a couple of early threepointers Bedford no good inside Theres the fifth rebound for Dort and Cal And I think this is the biggest factor so far Eric All over the boards All over the boards They have more offensive rebounds than Virginia Tech has overall rebounds Great job right there finding Chris Bell off the curl And thats what he does He knocks down threes and an opportunity for a fourpoint play We dont say that often Pat Its funny Chris Bell scoreless the other night hit an early basket quiet the rest of the music first half and now an early three here in the second Hes such a great shooter but what he has to do he has to be able to create separation off of that screen So sprint off of that screen create that separation and get an open look And thats exactly what he did right there So a big music fourpoint play Bellis just about a 90 free throw shooter Cal has his fourpoint advantage back How about just making it tough for Neil even to bring the ball up Throw a double and Ansbury Bedford left open He hasnt found that range but once so far this afternoon Hes now one for five from deep Yeah he has to be able to play off that long blowout and attack it Something worth watching in the second half The host of music players on the floor as Bell has started hot the host of players on the floor on both sides who are playing with two fouls A great sign for Cal getting Chris Bell going Hes averaging almost 15 points on the year But he has to be aggressive looking for his shot and not play hesitant music on the offensive side of the ball A six nothing Chris Bell run to begin the second half putting Cal up by six Answer there And Bedford paid for that He hit the floor hard but finished with the left hand This what we talked about on that previous previous possession Attack the close out be aggressive getting to the rim Great job by Bedford finishing Heres Bell Theyre looking for him again Dallas not giving him much space to operate Bell feeling it right now A little bit of a heat check there Heres Shoot You dont want to leave him open over the backboard and out of bounds Shoot Hes going to have his opportunities more so in transition trying to get ahead of the defense And if hes getting open looks in half court that music means Virginia Tech is doing a great job of screening their man Heres Pippen inside the paint Looking for Bell again Theyd love to get John Camden going too Well thats a shot right there for Chris Bell He has to shoot the basketball Loses the handle and a late whistle and a foul Christian Gerak And the crowd here does not agree Well heres my thing You should have shot in the first one when you had the opportunity to do it Now you just make it more difficult on yourself when you have the defender right on you Bedford doing a great music job of just getting in there And lucky for for Cal they got the foul call Now its a second personal foul against Jaylen Bedford Trying to stick with Day Ames here Shot clock down to four Ames has to create He can do that Tough shot and he draws the foul with two seconds on the shot clock I dont know about that one That was a bon call but Cal has to do a better job of getting their ball movement right now at the start of the second half Theyre playing too much ball We know day as can create by itself But again thats a tough way to play the whole game You want to be able to get some movement and be able to play off the rotations in the closeouts First foul on shoot Two shots for Ames Ames seven points in the first half Last season at Virginia this season in Cal And as we said earlier he has really found a home in Mark Madsons program his numbers up across the board And I think it was tough last year for everyone on Virginia with the you know depart to Tony Bennett and Sanchez taking over right before the year So they werent really situated as a team but Ames looks comfortable here at California Now Dallas coast to coast and showing off that handle at 69 that has him on many NBA mock draft lists Pat I I just think for Abdales in Virginia Tech we talked about how he gets to playmate can be a distributor but you make yourself a better distributor when youre aggressive looking to score the basketball Youre just going to open up opportunities for your teammates when youre aggressive looking to score Four points for Dallas in the first half Second weekend of ACC play and weve had walltowall action so far are coming up music next Freshman Phenom Caleb Wilson and 17th ranked North Carolina host Wake Forest Thats at 6 Eastern And immediately following that one music well debut our documentary chronicling the 93 national championship team for UNCC led by Dean Smith Never before seen footage and interviews from players and coaches right here in the ACC Network and the ESPN app Pat if youre A Dallas and youre aggressive getting to the basket youre going to have opportunities at the free throw line but when you get there you have to be able to knock him down And hes only a 69 free throw shooter of the year Theres that last sequence music And Dallas has missed a couple from the line today TT Carr called for the foul there So well keep possession with Virginia Tech This was tied at halftime Cal scored the first six points of the second half Toby Lalen and thats going to be number four on the back of big man coaching us We know we talked to coach Madson and he told us that he wants his talent to be physical but when it starts getting into where youre getting in foul music trouble you have to be able to be aware of that We go right back to Low who cuts to the basket Couldnt handle it initially Great job by TT Carr getting over there Hanssbury open this time Lau second time no good Lau still battling inside Its loose and itll stay with the Hokes Pats okay with Hansbury taking those threes We know hes capable of knocking it down but hes a much more effective player when hes playing free throw line and in for Virginia Tech Hes a 50 shooter just 31 from deep Theres a reach in against Bell and those fouls are starting to mount again for Cal Were not even at the first immediate timeout and theyve already got four Chris Bell right there for Cal Force Abdales music back into the screen He loves to reject the screen but you got to be able to be on that hip and force him to play into that pick and roll So Bell goes to the bench Had a quick start to this second half Thats just his first foul And they pick the pocket of Bedford Its Dort with the quick hands Theyve got numbers if they hurry Heres Carr Ames was camping out in the corner Good job by Virginia Tech to get back Great decisions right there by TZ Car just to get it back out and set up a play DJ Campbell back in Car again lines that one up The Wilds leaping ability is impressive Dallas bobbled up this time Hsbury right to the basket And thats fourlegged right there You catch it right there Make a decision Decisive Put your head down and be aggressive Look at those big shoulders right there Theyre bouncing off of you big man Six points for Hansberry Cal answer Shot clock under 10 Campbell indecisive numbers Have Dallas has shoot sets the feet Good close out there Back to Abdollis Ball movement Corner three Good Tied at 45 6 nothing run for the Hookies And a tie again Carr Good crosscourt pass finding Ames in the corner cheering Nolan Dorsy back in the game for the Bears Ames pulls up midrange and Lal out jumps everyone Just another tough shot for Cal Really no ball movement at all in that possession Virginia Techs been doing a great job of getting out in transition and creating offense that way cheering It was Bedford who hit that three from the corner on their last possession leading to the Bears timeout Abdales finds him again This time hell try the music other side No fakes it and puts it on the floor One second to shoot of Dallas has to fire and Dort grabs another rebound Its an unbelievable pass right there by Abdales playing off the close up but good job by Cal just being active and hustling getting hands up on the shot Aim spins away from Abdales and switches to the left hand Wow You know pass sometimes you just have to put it in one of your best players hands and tell them to go ahead and make a play What a tough finish right there by a Dallas time this time Its an air ball though Possession saves Shot clock continues to tick and we have a foul against Cal and that will be their fourth excuse music me their fifth team foul Tight game second half in Blackburg Cal nursing on the ESPN app Going to break Lee Dort was having a phenomenal game Picked up his fourth foul Montas music coaching us also with four fouls So those are two of the three big men for the Bears from the break Shoot So Cal has Milos Elich at center That is the next up mentality Cals been doing it music as a unit Now Milos has to come in and keep that physicality going Look to be aggressive when he gets the ball around the rim Goodman turns the corner on shoot Burrows his way through but he cant finish so many of those opportunities around the ring He just hasnt been able to finish Mau will fire for the corner TT Carr has had a lot of responsibility this afternoon Nearly throws that one away Still 17 music on the shot clock The right idea by Carr Good job by keeping handling on his hip but if he doesnt get in front of the ball keep attacking the rim get music downhill Chris Bell back in Dorsy to the bench Hanssbury goes to the bench for Virginia Tech again Hansbury playing with his two fouls music from the first half Heres Bell who came out and scored six straight to begin the second half and finishes there this count Their big men are are known to be able to pass the ball and good job right there by Chris Bell setting up the back door as well action Huge lift from Bell Eight of his 10 points here in the second half as Christian Gerak draws contact going right to the basket Great job by Bell recognizing music the overplay by Abdales and then Milo putting up right on the money right there Bell finishing at the rim Bell has to do a better job of being aggressive and when he has opportunities to shoot the shot he has to take it So heres the freshman big music man Christian Gerach starting his fifth game of the season Hes kind of moved into the starting lineup when Lwal was out for about a month Laus back Hes coming off the bench for now The plan is to reinsert music him at some point into the starting lineup Berdicks been hes been really good for Virginia Tech Hes averaged about six and five but hes being a presence around the rim Hes using his strong physical body and hes doing what the coaches asking are asking of him to do Pippen trying to get free Shot clock under 10 Shoot Working hard defensively Too strong from Pippen but Lau came down on the baseline So another chance for Cal And you see right there Pippen just kind of puts his head back a little bit Hes doing a great job of into the rim and spent about three or four of those are just rimmed out Has to be able to finish it when he gets that close Hell go to work again This time the midrange working for Justin Pippen What I love about Pippen is hes just going to keep going Hes not worried about you know a couple missed layups Hes continuing to be aggressive and thats what Cal needs him to be is aggressive Nine points for the sophomore point guard from Los Angeles Great job by Cand getting in there on Gerak Tech has missed its last five from the field Can Camden get going Not with that one Hammond trying to spin his way from Ames Elich poking at it Too much right there Now Dallas shielding off the defender with his body He cant finish it Gets it back though Power dribble inside and back to a twopoint game Yeah he already has the advantage at the guard spot Hes 69 So hes just aggressive to the rim Hes going to be able to get his shot off Now its up to him to be able to finish But great job continuing to play Ames using his size advantage against Hammond He doesnt usually have a size advantage Shuffle the feet Another Cal turnover and well head to another timeout on the floor Hanssbury back in the music game after a brief rest for the Hokes Hammond just a blur taking it coast to music coast Ran into his own man and it disrupted him How many times have we seen from both teams just not able to finish at the rim Pippen using that screen Camden the former Hokei trying to get free Pippen got the defender to leave his feet Van Hammond fouls him and Justin Pippen will go back to the line How about Pippen Four for 13 from the field One for five from three But he continues to play He continues to be aggressive Hes so crafty with the ball in his hands Pump fakes being able to get Hammond up in the air and draw the foul An opportunity at the free throw line Hes got one threepointer today Hes working on a streak of nine straight games in which hes knocked down at least two threes Last season played 28 games off the bench for Michigan They won the Big 10 championship went to the Sweet 16 Much more prominent role this season in Cal And is that going against Bell It is Chris Bell has his third personal thats going against Bell and Cal is in the penalty Its the third foul against Chris Bell And were going to walk all the way to the other end of the floor And Virginia Tech is going to shoot free throws now and for the remainder of this game And similar to the first half they were in the the bonus pretty early snorts Good look here I dont know about that one right there Pat It just it looks like Shu just ran him over Its a tough tough break right there for Cal But now if youre Virginia Tech 11 minutes left in this first half theres no reason to settle You get to the rim every single time Be aggressive and youll have opportunities at the foul line Lee Dor back in Dor is playing with four fouls So is Montas coaches the two big men for Cal Theyre both out on the floor right now each with four And you know what that means for Virginia Tech Your next possession down you go right inside to Hanssbury Shoot goes two for two And once again we have a twopoint game And for Cal this guy needs to have the ball in his hands the remainder of the game to make plays or be aggressive scoring the basketball Bell trying to get free Hes had a big second half And this one goes the way of Chris Bell Its a foul on shoot So the 15 foul for the Hokes Itll be an inbound for Cal Second foul against Shoot cheering Heres the starting back court Justin Pipp and Day Ames This year they average a combined 32 points a game Ames left free and thats a big one We talked about Pippen but we cant forget about Ames And man he does such a great job of creating space off of that dribble That crossover is lethal His second threepointer of the night Hes got 14 points And he has become a very good threepoint shooter this season Prolific from downtown Double team at Hansbury Virginia Tech You have to cut right off of that double team Baseline jumper for Hammond Dort the box out Curry caught the ball too far away from the rim Ames loses the handle and a whistle at the end of that play Foul check number three Ben Hammond Its against Ben Hammond his third Its the six team foul So starting with the next foul Cal will be shooting free throws Hey Pat how about Dday A Hes That left and right crossover is unreal Creating spacing right there being aggressive causing Hammond to follow Thats a hook right there Pippen hooked the defender and thats an offensive foul against Justin Pippen his third there Yeah thats obvious right there If it wouldnt have been Hammond would have got called for that tug on the back of his jersey One action leads to another Cal turns it over Hanssbury left free Step behind the line and he cans it You know what I just love the confidence from this guy Hes not having the best game cheering You would think he wants to go inside but hes that wide open Shoot the ball young man Coaches has it poked away Gets it back cheering Bit of an indecisive possession here for Cal So Ames takes matters into his own hands What you call a grown man drive How about him putting that left shoulder into his chest and just getting to the rim finishing on the other side coach with those four fouls runs at Hammond Bedford trying to get free working on Pippen goes around him and a tough finish inside Thats what really Bedford excels at Attacking the rim getting to the basket and pretty crafty with his finishes around the rim Back and forth we go in Blackburg cheering Back door Pippen too strong Great pass by Gort Bedford driving baseline Blocked from behind by Bell Gerak gets it back inside and he is fouled If your handsberry you just want to keep being aggressive If youre that wide open shoot the ball Eventually its going to drop Its a grown man Put my shoulder in your chest Finish at the rim music And heres that last play Bell the block from behind but Montes Coachus called for the foul and that is number five So Mark Madson has been rotating these three big men One of them is now out for the remainder of the game Coaches Lee Dort still out there with four fouls And for now John Camden will replace coaches Pat I tell you what Coach Madson has a great he had a great game plan this whole game and and those two bigs I mean those guys have been doing a great job being physical on the boards but you know right there Bedford again doing a great job being aggressive drawing the defense and it allows Gerak to be able to get to the offensive glass 610 260 from Charles Town West Virginia with 821 to go a chance to tie and once again we are tied at 58 Gerak takes a seat Toby Lwel back in cheering Gak looks like hes from West Virginia He has that big country West Virginia body Country strong car up top Camden cheering Ames again cheering with some off the ball movement if youre Cal looking to set up AD Dallas spins away from him and another tough finish for Dayday Ames Well if youre Day Ames give me the ball and let me cook spin cycle finishing back with the strong hand Virginia Tech keeps coming back They havent been able to get over the hump Day Ames meanwhile scored the last seven for Cal You got to see Lao right there You got You got to get closer to the rim though if youre Toby Ames trying to hold his ground Bedford for the lead Offensive rebound Lau off that power dribble has it knocked away Loose Dort to the floor trying to corral it Its batted out of bounds off of Virginia Tech The effort on both sides befitting of a twopoint game right now Its Cal Now in the last sequence before the timeout they determined that Cal did have possession So they only have 8 seconds to get this ball over midcourt And they do it easily Heres the freshman TT Carr from Mil Valley California Elite back door lost his man and Carr found him That was kind of a slow progressing play right there Virginia Tech could have had the weak side help and come over and at least try to get in the way of Moses right there But great job recognizing that back door by TT Carr Thats a crowd quieter there Bedford off the mark Another rebound for Carr Hes been good today And again Pat we talked about Virginia Tech is in the bonus the rest of this half You dont need to settle for those shots Elich the only big out there now for Cal Lob to him and he finishes backto back possessions Timeout Virginia Tech A six nothing run for Cal and theyre back up by that amount Hes not just a scorer Hes a play playmaker as well Mike Young looking to regroup the troops Hes done it several times goes out knowing that youre in the bonus being ready for the contact draws the foul opportunity at the free throw line Big free throws coming up here Ammani Hanssbury 16 points and nine rebounds a game this season That puts him into double figures with 10 points Hes got eight double doubles this year including his last four games Justin Pippen back in Only five rebounds tonight for Hansberry and only six shot attempts Ks done a great job of pushing him away from the basket This last six minutes he has to look to get the ball inside that free throw line area and be aggressive Last two trips they went to Elach He has the ball again looking for Ames Elach rolling to the basket This time Ames keeps it and its blocked by Hansberry numbers as Ames hit the deck Five on four Hammond down the lane Less than six minutes to play Has to flash into that Give it to him right now There it is And then you got to cut off that double ball movement Shoot Hammond straight on Low inside and he finishes You know how hard it is just to go vertical off of the bump and dunk the basketball This guy is a special special athlete They welcomed Toby Lal back this week A little overzealous there The reachin against John Camden 17 Third foul against Lwal And this guy right here just off the bump and then vertical dunking the basketball Hes one of the most gifted athletes that we saw in a Ive seen in a a long long time Hes made I would say at least half a dozen plays today that youre just not used to seeing Again Im going to round up If you have a 50in vertical youre up in that air for a while and youre able to do things that most people cant John Camden misses the front end of the one and one Hes still scoreless Perhaps pressing a little Spent two seasons here in a Virginia Tech uniform earlier in his career Now Dallas cut off Hanssbury and were tied again And thats what you have to do with your Hanssbury Look to get into that area and then once you get the ball right there youre too strong Just go up and finish Six nothing Tech run out of the Mike Young timeout And theres an offensive foul And thats number five on Lee Dort That will send the Cal Big Man to the bench for the remainder of the afternoon with 452 to play in a tie game Thats a big big foul call right there And the way this game has been called I was a little acting job by shoot right there But the door might have been put that shoulder in a little bit but shoot selling it a little bit and getting the call and thats a huge foul call Lee Dort has been exceptional for Cal tonight He goes to the bench his afternoon finish with 10 points and seven rebounds And now Mark Madson will use one of his remaining timeouts As well as Cal has played theyre right here and right here on this set They need to look for Hanssbury at the free throw line area and be aggressive at the rim Low they go to him Remember Cal now very thin along the front line Their top two big men fouled out of Dallas around Pippen What a move that was The first lead for Virginia Tech since it was 16 15 You know whats so great about AB Dallas is hes never sped up He plays at his own pace He knows how to use his body gets you leaning one way spins to the other and finishes with the right hand What does Cal try to do to answer Well they put it in the hands of Dayday Ames for the bucket and one And how about Pippen and Ames playing off of each other Great job keeping his eyes up How about Avdal Just a great job getting Pippen leaning and then using his body protecting the ball finishing and then excuse me I said it was Pippen but it was Milos Cals Bigs is doing a great job distributing the basketball And Ames has been great finishing at the rim Opportunity for a threepoint play Its also the fourth foul against Toby Lwal He goes to the bench and Ames puts Cal back on top This is ACC basketball right here Physical back and forth You love to see it Hammond trying to penetrate that defense Hanssberry just looking to drive underneath feed Reverse layup is good Christian Gerak Oh the awareness off the spin by Hansberry to see Gernak Great pass by the big fella Point counterpoint here in the second half Pippen cant answer that time Loose ball Great decision right there off Dallas Slow it down getting your set Get something close to the rim if youre Virginia Tech They operate through Hammond Bird has it knocked out of his hands Its a foul against Justin Pippen And that is number music four on the Cal point guard A onepoint game V coach Martin Maxon about rebounding the basketball and being physical And Virginia Tech on the other side has been doing a great job of just staying there the whole game and not getting rattled by Cal Theres the foul trouble The physical play certainly having a hand in this The two big men out Pippen four fouls Bell three And how about the freshman Christian Gerdak down the stretch Big buckets Big free throws for Tech Theyre on a 12 to3 run Well Pat its just a West Virginia thing Thats all it is Back door Bell Good body control there We saw that probably about three or four times Two from Milos and Bell Crosscourt pass from Hanssbury Hammond trying to split the defenders Shoot Theyd love to get him a look Shot clock now down to six Hammond around Camden has it taken away by Pippen No numbers Pippens going to do a little give and go Fires the three No good Hanssbury the rebound You dont really need a three at this point Youre in the bonus You can play off the handoff and turn the corner and attack the basket If youre here for the start of North Carolina Wake Forest well get you there right at the end of this In the meantime you can watch it on ACCN Extra Two minutes and change to go here in Blackburg Abdales switching to that right hand Thats a Thats a move right there Well how about Abdales getting the switch getting the mismatch that he wanted long crossover and then inside hand finish on the left side Its a pro move Heres Ames Hes been good in the second half with 14 of his 21 cheering Under two minutes to play Eli sets that high screen cheering Ames finds him but he couldnt handle it A whistle at the end of the play against the Hokes against Ammani Hanssbury his fourth And its a tough call but if youre Virginia Tech if youre Hanssbury you got to be there a little bit earlier Well he was there but he left his feet And thats where the foul got called Right when he left his feet So the foul is against Hansbury Its his third not his fourth And thats an important distinction with a minute 37 to go in the second half Its a one and one though Elach hits the first one and thats big Both of these teams from the free throw line tonight Only missed two as a team Each team Yeah A lot more attempts for Virginia Tech No surprise with all the fouls by Cal Elich is second Smooth as well Its a onepoint game again Little more than a minute and a half to go Those arent easy free throws to make right there either Hammonds got to get it over the midcourt line He has three seconds to do so Yeah you dont want to settle if youre Virginia Tech want to get something going to the basket Tech hasnt played from in front for much of this game SHOVEL PASS INSIDE Low the finish Oh what about that handle right there by Hammond in and out crossover and then dropping it for the finish That was impressive right there Big plays on both ends down the stretch Virginia Tech Your hip and be aggressive to the rim cheering Here we go Threepoint game coming up on a minute to play cheering Ames underneath Elach wide open and a late whistle Dallas thought he had the call He wants Mike Young to challenge Virginia Not sure if hes inclined to do so right now Young doesnt agree with the call And be loach goes to the line Well again it was Ames was a little bit late on the pass even and Abdales he was late coming over from the weak side They were going to call that foul when had the advantage Abdal has to do a better job of coming over earlier Second upd So Elich big free throws again here down the stretch DJ Campbell just checked back in for Cal cheering And how about Elish 10 points four rebounds and Mark Matson told us Hey were going to play two bigs We need those guys to be able to make an impact And they have answered the call and then some is the last big man standing Minute to go Hokeis nursing a onepoint lead Crowd starts to rise to its feet here in Blackburg A game in the scheme of things in the ACC both teams really need Hammond crossover dribble again Loses it Taken by Ames Numbers if they hurry Ames slows it up Now its Cals turn to take the lead Madson calls timeout with 37 seconds to go That is Cals final timeout Hammonds done a good job of getting in there and being grappled but you got to be and making sure Pippen or Ames gets open so they can have an opportunity to get into their set and get downhill Camdens the inbounder They have to get it in and do cheering Theres about a 14second difference between shot clock and game clock Virginia Tech has played four consecutive onepossession games Heres another one Ames gets free comes up short Els the rebound Bell passes up the three Midrange No Loose ball taken by Hansberry Shot clock off and hes fouled They got what they wanted They got Ames in a situation and he had a clean shot It looks like he just lost the ball but they still had an opportunity Chris Bell in the midrange and they got what they want and Ames is great defense by Hammond AMC is always going to find a way and just shorted it right there Another opportunity but Chris Bell just couldnt take advantage of it in the midrange shot Virginia Tech they have to be able to knock down these free throws How about the defense by Hanssbury getting his arm extended on the Ames attempt Did that affect him at all Oh absolutely I mean if its any hand any type of adversity from the defense is going to alter the shot or make it a tougher shot So Hansbury great job of not giving up defensively on that play Twopoint game One more free throw for Hanssbury The foul was against Camden Hes got three Remember no timeouts for Cal Virginia Tech does have one Both teams have been so impressive cheering We play it out Shot clock is off Threepoint game Do they foul or will they get a threepointer off Pippen quickly into the front court Camden puts it on the floor to the basket No but he draws a foul 84 seconds to go Thats number five on Toby Lal So his game is finished Camden with two big free throws coming with Cal down by three But I like Camdens mindset He even though theyre down three he doesnt settle and hes just aggressive to the rim They have enough time music if they knock down these free throws to try to get a steal If they dont get a steal obviously they got a foul right away but theyll have another opportunity at a possession to close this game out Toby Lwals second game back after missing nearly a month 10 points and seven rebounds Two free throws for the former Hokei Camden first one is good Thats his first point of the game The only type of mindset you have to have having zero points Does he try to miss this or do you make it Well see Makes them both Onepoint game Dorsy in Camden out Remember one timeout Virginia Tech None for Cal Well you try to go for the the steal initial and if you cant get it you have to foul right away Hanssbury inbounds Shoot has it Clock ticks and they foul him 67 to go Foul given by Nolan Dorsey Jaden shoot a good free throw shooter Hes four for four today Hell make that long walk from end to end to shoot two Both teams have shot very well from the line Second half Tech is 13 for 14 And if youre Tech this is the guy who you want to shoot free throws And the first one short Was that Was that my fault It was not your fault I dont laughter believe in it So offense defense Substitutions for Mark Madson Remember the other night in that loss to Stanford Tech missed a late free throw that would have put them up by three Now this one is to make it a twopoint game Got it No timeouts for Cal Timeout Virginia Tech Their last to set up their defense for Cals game tying or gamewinning attempt Uh this is tough going full court but you you got to get Dayday Ames on the run Let him get into his stride and then So both teams out of timeouts Twopoint Virginia Tech lead Im switching everything If Im Virginia Tech I cant get caught in a screen Camden looking for Ames and he threw it away A miscommunication between John Camden and Day Ames He throws the ball away on the baseline Still 45 seconds to go So now Mark Madson sends in his defensive unit and theyre going to have to foul right away And thats the worst thing that can happen if youre Cal to not get any opportunity at a look and and now you got to foul right away if youre Cal and hope that Virginia Tech misses some free throws Well first you have to foul Dallas will inbound Theyre instructing the Virginia Tech bench to sit down if Dallas has to find someone No timeouts And Bedford is fouled by Dorsy I think Bedfords uh momentum was taking him a little bit away from that personal foul So Dorsy gives the foul Hes got four for what its worth And he needs to stay on the floor The substitutions have to come in between the two free throws So Bedford can essentially end it here by hitting two free throws 100 You just got to go to the free throw line and knock down two and you win this basketball game 63 on the season And that leaves the door open for Cal Second number one That those free throws arent the same as when youre shooting them in the first half when you have 3 seconds left in the game and trying to seal the deal So 36 seconds to go You have Pippen and Bell at midcourt for Cal Well remember they dont have a timeout so on a miss they have to grab the rebound quickly and throw an outlet Theres some confusion here over whos supposed to be in the game for Cal DJ Campbell goes to the bench And heres the second attempt for Bedford And that makes it a threepoint game Cal has to get it somewhere near half court on the on the run Hopefully they get a clean opportunity at the basket Camden will inbound He can run the baseline Camden the length of the floor Elish catches Pippen a look off the back of the rim You couldnt ask for a better look You couldnt ask for a better game And Virginia Tech survives here at home I tell you what both of these teams battled from start to finish I mean Pat you said it You couldnt have got a better look if you drew it up And Pippen had an opportunity to tie the game but Virginia Tech they deserve this win right here Pat Fantastic game An early 11point lead for Cal Virginia Tech comes back comes back again in the second half and they win a big one at home 7875 So for Eric Dondorf Im Pat OKeefe saying so long from Blackburg where again our final score Virginia Tech 78 and Cal 75 We now send you to the Dean Smith Center for Wake Forest at UNCC mens basketball West Durham and Dennis Scott have the ball
