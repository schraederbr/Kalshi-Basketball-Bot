off a disappointing 1319 campaign a year ago Off to an 112 start coming off an overtime victory against Elon in their most recent game Itll be Virginia in the dark blue uniforms in the orange trim Controlling possession first They are without Jakari White number one in the ACC in threepoint shooting percentage He had wrist surgery on December 23rd Expected to be back in a week maybe two weeks depending on how his rehab goes It is his nonshooting hand So theyll rely more on Ditter who drives to the basket blows right through the double team Thats an important matchup today Derritter and Hansbury Virginia Tech cannot afford to get into foul trouble They are not nearly as deep and Derritter is a physical driver Ninth starting lineup for Mike Young and Virginia Tech with all the injuries that they have had Mentioned Hansbury the transfer over from West Virginia whos their leading scorer This is cheering Jaylen Bedford lost it and a turnover on the opening possession for the Hokes Its been a Virginia Tech team that has taken very good care of the ball so far this year Foul on the other end Just nine turnovers per game for Virginia Tech Thats top 10 in the country Its a big early foul I mean Ammani Hanssbury has been as good as any player in the league One of the five best players Its not smart He probably fouled him before they actually called it I think he fouls him there and then comes down and just unnecessary Thats kind of the shot you wanted Hanssburys fouls are almost worth double because of his impact averaging cheering 16 a game eight rebounds a game You know this is a Virginia team that is dominating the possession battle They dont turn it over Theyre very good at the offensive glass and they are so quick in transition Virginia also shoots the three very well Well they take nearly 27 threepointers per game the most the Cavaliers team has taken since 2008 And they make a lot of them as well and 40 shooting from three on the year as Virginia Tech a late whistle on the loose ball rebound go against the Cavaliers You know Mike Young the head coach there for Virginia Tech uh has done a great job seventh year there You know takes ADA off of the ball First couple possessions here having Jaylen Bedford initiate I think Mike Young needs ADA to be aggressive today No Tyler Johnson still playing without Toby Lal Hansbury and ADA have had to carry a heavy scoring load for this Virginia Tech team Coach Young and Virginia Tech trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2022 And a wild shot from Hansbury who was double teamed in the paint cheering Heres Ditter spinning and its Hansbury who rips it away of Dallasos on the other end You of Dallas the freshman from Greece was averaging 15 points five assists on the year Rob inside Thats really good interior defense here early from Virginia Oh and a nice job by Don Hall coming over making a play A guy whos played a lot of basketball in his time You know Virginias defense has steadily improved Again theyre always on the attack offensively I think guarding the ball and defensive rebounding have been two problem areas that Ryan ODM has seen progressively get better cheering of Dallas with four on the shot clock fading away Really good defense Tracked down by Malik Thomas Transfer guard from San Francisco has to take it himself and a rebound for him Dallas who went through the NBA draft process before withdrawing and committing to Virginia Tech gets the Hokes first bucket is really under under control and you know Don Hall giving up a little bit of size I think part of it is Hall can get under Abdollis You have got to make Abdollis work for 40 minutes You can never let him feel comfortable Nice job getting to the middle of the paint and he was really good at that floater once he gets there Johan Grumlo another freshman one on the shot clock and not a great possession for Virginia A little bit more stagnant than we have seen Its a very unselfish Virginia team They play a lot out of pick and rolls Theres a lot of ball movement Its incredible the metamorphosis How about that scientific word early in this one The the job that Ryan ODM has done transforming this program and what it does offensively They play fast They shoot a lot of threes Hes bringing over a lot of success A couple years at Utah State followed by VCU Now in his first year at Virginia of course gaining national recognition when his UNMBC 16 seat knocked off Virginia First time ever that a 16 seed beat a one in the NCAA tournament Four on the shot clock and every hokey basket so far as an offensive rebound by Gerdak leads to an easy one that that really has been the first easy bucket of the game for Virginia Tech And that the defensive rebounding again has been a problem area for Virginia Good job by Gertak getting inside position there Sam Lewis a spot up three Its a 47 excuse me 41 threepoint shooter on the year coming over from Toledo And a three is good by Neo of Dallas scored 30 twice this year Yeah great great find by Hanssbury and and to your point Eric hes got two 30point games this year He can really really score especially when he stays aggressive Five early points for Neo pick and roll and a lazy pass as Virginia Tech turned it over and Grunllo traveled trying to get rid of it Gives it right back to the Hokes Hes looked so comfortable so far this year You could say the same for Tess Ditter on the other side from Virginia Both those guys well prepared coming into college music basketball Virginia Tech on a 70 run thanks to five points from Dallas three of their last four from the floor Abdales to his left and the kick out to Bedford in the corner Nice job plugging off of that Abdales penetration Thats the shot you want Get it out of Abdaless hands Sam Lewis missing the run out layup Numbers now for the Hokes Shoot Dumps it off to Bedford rejected on the inside on the endo said I dont think so heres Der for three loose ball and an offensive rebound test thought about it now Malik Thomas fires away nothing doing for Virginia on the offensive end as they miss three chances on that one possession those offensive rebounds coming off of threepoint shots Virginia the best in the country at doing that flying in for an and one The freshman Christian Gernak on the offensive glass You can tell its an emphasis for Mike Young Virginia Tech to put pressure on this Virginia Virginia defense early They are scoring early in these first few possessions And one of the strengths of Virginias defense this year is they are forcing teams to play at about 18 seconds of possession A lot of it having to do with their pressure their fullourt pressure And then down here they force you to work Virginia Techs done a nice job running and getting to the rim early in these possessions And theyre getting second chance looks off some ugly first shots Theyre getting away with some real bad shots as Gerak cleaned up the offensive glass And right now Virginia has missed their last eight from the floor They are just one of nine to start this game Onenso who just picked up the foul kicks it out with eight on the shot clock Heres Sam Lewis whos short on the three as the Cavaliers 0 for five from distance cheering and applause And thats been again one of the strengths for Virginia is their ability to make that three Theyre as good Theyre in the top 10 nationally and doing that making about 10 threes a game And then heres that pressure Theyre not trapping out of it Its just a nuisance pressure to force you to chew off eight nine seconds of your offensive possession N0 run for Tech Dallas bobles the hand off Hanssbury strong to the basket and hes fouled going up Onenso has called for his second personal as the big 68 240 lb Ammani Hanssbury was coming down the tracks having an all ACC season and theres not one thing he does great he just does a lot of things really well 68 240 lbs go back to that overtime win they had against South Carolina on the road at the ACC SEC challenge he had 22 points 14 rebounds in that game he was a man among boys second in for Virginia He and Dallas have formed a really nice tandem so far this year Hbury five double doubles on the year Started his career Illinois was there for a year then West Virginia for a year and now here with Virginia Tech The common theme for all of those stops though was associate head coach Chester Frasier who recruited him in Illinois then went to work for Darren Dere at West Virginia and is now here at Virginia Tech and Hanssbury has followed coach Frasier along all the way Oh and Chester Frasier also responsible for getting Neo Avdales to Virginia Tech Had a relationship with Abdaless agent Second half for Virginia 30 Recruiting these days its you know is hard I mean its a lot of luck And if you got the right guys on your staff the case of Virginia if youve got a you get a Chase Mallerie whos you know local from Charlottesville Chance Mallerie you Well those guys fall in your lap and thats obviously a good thing Three players from Charlottesville on the Virginia roster right now The Cavaliers just trying to find one bucket to go down and that lob was not the best Devin Tillis intending to go inside to Johan Grunlo Turnover against Virginia who has now not had a point in the last five and a half minutes Isaiah Pasha sophomore transfer from Delaware making his first appearance in the game for Tech On to the sophomore Ben Hammond of Dallas Straightaway three No Hanssbury working on the offensive glass just out musled and outworked Devin Tillis underneath Virginia Tech have been the aggressors First seven minutes of this game they have taken the fight to Virginia 13 nothing run for Virginia Tech Second longest run given up by Virginia this year Nearly turned it over again Tillis finally gets one to drop The first threepointer of the game for Virginia in six attempts Virginia Tech riding a fivegame winning streak including their third overtime win of the year And their last time out the win against Elon that went into extra time You Abdulas missing the three Were going to go to a timeout here in a minute but after we come back from break were excited to be joined by Virginia Tech football coach James Franklin Hes in the building and well stop by to chat for a few moments Chance Mallerie bricks the three Now Hammond pushing Seems like everybody who handles the ball for Virginia Tech has got their eyes up looking for Avdales Hammond will take it himself inside the free throw circle Hanssbury another offensive rebound but he threw it away Don Hall for three and Hammond at all 511 of them goes up to get the board Well theres no rebounding but thats a shot that Virginias taken all year You know that step up three off of the bounce in transition Dallas double team Virginia Tech plus four on the glass here early Now Hensbury left alone Itll be out of bounds Virginia basketball with 115 to go here in the first Miamis really good up front on the defensive line Thats going to be a huge matchup Not sure if you guys want me to keep talking because the games going on Keep going as much as you want Youre my guest And then like always its going to come down to the turnover ratio and explosive plays Both teams have the athletes to be able to do it Uh Carson Beck thatll be a big factor Hes played really well the last four or five games in terms of protecting the football Coach whats this uh transition for you been like Drinking from water hose What how would you describe the transition Yeah its been its been crazy Obviously recruiting at a high school level recruiting now with the transfer portal trying to put my staff together Im here sitting with you guys today not to talk necessarily about basketball but it looks like a bunch of tight ends DNS and wide receivers out there So Im trying to get some work done from that standpoint We pretty much got the staff put together now I got one position to fill uh safetys code DC position Um but but were rolling in a thousand different directions Virginia Tech Virginia obviously a big rivalry This is a soldout crowd here at Castle Coliseum Coach what has been your you know first impressions of the sports fan atmosphere here at Virginia Tech Well obviously all the way back to my days at Maryland this is a place that is passionate about football that is passionate about really all of their sports um you know just figures though I get the job right after Virginia wins the you know its in competition for the ACC championship and wins what 10 or 11 games Uh obviously Manny Diaz has done a great job over there at Duke Um you know proud of him He was on my staff at Penn State Um but you know obviously this is a big rivalry I understand what it means to the state You a hoop guy Wheres your basketball game at No I I played a little bit Not very good I was a rebound turn around put it off the backboard do all the dirty work type of stuff Uh but I tried to specialize in football which uh I wouldnt recommend other high school players doing I should have played more sports growing up Well right now Virginia Tech doing a good job rebounding the basketball James Franklin strong suit as Tech on top 137 another prolonged drought for Virginia and you know one of the you kind of talked about getting your staff together and and recruiting and the transfer portal How much of that goes is is done the minute you put pen to paper versus how much can you preplan when youre going out knowing youre going to get your next job Not necessarily at Virginia Tech but somewhere do you have a semblance of hey this is what I want to do here are the players I want to go after and the coaches that I want to join my staff Yeah I think you gota you have a good idea about that right But the reality is you know are you going to follow the rules right And you know Ive been a guy thats followed the rules my whole career Theyve changed the rules as well where you cant do a lot of that recruiting while youre out of work like you used to be able to do a couple years ago Um so you have an idea but you really cant do anything legally until that portal is open Tough shot for Ben Hammond who muscles that one up and in as Virginia Tech had missed their last five from the floor but that one extends the lead out to six under nine minutes to go here in the first half Eric Roth and Chris Matah joined by Virginia Tech head football coach James Franklin And coach what is a realistic expectation or what are some goals you have for year one here in Blackburg Yeah you know its pretty early for me to say that Um you know obviously I want to get through spring ball I still dont have the staff completed together but most importantly I want to be able to put a product out on the field that you guys have good stuff to talk about The fans are excited Were also living right in the community and those types of things Ive been fortunate to turn around an SEC program Ive been fortunate to turn around a Big 10 program Uh and were excited about doing that now in the ACC Whats your take on on the song Enter Sandman Are are you a Metallica guy Well if if this helps answer that question I said I said enter the Sandman in my in my press conference So that explains to you Now I will tell you this Ive always loved the song I love the entrance I wouldnt say Im a Im a you know hard rock type of guy Im more of a rap RB hiphop type of guy Uh but I like good music Like I like Stapleton Im not Im not a country music guy but I like his voice I like good music whatever it is But if I had to say genre Im more of a rap hiphop RB type of guy Who is the greatest MC of all time man Well heres my deal Okay Find out if youre really a rap guy or not Well heres my deal Im a Im a JayZ Big Big E Tupac guy because thats the generation I came up in My wife is West Coast so she wants to argue and claim Tupac But then I got to tell her Tupac is from New York City and raised in Baltimore So even your West Coast rappers are really ours Theyre really ours What a breakdown What a breakdown I tell you what coach If you go out and win the ACC this year you can call yourself the sand man and you can play that as your theme song coming out for next years games as Pamman is just doing all the dirty work at 511 getting in the lane getting a turnover as Hansbury misses off the glass Were back and forth in what has been a very ugly opening half to this game And coach as we get a foul here going to break we really appreciate What do you mean ugly Were up by four You dont have to here to Blackburg Virginia alongside Chris Mola Im Eric Rothman We appreciate Virginia Tech football coach James Franklin joining us And Chris Coach Franklin was a little offended when I said it was an ugly start to this first half but both of these teams shooting under 30 Virginia is 1 for 11 from three Virginia Tech is 1 for six from three And weve just kind of had some sloppy play back and forth up and down the basketball floor Yeah its been a physical game Both these defenses I think have been really physical You know the turnovers 11 between both teams which is really out of character Six turnovers for Virginia five for Virginia Tech Nearly another one there Nice job by Abdales right after that just calming Jaden Shoot down And its just a post entry and and Abdales had size You know Mike Young has run a lot of guys in here Again not a deep team So that those guys coming off that bench arent youre not looking for a ton of production but a breather here in this first half Hes been able to platoon some guys which has been good Jaden shooting fading away at the free throw line Loose ball offensive rebound Hammond tracks it down Dallas for three The offensive glass has been huge for Virginia Tech Another three Huge Thats now their ninth second chance point Five offensive rebounds for the Hokes as Dallas now has eight points and sixpoint advantage for Virginia Tech Eight on the shot clock Lewis dumps it off inside Good finish Gonna senior from Nigeria came over after a year at Kansas State Ben Hammond has really been the gogetter for Virginia Tech Doing everything Steals offensive rebounds making some buckets as Jaden shoot blocked from behind Heck of a play there by Malik Thomas defensively not giving up Fourth block by Virginia Theyre number four in the nation averaging seven blocks per game Hammond on the pivot Little floater Really like Hammonds game A sophomore Second year here at Virginia Tech Allerie lobs it up and an alleyoop on Thats really the first time that Virginia has executed what it wants out of the pick and roll That was one of the things that Ryan ODM coming in wanted a steady diet of getting Christian Gerdak in that in that high screen Shoot was calling for on the far side because he was left alone The best threepoint shooters in the conference 45 from deep on the year You cannot come off of him even on that weak side Thomas lost it going up and Hammond comes away with the steal Flips it to shoot in transition Offensive rebound Hanssberry Now Abdales for three Left it short Another offensive rebound Youre lucky that Abdollis doesnt make that Six offensive rebounds for Virginia Tech Just two for Virginia floater lips out for Chance Mallerie as Virginia shooting just 28 from the floor Four minutes and change to go here in half number one Dallas leads the way with eight points for the Hokes Feeds it inside to Hansbury behind the back pass as he was double teamed and theyre going to say a goalend I mean that thats a bad double You know its a defensive mistake And again you almost get lucky outside of the goalend there Theres no help behind I Im not quite sure what Onenso was doing on that double Its a great pass nonetheless out of the double team by Hansbury and Gak who got the goalende Well it was a heads up pass I mean the guy was wide open but yeah I mean its Virginia just looks a little bit out of sync and I think some of that is they have found difficulty on the offensive end It has affected their ability to a guard and b defensive rebound Theyre also without one of their best shooters Jakari White who broke his wrist in a highlight reel dunk against Maryland on December 20th Had surgery three days later Its his nonshooting hand They expect him back relatively soon Jaylen Bedford climbs the ladder for the rebound Under four minutes to go in the half at the elbow Bedford just trying to do it all himself and a one and done possession for the Hokes Ditter all day and the straightaway three is good for Tess Ditter Just his second made field goal of the game Fourpoint advantage for Virginia Tech Next whistle will send us to a timeout Sold out crowd here at Castle Colosio An offensive foul The legal screen will go against Christian Ger 25 and start conference music play for the 2526 season Take a look at the ACC in the net Top 60 Got Duke Louisville North Carolina all in the top 20 Virginia not too far outside at 26 Some strong starts to the year for SMU Miami got Cal making an appearance there as well So ACC as a whole Chris pretty strong start to the year Very strong Did its job in the nonconference You know won games that needed to to win have pounded the teams that they needed to pound which the net favors Coming out of the timeout an offensive rebound on the last second tip by Tillis Somehow Johan Bruno got inside got the offensive rebound and now Virginia just down by two Hanssbury inside turn around Tough shot on the fadeaway Virginia Tech now shooting nine of 31 from the floor Both teams hovering around 30 shooting What has not been a offensive output here for either team in the first half Some of these quick early threes you know youre only down two but have not been great shots And theres a you know theres a fine line between this is what we do This is who we are We shoot threes We shoot early and shooting yourself into a disadvantage Dallas has his three rattle out Virginia Tech three of 11 from three Virginia two for 15 for a team that shoots 40 from long range on the year Virginia looking to tie or take the lead The last time they did lead score was 43 Heres Grundo in the corner and Virginia takes a onepoint advantage Yeah if you make the defense work thats what Im saying Im not saying stop shooting threes It is what they do And as you say they shoot a good percentage But you got to make this Virginia Tech team thats not that deep especially with the lineup they have out there You have got to make them work through the possession and you will get an open three Toby Lal Tyler Johnson Antonio Dorne all out today for Virginia Tech who now trails under a minute to go 80 run for Virginia And likewise thats two fallways on consecutive possessions by Hansbury where Virginias making him work and hes kind of bailing them out with a tough shot Yeah And the new year 297 seconds to go here at half number one Virginia 111 on the year Virginia Tech music 112 Riding a fivegame winning streak Virginia Tech leading almost the entirety of this first half has watched their lead slip away They led by as many as nine as the Cavaliers looking to add to their onepoint advantage Five on the shot clock Groom low trying to go back to back Fighting on the offensive glass was Don Hall And now Virginia can hold for the final shot Tillis looking up at the shot clock on the far side of the court missed the turnaround and thats how the half ends An 8 run for Virginia to go into the locker room 2423 So I think if youre Virginia Tech if you can keep this game low possession in the second half and and be efficient especially with Abdales I think youve got a chance here Its a series that tends to breed games that are very close to split the series last year as Bentford knocks down the three for Virginia Tech to start it Thats how aggressive Virginia is going to be to get the ball out of Dallass hands That shot will be there That one extra two extra passes out of the pick and roll will be open to put a point the split series last year The totals in the two games combined four points in the wins and losses and this series dating back to 2008 has gone to overtime five different times So no shock that its a twopoint game as we start the second half You know the other thing Virginia Tech did well was rebound the basketball You mentioned the offensive glass They also kept Virginia one of the best offensive rebounding teams nationally off of their offensive glass Got to continue to do the job there Theyve got to continue to win the physical in this game Well and Virginia Tech on the season is not a good rebounding team Theyre dead last in the ACC in rebound margin and 239th in the country in that category And a travel there as Ditter is pointing at his feet But a pretty obvious extra step as the eighth turnover on the Cavaliers That travel is going to be called a little bit more tightly here in the United States than it is in Spanish professional basketball Clarence Armstrong Doug Surman Spearman are referees didnt get a chance to highlight them in the first half as they did not blow too many whistles in the first half which we appreciate Oh and Ryan ODM was not happy with the Ritter because he wants that ball to move like that Youve got to get off the ball if its not there that that straight line drive This is a Virginia team thats been really good at sharing it throughout the year Dallas who had eight points in the first half make it 10 with the midrange jumper And and theres that Luca Donic comparison Thats the similarity Hes got that sort of use that body and go up over the top in the midrange with that position of size From Greece went through the NBA draft combine So under control I mean hes just so good at in this pick and roll Gets the defender on his back and then goes up over the top Hes got about 4 in on Don Hall Thats the advanced level of Abduls game especially out of that high screen roll out of the combine He was a projected second round pick decided to withdraw his name from consideration and committed to Virginia Tech Leak Thomas tough shot with the grad transfer from San Francisco Hes got five points Thats his first made field goal as his previous three points had come from the free throw line And you get Ch and Gak in the screen roll there I mean theyre just theyre just picking on the matchup that they want Dallas weaving drawing a lot of attention Can they get Hsbury going offensively Well see if he can score a couple at the free throw line after going just one for eight for four points in the first half 17 Johan Its very hard music and and its no surprise that Hansbury has had a hard time scoring at the basket today It is very hard to score against Virginia at the rim Bruno and Oniano when he comes in thats 40 minutes of rim protection Both of those guys are in the top 20 nationally in block percentage Rensbury to his credit doing a good job on the glass today despite the lack of offensive production for Virginia Techs leading scoreer He does have seven rebounds Just four points for a guy averaging 16 on the year as he misses both the free throws with 18 minutes to go in regulation To killer Hall looking for help he finds Tillis who rattles in a three Thats the difficulty Youve got shoot and Gak defensively in the pick and roll which Virginias going to pick on and then youve got 40 shooters from three spaced around that perimeter and if you get caught ball watching those guards either Hall or Mallerie are going to find shooters spent three years at UC Irvine was second team all big west last year Offensive rebound Berdock Now Bedford Little sky hook off the glass Hanssbury on the offensive rebound Misses again Got his own miss and a whistle Theyre just pitching a tent Gerak and Hanssbury just pitching a tent right underneath the basket Immovable objects And again theyre just have theyre having a hard time finishing You know they just have had a hard time finishing when they get it that deep Nine offensive rebounds Nine second chance points for Virginia Tech But theyve had a couple possessions Chris where theyve had two or three misses on the same possession got the offensive rebounds have come away with nothing music The offensive rebounds going into the game just 11 per coming into today Hes already got nine for the Hokes Bedford Quick stop Five on the shot clock Hanssbury for three Missed everything You know if youre Oh Virginia lost it out of bounds I was going to say if youre Bedford and you get it that deep youve got to put that shot up But we have seen some silly turnovers and just kind of giveaways from both teams You know two teams that are so good have been all year at taking care of the basketball That was Sam Lewis who just was all by himself took his eye off the ball Virginia Tech will get it back Ryan ODM confused as to whats going on I think hes confused about the shot clock Yeah the reset cuz theyre saying that their guy didnt have the ball Didnt have control of the ball Sam Lewis Mike Young has lost a jacket is warm in this building today Definitely doesnt hit the rim It was a little tougher than than I thought but if youre Lewis just let it go out of bounds Unless you thought it was tipped on the shot first review of the game Bro Chris Pollola here with you in Blackburg They are reviewing to see if the ball hit the rim music I dont see any change in the rotation there I didnt get my binoculars out in time Onepoint advantage for Virginia number 21 music still huddled over there music So we do reset the shot Shot clock stays at 12 two 12 Still Virginia Tech basketball and still a unforced error for Virginia to even have this ball back in Virginia Techs hands Jeez Jeez I mean how longs he got a hold of him before you call a foul right in front of the official Thats his second second on Deon Tillis against the penalty And you know this is going to shoot with 172 on the shot clock and I mean my goodness it took the official forever Jake on the crossing route Now another pause to go to the monitor again looking at the clock this time as the play did not technically start and Mike Young going all the way across to talk to Ryan ODM both smiling I tell you what Mike Young is working over there It is hot in this building Hes got the stool He took the jacket off finally turned on the big fan at least one big fan that they have here at Castle Coliseum And again just now the clock shows 64 minutes and 70 seconds which I think is impossible All right so we talked about the turnaround for Virginia but for Virginia Tech Mike Young in his seventh year they went 13 and 19 last year Theyve got 10 newcomers on the roster three transfers and seven freshman including Neo Abdelas Abdales excuse me and Christian Gerak Both on the floor now Transfer Ammani Hanssbury Twoman game as Hanssbury fires a three Needed one to go Theres that twoman game and Abdales gives it up to get it back And then youve got the defense in confusion and a nice little pop there by Hanssbury for a wide open three Thats his second made field goal in 11 attempts as now Hanssbury has cheering seven points Virginia Tech back up by two Getting a little more physical on both sides of the floor in this Jaylen Bedford called for the foul Checking in for the 28 Theres this three and again just a twoman game and Abdales gave it up to Hansbury Came over for the handoff Got it back The defense didnt communicate music Probably should just switch that Hansbury pops to the top there for that wide open three One of the easier looks one of the cleaner looks hes had all game Hes just a 28 threepoint shooter on the year One for three here in this one Thomas looking to answer offensive rebound sits on the rim for an eternity before dropping in for Chance Mallerie Mallerie is an outst at 510 smallest guy on the floor He is an outstanding rebounder for a guard Third on Virginias team in rebounding Weve seen both sub6oot guards for these teams make some nice plays on the glass with Hammond for Virginia Tech and Mallerie for Virginia Yeah Virginia Techs going to need a third score Jane Shoots going to have to show up in this daughter of NBA vet Vin Baker Good luck to them their upcoming games this week Quick score out music of the break Chance Mallerie Little reverse layup to give a twopoint advantage to the Cavaliers Couldnt get much easier than that I Im not sure you know Ben Hammond Im not sure what hes doing Might be able to stay in front of the basketball Whistle in South only nine fouls the entire first half Seven fouls now here in the second half Five going against Virginia Were called on Dinner his second Neo another whistle as Virginia Tech inches closer to the bonus Hall Dallas will go to the free throw line Cavaliers Speaking of Tess Ditter Chris you know guy averaging 16 points per game has really not had many opportunities here today He just picked up his second foul Hes got five points but only five field goal attempts And really when you look at the Euro freshman keys to the game that we talked about between ADA and Ditter its been Neo has been much more a part of the Virginia Tech offense than Ditter has been on the Virginia side cheering Hey these free throw misses are killing Virginia Tech cuz its look theyre in the bonus now for the rest of this game and theyve only committed two on their end Foul line should have a lot to say about this game if youre Virginia Tech missing the three All fighting for the offensive rebound and whistle this time against the Hokes We talked about the free throw struggles Virginia Tech two for seven from the free throw line Virginias only at four attempt three foul called on Jaden shoot thats his third sharpshooter shoot who struggled today is on the bench now as backto back fouls on Virginia Tech Jaylen Bedford his second baseline out of bounds A missed three and a whistle underneath going against Virginia Thats on Ditter Thats his third 28 D Third on Tess Ditter Fouls becoming an issue here Ritters got three for Virginia Shoot has music three and is on the bench for Tech This has been ugly Chris Yeah Yeah it has Theres no other way to describe it Its been physical and I think you know officials now although these are fouls I mean you know two 13 Hansbury shooting a so with Virginia Tech in the bonus its Hansbury to the free throw line 69 free throw shooter on the season both of these teams have struggled at the free throw line on the year Virginia Tech as a team 70 from the line Virginia 68 here in the bottom third of the ACC in that category Tie ball game 1443 to go here in the second half cheering And off to Tillis who turns the corner Hes swarmed at the elbow Paul gets a switch Baseline pass Lewis He traveled Either he traveled or he stepped on the baseline Either one its a turnover Really good defensive possession I mean just nice job cuz Virginias allowing that ball A couple ball reversals you know some probing penetration and a nice job just kind of staying in front of it And not only did he step out of bounds he also trapped So a good close out there by Ben Hammond Tough day for him Lewis commits his second turnover Hes got zero points 0 for five shooting See Odoll keep his dribble there Go into the back down game Didnt have to pick it up Eighth turnover on Tech Allen Hall straightaway three Swatted out of bounds Virginia Tech will get it back Second in for Virginia Number one the lead Thomas You again no advantage gained on the offensive glass for Virginia today A team that has really had that advantage on the year Virginia Techs done a nice job fighting them Dallas pops for a three Nothing but the bottom of the net for Neon Dallas He does a nice job creating his space coming off of that Just a big step Pushes the ball out in front and able to get his body square 13 points for the freshman One and done for Virginia Another board for Hsbury pick and roll to Hansbury Goes up No double pumped a couple times in traveling Again that length in the paint has bothered Hansbury today Hes had possession a number of times in the paint off of that I mean just high level advanced from AD Nice job creating that space as he fires off of that high screen Pretty cool story Neos dad who was a pro basketball player in Greece actually in 1991 played an exhibition game in the US here at Virginia Tech So despite really some no connections to the university He played that exhibition game in 1991 and then some 30 years later your son winds up going to play college basketball in Blackburg 42 is left nine on the shot clock Thomas for three And Virginia whos made now just five threepointers in 24 attempts gets a big one there Eight points for Malik Thomas 12 and a half minutes to play Go Bedford slides to his left misses the three Knocked around for an offensive rebound by Hanssbury who saves it from going out of bounds Now Hammond collides underneath with Groomlow No whistle Thomas out running and a one hand flush from Malik Thomas Ben Hammond said Im going to try this Im going to test this And Grunlo said deny Pasha trapped on the far sideline Now Hammond al the long two Loose ball knocked out of bounds Hammond touched it last Defense on Well see if Miami can pull off the upset tonight ACC huddle crew all night long Elite Thomas missing the three out of the timeout Ball on the floor Held ball Possession arrow favoring the Cavaliers Second in for Virginia 30 down Chris Pollah here with you Chris you got a favorite a team you like in the college football playoffs Man its hard to its hard to go away from either Indiana or Ohio State I know were on the ACC network Um certainly rooting for Miami but uh I I you know what I like Indiana I like Mendoza but I think Miami is going to pull off the upset tonight There you go Good call by you Yeah I I think so I I think Ohio State is a little overstated maybe a little overrated Its just me a Cincinnati kid who grew up around Buckeyes fans my entire life and still do Bedford for three Its saved but to the wrong team Good effort by Sincere Jones making his first appearance The freshman from Portsouth Virginia See if Tesla Ritter can get something going for Virginia offensively Hes been quiet Chance of a three here Ritter still with just those five points Came into today averaging 16 per game Coming off a careerhigh 27 in the win against American the last time out Dallas driving stripped no whistle Don Hall got the steal pushes it ahead Malik Thomas another breakaway bucket Dallas wanted a foul I I didnt see it that way I thought that was was really good defense off of the pick and roll And because Abdales was involved in the play youve got no defensive balance and just a free giveaway And turnover on Tech Hammond Absolutely nobody stepping up in front of him And that ends a 3 and 12 minute scoring drought for the Hokes cheering Inside to Derritter and it poked away Sincere Jones got his paws on it The loss No Second effort Bedford was there Bedford Great conversion and a nice job following up the play Assuming a miss there on the offensive glass by Virginia Tech 13 offensive rebounds for Virginia Tech Backtoback buckets for Malik Thomas who is the leading scorer now in this game with 14 points 13 offensive rebounds for Virginia Tech Two above their season per game average Crosscourt pass Dangerous Hammond driving triple team 511 guard from passes Virginia to go to the free throw line Yeah its too bad Virginia V and here comes JD shoot You dont have a shooter in that far corner And so Virginia and these pick and rolls theyre really shrinking music the floor cuz the penetration from Abdales and Hammond is really chewing up their defense Example music example right there by Hammond But there that skip is there So Hammond and Abdales are making the right basketball play as the defense is coming over You just dont have a shot maker in that opposite corner and shoot with those three fouls Top five in the ACC in threepoint percentage this year at 45 from deep Hes ready to check back in A reminder coming up next well send you to Cameron Indor for the second game of our New Years Eve double header Wooden Award front runner Cameron Boozer sixth ranked Duke will host Noacy Reeves and Georgia Tech Nice way to music ring in 2026 with Jay Alter and Randolph Childris on the call Hammond hits the pair 4242 845 left in regulation This series has gone to overtime five times since 2008 Will we see a sixth with Alioop No Out of the reach of Johan Broomllo Great execution out of the set Just a really poor pass by Mallerie Hammond was trapped He got bailed out the foul call as he had nowhere to go Beyond Mallerie I believe his first 19 foul That is a lead to the line for Hooks number three Ham it back to the free throw line and one He was just there a moment ago making his first two attempts of the game Make it three in a row Thats where the penetration for Virginia Techs been really good cuz theyve been in the bonus since the 15minute mark Yeah Now our ninth lead change of the day Hammonds now got eight points Hes riding a streak of five straight games with 10 or more So two away from that to give Virginia Tech an advantage here with 820 to go The crowd getting into it as well A sellout here at Castle Coliseum Elique Thomas And Im not sure how the referee on the far side Chris whos blocked by two defenders can see that because at least in real time I didnt think there was a lot of contact Well I I thought there I thought I thought Jones reaches in here Now to your point about the angle Ah bad Yeah thats a bad call And youre right I think the angle affected the official Its a good point That was Clarence Thomas or excuse me Clarence Clarence Armstrong who was over there on the far side of the baseline and there was a near side referee who had a clear view of the play who did not blow the whistle Regardless Thomas at the free throw line cheering makes one misses one Fivegame winning streak for Virginia Tech You speak about overtime games Theyve already played three of them this year Most recently their last time out an overtime win against Elon Tough guy to throw it to on a short roll Gerak just not prepared to make a play there Commence the 11th turnover for Virginia Tech Now Mallerie baseline throws up a prayer Dallas weaving free throw circle Thats a shot you can live with though Extra pass Malik Thomas for three Dallas the rebound Good look for Virginia Hes now just five of 27 from three Strip steel Oh the Enzo got his hand in there Thomas was calling for it Turns on the Jets behind the back Knocked out of bounds Itll stay with Virginia cheering Chris Mola here with you at Castle Coliseum in Blackburg These two split the season series last year in games decided by a combined four points cheering clash in the Commonwealth always seems to bring out tight games Ditter came back in with those three fouls during the timeout and misses the threepointer Hes now one for five from deep Chris anything youre seeing from Dor in terms of his lack of production offensively today I I think he has had these moments You know he was not good in the in the Maryland game He was terrific in their American win So hes going to have these fluctuations The thing with Virginia all year is their balance has kind of saved them Like they theyve got a lot of guys out Jakari White with that broken wrist Averages 11 points per game and shoots 50 from three definitely use him shooting threes here this afternoon Four to shoot for Hammond against a Ritter and an offensive rebound A quick touch put back by Ammani Hanssbury Missed it but itll go to the free throw line Yeah sorry Eric Ammani Hansbury has put on a clinic on the offensive glass today Thats his eighth offensive rebound I mean he has just been around the offensive glass all day today and they have not been able to move him out of that area Itll be interesting to see how long Mike Young keeps on Dallas on the bench I think hes trying to get him a quick breather here as we close down the stretch of this game But that offensive glass has really been the difference I mean its why man the free throw line is is killing Virginia Tech But that offensive glass is really why this is a onepoint game right now 148 on the offensive glass for Virginia Tech 14 second chance points as Hanssbury misses both We mentioned Jakari White out for Virginia Virginia Tech also without Toby Lal one of their best scorers at 13 points per game Tyler Johnson the sophomore who averages nine points per game as well as Antonio Dorne the big sevenfooter All three of those players out for the Hokes today Collision inside Don Hall hit the deck Virginia Tech came away with it Shoot for three Three Wait for James Shoot to make a shot and he does Early offense Good put pitch ahead there to find Shu There was no hesitation Referees have stopped play and sent both of the teams to the bench It is not immediate time now Virginia Tech coach Mike Young just came out on the floor and yelled to the referees What are we doing Why are we stopping the game As Virginia Tech had all the momentum and I I dont know what that was for I dont know But Ryan Od was asking he was saying somebody was pushed I dont know And it you know it kills the crowd momentum Like this crowd is ready to go nuts after that three And good for them back on their feet cheering Sell out even without the students in school And you can hear cheering them here in Blackburg cheering Ditter left alone and quiets the crowd Couple times that theyve left him alone from three as hes made his second triple in six attempts Virginia Tech is probing with a double like Geroxs going and that forces a rotation behind him which is leaving that guy opposite in this case Ditter open checking in for the Hookies Again the balance for Virginia has been their strength this year And here comes ADA back into the game I I would assume for the stretch run just get him a little breather out of that last TV timeout Techs leading scoreer with 13 points as we approach the 5minute mark Eyes wide finds shoot misses the three You love it though He just hits a three Mike Mike Young says were going to go back to that Well give us another one Set play to shoot cheering methodically backing in Now its Ditter changes hands and finishes with the left Thats the shiftiness Thats the advanced level of Ditters game 240 lbs fleet a foot in the paint and a basket to take the lead Five in a row for Ditter to give Virginia a onepoint lead Virginia looking for their 100th alltime win against Virginia Tech Tech trying to stay perfect at home Hanssbury underneath Hanssberry Double with 11 and 13 Virginia with the basketball down by one cheering Dallas called for a foul riding the back of Deon Tis the last one last one to give for Virginia Tech So now Virginia in the bonus you know not in a scoring area Not not a great foul there from Abdales Eight on the shot clock as well when the foul occurred cheering Having trouble handling the basketball Eight to shoot Derritter thought about it Hanssbury stayed with him Now Hall for three Banks it in How about that Ben Hammond takes a gamble Goes for the steel You find the open shooter and he goes glass What a big shot inside Runo the rejection on Gerak Sevenfooter from Germany stands tall Every time we get some flow in this game we have an issue with the clock And now its a timeout on the floor with 336 to play Don Hall hitting the big three to slowed down because of clock malfunctions Its a big possession coming out of the timeout You know we havent seen many two possession leads in this game Chance to draw up a play for Ryan Odum Tillis on the baseline knocked around into the hands of Gerak Well thats what you wanted man Tillis the body against Abdales and just couldnt finish Eight on the shot clock Hammond with a burst of speed Collides inside with Johan Grublow Its not afraid Ben Hammond man he turns that corner He is going for a rim collision Johan when you play at his size you know they list him 511 Hes probably 59 510 You have got to be tough And that is you could certainly say that about Ben Hammond And its nice having the two ball handlers You know Devin Tillis was on Dallas there denying him the ball Hammond comes back to get it able to turn that corner And its square on his tailbone too which can now feel good despite Virginia Tech struggling at the free throw line Hammond himself five for five for the Hookies number zero That was a big exchange I mean Tillis has has the post up of of Dallas cant finish a layup on one end and you get two back singing here to tie the game cheering Hammonds sixth straight game with 10 or more points ties it at 51 Under three minutes to go cheering Ditter stops and pops over the backboard and out of bounds If if youre Virginia Tech thats the shot you want And I dont know if youre Ryan ODM thats the shot you want The defense went under It was open It doesnt mean at this point in the game tie game under three minutes I think you can get a better one than that Virginias lowest point total of the season 73 That came in their only loss to Butler right now just 51 points with 240 to go for the Cavaliers Virginia Tech theyve only scored under 70 points twice both times in losses of Dallas turning around Offensive rebound and a put back by Gerdak That front line of Gdak and Hanssbury have been magnificent on the offensive glass 15 offensive rebounds for Virginia Tech 16 second chance points cheering cheering in the corner Its Tillis Cant get the three Dinner gets an offensive rebound of his own Thats his game Use that body Get in there Make a play A good open shot from Tillis And a nice job following up from the weak side by Derritter Punch for punch man Expect nothing less in this rivalry 12 and eight now for Ditter Seven to shoot for Step back three You like to see him drive that Youre in the bonus You got the Ritter on you I think you bail out the defense with that shot cheering One of three Cavaliers with three fouls 110 to go cheering Ritter lowers the shoulder turns on the Jets and puts Virginia back up by two cheering Twopoint basket 28 Timeout taken by Virginia Tech with 534 seconds to go Youre in the boat If youre looking for Duke Georgia Tech that game will start on the ESPN app and we will send you over there as quickly as we can following this game Hammond caught baseline and a mismatch against Derritter 10 seconds to shoot 40 on the game clock for Avdales drives floats up and offensive rebound and a goalend It was Back again on the offensive glass The bucket Its been the story of the game ADA had it Virginia switched that high screen So Abdales had the smaller Mallerie on him The story of the game though has been the offensive glass Christian Gerak only a freshman 610 260 Look at where Hansbury is too I mean they have just camped music around that basket Tillis you got to grab that Two hands on the ball You got to grab that Do you think that was goalending Now another look at it as they review at the monitor Oh it hit the Did it hit the rim I think it hit the rim but I like the call live And I I I like it there I I think it might have hit the bottom of the rim before it was swatted away Yeah I didnt see that music I didnt think so first angle we saw but the second it looked like it hit the bottom of the front of the rim before Grunlo touched it So right now they credit Gak with the basket Yeah it looks like it does Yeah but when does his hand hit the ball Abd counts Okay theyre going to count the basket Its a quicker review than I was expecting 555 34 seconds to go Pick on and match up here You get the Ritter on a switch You get the matchup you want Drive the basketball Get it up on the backboard 4 and 12 second difference between the game clock and the shot clock cheering Allen Hall guarded by Bedford cheering 10 to shoot Hall to his right cheering Six for Tillis Five to shoot Tillis backing his way in Baseline Rejected underneath Gnak has it 3 seconds to go Hammond ONE TO SHOOT FOR THE WIN And we will go to overtime What a defensive stand music Free basketball In overtime Chris Vullah here in Blackburg music Virginia will start with it cheering cheering Chance Mallerie Little floater Rebounded by Hansbury His 14th rebound of the game I think they wanted to run through all the progressions there cuz Ditter was open on the block Gerak great seal and a finish Its like a football player waiting for the Hail Mary to drop over the defense I mean Gerdak just kind of caught it in the bread basket as it floated over the defense One of four players in double figures for Virginia Tech Hes got 12 cheering Ditter charging at Hansberry Hansbury with the rejection Numbers for Tech What timing by Hanssberry Its Hammond whos fouled from behind And its Tis who gets the personal his third Again with Virginia Tech youve got two guards who are on the attack off of the dribble I mean Hannah catches that and is immediately driving a closeout How about this defense I mean textbook vertical Our music timing was perfect Outstanding defensive stand What a game from that guy right there I mean a man among boys And Hammond six for six at the free throw line today Second for Virginia 33 of the rest of the team is four for nine Hes seven for seven foul line and the offensive glass at Virginia Tech You know well see what happens here but its been the story line for Virginia

Onensu What a set And thats where Oniansu is at his best Not at the top of the key handling but in that dunker spot Great timeout by Ryan ODM and a great set out of it Hammond just two of nine from the field Another offensive rebound for Gak had another one but it was stripped away by Chance Mallerie cheering Mallerie gets a high screen Double team cheering Ditter lift out the three Hall an offensive rebound Mallerie misses the three Another chance for Virginia Ditter up in the air Tillis the fourth chance on the possession And Devin Tillis ties the game at 59 Its the first time they have imposed their will on the offensive glass Its been a huge strength all year for Virginia Dallas a quick three misses and a bad shot You dont need to panic man Get into your stuff Run offense Just a panic shot there cheering 10th time this game has been tied Weve had 15 different lead changes Onensu again you dont want him handling the ball 30 ft away from the basket THREE TO SHOOT DERRITTER KNOCKS DOWN THE THREE How about a response by Virginia Down four Time out Virginia and they go on music Pressure from Virginia out of the timeout Still a lot of time No need to panic You certainly dont need three Play inside out Shoot Drains the triple Tie ball game with 144 in overtime Leave it to Mike Young to draw a three Forgot who we were talking about I mean Mike Young of course you go back to the days at Wford with Fletcher McGee When Mike Young has a shooter hes going to use that toy Really nice screen there by Gerach And weve been saying all game like they they need Jaden Shoot to make a big shot They need him to step up and make a shot Really nice execution Shoot All three of his field goals have come from threepoint range today Hes three for six from that distance See his numbers on the season ranks in the top three of threepoint shooters in the ACC takes about three per game So hes right on his season average He is playing by far his best basketball of his career you know hes really batted battled injuries some illness thats that hurt his development but he he is really really playing well And Mike Young feels it like yeah Mike Young is starting to use Jaden Shu in actions that he ran for some of the great shooters he has coached And Sh came into this game cheering 12 threes in their last four games shooting almost 50 from there Youre looking for Georgia Tech and Duke That game is on ACC Network Extra currently and we will send you to Cameron Indoor as soon as we conclude this classic between Virginia and Virginia Tech The music 161st meeting between these two teams cheering 52 times the game has come down cheering to a 5oint or less margin 130 to go Dinner killer Fouled by Hansbury as he was cutting inside Hansbury knows it Hes not reacting and just a bad foul You know its not again not really in a scoring area You kind of have to wither Youre leveled off Youre fine Just unnecessary I think theres a little bit of fatigue and you can understand why Its not a deep Virginia Tech team and I think Hanssbury that was a tired foul Thats a lane violation on ADA I mean he he was clearly in the lane and so Ditter who missed the free throw and Mike Young cant believe it Yeah at this point of the game obviously I mean Abdal knows it just a brain fog and its a one and one too so the Ritter gets another crack at the front end cheering its a big mistake there by the freshman Mio Abdales on the lane violation potentially cheering a twopoint swing on the violation cheering nope just one oh and then Abdollis This is bodied after the rebound and he is down touching his right ankle rider Thats his fourth The fourth foul on Tester Ritter I mean it its just a a play you cannot make And maybe hes frustrated missing the foul shot cheering Oh he stepped on his foot coming down A Dallas stepped on Ditters foot rolled the ankle You see there to the line for the Hookies Number 17 Neo of Dallas shooting two Two free throws upcoming for Neo of Dallas cheering Thats its a big time foul because you you allow Virginia Tech to march 94 ft to take two free shots And its the fourth foul on Ditter No doubt His reclaim the lead Dallas is going to come out walking gingerly after rolling that ankle And they go a little offense defense here Dallas not even taking a seat on the bench Hes ready to come back in Already walking to the scorers table cheering 10 to shoot Tillis cheering extra pass on nearly threw it away Three to shoot MALLERIE FOR THREE WELL HOW DID HE DO THAT Threepoint glass Were going to look if that was a three or not Looked to me like it was live but my eyesights terrible But what a big time shot And its so deflating for Virginia Tech cuz that was a really nice defensive possession And late clock following play is under review for a two or three point Three Yeah no question that was a three and over length over the 610 Dak The calls been confirmed Threepoint shot by Virginia Mallerie a 44 threepoint shooter on the year None bigger than that one right there Our 18th different lead change And Virginia back up by two under one minute to go in overtime Dallas back in the game now So again going because of the injury going a little offense defense I I think just look at how hes kind of hobbling around I think you got to start the ball here perhaps with Hammond Go to shoot the threepoint threat Now its Hanssbury walking it over the timeline Gerak hands it off to shoot Got some space Clanks off the back of the iron and a foul underneath on Virginia Virginia was behind Berdak and part of it is he was up involved in that high ball screen and hes lucky cuz he left Shu but he left Shu because hes worried about Geraks ability to offensive rebound And look at that I mean boxing out as the offensive player Little bit of a touch there I dont know about that but nonetheless shooting two Wow I mean barely any contact and the whistle The ball was going over the backboard out of bounds anyway It would have been Virginias basketball Instead its Gerak at the free throw line 69 free throw shooter on the year You know again I dont think that was a foul but sometimes when youre the aggressor as Gerdak has been all game get the benefit of the doubt Theyre going to give you that benefit of the doubt Gak 13 points 13 rebounds Came into the day averaging six and four and he just tied it up with two free throws 41 seconds to go Dallas checking back in for shoot cheering Will one overtime be enough 10 and 12 second difference between the game clock and the shot clock cheering Mallerie with the left floater rejected by Hammond Loose ball Ditter finger roll Its good 13 seconds to go Got a timeout Ditter with the heads up play on the loose ball after 511 Ben Hammond went up for the block Got that kick out And I would not put it past Mike Young to draw up a three here on the side out of bounds for the win with Shoot on the floor Two options to inbound the near sideline Heres Hammond Its a screen from Shoot Five to shoot Gerak inside the two hand slam to tie it at 68 4 seconds to go Heres Dinner for the win Off the mark and we go to double overtime pay as the ear of the first overtime and we are tied at 68 Mardak just left all alone hell out of this game which would be catastrophic considering he has put this Cavaliers team on his back at the end of regulation and now in one full overtime period Eric Rothman Chris Pollah here with you Double overtime between Virginia and Virginia Tech in the clash in the Commonwealth And itll be Virginia Tech with the basketball to start the second overtime period Mentioned the injuries The wall Johnson Dorne out for Virginia Tech Jakari White with the broken rift out for Virginia Jaden Shoot missing the three Fighting for the rebound Gernak gets another offensive board What a game for the freshman Christian Gerach A career game Yeah without a doubt And its just been hard hat stuff I mean bring your lunch pale to work today Christian Ger 16 points on seven of 10 shooting 14 rebounds Out of his area twohanded board saying thats mine And seven offensive rebounds Thats seventh on the offensive glass And theres a possession arrow in favor of Virginia Fourth overtime game this year for Virginia Tech First for Virginia cheering Virginia Tech won a double overtime game against Virginia in 2016 here in Blackburg Two to shoot Tillis has to get rid of it and cant get the roll Loose ball Gak another rebound Mallerie almost there again Just a really good guard rebounder He had it in his fingertips Dallas really hobbling Hammond lost his footing for a moment there 10 seconds to shoot Heres Jaden Shoot Five fordales who rolled his ankle at the end of the first overtime And that one trickles off the front of the iron Two close calls on both ends from distance Chance Mallerie baseline extra pass to Ritter up top and a loose ball foul underneath against Mallalerie Virginia Tech number two Mallerie Thats his second personal foul These two have just been fighting for the last 10 minutes of this game And I dont know again I I mean I think you guys got to let I think the officials got to let music those two guys fight for a rebound Thats a tough call Mallerie still pleading his case to the line for the Hookies Number three second personal on Mallerie but then he sent him into the free throw line whos eight for eight here in this one cheering Checking back into Virginia number five San Louis Its one of the areas Mike Youngs going to look back on this game win or lose and say We got ourselves to the line We just havent been able to to shoot our percentage Hammond makes the back end to give Virginia a slim onepoint advantage as Sam Lewis checked the game for Virginia in between free throws cheering 11th overtime game between these two The third all time that have gone to double overtime Dinner traveled Nice job by Hanssberry You know hes had that matchup and again hes played were talking 42 minutes in this game Ammani Hanssbury and just does a nice job staying in front and Ditter just gets sped up music Hanssbury you can tell all the work hes put in on the glass this afternoon He is dog time And defensively you know hes had that match up go to Hanssbury in the post looking for help and he threw it away Really nice defensive play Kind of baited Hansbury into throwing that Sam Lewis did cheering Enzo thought about it Now Don Hall rejected by Hammond He did it again Threeon one HS the slam Hberry cheering Time out Virginia back from the highlight package Its on Van Hammond You know these two have had a battle and its kind of mono and that was just over Hes overenthusiastic to make a defensive play One one thing well have to have somebody hopefully postgame ask Ryan Oda is Malik Thomas whos the second leading scorer for Virginia in this game with 15 points has not played a single second of either of the overtime periods So Im not sure if its an injury or what but you see here the foul on Hammond the inbound coming out of the break trying to make a play Sometimes you just got to live to fight another day cheering applause And your point about Thomas is a good one And he doesnt appear to be injured at least you know visibly Hes not hasnt gone to the locker room as far as I know but curious why hes on the bench Hammond with a onepoint lead inside the free throw line And Ben Hammond continues to impress Hes got 15 points cheering cheering Paul finds Derritter on the wing Too strong Loose ball still loose Garnac has another board up ahead Abdales stops on a dime to Hanssbury whos caught in no mans land and a reset Plenty of time Run offense man A better pass to Abdollis would have been an easy layup Hey and those are the breaks They made the right decision ultimately Now you just run offense Dallas step back three too short Yeah I dont know about that Never got into anything And thats a fatigue shot right there cheering One minute to play One minute to play Mallerie spinning wildly Loses it And its Hammond on the floor to get the steal Hammond has been tonight defensively Now he wants the ball with 45 seconds to go And he has gone after that Mallerie matchup 10 on the shot clock Virginia Tech up three here in double overtime Hammond to his left bodied No whistle Rejected by Gunlow Out of bounds 26 on the shot clock Mike Young going to save that timeout Calling out what he wants here You got to watch Jaden shoot Number two in white slip to the basket You know Gerach or Hanssbury slipping to the basket Hammond to inbound Hanssbury for three Clanks off the iron 20 seconds to go Virginia needs three to tie Hall kick out Hammond Another steal and hes fouled Number 30 Don Hall Thats it for personal foul Ben Hammond has changed his name with his defense Don Hall just kind of over penetrating Nowhere to go And how about the discipline by Hammond to stay home in the corner He knew where Hall was going to try to bail out with that baseline skip What a tough do Sometimes the biggest rivalry games create legends Ben Hammond Ill tell you what the grit Yeah With who Virginia Tech has out today and this games not over We got a lot of time obviously And now with 14 seconds to go in the double overtime period Malik Thomas is checking in for the first time since regulation Ben I Im very confused as to why Malik Thomas has not played at all in the extra periods Yeah the only thing I can guess is that with Virginia Tech having their two ball handlers on the floor and with the way this game has gone defensively perhaps Ryan ODM has gone with Mallerie and Don Hall together I I dont exactly understand Thomas left the end of regulation with 15 points Has not been out on the floor Georgia Tech and Duke We will join them as soon as the final buzzer sounds here in Blackburg Season high 17 points for Ben Hammond to give Tech a fivepoint lead No threes no fouls If youre Virginia Tech keep the ball in front of you No threes no fouls Heres Thomas whos cold coming off the bench behind the back Oh what a move and one for Malik Thomas with 94 to go You know again as good as Ben Hammond has been hes had two bad fouls And theres Malik Thomas making a play And Im not sure why he hasnt been on the floor but more importantly Im not sure what Ben Hammond is doing No threes no fouls and certainly no cheat Yeah just a swipe Just a lazy swipe uncharacteristic for his performance today Ben Hammond 94 seconds to go Malik Thomas a 73 free throw shooter Games not over yet cheering Second in for Virginia 12 Elijah Gertrude Twopoint game Elijah Gertru checking in for Virginia The Ritter pressuring the inbounder Its Ammani Hanssbury Virginia Tech looking for their fourth overtime win of the year already Uhoh Is Ditter about to get teed up Oh it was so close Doug Surmans was about to tee up the Ritter and Hammond was fouled Ill tell you what Chris that is the fifth foul on Virginias number Excuse me Thats not on Ditter Its on Elijah Gertu Doug Surmans was arguing with Derritter guarding the baseline inbounder and he reached for the whistle to tee him up and he dropped the whistle I think he had gotten the clean draw of the whistle Ditter would have gotten a technical foul Instead they inbounded to Hammond who will go to the free throw line You know if the 9 seconds you have to commit the foul quickly They had Hammond right where they wanted him there though on that baseline in a trap Cav 12 for 13 from the free throw 17 Hammond and Gerdak have stepped up in big ways for this Virginia Tech team today Combining for 34 points Big offensive rebounds for Gerak Big steals down the stretch for Hammond Fourpoint game Tech will take a timeout music 76 seconds to go music for a win against their instate rivals number 21 Virginia cheering Tillis chucks it inbound and a timeout Final one for Virginia It took about a half second off the clock Good execution on the glass music So its Virginia down by four 7 seconds to go cheering Thomas quick three Swish Malik Thomas brings Virginia within one 36 seconds to go And again it just begs the question how has Malik Thomas not been on the Evan 13 for 14 from the free throw line today This is the first Both teams out of timeouts cheering Twopoint game 36 seconds to go A threepointer wins it for Virginia What a stunner it would be Tillis the heave to Derritter Thomas for long two AND A TIP IN THE TIE UNBELIEVABLE CHANCE MALLERIE SENDS IT TO TRIPLE OVERTIME And hes not breaking music Third overtime Eric Rothman Chris Fullah here with you It might be 2026 by the time this game ends Im good with that man This is great Virginia start with the basketball This is the longest game in the 161 meetings between these two programs The Ritter still out there with his four fouls Malik Thomas starts the triple overtime period on the floor Offensive rebound for Tester Ritter So regulation was all Virginia Tech on the offensive glass Overtime its been all Virginia on the offensive glass Well thats two consecutive offensive boards to score One to send it into triple overtime by Mallalerie And you start the third overtime with an offensive rebounding score Hanssbury swarmed goes to the corner baseline Hammond good floater Hammond cheering Mallerie who sent this game to triple overtime lobs it to Groomlow Got a fingertip on it Nearly went in A Virginia Tech opportunity Each team awarded a timeout to start the period Hammond free throw line Leaner good And youre small Youve been small your whole life You know how to play in the paint What a shot fake there by Ben Hammond 24 points A careerhigh for Ben Hammond and he has taken over this game in a little bit of an absence from Abdollis after he turned that ankle Mallerie for three missed everything and a foul on Burllo Youre right that that injury to Dallas here Hes still been out on the floor but has been pretty inactive considering what he did for the first 45 minutes of the game He turned it pretty good You can see him grimacing and kind of limping there as he walks but theres a gravity to him I mean thats why hes on the floor Hes better than the alternative off your bench And you have a guy like Hammond who has kind of taken over this game I mean the minutes that these guys well everybody has played but certainly Ammani Hanssbury has played 48 minutes in this game Misses the free throw You look at foul trouble Don Halls already fouled out for Virginia The Ritter and Bruno both have four fouls Nobody for Virginia Tech has more than three So that may play into it the further we get in this game And both point guards for Virginia are off the floor As you said Hall fouls out and Mallerie just limped over to the bench Tillis cheering double team Malik cheering Thomas dancing with it now drives somehow gets it to go Malik Thomas ties it at 82 What a crossover and he had the matchup Thats the matchup you want is Jaden Shu By far the weakest defender for Virginia Tech out there Hammond lefthand dribble drive of Dallas Its been a while since hes gotten a shot to go Rolled the ankle Now Hanssbury for three Almani Hanssbury puts Virginia Tech back on top with 219 For three Run out of superlatives for Lmani Hanssbury today As gutsy a performance as Ive seen Groom low Cant answer Offensive rebound Thomas knocked around and Hanssberrys got it Hes fouled Nearly 50 minutes on the floor for Ammani Hanssbury and he comes up with another big play Fouls on Virginias number one Thomas Thats his first personal foul Yeah you help on the penetration there You know Hanssberry hes done everything today music Only a 27 threepoint shooter on the year in triple overtime after playing 50 minutes says I got three for you And then here he is just battling on the glass Those two guys Hansbury and Gerach have dominated the front line match up today Hansbury 16 points 15 rebounds Hes played 10 minutes more than any game hes ever played in his collegiate career Giving it everything hes got for Virginia Tech This the back end Fourpoint game Weve been here before cheering Thomas lost the handle Got it back Stutter step Tip follow Brun low Loose ball Thomas And Thomas fouled by Jaden Shoot Virginia number two Ju thats a fourth personal foul and hes scrumptious on these these rebounds That ball goes up I mean theres three four dudes from each team in there and Jade Shu tries to come in there late to kind of tip it See him on the far wing He gets called for a foul and a good call Well maybe Brian ODM knew this game was going to go to triple overtime so hes saving Malik Thomass leg Yeah I mean its a good point dude He by far looks like the freshest guy out there cheering Thomas now has eight points in the overtime periods but again he didnt even come in till halfway through the second overtime cheering Apparently if he misses this next free throw everybody in the building gets bacon cheering These fans deserve bacon anyway man They deserve a Continental Breakfast you know some coffee Theyve been great A sellout crowd here at Castle Coliseum And again a sellout with the students on winter holiday break So a lot of fans showing up here on New Years Eve and theyve been treated to an absolute classic 130 to go Hammond proddding his way inside Flips it up and in And Virginia Tech up by five Their largest lead in any of the overtime periods Does Virginia have magic once again Thomas spin cycle beats the double team No whistle Saved from going out of bounds by Gerak Now of Dallas pushing and hes fouled by Thomas with 106 to go Foul on Virginias number one Malik Thomas I thought he got fouled down on the other end initially Thought so too And Malik Thomas is just he is wheeling and dealing man Spin spin cycle in the lane Gets to his spot where he wants to the line for the Hookies 17 music Neo on Dallas Yeah I think theres contact there I I think he gets hit on the body Great job by Gerak to save that from going out of bounds Nearly 7 ft tall Played 45 plus minutes Somehow nimble enough to make that play Greek flag flies for Abdales at the free throw line who makes it a sixpoint game Youre Virginia here You dont have to panic obviously but you got to work quickly Youve got to get into something here quickly Drive the ball cheering One minute to play Is the one to drive it to Ritter working against Hansbury Nowhere to go Great defense by Hansbury Under a minute to play Tillis misses the three Knocked loose and Hammond gets the rebound Pushes up ahead of Dallas WITH THE LEFT HAMMOND THE TIP FOLLOW THE CHERRY on top for a career night for Ben Hammond 28 points for Ben Hammond And he commits the foul on the other end Fans not happy about it You know Ben Hammond has matured so much since last year Like hes always been this you know pack of dynamite out there on the floor Plays with such emotion plays with such force in the league but hes become a basketball player and the impact hes put on this game in the second half and certainly through all of these overtimes has been dynamite cheering Thomas trying to resurrect Virginia one more time The deficit lot larger than it was at the end of the second overtime They were down four with under 30 seconds to play cheering Both teams still with their timeout Hammond gets the inbound Gertude fell down now Chasing from behind Hammond threw it away Got it back Unbelievable Oh theyre not going to foul I mean that that is a lot of time I I dont know what Ben Hammond is doing Like the assumption is they are going to foul They have to Its been a roller coaster No doubt To the line for the Hookies Three Ben Hman shooting two back in Virginia 29 points for Habit now Boy this this little boys been going through it Virginia has fought their tails off here on the road but just not enough down the stretch here in triple overtime 25 seconds to go Thomas stepped back All the time in the world Missed the three Gerak what do you know Another rebound Thats the 19th rebound for Christian Gerak And now the fans in Blackburg can taste it To the line for the Hookies A lot to be proud of for this fan base today Their team This was as gritty a performance as we will see all year in the ACC perhaps in college basketball Again down three major rotation players Massive minutes today from their first five Nails Just nails from Virginia Tech today Gord almost got his his own rebound after the missed free throw Thomas loses it Final seven seconds and Virginia Tech It took three overtimes but they pull off the upset in the clash of the Commonwealth
