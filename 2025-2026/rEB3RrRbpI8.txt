Henry Basar by dongo with Kell Miller AJ decide Jeff Clark on the whistle and away we go from Atlanta And here is the freshman Dixon Picked up by the veteran Lamar Washington and Caleb Wilson out of a double team Back for Dixons three Bounds away and the rebound pulled down And this is the freshman Akai Fleming We see that first possession Damon talked about hes going to double team Caleb a lot Great quick pass Dixon just missed a wide open three Dongo at the top Messar has the assignment on him Heres Kesi Reeves Tech leading score His first jumper rattles out Put it back up Messar blocked it away Jaden Young leads the fast break with Trimble trying to get to the basket Floater was good and Carolina in front Thats one thing about the block shots with North Carolina They get out in transition Nice floater Fleming against Treble whos arguably Carolinas best all ball defender Yeah For all you young guards out there watch how the technique of keeping your hands high and low and keeping your man in front of him Sto with Bessar defender Two pretty good post guys there Heres Washington away The rebound for the red shirt Jr from the Stone Tarill lineup Of course theres Treble out of the corner Its five nothing Seth Trebles got all five Thats his 12th three of the year Well Damian said if theyre going to make a lot of threes early you have to live by that You cannot let Caleb Wilson get off fast So early double teams Tried to go to Leaves almost lost it on the drive Followed by Henry Basar Rebounded by Wilson off the deflection Carolina trying to push it Besar with Dono there Reeses thinking about helping out Heres Jay Young A three Long rebound Young will run it down Get it right back to Basar who scores Yeah good job shot by Young Then feed BAR down low Georgia Tech trying to find some offense Dongo launches and hits Dongo Just his fifth three of the year and the Jackets on the board Yeah its a big time for you early in the game to stop the bleeding First couple years Biden had a threepoint game in his arsenal So far so good Hes judicious though about his attempts Thats only his 11 Smart attempt Good point guard Young Mesar three Cant answer The rebound pulled away Thats Mustafa ahead for Fleming in traffic Couldnt get the roll He and Bessar battle for the rebound and a hell ball will belong to Georgia Tech Well you see the difference with Fleming You go at the shot blocker Now you get your shot off versus trying to avoid and get your shot blocked So right here rotate slow leave music it Big fella by I love it Stop the bleeding Keep the ball with confidence Dango 14 and nine the other night with two blocks in Blackburg Georgia Tech plays without Mohamed Sila again today Also Pton Marshall at 7 ft Not able to go for Damon Start Carolina an early fourpoint lead Quick look inside Reeves with the shot clock winding down Three ball over or two shot twopoint shot just inside the line Missed everything against Wilson Heres Dixon for Caleb Wilson Double team quickly Tried to go back to Besso Young for Treble A triple and a rebound deflected away Dongo Here comes Lamar Washington pull up foul line jumper Fleming Dixon trying to get Carolina in transition here Dennis Well last last possession was solid Caleb Wilson says time for you to get one Missed everybody off the baseline Last touch by Dongo says Kell Miller And now theyve reversed the call Itll go to the Jackets Jaden Young comes off the floor Luca Bogabots is in along with Jiren Stevenson who was terrific last Saturday in Charlottesville off Hubert Daviss bench Now watch this double team here This time Caleb Wilson said Let me turn into it Hadnt gotten the shot off Stay patient big fella because youre picking Tech apart The double team is coming wide open threes Stevenson trying to help with Washington Dongo now with Treble on the switch inside the catch and score soon for Dongo As soon as the shot blocker goes out great over the top pass and finish swap Stevenson for Bessar youre not swapping the same guy No sir whatsoever Shot blocking and ri protection gone Dixon working against Mustav the junior from Montenegro out of the double team Dixon will run it down and tried to deliver it got deflected by Mustaf Nine to shoot And we get our first break in the action here in Atlanta North Carolina with a strong start but Bongo has picked up five in a row for Georgia Tech Tar Hills in front 7 to five when we continue on ACC Network music in the day what we are now So oh my goodness a lot of good conversations North Carolina two of three to start the ball game from the floor One of five cents Heres Bogabas out of the timeout Stevenson on the launch Thats a back miss Rebounded by Washington We saw that from here Jackets were 0 for four to start Tech is two of its last five Both belong to Dongo Twopoint game A lot of Mcdongo All seven of Georgia Techs cheering points and were tied Great seal by a great pass by nice and high No shot block in the paint whos been battling injuries 3D trying to bring the a game to the area so far Treble into traffic Heres Bogavat A three bounds away and out of bounds And Carolina kind of living and dying a little bit with threes here Well how youre getting your threes That last three I didnt like at all Look at that great seal Perfect pass Keep the ball high Finish with the left hand But to your point part that last possession by Carolina when youve gotten the ball to Wilson hes taken his time Hes found wide open shooters They just missed the first couple shots Take your time and continue to attack the paint Mustaf with Washington Reeves Cam Craft has come on the floor for Georgia Tech Wheres number 12 on the drive and Mustaf shot blocked by Wilson A foul on Treble One thing David told us yesterday in practice Mustaf being at the four regardless of where he is on the floor he has to drive the basketball attack the paint Now hes at the free throw line So Jaden Mustaf will go to the line Hes 64 3D Whats up here First 16 eight points four rebounds Now almost 12 and seven couple double doubles I I think hes buying into a new role And sometimes these young men today want to try to prove to us what they cant do versus doing what you can do Youre undersized four man and Damon understands that Thats why his last three games numbers Dongo goes out Cole Kiraak 7 foot freshman from coming Georgia into the Georgia Tech lineup Only averaging about 11 minutes a game in conference play And snorts some way in those 11 minutes has some type of electric dunk to get the crowd going So well see if they can do that early in the ball game Gustav one of the two Georgia Tech with his first lead of the day Eight nothing run after Carolina went off seven nothing to start Heres Vessar on the catch Got dislodged Almost threw it away Bogavot somehow collected through traffic Treble Good look ahead out of the corner Cayenne Evans misses Besar the stop stick Got to box out Cole lost on that rebound Yep A good swing swing that time by Carolina getting to get a wide open shot Washington the pull up Carowak inside and it rolled off the back rim Besar the rebound Heres Evans now Wilson went out of the lineup on that last dead ball Treble Hell wrap it around Besar against Kira Right hand jump hook Rattled out Knocked away And heres Georgia Tech down a point Mustaf against Stevenson Chaz Kelly wears seven for the Jackets into the lineup early He plays better than 20 minutes a game in conference play They tried to lob the car away Couldnt connect Carolina in transition Stevenson stripped of it by Kelly over the inline out of bounds Jire thought he got a foul So did Hubert Davis Kelly Miller says no Play on Out of bounds to Carolina as Reeves reports for Washington in the Georgia Tech lineup Yeah that was a good job by Kelly getting back not assuming that Steven was gonna make that play Good hustle Stick your hand in there Were old school West Hands part of the ball laughter Carolina one of its last nine Heres Evans off the screen Took the bump from Reeves Seth Trimble baseline in the air Couldnt finish Vesar tried to tip it finally scores on the third try Yeah I felt like the crowd was going woo by trouble and a good miss but they saw right on time to finish the play for him Reeves the bounce pass for Kurowak working against Esau Carolina back to an 11point advantage or threepoint advantage at 118 And theres stop first field goal Hes got three Boy the games got pace to it Stevenson cheering bogots around crab into traffic and lost Saw the difference where theyre kind of half in the post that time rolls out Excuse me Cam Craft comes out by trying to take the charge Yeah Bootos a little late Cam Craft has to close out with the other leg up one to keep his man in front of him We saw Carolina early in the year Trimble was hurt Mogot was in the lineup Ken Evans was starting Stevenson was starting Yes How they kind of inverted that lineup right These three guys come off the bench Why the confidence level going up for this team defense Well its amazing cuz we were talking about which guy is going to bring it consistently To your point when Seth comes out every guy had an opportunity but nobody really emerged Now Seth comes back Now Dixon has the opportunity to lead the way Heres Kelly Bounce pass Dongos return Put it up with a left hand and Bessar couldnt control it Itll stay with Georgia Tech See the difference though with Bessar on the court Everyone changes their shot So to me its not a block shot I like to call it an alteration because now you made your opponent do something different to miss the shot Now the shooting percentages go down Mustaf goes out He picked up the foul a moment ago as Dennis told you Mai Fleming has come back in with Craft and Dongo Reeves and Chaz Kelly And here is the explosive freshman Fleming He did not play the other night at Blackburg by the way Nursing a sore back Theres Craft for three Boy Vessar one and done is Georgia Tech Almost eight minutes to go or gone here in this first half Here is Powell on the floor for the first time The West Virginia transfer Bovots into a tackle on the

17point lead for North Carolina here in Atlanta Jonathan Pow wears 11 for the Tarheels Fogots out of a double team in the front court Theres Stevenson wraps it around Pow The catch layup fell off the

Dixon on the bench runs the Carolina offense Heres Ken Evans backing it out against Mustaf Stevenson looking for Bessar with Dongo battling inside Bogots front of the circle knocks it down 13 for Luca

the dribble and a foul on Luca before the shot First on Bogavots is the fourth ones and a baseline inbounds pass or in inbounds for Carolina for Georgia Tech with 945 left Can Tech score here and get three or four stop to get this energy back in the building to try to get a victory here Otherwise it could go the other way quickly Yep misses Dango against Wilson into Travis right hand score now Nine in the second half 21 in the ball game Can we see more of that Thats a season high by the way for 20 against Syracuse 7356 Wilson the pass to the corner and the three rattled out for Bogots That time the trap came early to get the ball out of Wilsons hands Washington through traffic and bodies go down below the basket but a whistle and a foul foul charge to number zero K Evans Ken Evans will draw his first five on Carolina and Lamar Washington to the strong 77 on the good move by B Can Bob be more aggressive though Wes its like youre the dude Youve been here three years And a lefty free

effective here in recent games at ACC play Heres a lead This is Treble to the basket Layup Good Seth Treble Nice look ahead Carolina Another transition basket We always say keep your head up Throw the ball Miscommunication by Tech Easy layup by 13 for Treble Arios only have 23 points though here in the second half after scoring 52 in the first half Craft for Dongo And then heres Treble with the steal Hes got Dongo to beat layup Good One of the best in our game Ball pressure Seth Trimble One of the best in college basketball Yep Time out Georgia Tech Trimbles got four in a row Carolina lead

hustle for the rebound Washington beat him to it bounce pass ahead cheering and flming the dunk His second field goal Washington wouldnt give up on it No did not Once again Tech is trying to take Carolina out of their rhythm here in the fullcourt trap Back to a 15point Tarhill lead Heres Evans AR tried to go to Wilson Dongo knocked it away Hansboro almost made a terrific play on the ball By the way he was ready You know that much like much like Dennis has had to do in a couple of ACC arenas this year Look at Lamar Washington music Wont give up on the play Fleming gets the dunk Georgia Tech to within 15 when we continue Besar on the lean in Washington clears the rebound for Georgia Tech Tech gets their first stop now Can they score Kai Fleming and nothing short of the rebound after Dixon tle 710 to play Its a 15point lead for North Carolina Tar Hills have been workmanlike here in the second half 3D cuz really theres no margin to the no margin advantage here in the second half Oh dont do that to him Im racing Im going to get the ball Oh I see the double team coming over my right shoulder on the baseline Splats 22 now for Wilson Dongo The follow of the miss by Washington by Dongo working on a season high 11 and a half 23 in the ball game now for Dongo This four is named this play Double team comes shares it Look at it Hes asking for Wow Right back to it Now Dixon left alone Stevenson the rebound and the layup Thats perfect basketball Swing Throw it back You swing it again You get a wide open thing you miss it Stevenson cleans things up the rebound and finish Heres Fleming The other thing youve noted before when youve seen Carolina Washington will miss the jump shot Lets see Battle for the rebound Carolina out of the rhythm Both Wilson and Bessar outstanding passing If I cannot think of two guys maybe one guy but both guys are exceptional passers and being 610 and 7 ft Yep Here goes Trebles down the lane and one on the foul Tell Miller awards the bucket to Treble The foul is going to be on Purowak I believe Well I was talking to Seths mom before the game and I was wondering what this hair do new hair do Well when he wears his hair do he likes to tack the paint and talk a lot of stuff So thats the stuff talking tremble tonight Yep So Seth Treble to go to the line Hes now got 17 in the ball game As you see last year against Georgia Tech and Chapel Hill remember we talked about a few weeks ago Now hes back from the injury Dixons moved into the starting lineup I think hes more aggressive off the ball a little at times Ill give you one better than that Carolina with Trimble in the lineup averages 15 points and fast break per game without him in the lineup this year Nine and a half Oh that ball pressure doesnt lie His presence doesnt lie Yeah And now hes got 18 points Look at the ball pressure again He is one of a handful of guys who can really defend the ball at distance Exactly Heres Dongo against Bessar and theyre going to call the foul on Bessar Itll be his fourth Sixth on number 13 is four Thatll be his fourth with 522 to play Good free throws for Duncan Good action by Tech Nice pocket pass there by Kelly Fake to get off his feet Stevenson will come back for Carolina after the first free throw from Donga Bongos committed to the process here Dennis I think thats the other thing to note He has bypassed the NBA draft and the portal in each of the last two years Yes And thats why I chose to put pressure on him Now you want to be attemp to be a part of the big picture So go ahead and take over This is your team Youve been here the longest Youve earned the right to be more aggressive each night Got to stay healthy to do it Got to stay healthy Yes Yeah got the first of the two free throws Hes hit four in a row at the line here in this second half Got 24 in the ball game Does Dong He is five off his career high and second run 8466 triple hits it to Dixon That was close Theres a lot going on there Yeah it was Bodies down guys shuffling their feet all sorts of stuff See the bigs today Look at the numbers Wow 40 combined for Wilson BAR of Carolinas 84 And here is Wilson working against Dongo at distance Fives only got the two fouls Caleb misses on the long term Thats the first shot Didnt like it today Yeah everything else should be solid with the first bad shot of the day Fleming Heres Dongo inside and squeezed around Wilson to score 26 now for Dongo or 27 rather Two off his careerhigh And Hubert Davis with four and a half Wants Carolina to kind of get organized here at the offensive end Dixon on the drive into traffic Couldnt finish Draws the foul Hey take me through the dongo worksheet here Quick tack mode Baseline spin uses the rim so Wilson cannot block it But once again more aggressive The patience baseline uses the rim nicely Kind of beat Wilson in his own game didnt he Yes he did You know Wilson loves that spin move on the baseline cheering I told some people youd already compared him to Tar Hills of yesterday year with the spin move Well the first game we had was against Rafford He did it twice Then we had the second game against Navy He did it again I said OkayQar Hill you might not like this early comparison James Worley Yeah But guess what He does it on both blocks where certain big guys only do it on one block Yeah Derek Dixons got five now Lead back to 18 That gets patted away Kelly trying to fire it inside to Dongo whos battling Stevenson Coming up on four minutes to play here in Atlanta Pocket pass and tried to get it to Fleming turned over Hell ball will belong to Carolina and get us to a timeout Under four to go here in Midtown Atlanta North Carolina by 18 on ACC Network music ACC basketball is presented by Food Line the official ger of the Atlantic Coast Conference Carolina in Atlanta today to see Georgia Tech and the Atlanta native Caleb Wilson music and the Tar Hills leading 86 68 If its not like Atlanta we got this DMV thing going on We got Cubert Davis We got Dennis Scott our producer Tanner Fipps All you DMV guys are hurdling around today huh Some in the water They said Guess Im in the water And then people like Hey ATL our guy is home Number eight How about 85 or more for Hubert Davis in five of the last six three How many dunks do you have now I kind of take track You like what Five dunks Four dunks Leap in the nation according to uh some of the analytics and the analytical people are finally happy He made a three for him tonight Jesus Yes you are You are really on the analytics Yes because come on I love the three You know thats how I created my nickname But for a guy like Caleb keep attacking the paint Keep putting foul Here is Wilson at long range out on Q Right on Q and left it on the rim for Dongo I like that shot a lot better than the other fade away took early in the shot clock 325 to go Cam crab back on the floor He was redot in the first half That three bounces away Tremble saved it though on the way down to Vessel Carolina regardless of the outcome here has Syracuse Monday night Chapel Hill and then Duke on Saturday at home So a little bit of a break for Hubert Daviss team Interesting sketch too Heres Wilson out of a double team That was good defense that time by B not going for the pump fake Trimble with five to shoot into traffic Took a bump now from in front Left it on the iron Wilson going to clean it up Caleb trying to come out of the fray with it Lost it on the ground Now scrambled out again And what do we have Jeff Clarks calling timeout Mustaf is hurt and Trimble also slow to his feet and Georgia Techs first year basketball trainer Kelly German out to check on Jaden Mustafa ACC legacy of course his dad was Gerard Mustaf who played at Maryland the late Gerard Mustaf there it is that right ankle turned quickly Hes tough Hes a tough young man Tough young man Tremble went down in the cray as well Mustaf remember theyre already missing Mohamd Cila today with an foot injury Pton Marshall is out with a sprained thumb And theres Cila who is a terrific player but to be honest with you has played a grand total of 23 minutes against the ACC this year You know my problem with that is the best ability is availability And unfortunately for Seal this year he hasnt been available a lot We know the talents there and the upsides great but I need you healthy big fella Same thing with you Pton Marsh Ive been knowing you since high school as well You need both those big guys healthy if youre a Techman 8668 238 to go All pressure by Tar Hills Oh they called a foul Hog the foul his second seventh on Carolina with 238 to go Craft to the line shooting Craft will shoot one and one He is just six of eight at the free throw line this year In the 22nd game of the year the only way I let him off the hook for our viewers hes a jump shooter so most jump shooters dont get to the free throw line Now the challenge is you have to put the ball on the floor at times to create these opportunities to get the free throw line because you shoot the ball too well Knocks down both of them there Encouraging sign though Hes gone double figures back to back game Yes Hugh three times in the last five Hes got five and a half 13 in the game Had 14 against Pit But its a 16point game with inside two and a half to go Here comes Bogots Dribble handoff feed back to Bessar or a foul on Dango Be the third on Bango to seventh You see the difference but Tech has the ball Carolinas ball pressure is exception Carolina has the ball Its not the same ball pressure Carolina running whatever they want getting whatever they want Bessar has got 18 in the ball game cheering And first one good Make it 19 Now applause he had a double double against Notre Dame Only seven last Saturday at Charlottesville because of foul trouble He has responded nicely today And now has got 20 Well its a luxury to have your big guys with big time free throws down the stretch Wilson and Bessar have 42 of Carolinas 88 Kelly back the other way Rimmed off and they scramble for it Heres Wilson Derek Dixon Heres Wilson Inside blocked by Dongo Recovered to the corner Bogavots the three ball Eight and a half 16 now in the game for Luca Bogavots And Carolinas got 91 with 96 seconds left Yeah it looked like Lamar Washington caught a straight elbow Elbow to the mouth Oh theyre going to look at it Oh Kaylin Wilson makes a move for the basket Were going to see if its flak So applause Carolina will make some wholesale substitutions here And meanwhile AJ decided the previous play is under review for a potential flavor foul Kell Miller the announcement for you And So Lamar Washington appears to be okay Incidental contact So theres the ruling Incidental will play on here Thats one of those ones partner ex players you want the foul but every time you watch youre like why did my face have to get in the way Yep thats it Youre right It doesnt feel any better but thats the right call Coming up next well send you to Coral Gables in the Watco Center for California and Miami Jay music Alter Randolph Childress standing by Boy tough loss the other night for the Golden Bears at Tallahassee

the lane with a right hand Fell off the rim Dom the rebound Fleming tried to go back to Dongo Stolen by High Evans for Stevenson So Dennis what do you think Carolina now This will be three in a row Syracuse Monday night I like with Dick Dixon being the starting lineup Trimble being on the off guard letting him loose from Rome His ball pressure still there Theres Zen High a fall away off the glass and Fleming will have it with 22 seconds left and Carolina on the way to a 5 and3 record with Monday night Reeves has 14 The bigs delivered here today though Three Oh in a major way Defensively
