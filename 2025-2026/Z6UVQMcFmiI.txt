Ernest Ude wins another jump ball Hes now 174 on jump balls so far this season Miami in the road Blacks here in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts where its still snowing outside First game of the month for Miami And its going to be a huge month for Jay Lucas in his first season And the game begins with a Malik Renew threepointer Yeah hes a really good shooter from there Evan You cant leave him wide open there and middle ball screen action You force you to tag the road because Ernes is such a lob threat Someones got to rotate over take that three ball away from Malik Reu Donald Han Jr answers in the lane makes his first shot Thats a good sign for BC Its a great sign if he can get going Hes been a little bit inconsistent and erratic in his his play Strong start here knocking down his first shot A freshman Shelton Henderson creates contact inside and will earn a trip to the free throw line The foul called on Luca Taves Shelby Henderson here is just overpowering I think you have to put a bigger body on him Staying between him and the basket is a difficult ask of anyone And got to find a way to put a bigger body on him He has to throw a crowd when he gets in that paint Double figures in seven straight games for Shelton Henderson the freshman from Houston Kevin I think he has emerged When I think of the big three for Miami in the start of the season it was renewed Donaldson and Uday I think its now Donaldson Uday and Henderson Hes been that good And thats good news for Miami to have UD be number four Well it is because you know what youre going to get out of him Yeah Hes going to give you seven to 10 points and 10 rebounds You can write that in the book right now Any points he give you beyond edit proposes from the ACC logo in and out rebound Reu Donaldson is the creator for this offense and he loves for U who throws it down Have to manage his minutes because I think he has to stay in attack mode And thats Trey Donson there Ernes dont stay between him and the basket Expect lobster unable to answer at the other end as Payne comes up short Rayu looking to back down Capki Malik Rayu missed the short applause Thats the strength of this Boston College defense I think is at the interior Both guys inside provide a lot of length and shot blocking ability Donald Jr back outside to Payne Shot clock at six Payne slithers through the lane and Uday grabs his first rebound Lot of dribbling around the perimeter there for Boston College Got to find a way to touch the paint Oh Renu was open He attacks Met by a strong dynamic defensive duo Hastings and Kapky both there Transition three wont go but Kafky there for the stick back Great job there on both ends of the floor by Kapki Challenges the shot by Ray Newu He hits the ground He continues to play Rim runs gets him a put back Miami on the attack again High off the glass goes Henderson I think the bigs are going to have to come up to the point of the screen against Shelton Henderson Hes big and physical enough to get to the rim and finish at the rim in traffic and challenge these bigs Chase Forte and Sali Altuna Altunas at the scorers table Subs coming next Whistle Kafky teardrop No Hastings keeps it alive SURROUNDED BY HURRICANES HE SCORES and one Great job there by Hastings applause Sometimes as a big man when theyre switching youve got to take advantage of that here Shot goes up He gets inside attacks the glass Allen unable to block from out Gathers himself Creates a little space here Goes to the line for the chance for an air one Foul on the freshman Dante Allen Hastings has potential to really change the game with his activity defensively Only averages 66 rebounds a game but hes up there among the league leaders and blocks And you see early on the way he can work in traffic You see that plus or minus there That is a massive difference when hes not on the court defensively He is the key He erases all the mistakes When someone gets beat get to the rim Finishing over Jaden Hastings is a tough ass of anyone Hes done a great job all year long anchoring this Eagles defense In and out Second chance Not going to happen Just like that Thats Hastings job there Gets to the rim Challenges the shot Does not foul Does a great job there Scoop shot from Hastings Off balance Not even close Henderson loses it Here comes Payne the other way cheering Wes thank you so much Welcome to Chestnut Hill everybody alongside Randolph Childris Evan Lepler and a back and forth first four and a half minutes here at Connie Forum Miami with the early twopoint lead and the Hurricanes playing for the first time in a week since a very slim loss to Cal on their home floor Bowden Cowsky for three gives Boston College its first lead of the day And we talked about that earlier with coach Robinson Bowskys ability at that big spot stretch the defense Sorry Earl Grant out of the way But his ability to stretch the defense changes everything for Boston College because now you cant sag off in the paint Hastings not a perimeter threat Dante Allen pulls it back out Donaldsons going to need to create with a clock winding down Rejects the screen DONALDSON GETS TO THE RIM AND MISSED IT HENDERSON the stick back for two Theyve got to put a body on Henderson He is going to the glass every time as a perimeter defender Youve got to know that First second chance points for Miami Kapi not this time Rebound Alunas Reu got the first bucket for Miami goes to work again and draws the foul Thatll be the second team foul on BC Its the first on Capi Thats his first personal foul And again the depth of BC is their strength in this game Out of the timeout itll be two shots for Malik Renu He scored at least 20 points in each of his last three games He was 12 for4 at the line against Cal last Saturday Finished with 24 points on just eight field goal attempts Cal doubled him a lot He didnt get a lot of field goals up So far here it looks like the Eagles are going to play him manto man One of two this time for Renu crossed over 1500 points for his career last Saturday Strong few years at Indiana before metriculating to Miami Six minutes gone first half Connie Forum looking high and it goes in Chase Forte gets the two Was that a shot or a pass I thought it was a pass when he first threw it or shot it Id say And I think hes the X factor Hes a guy that struggled early Now hes starting to figure some things out getting more comfortable in his role And if it was you I would have known it was a shot Definitely was a shot Youd have to think twice if it was me Reu stays with it Gets an offensive rebound and a bucket for all his troubles I think Aiden Shaw sizewise going to have a difficult ash guarding ring knew in the post Theres some good power forwards in the ACC right now I mean he comes off here freezes renew shoots the floater Maybe that was a shot He didnt look too surprised No not at all I mean its its a good look And again its a good sign if he gets going too cuz like hand forte has been up and down But Earl Grant told us earlier today if we can get him going especially defensively makes us a lot better Ray New grabs the rebound his third already Dante Allen kicks it Corner three goes for Teeo Malovitz Malovich with the open three but the play was created by Allen in the dribble penetration Right now early in this game both teams are getting good contributions from their bench And Miami knows that its depth is not what it used to be Kapi draws the second foul on Uday Miami foul number eight I think Miami turned defense into the offense as fast as anyone When that shot goes up you got to commit You cant hang around there trying to steal an outlet pass Five guys got to get back so you can match up They get from one end to the other as quick as anyone Miami number one in the ACC Fast break points per game Kathky at the line and second foul on Uday 1234 left in the first half If youre Jay Lucas how do you manage this But now youre going to see that small lineup again now with Reu at the five And thats not a bad thing because what it does is it puts perimeter shooting around him Sheldon Henderson now slides to the four And this is a better offensive group for Miami but defensively they can be vulnerable to dribble penetration The Israeli junior Nome Door is in the game for Miami DONALDSON WITH A BEAUTIFUL PASS but its blocked and a foul called on Shaw And thats what I mean Evan when they go to this small lineup Now you got to be careful Who do you help off of He comes off he slips you got to get a tag against a guy we talked about thats potentially a first team all ACC guy but youre worried about a shooter that you just had knocked down a three possession before Its well done by Donaldson timing that pass perfectly He plays the position as well as anyone I just think his is just a matter of not always in attack mode and down the lack of depth He has to do that I think one of the best in the country at double doubles with guards and assistance scoring and better the better he attacks the better Miami offense is overall Bray new is averaging just a hair under 20 points per game Season high 28 Came against Pittsburgh Off to cheering a fantastic start through the first eight minutes today despite that missed free throw Hes missed a couple here but hes been really consistent all year long on the offensive end of the floor BC trailing by four Caleb Steager feeds it inside for Capki Going to work on the smaller Renu Unable to convert Here comes Donaldson Now watch for Miami on the other end of the floor Theyre going to continue to spread you out and then have Donaldson create finding Renu inside for two more You got to do something with Donaldson in that middle ball screen You got to get the ball out of the middle of the floor cuz the ball changes from weak side to strong side so fast you dont have time to rotate over Kapi answers immediately I think Miami on the other end because theyre so small now they may have to look at some zone The battle of the big talked so much about the guards Randolph but its the two big guys Renu and Kapy that each have nine points a piece Forte into the traffic Rebounded by Malovitz Forte has got a watch He shoots the shot He cant tag and try to get the offense I mean the offensive rebound Hes got to get back and match up We had a clock issue I think they set the clock to 20 instead of 30 after the BC Wonderland Weve got about what 4 in today so far at least And Ill tell you I I was inside Connie Forum last night I came to the BC hockey game Its chilly in here last night as you would expect at a hockey ring It is toasty right now It is really warm I had to come out of my jacket here Anderson gaining confidence with every game on the offensive glass Hunas making something happen and thats a bonus for Miami It is You want him to get it off the glass there Great drive by Shelton Henderson And when you rotate over as a guard you dont I dont want no part of having to try to crack down and box out Alunis Hes going to win that battle more times than not First foul on Hastings cheering Alunus has struggled from the free throw line Hes now five of 13 on the season cheering He has not played doubledigit minutes in a game since cheering December and he missed them both applause Im told free burgers for the fans here at Connie Usually thats a second half promotion but they get it out of the way early here in laughter BC Whatever it takes Whatever it takes You see Miami now back in that zone and they miss two more free throws Do they get fries with it Yeah Oh a drink would Shaw keeps it alive Fox winding down Payne pull up Tough shot Would not go And its Malivance with a rebound Good possession defensively there for Miami Boston College Man or zone The ball has got to touch the paint Ray News is not on the floor Neither is u dovat over to Henderson Alovitz tough shot over the contest from Payne and loose ball scooped up in the corner by Hastings This is a lineup to DC You want to take advantage of it Best shot that Pay has had so far couldnt make it but Shaw tips the rebound out and the pass goes through Paynes hands this time Henderson in transition defended really well by Aiden Shaw And one ref says its a jump ball The other says its Miami ball Officials still conversing Theyre letting them play here They on the drive BC turns it over and thats just really good defense Sheldon Henderson is a load He initiates the contact and wants to foul I did a great job about letting the guys play Neither team has scored in the last two minutes with their lead and scores out right now And Ray New and Kis Ray new steps back into the game Kathys coming back next whistle Yeah get a sense this game You cant let anyone get too far ahead when youve had the offensive struggles that both of these teams can have at times Caves cheering can he create something late in the shot clock Pay back to Luca Put on the line two Rebounded by Rayu This is a Boston College game so far Its played at the pace that they want to play But now Miami is readjusting to the pace that they played once before I think this is the style that theyre going to have to play because of because of their lack of depth and the way they want to finish the season Not this time for Renu but the rebound comes out to Dovra Second chance No Third try the charm from Malik Renu You can see here early and often theres just no answer for Malik Mu Good Jay Lucas Can you keep him fresh Hes showing you he can lift you up offensively And I think thats why you see this zone Not that theyre resting in the zone but it alleviates him having to chase everyone around in rhythm Three for DJ Han Its a great start offensively from him He knocks down his first three Does not miss the shot here And this is a different team when he gets it going on the offensive end of the floor He had games last year where that shot was a layup Yes One of the better gifted scorers as a big guard that we had coming into this year and got off to a slow start What do you think the issue has been this year for him I think confidence and expectations Just put too much pressure on himself and sometimes you just want to get out there and just go play and hes starting to do No foul Its a travel called against Alunas BC hanging around Thats this the whole Allen crew from Miami Gardens Florida is here And the fact that he is with the team and was rebounding for him in warmups and in great spirits pretty powerful stuff It is I think its one of the best stories in college basketball right now Theres a GoFundMe out there raising money for his all his medical expenses Thats raised over 77000 already You can see a link to it on the Miami website if youre interested in supporting Marcus on his road to recovery and had a chance to chat with him before the game Special young man dealing with some adversity and hes going to be back I got no doubt he is and its just something tough to hear and see that he has handled it his strength and what he means to this team And he was playing 19 minutes a game before he went out Five points three rebounds 67 sophomore He He would be in the rotation if he was fully healthy He was the first guard off the bench early in the year Pal was on Hastings his second Renew back at the line Heres Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header starts with number 20 Clemson hosting Virginia Tech at 7 Eastern and then Wake Forest in Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion Like everything else both are also available on the ESPN app Thats Wednesday night on the network cheering Renu has been on a tear here to start this game Interesting day already in the ACC Louisville winning on the road at Wake NC State hanging on to beat Virginia Tech by nine in Raleigh Virginia getting a home win against the Orange of Syracuse Donaldson in transition throws it to Henderson who does the rest The guards of Boston College have got to get back especially in this zone Trying to get in front of Shelton Henderson is scary but you got to do it You got to get a body in front of him Someones got to pick up Trey Donaldson in transition a lot early than theyre doing Both Taves and Hand could have pulled the trigger and both were a little tentative And now BC scrambling late in the shot clock Taves rejected by Henderson Dante Allen leads the break Allen all the way cheering Time out No difference in fast break points If they want to get back in this game and keep it competitive they have got to make sure they get back and set their defense And that really starts for BC with playing better offense They got to sack the paint job I think they got to drop class Nothing doing there for Payne Transition opportunity again OH BEAUTIFUL SPIN MOVE Donaldson draws the hard foul on Jason Asamod What a move here One second Hes here One second Hes gone See you Ill be right back Wait here for a minute Ray Donaldson again I just think hes a different guy when he stays in attack mode like that unselfish player cheering As you see he and I have the same hair stylist there You know as you said you think its the best in the ACC Its why we go to the same hairstyles I figure he should lend some of it to you Im proud of him now And I I made the comparison He he closed Hes one of the best closers in closers in college basketball And I compared him to Mariano Rivera and he had no idea who he was So today the first thing I asked him was Did you do your homework And hes like Yeah yeah yeah So he got into his right hand pitcher stance I think he said his dad got Yeah Great job Thats great parenting right there Dad had to make sure his son knew cheering Trey Donaldson couple years at Auburn started 37 games for the Michigan Wolverines in the Big 10 last season Short hand cant connect Danger zone time here for BC these last five minutes of the half Got to keep it within a manageable deficit Rayu overpowering Aiden Shaw Somehow BC gets the stop Yeah theyre going to continue to allow Ray knew to play oneonone and hes won that match up more times than not Eagles one of their last 10 from the field Theyve missed their last five shots And its a reaching foul on Henderson Donald Han Jr averaged almost 16 points a game last year Of course he was named the ACCs most improved player The scoring a little bit down this year Season low six points on Tuesday against Duke But hes still 14 and five a game I think the problem has been hes just been real inconsistent there is thats not been the pain the problem for Fred Payne Hes been really consistent scoring though averaging 20 points a game his last eight Maybe thatll get him going cuz he was 0 for six before that make I think hes more comfortable getting to his midrange shot especially getting to his left hand Donaldson pull up No good Another second chance here Its Rayu from the other corner Opportunity for Boston College in transition Payne goending cheering applause Henderson shaking his head at the baseline official but I think Payne got it off the glass a split second before Henderson got the flag He tried to time it You see him chase chopping his step right there getting ready to go and yeah just a great job by Paying there just getting to the glass quick Backtoback buckets for Payne Yeah throw the numbers out You got to allow him to go Hes got to maintain his level of aggressiveness Oh some pressure defense in the back court for forte to pay Timeout Miami A little 6o spurt here from the Eagles and their pressure Trying to play a little faster and they drilled off buckets here Got themselves back in this game Eagles for the most part have taken care of the ball Only one turnover so far and despite the fact that the rebounding disparity is plus 10 for Miami only a onepoint difference in second chance points Uday 3 seconds is the call cheering Once in a blue moon you see that on tomorrow dont forget our womens basketball action on a Sunday afternoon starting with a play for K double header NC State Virginia Tech at noon Eastern from the castle and then Indian Navar and number 25 North Carolina taking on Wake Forest Like everything else both games also available on the ESPN app Coverage starts at noon on ACC Network One thing to keep an eye on is Miami domination on the glass That could become a separator especially them on the offensive glass No good for Kapky who had nine quick points early Anderson kicks it Allen pops it over Malovich for three Kevin that counts as a transition basket for me Again you dont match up on the basketball Forces you to collapse You cant leave Miami with an open three They struggle to make threes at a high level You dont want to give them open Oh good hands from Renu Deflects the entry pass Second BC turnover Henderson downhill Allen lost it Gives it right back Reaching foul on Donaldson His first pushing the ball in transition here as you can see the drive the defense collapsed You got four guys in the paint Great one more there by Allen Talk about space Yeah you wont get a more open look than that He didnt have a guy within 15 ft I think Earl Grant was the closest defender to him He was And Im not trying to create conflict here when I tell you the official stack keeper did not score that as a fast break bucket Thats all right But well protest it One hand shot no good offensive rebound Shaw stick back two applause with the big lineup and thats something where I think BC can be effective on the offensive glass and right now with UL out this is a small lineup Miamis better offensively Donaldson kicks it Alivitz not this time Shaw has been active since he entered Thats his fourth rebound Payne looked good on the way Would not stay down Donaldson through the trees doesnt get the bounce Kafky the rebound Here comes BC Paynees calling for it Hand will take it and Rayu picks up his first foul Aiden Shaw is always trying to find ways to impact the game And here he gets on the offensive glass That is a great offensive rebound and finish here He does a lot of his best work on the defensive end of the floor First miss at the line today for Boston College go to Jay Lucas just turned 37 in December When he was introduced this past March as the new Miami coach he said that his whole life has prepared him for this moment applause Of course his father John all American in Maryland 14 years in the league head coach of the Spurs Sixers and Cavs cheering Comes from a basketball family and then some applause Hes ready for this opportunity there This dad is still energetic Got a chance to see him last week when he was at the game in Miami And see big brother there I mean he is well prepared cheering By the way that was Miamiys fourth turnover in the last four minutes And weve got a onepoint game cheering Donald Han Jr knocks down the three Henderson at the other end into double figures here in the half for Miami Just that quick you score a basket and again you have Shelton Henderson flying down heel coming at you You have got to put your chest in front of him You cannot give him any angles Hes just too athletic and too strong Oh nice move Silky finish from the strong Boy 11 in the half for Kapki Eagles trailed by as many as 10 Back within one again This is where I think Trey Donaldsons got to be aggressive but you worry about fatigue at some point Tenderson this time creating Kane Snacks it out of his grasps Seven to shoot for Miami He comes off this ball screen No hesitation DJ Han Dez here watching He loves to see that Donald senior threeyear captain of Virginia Ray We got a whistle Its a travel Great job Miami turnover Great job by Captain Holding his ground walling up using the baseline as an extra defender Just just excellent defense there Boston College has only led for 38 seconds in this first half They cheering jumped in front 109 They got a chance to take the lead in the locker room right here Less than a second separating the game clock and the shot clock Theres no shot blocking on the floor for Miami You BC get two feet in the paint get some type of rotation and then find the open teammate 5 seconds Payne crosses over with three Payne stepped out of bounds Miami ball with 19 remaining Thats in the Achilles heel for BC They they they defend well enough to keep themselves in on the offensive end of the floor You have a chance for the last shot You got to get a field goal attempt No fouls to give for BC Alivitz from midcourt over the backboard And that is how the open 3329 at the half and lost by 10 Big stretch of games coming up for Miami starting with North Carolina on Tuesday Tarheels Ive heard are playing tonight against some team from nearby I think they wear a darker shade of blue Cant remember I cant think of which team youre talking about Oh we got it on the Duke laughter at the line Hard to say for us weight guys huh Henderson at the line after the foul picked up by hand applause Only three turnovers for Boston College today So Miami team that often feasts creating turnovers leading to offense cheering No points off turnovers so far today That was obviously a key Yes for Earl Grant coming in Both teams usually do a really good job at taking care of the basketball Miami with eight first half turnovers led to a couple of easy baskets for BC They leave Payne open He cannot make him pay Pull up Henderson short Thats the next development in his game is the catch and shoot open threes Once he gets that down it just elevate his play as he continues to expand his game and a really good on ball defender Needs to get better from the free throw line too That was something Jay Lucas has talked about Hayne well defended by Dante Allen So Taves again forced to fire Hastings got a hand on the rebound but could not secure it Then he takes a tumble Donaldson bulldozes over Taves Its an offensive foul applause Its a good call by the officials Im surprised sometimes this isnt called more Number two on Trey Donaldson does a great job Like watch guys watching the NBA they initiate the contact first and great job there by Tays taking it right there in the chest I think he had no question but to call that an offensive foul I like how Luca didnt flop and he still got the call He stayed on his feet If they didnt call it he was still right there When you got a coach that spends half of his time coaching in a defensive stance you got to learn how to defend Be tough doing it Kafky fires and the rebound for Henderson His sixth board Miamiys plus 11 on the glass Big reason is this guy Rayu hits the cutting Uday officials looking at each other Miami leads 3533 BC hasnt led since the score was 109 trail by as many as 10 but they have hung around Taves looking for Hastings Hastings over the back Thats Jadens third foul of the game Heres this weekends ACC Network gymnastics schedule coming up later today Number 20 Cal squares off against number 16 Clemson Thats at 6 Eastern 3 Pacific And tomorrow well wrap up the weekend with a tobacco road rivalry 12th ranked North Carolina number 22 NC State 4 Eastern Both meets also available like everything else on the ESPN app Late whistle cheering foul is on hand His second hand Donald Han doesnt like the foul but I thought he the foul was earlier Foul was on Taz with the left hand He grabbed them Final hand is like that is not my foul Bro Grant asked them to He said Hey the foul was on Taves not hand Would they look and reconsider that We have seen officials determine without question I dont think its who that foul was on But Im not sure Earl has made that case If it was on Taves it would have been his second Instead its Hs second One of thems a 14 points per game score and ones a sixpoint per game score Yeah that was his third maybe fourth foul Hed definitely be challenging that Its I think Ray knew they continue to defend him oneonone and if Miami I like that matchup Im going to continue to go to him 15 for Renu and puts it on the floor Taves fakes it Kappy attacking Reu may have shuffled the bumpies but he scores two off the glass Hes a really skilled big guy Whatever he gives you from a threepoint line is beneficial but when he gets in that paint hes capable of scoring over either shoulder Reu strong take right into the belly of Aiden Shaw I think Aiden Shaw has a lot of length but hes given up a lot of pounds to a really strong Malik Renew inside and creates a contact with Henderson and draws the second foul on Sheldon Henderson These two guys have been going at it all game long And they have not disappointed in this matchup Jaffy there with a nice lefty lay kissing it off the glass Not to be undone I think Ray Lou goes right through Aiden Shaws chest So dominant getting to that left hand Ruras right now six of 14 from the floor Caves not looking to score Payne is hasnt been his day from the field now Three of 13 0 for five from deep hands foot Miami Miami ball Theyre starting to struggle scoring the basketball And again when we talked about BC their issues are on the offensive end of the floor Like that last possession thats good offense Payne gets a good look Hes just unable to knock it down Theyre going to defend well enough to keep themselves in the game The number for them is can they get to 70 to give themselves a chance to win games like this Theyre only halfway to 70 right now and the free throw percentage has left something been desired in the past Four of five from the line so far today again right around Shaw You got to be careful again Earl Branchs got some decisions hes got to make as he send help to Malik Rayu When you do that then you open up shots for other guys but right now Reu has it going You cant let Renu beat you Luca Taves all the way His first two Lukay looking to pass the ball a lot hanging on the perimeter A great job there just putting his head down and getting to the rim Ray knew again This time he lost it Eagles stayed home defensively and it paid off that time You can see the philosophy approached you know just to finish new oneonone cut the water off for everyone else Allow him to go for his numbers and just dont let everyone else get involved Daves to capy Oh ITS PAINT INSIDE COULD NOT FINISH Donaldson at the other end with a hop skip and a jump for two First field goal for Trey Donaldson Hes got three points five rebounds and four assists in the game I dont think hes nearly as aggressive he needs to be the lack of depth from this Miami Hurricane lineup Thats a big bucket for Boston College DJ Hand into double figures for the 19th time in 23 games this season Feel the teetering there Yeah more importantly hes efficient right now cheering Miami throws it away Renu bad pass Lazy pass to Donaldson Reu has gotten it going here to start the second half Hes continue a strong effort here with 19 Can he hold on Here comes Stevens music Boozer and Caleb Wilson And I dont know how many times in that great rivalry has the best player on both teams played in the same position and theyll be matching up against each other But thats going to be I think a great game here in Chapel Hill You think Duke stays undefeated in the league or you think Carolina gets them tonight I dont think they stay undefeated I do think theyll drop a game whether its tonight or another game Decent look for hand but he could not connect And Miamis got the ball on a threepoint lead here at Connie Forum and Chestnut Hill Trey Donaldson in the lane for Miami Ray News on the bench and Henderson was fouled Payne with his hand caught in a cookie jar there picks up his first You can see now what Jay Lucas has to do Ray News out of the game You going to him early now that hes out Ball will be in Trey Hendersons hand a lot And look for with Shelton Henderson and Trey Donaldson Im sorry Theyre going to initiate the offense It was a beautiful pass The lane was wide open and Alunus could not make the catch Thats a lot of spin on that bounce pass there We often tell you guys if you dont see the numbers you dont throw the pass That one maybe should have had a little air under it 16 guys dont like catching passes that low Kapkey too strong off the window there Allen a blur down the floor to Henderson Back to Allen for three His development everyone talks about Shelton Henderson development Allen has just been I think Dante Allen also the last couple of games his minutes have gone up now hes in the starting lineup hes becoming more and more comfortable and not for that wrist injury hand injury early in the year hed be even more comfortable hes been playing really good basketball important shot fore missed it left Henderson downhill Oh youve got to get back and corral him in transition allowing him to play oneonone I think its just given opportunities because if he doesnt score it right there you can do nothing but foul Hurricanes have made their last six field goal attempts Meanwhile PCs gone cold scoring drought north of two minutes Miami a chance to stretch it back to double digits Donaldson pulls up buries the jumper And time out Earl Grant Miami matches its largest lead up 10 Miami starting to figure things out They get stopped Youve got to run back Get your body in front of the basketball You dont do it You dont match up Dante Allen makes him pay Yeah And it starts on the defensive end Theyve been able to get stops and as we talked about quickly transitioning on the offensive end of the floor scoring the last seven field goals here They drop back into that zone Its a foul on Allen applause Three shots coming here for DJ Han Connor Hans been really efficient here in this game Three shots He shot the basketball really well Listen only two shots Has 12 points Didnt hesitate when he got that opportunity applause Wednesday night on the ACC Network I have the privilege of being alongside Dan Bonner and Jim Beheim at Clemson for the Hokes and the Tigers And then Doug Sherman and Scott Williams have the call from Atlanta for the Demon Deacons and the Yellow Jackets Wednesday night Pebble header on the ACC Network Randolph youll be at the dome on Wednesday night Correct I will cheering see Coach Beheims dress dress warm laughter Dont remind me Ive learned from being here It has been particularly Syracusey here in Boston the past couple of days from a snow standpoint No good for Donaldson this time Thats not a good shot there Trey Donaldson Really good defense by Boston College Its currently a feels like 5° here in Chestnut Hill where the snows falling outside Con County Forum Thats why you and I even though youre originally from here you live in North Carolina now Yeah I become a wimpy southerner You and I both my friend You and I both Alvitz passes it up feeds inside OH SHAW called for the foul He had a lot of ball but also some body as Alunas had big ambitions inside for Miami He did If you want him to catch the basketball instead of throwing a bounce pass just throw it up high Definitely on the arm Yeah its a really good challenge there by Aiden Shaw Its a little bit of the arm and got to make him earn it Cant give him the layup cheering And thats why you make the foul there You dont give him a layup He only shoots 41 from the free throw line While we have a moment are you going to make the fans in Boston happy and pick the Patriots to win tomorrow night or are you riding with Seattle Wow cheering Can I get out of Boston before I answer laughter I know who youre going for Not if the snow has anything to say about it Well the Winter Olympics just began too And you you spent time around Milan Cini You of course played in Italy I did There in Verete Italy Maybe 30 40 minutes outside of Milan there Whats whats one thing that folks should know about Milan that you know that people may not realize Depends on what stage of life you laughter go Oh thats a big shot Caleb Stinger maybe Thats what you think All right Eagles back within six Kevin theyre not going anywhere Theyre just too good defensively This is a game of runs and BC will find a way to get back into this game We tick into the fourth quarter of this ball game Oh that looked like a foul on Henderson No call Donald Han ended up on his kester Earl Grant is beside himself He might get teed up and he might be right Three wont go Allen the rebound Momentum for Miami Dante Allen rejected by Forte cheering Well Errol Grant earned that one cuz I thought it was a lot of contact on that possession and the officials didnt fold it Bad pass by Forte Miami gets it back First turnover of the second half for BC Thats their only their fourth turnover this whole game I think thats why theyre in this game But they dont have an ass guy Missed cheering dunk by Renu He thought he was fouled Hand contact cheering We get a whistle which allows us to take breath and go back to this Henderson play But one adjustment Miami has made They put Sheldon Henderson in the post and does a really good job of moving his feet You see that left arm extend a little bit there with Henderson Good thing Earl Grant doesnt cuss cuz thats laughter why I dont think he got a T there He definitely was letting the officials know cheering That awkward hitch for DJ Han has hampered his free throw shooting Its been a lot of conversation about that in the offseason and cheering youre a shooter What does that say to you I it wasnt as bad as it was year ago He didnt do it as much This year he just really seemed to emphasize it and I dont know what he was working on He tends to move it to the top It looks like hes trying to move it more from the middle of his body over to his right side And doesnt do it as much on his jump shot but he really does it a lot on his free throws Hes four of seven at the line four of six from the field BCs leading scoreer with 15 Gnome to Grat to Teimo Malavitz Kay takes the rebound away from Stagger Thats an open look there to Mlovich Hes got to knock that shot down Thats a foul Pretty cheering good defense from Doat up until the foul First on Dovat fifth team foul on Miami And hes playing hard there Got a deflection Just couldnt quite get to it Youre trying to steal minutes with him in the game right now And this is the Miami team now thats these guys are going to have to play And this is where Miamis lack of depth can be a factor If BC can make some shots and get some bounces like right there from Caleb Stinger A heck of a horse shot Yeah looked good Leaving his hand cheering got the lucky bounce Sometimes its better to be lucky than good Renu and one second foul on Capy and Renu over 20 cheering renewed to complete the threepoint play unable to do so Miami 917 at the free throw line 53 Evan theyre only 68 on the year And theyve struggled when theyve had the wrong guys take free throws And Malik Ray knew has been one of the guys who shot nearly 80 all year long He struggled here this afternoon Steagers pass intercepted Second turnover of the half fifth of the game for BC Dante Allen fires Rebound hand BC is going to get in the paint and force Allen and the other wings to knock shot Even Donelsson theyre running them in the help but theyre late to close out They want to control the paint and force Miami to beat shoot threes and thats not what Miami want to do Hastings going at Rayu over the shot blocker Rude who came to help He teases you with his a his ability and athleticism to finish around the rim I mean he gives you everything defensively offensively hes capable turning over both shoulders glimpses of his tantalizing talent and its a pretty consistent picture for Malik Purdue Well these guards of Boston College have got the help on that ball screen Theyre essentially setting a one or a two four ball screen The Boston College guards are not helping Got to give that big man some help Cant allow Renee Malik Return the corner Donald Jr cuts the deficit in half Hes eating up His dad approves Hes got the hot hand for Boston College Only kept he had it going the first half and he has it going here in the second half Hastings the steel cheering Pay leads the break Payne makes it a onepoint game cheering Time out Jay Lucas Ty Forum coming alive It was pit wrestler Jordan Val Boston College softball third baseman Janice Espinosa Stanford womens basketball star NooNoo Aggera The featured athlete special access show begins 9 Eastern Tuesday night right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Under six minutes to play in a onepoint game Malik Reu chested away by Kappy Rayu turns THE CORNER AND MISSED ANOTHER DUNK cheering He has missed two dunks and two layups at the rim here this afternoon and hes done a great job of staying in attack mode but hes got to finish Boston College takes their first lead since it was 109 and is over 20 cheering and applause Danger time for Miami on the road Henderson retakes the lead quickly for the Hurricanes I think Donald Han Jr is going to have to front Shelton Henderson at the post Boston College has shown they are not double teaming anyone in the post Our third and fourth lead changes of the day in the last 30 seconds Final five minutes in Chestnut Hill Dangerous pass Granu read it all the way Theres a lot of length and athleticism on the court Donaldson to the basket When its money time Evan thats theyre going to put the ball in trade on us in the end Are we in the ninth inning yet or is it Were not there This six out save Yeah this is like the middle reliever time right now We hadnt got there yet Seventh eighth inning Kathky too far on the catch the reach and foul on Allen Its the sixth team foul on Miami This is the guy that we thought we were going to get all season long and he struggled early but he is in his bag here this afternoon with 20 points for BC And Trey Donaldson is just doing what he does when the time matters And Miami needs a play to be made Canc scored 20 against Virginia but this is his best game in ACC play this year Six of eight from the floor Four of six from three Still four minutes to go Hand blocked from behind by Henderson but he fights back CAPY GOT IT Great play there applause by Don Han Jr He gets the shot block cheering just finds the open man Ive heard analysts around the country use the word stick tuitiveness That was the case there for Hand Double comes Kick out Donaldson three Answers Big shot Miami cheering Trey Donaldson into double figures with 10 And he quiets the crowd here at Connie cheering Capy inside Hastings with a loud two DC is really passing the ball to each other finding the open man Theyre rewarding their teammates Its unselfish cheering playing What a game as we head down inside of three minutes Anderson count it and one My man Randolph It has become a bar murderer late Back and forth 249 to play This has turned into a riveting back and forth ball game Trey Donaldson nine of his 10 in the second half Hes also got seven rebounds and five assists It was Shelton Henderson who on the attack has a free throw here to reach 20 points cheering He missed it Rebound Kafky poked away It comes to U and Miami Take advantage of this gift of an extra possession Kevin I dont think anything makes a coach matter than giving up an offensive rebound off a free throw particularly when youre playing a team that you know is struggling from the threepoint line Coming down Rayu recognizes it and it rounds out Its another missed opportunity by Malik Rayu Hes getting to the rim How did that not go in Capy inside Ru playing with two fouls can be physical cheering Hand well defended by Henderson and its stolen by Donaldson to threeonone or a oneonone Dante Allen throws it down Miami by five BC has done a great job all afternoon of taking care of the basketball Only five turnovers cheering but that six turnover comes at a critical time when it was a one possession game Now theyre down five Kapi rebound Donaldson Miami will take some air out of the ball here Youre going to get a youre going to get a ball screen here of some type of action with Malik Ray New and Trey Donaldson Its a goto play for the Kings I just think you know you run your ball screen tough and here he comes and let the games begin Donaldson splits the double cheering but he was fouled by Hastings Number four on Jaden Hastings personal foul At the end of the day when youre playing Miami the game is going to come down to this play How do you guard the ball screen With Trey Donison Malik Reu they do it They empty out that side They clear it out for a twoman game And you have to be prepared to defend that play when youre playing the Hurricanes cheering Eight team foul on BC One and one here for Donaldson Hes one of the better free throw shooters for Miami and he calmly converts to make it a sixpoint game Thats why I call him Mariano Rivera baby Its its its were in the bottom of the ninth right now and you got to go to your closer Of course Red Sox fans remember Mariana Rivera coming in game four of the 2004 ALCS Kevin spoken like a true Boston drew the block laughter Bill Miller smacked one up the middle and on opening day next year was cheering your history right now Big shot Boston College needed it Fourpoint game with a minute to go You got extend pressure here You dont have the foul but this is this possession here This is the game Youre BC You got to get a stop because when you get this ball back youll be probably 30 seconds left in this game or 25 seconds left Hes got to get a stop DONALDSON FLIPS IT UTE WITH THE DAGGER JAM NOW if youre Miami you dont want to give up a three you got to get up extend your defense beyond the threepoint line Timeout PC 254 remaining How about that pass from Donaldson Just a great pass by Trey Donson Like I said you just put the ball in his hands and allow him to make plays Here he comes off If youre a guard and you switch and you dont get below Ernest Sudake you better have weak side help They didnt have either Didnt do it right And they paid the price in a critical basket That may be the dagger for Boston College Seventh assist of the game for Donaldson Hes also gotten eight rebounds and 12 points Unless we go to overtime its probably not going to be triple double but hell be fine wrapping it up heading back to sunny South Florida Well in ACC games BC has more often than not been close But uh a couple key mistakes really when Capki got the rebound and then had it smacked away and then the ensuing offensive possession BC Those are two of BCs seven turnovers of the game Evan its just a critical I mean thats been the issue with BC Theyre really close to being a really good team in a sense that they theyre right there Theyre in these moments And like we said I told you the magical number for them is can they get to 70 That just seems to be a number that when youre playing them you feel good when you get above 70 because you know BC is going to struggle to score Sound like Josh Passner a few years ago with Georgia Tech saying over and over again we got to get you know And in todays climate when so many teams are built to be able to score the basketball it forces you to do it And you put too much pressure on your defense against and theyre a really good defensive team as good as any in the ACC Tough shooting day for Fred Payne One of eight from three five of 18 overall Tough for BC and its going to happen right Hes been averaging 20 points a game in the last eight games and he has an off night and thats the problem you have when your team has offensive struggles Hand fouls Henderson personal foul teams ninth team foul for four on DJ and the ninth team foul So one and one here for Henderson Three for five at the line today 58 on the season coming into today for this talented freshman from Houston His nephew is the Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson Sounds like youre taking the Seahawks Uh I think Im going to rely Im going to lean on the defensive front of the Seahawks right now I I think thats where Im going to go Missed free throw and then a lazy dejected foul from DJ Han Thats his fifth Little things becoming big things late for BC as DJ fouls out with 20 points He gave it his all Played really well really efficient took good shots and was rewarded for it Really good offensive game here Hadnt had a lot of help cheering He and Bowden Campy done all they could on the offensive end of the floor to keep BC in it Just not enough help So it looks like Miami is going to get the road win Road wins this year at Wake Forest Notre Dame Syracuse And in 8 seconds here at BC Stager 3 Kapki stick back Yes 23 to go Timeout Boston College in a fivepoint game that and you can simulate it all you want or try to Its just a hard adjustment to make and not many teams have been able to do it Clemson music beats Stanford by two on Wednesday Miami gets it in BC gives the foul with 16 remaining The odds are not in Boston Colleges favor right now Randolph Yeah Ive seen some miracles I dont know if were capable of seeing one up by the opposing team at the free throw line and 1 second left I wonder if Trey Donson has probably been told to make both free throws but if this game was relatively close this is the equivalent of victory formation here for Miami Yeah this was close enough You just tell them to miss it Hurricanes havent beaten BC since January of 2023 Eagles had won the last four in the series a streak that is about to end in 16 seconds BC is going to fall short of 70 barring a last second shot Yeah thats the magical number Eagles have the Bay Area West Coast teams coming here this week Stanford on Wednesday Cal next Saturday cheering and
