cheering Cavaliers in Don Hall to get things started here tonight An American will play manto man Theyll do a lot of switching on the high screen and rolls Heres Ta Ritter This will be a tough matchup for Jones Crosscourt Lewis for three Offensive rebound Hall and hes blocked inside Good job there And now we got a tie up and a jump Its going to be American possession as Wyatt Nadis got the rebound that was tied up Starting five for American How about number 12 there Jeff Sprouse Sprouse is a guy whos going to shoot the three Almost 70 of his field goal attempts are threepoint shots Virginias going to have to find him particularly in transition Sprouse has it now Goes up top here for Julion cheering Hall And on the take and a foul is Tessa Ritter took it in and hes going to get two the starting five for Virginia And how about that defensive and rebounding intensity that theyve had Johan Grunlow has played well Number 17 Grunlo has And hes number 10 the number 10 shot blocker in the NCAA And Grunlow at over 7t tall Ditter is 69 Their size is really going to be a problem for the Eagles of American University tonight Foul was on Matt Mayok for American Mayok an important player for the Eagles Hes a very good threepoint shooter Missed last game with an injury but hes back Hes got that left knee really heavily taped Fight for the offensive rebound and it was the Ritter that got in there and they called another jump and its Virginia possession this time Now we talked about Virginia and their ability on the offensive boards Theyve theyve just about gotten every miss every rebound for every miss Youve been watching this team obviously for a number of years What is the difference with this group that you feel like youve seen you know in the change with ODM as this jumper goes in by later Well its a whole different cast of characters And you know yes they run up and down Yes they score a lot of points but the objective is to just score one more than your opponent Doesnt matter how many you get And this is what American does They really like to shoot threes Theyve had two games in a row where theyve made 14 of them So the Cavaliers are going to have to get out and cover That was Julen Europe Then knocked down the three Tied up here in the early going Minute and a half gone by on the drive Sam Lewis got shut off and a three at the top Thats no good by Thomas Another offensive rebound and a put back for Grunlaw Thomas has not shot the ball well for the Cavaliers so far this season but again their size inside particularly when they shoot that three have long rebounds Its hard to block out Greg Jones trying to go baseline Feeds the cutter and he couldnt finish that time That was Wyatt Nadis cheering Good play there But here come the Cavaliers Thats almost a turnover because he had an easy layup But it wasnt easy because suddenly Grunlows standing there Grunlow gets it back out for Ditter Nice drive for two Had cheering just too much power there You got Grunlow out of Germany The freshman at 7 foot You got Ditter out of Belgium at 69 averaging 15 points a game Ditter Heres a three again for American No good by Greg Jones Long rebound out to Nasus American will shoot the three now 46 of their field goal attempts are threepoint shots And Sadus throws it out of bounds Well Derritter is a big powerful guy and one of his really good skills is ability to get the ball to the basket Now here its typical of Ditter He doesnt do the straight line drive He gets that turn gets that pivot and theres hes just too strong inside for the Eagles 20 plus in five games this season for him Hall gets it back inside Good ball movement here Three ball durator and he knocks it down Well thats just beautiful ball movement Virginia they attack you they get the ball moving they force you back into the lane and then theyve got guys who can knock down those threes Hes already got eight of the 10 points so far for Virginia in this first half but he was only one for eight against Maryland Eightpoint win over Maryland the other night for five wins in a row for the Cavaliers Their only loss was to Butler back on November 23rd 80 to 73 Sprouse frees himself up and he drains a three Thats what he does And you just you just cant leave him alone you go for that fake because he shoots it so well but he really looks for the three As we said almost 80 of his field goal attempts or threepoint attempts And here comes Chance Mallerie in for the first time tonight for Virginia Paul takes a seat also in Okana Onenso and hes the number 15 shot blocker in the NCA The big guys just keep coming right Dan Hes 7 foot Got two sevenfooters 69 in there as well Thats out of bounds Thats going the other way Im going to call offensive foul Push off Push off You got it So Malik Thomas I think is know he might be struggling with his confidence a little bit This is a guy who was fabulous last year at San Francisco and hes struggled a little bit at Virginia Hed really like to get himself going over the last three down in the numbers Average 131 over the last three about just under six American down four with the ball here Timeout coming at the next will be our first of the night Heres Madden Collins for a long three Thats no good Rebound by Mallalerie Now Collins does a lot of things really well and threepoint shooting is not among them unfortunately Lewis in the miss Ritter and the follower doesnt go and American has it And look at this D Ritter the defensive end gets it back Hes fouled cheering and counter basket medical issue right now and has left the game So we certainly wish Leslie all the best Hope hes going to be all right Uh well get an update for you as soon as we can about that Uh but thoughts with Leslie right now and he is out So its just two officials right now officiating this game with Tony Henderson and Roger Harris And the officials prepare for this I sure hope Les is okay But the officials you know they usually work with three but they all train to do it with two and thats the way it was done Thats old school They got two great ones out there so theres no doubt about that Well see what happens here with Virginia on top 13 to six About 5 minutes gone by here in the first half Collins works his way in puts it up and in Collins he took that threepoint shot Thats not the best part of his game The best part of his game is taking the ball to the basket He took it right into traffic and got it up over on Yenso Dan hes their leading scorer at 13 points a game coming off the bench and a whistle and a foul as Thomas goes in Malik Thomas Malik Thomas he has to be aggressive He went to the free throw line almost seven times a game last season only about four times a game this season Of course hed like to have that basket but I think its a really good sign for him to go and attack the basket So Chris Egan has called for the foul for American Here is Thomas at the free throw line and has another coming up right after us here tonight Battle of the Carolinas We go to Chapel Hill Caleb Wilson 12th ranked North Carolina hosting music East Carolina right here on the ACC Network Doug Sherman Terence Osby with a call on that one How about UNCC off to their best start in 17 years Dan Theyre 11 and one right now Caleb Rosa is pretty good at basketball Maybe thats a reason why laughter What about that freshman class I mean there is some I mean overall I should say just in terms of you know youre seeing some here in this game tonight uh in the ACC in general a lot has improved right in terms of the conference some of the great talent around the nation Heres a three ball thats up Thats no good That time by Americans Egan just about everybody from American shoots the three very well Egan is not among them Two of five right now from threepoint range for the Eagles Theyre really trying to pressure the ball Derritter cant be stopped here early 13 points 13 of Virginias 17 Hes just powering his way to the basket And of course who wants to get in front of that when hes driving Three ball Collins That is no good And rebounded by Onenso He is only a 24 shooter from beyond the arc Hes at his best when hes attacking and now unfortunately hes mismatched inside against Der Largest lead of the game here for Virginia trying to add on to it Dwayne Simkins head coach for American jumping up and down on the sideline as this ball goes into the interior and its knocked away Thats a tough pass but on Yenso every once has a tough time catching it in there Just two turnovers so far here for Virginia Four for American Heres Matt Mayok Fade away in and out I got that shot up but it was highly contested and I dont think thats the way American can have some success They need to move the ball They need to move themselves I think they need to try to get open threes Its a third rebound already for Ditter to go along with the 13 points Now in the corner wide open is Hall for three No good And Collins has it Lets see if they get better ball movement on this offensive possession Well the ball cant stick Its got to go from side to side You got to make this defense move And one of the problems is you got Virginias got their two point guards in the game now So they can really put some pressure on the ball Five subs ready to come in Three for American two for Virginia at the next whistle Thats a tough fade away there in the corner by Mayok Americans missed their last four shots from the field and right to work goes Devin Tillis and the Eagles have it Collins out to Mayok Thats a three Thats no good Mallerie has it for the Cavaliers And save there for the moment from Collins And heres Mayo A little bit sloppy play here in both ends of the court Dan each team has played very well defensively And again the problem is Collins has been open for a couple of threes but hes not a good threepoint shooter Game has been played at a very quick pace Yep Five to shoot Collins over Tillis No he needs to try to go by Tillis cheering No points for American over the last three and a half minutes Weve been stuck on 17 to eight here for a while 1120 to go first half on the drive Count it for Mallerie cheering And coach Simkins and American have taken the time out We will return Its Virginia 19 American That white headband to a white stocking cap because he hurt his wrist in the game on that dunk against Maryland that he had And hes out for an indeterminate amount of time They hope to have him back quickly but its he injured the wrist on his nonshooting hand All right So Gertrude whos averaged just about seven minutes a game through eight of the 11 contests this season is out there now A three ball goes up No good by Sprouse for American Also Leslie Jones our third official is back onto the court Came over told us had a little bit of a stinger in his back there Had to head to the locker room for a minute but hes back out there And Virginia taking advantage once again with Gertrude who you just mentioned Comes in scores basket and a foul Thats what you want to do if youre Gertrude Weve only played in eight games Not much of an opportunity but you get in the game you drive right to the basket And thats what Virginia has been doing Weve seen Derritter do it Now we see Gertrude do it Virginia is outscoring American 142 in the lane And thats the way theyve been doing it with offensive rebounds and drives to the basket No doubt 14 foul Its a nine nothing run for Virginia right now as they lead it 22 to8 And theyve done it without the benefit of the threepoint shot Theyve only made one three That was by Ditter Theyve only taken five Americans started two for four Theyre one for their last nine here cheering Theyre getting better ball and player movement on this possession Fade away doesnt go and Tillis has it The shot clocks running down so he had to take that But if youre going to take those contested shots inside youre in trouble applause And Gruno is fouled Already 22 on the board here for UVA and were halfway through the first half How about this stat The 500 games that Tony Bennett coached we know the kind of style they played with 47 games 80 plus Theyve already scored 80 or more in 10 of the first 11 here this season In fact the only game they lost is the only game they didnt score 80 But again a lot has been made about the fact that theyre playing at a faster pace and scoring more points But what Tony Bennetts teams did very effectively is they scored more points than the other team right And so you know they won an awful lot of games You can win the game 60 to 59 just as easily as you can win it 199 But to your point that you talked about earlier with some of the highlights before we tip the ball off Virginia is getting their hands in the passing lane Theyre getting steals Theyre making effort plays Coach ODM talked to us about that before the game tonight Thats a big reason why theyre so successful early as well Well this is a team that likes American that likes to shoot threes In fact the Patriot League is a threepoint shooting league So what Virginias doing is disrupting what theyre theyre trying to accomplish Well I would say they are two for 10 from threepoint range Make it two of 11 And cheering the rebound here by D How about him running the floor at 69 whistle Well okay Running the floor at 69 is fine but you get 69 guys out there who from about half court decide to make bounce passes to the 7 foot guy Thats not a good idea Virginia lucked out there cuz they got a kick ball called So there are advantages to having your 69 guy dribble and there are disadvantages No points for American here in the last 5 minutes and 17 seconds Lewis for three No And thats knocked out But weve got a player down and a foul is called here D going over the back Yep Thats his first Just the second team foul for American Its team foul on Virginia Its their second foul And Le Jones looks like his back is acting up again Yeah Yeah Celeste Jones heading back to the locker room He went back there and the Virginia medical team worked on him and popped his back back into place Yeah So its just Roger and Tony out there right now Roger Tony Henderson our two officials as Virginia in front Theyve had double digit leads in now 10 of their 12 games this season Theyre doing a great job pressuring the ball They are so far forced four turnovers for American inside Another tough shot Thats the other thing too Theyre forcing him into tough contested shouts Brunow Lewis Thompson inside Not a great idea They had to hit a couple of blue jerseys And here comes American Sprouse Three ball Nasis No Tap back out of right into the hands of Greg Jones And now Sprouse for three Thats no good Another offensive rebound American Boy thats not going to make Ryan Od happy Thats twice You had one against five offensive rebounding and the one got the ball for American twice in a row Now getting double team in the corner Shot clock down to two Three ball is up and in by Greg Jones Finally one goes down for America But they moved the ball from side to side They made Virginias defense commit to stopping the play in the lane and that created an open threepoint shooting opportunity And that just stopped the streak of 10 misses in a row by American Three ball the other way Thats off the mark by Mallalerie Out of bounds and its going to go over to American when we come back 754 to play the first half Cavaliers doubling up the Eagles here at home for the Virginia players at prior colleges Virginia 12700 versus American 7 That is incredible Yeah I mean the one player for American is Adrien Samuels who is from Princeton but youre right not here not able to play in this one tonight But yeah the experience for sure much different But you know what Give us this on this one Dan Its you you hear that all the time but its like how about the experience of playing under coach or in his system right You know I mean thats that could be good You know it still takes a little while to to get these guys figured out Well everybodys building their teams and Dwayne Simpkins from American is doing it with freshman and Ryan ODM is doing with transfers American has nine freshman on their roster this season Paul feeds it inside Bruno fights to get it back Does so out of bounds off his knee American possession But again American theres American plays in the Patriot League And in the Patriot League you can get away with that Theres four freshman that dont really see too much of the action I mean Egan is a freshman off the bench Collins of course is their leading scorer number two averaging 13 points a game He comes off the bench Kate Sebastian as well And then theres two that arent here unavailable tonight and Dean Hogan and Carson McDonald whos out for the season with an ACL tear He only played the first four games Nice cut here and the basket by Thomas on the feed from Puro And we mentioned Thomas only shooting 30 from beyond the arc on the year And lots of times when youre struggling from beyond the threepoint arc the simple method is to get closer And Thomas is a guy who you know was an outstanding scorer at San Francisco and they you know he could be an outstanding score here Its a matter of confidence right now cheering You know he led the West Coast Conference in scoring last year Heres Collins Fler got it Thats really a good play because that was up over Bruno and Collins got that shot off so quickly didnt have time to react and now American coming out in his zone Virginia has just punished that cheering getting easy shots against the manto man Four points for Collins here early A wide open three at the top doesnt go down by Ditter Another offensive rebound Hell try it again and that was good applause And this is what I like about Roger Ers One of the best officials in the nation no doubt Getting players together talking to him telling him about what he just saw in that last play without calling foul or doing anything crazy This is really a good job by Hall to get the ball back out And you know Derritter thats like shooting it in practice You know you miss one your manager whos rebounding throws you the ball back and so you shoot another one Thats way too easy Ditter is outscoring American by himself tonight 1613 Well but the interesting thing about this is Virginia you know were talking about all the points that they score here Youre getting a look at Territter uh what hes done tonight but Virginia is only shooting 41 from the field or excuse me 47 from the 14 from beyond music the ark Theyve missed a couple of free throws Foul called here with 605 to play in this first half Its on Lewis Sam Lewis picks up his first for Virginia Theyre up by 14 Theyre up by 14 to fight the fact that they havent shot the three Well there it is Its American But bank that baby in hes got six Lead is 11 Thats the fourth three made by American Theyre four of 15 To your point on the other side Dan UVA two of nine make it three of 10 as hits You know youre in that zone and you just you have to react more quickly out to the shooters We said one of Virginia advantages they got a lot of guys who can shoot the ball and Ditter is one of them the other way once again American not a threepoint try Jones not there Thomas Thomas bumped it Fouled and heading to the free throw line for UVA Back to Ditter for a second Hes got 19 points here tonight The freshman season high so far is 26 Its almost unfair to call him a freshman right You know based on his age and his experience Hes only got two years of eligibility Looking ahead to our final womens basketball double header of 2025 music coming your way on Monday a week from tonight Pittsburgh Notre Dame North Carolina BC Notre Dame leads the series there 37 to4 Theyve won 20 of the last 21 and UNCC and BC Thats a week from tonight here on the ACC Network I just think that bodess well for Virginia Thomas being aggressive trying to take the ball to the basket He can really make a living at the free throw line Hes an outstanding free throw shooter 75 coming into two tonight Largest lead in the night for Virginia with five minutes to go in the first half They are doubling up the Eagles Sadis Sebastian recovers it and throws cheering it away to the UVA bench Im really impressed with the way Hall communicates with his teammates on defense He works really really hard In fact Virginias done a great job the defenders communicating with another when to switch when not to switch when to switch back They have just totally flustered America And again this is a good offensive team They average over 80 points a night Three balls Thats no good Offensive board Mallerie Malleries floater is good applause He is so efficient He just doesnt shoot the ball that much but He really is two of three tonight Hes got four points three boards as well as a broken record here Another threepoint attempt for American to no avail by Sebastian cheering And thats an offensive foul on Lewis Itll be his second tonight Now Virginia trying hard to push the ball in transition Fullcourt press here Cavaliers And this is something that Virginia does They like to pressure the ball particularly when Mallerie is in the game And even if theyre not forcing turnovers theyre causing you to run time off the shot clock before you get into the offensive zone and then they speed you up Thats a great point Heres a three on the way That is off the mark again Lasis and back into the hands of Lewis had a steam a little alioop there from Onenso and hes going to store it anyhow Thats thats the way you got to throw the ball to Onenso You need to throw it up so he can go get it You throw it down below his waist he has a tough time hanging on to it Virginia another run going here Nine nothing Turbe gets the ball in the lane gives the fake and Onenso just looks at him Thats very discouraging Hits a three Feel like its the only way theyre going to stay in this game I mean thats all theyre doing Putting up the threes here Thats nine for him But its hard for them to get close to the basket so they have to take and make threes Fifth threepointer of the night Under three to go Theres Tillis Tis scores it Now thats just a muscle possession Thats not typical of Virginia You dont see their guys dribble the ball that much but there was no help that came and so he was able to muscle his way to the basket Its hard to help against Virginia They got so many guys who can shoot it Sebastian looking for the cutter there And its back out cheering to the top Threepointer off by Mayak Lewis for three Thats why you cant help You know Thomas did such a great job getting the ball to the basket When he gets in the lane they help out on him and leaves the guy wide open and Lewis knocks it down Virginia well on their way to another 80 plus point night here Its 4119 Still two minutes to go in this first half Sebastian Heres Greg Jones with five to shoot A contested three that goes down Wow Paul Lewis Well Lewis coming into this game on the season is only a 21 threepoint shooter Hes been better than that throughout his career Was 44 last year But that was a tough tough shot Six of 21 from threepoint range 21 of their 29 shots have come from the threepointer Still await in immediate time out here with a minute 12 to go We may reach the end of the half before it Here is Mayok and again Eurbe for three Thats no good Nobody there to try and get the offensive rebound out there for American They want a timeout Virginia does And theyll get it with 594 seconds to go Cavaliers well in command here in this one Less than a minute to go Youve seen from Virginia all year long and tonight as well is their ability to move the basketball And this is a perfect illustration You get one screen and then you get another screen and now the music ball starts to move inside out another pass and finally you get a wideopen threepoint shooter Thats why Virginia shoots 40 as a team from beyond the arc because they pass the ball so well And then this guy Tess Ritter so far in this game 19 points seven of nine from the field three of four from threepoint range Also has four rebounds as well And now its Tillis for three And thats no good Offensive rebound Mallerie How many of those does he have Right Does it again Slaughter of these seven foot guys And I think hes got three or four offensive rebounds He has four rebounds in this game Youre right Hes got more offensive rebounds than the big guys And a three goes up and in by Sprouse Well Sprouse we said is an outstanding threepoint shooter And they need a lot more of that Problem for American in this first half They had a drought of 6 minutes and 51 seconds without a field goal Huge reason why lines of 17 make an 18point lead here for Virginia 10 seconds to play first half Ditter trying to cap off his play of the first frame He does on the drive for his 21st point of the night Hes been able to do anything he wants We have reached halftime and its 262 Virginia and a rebounding advantage as well And the second half is underway But the dominance is more than just on the offensive end American has attempted 31 field goals 23 of them from beyond the ark They just cant get anything inside 30 from the field And theres a foul called here as its Chris Egan whos going to head to the free throw line for American And that that disparity there with 23 of your 31 shots being threes is obviously something American addressed at halftime because they went right inside And even though Egan cheering is facing a significant height disadvantage he went right after Grunlo cheering and the first free throw attempt of the night for American here And to Ritter look at this Sean Singleary who cheering had the John Paul Jones Arena record of 23 points in the first half all the way back in 2008 23 and then Ditter tonight with 21 saw a member of the media in the locker room said he had predicted that Ditter was only at 20 points tonight He just said he didnt think he was going to do it in the first half but thats the case Kernow Oh feeds to Cunning to Ritter He couldnt score it and its rebounded by Egan And here come the Eagles Well that was a great great pass I think it might have surprised Der a little bit But boy thats one you got to finish Heres Jones over there Nasis gets hit Takes the contact Scores anyway cheering And again theyre going right to the basket Theyre they average 21 free throw sent attempts a game They only have two tonight Dan you and I were talking about this game last year drastically different It was a comeback needed by Virginia to win that one They won by only five exactly a year ago today on December 22nd But keep in mind that that American team last year tied for the Patriot League regular season championship won the tournament went to the NCA tournament participated in the first four This is a good program Theyre well coached They are really good threepoint shooters even though Virginia has made life difficult for them tonight Excellent inbounds play It goes to St Louis for the easy two You know Virginia just has the kind of size that American cant defend Now Sadis cheering back the other way for two Hes noted as a threepoint shooter but hes got some long arms and knows how to get position inside Malik Thomas little midrange Thats good See again hes struggling from three so get closer Eight points for him here tonight in an 18point game Two minutes gone by Second half Mayok for three Just just a little bit faster than he wants to shoot it Virginia really rotating well defensively Dinner again and I mean nobody picked him up Great screen there 23 Six off of his careerh high and a block inside by Gunwell cheering Thomas fouled on his way in by Egan But Ditter we showed you those halftime highlights Hes just been powering the ball to the basket and thats what he does Grunlo blocks out two guys and he just goes right to the skip And down on the other one were talking about Nadis having really long arms but you got to have much longer arms than that if youre going to try to shoot it over Ditter or excuse me over Grunlow right But Ditter what has impressed me the most about him tonight is how hard he has played Hes really competed Hes competed efficiently and Im telling you they call him tank and you can understand he is a huge guy and if hes driving down the lane I am not going to get in his way So well let me ask you this I mean I mean today freshman coming in I mean freshman right Hes 69 238 I mean sometimes 23 years old right Yes So a little older there obviously but heres a three by Thomas Doesnt go Offensive rebound UVA Back to Thomas Faking on the three Takes it in for two Hes got 11 Hes got 11 And theyre all inside that line You dont have to shoot from beyond that line You get points inside it Jones now for American Hands off for Sprouts And losing the handle is Mayakok Mayak is more of a catch and shoot guy Hes not a guy whos going to create off the dribble And uh do we have a technical foul Yeah I just saw a technical foul assessed to Dwayne Simpkins Yep So the technical on the head coach for American going to be free throws here for Malik Thomas and these officials too as well I mean Roger Ers and Tony Henderson having to do it all tonight cuz their third official Leslie Jones had a back issue and was unable to be out here and he tried to give it a go multiple times So hes back in the locker room So just two officials here tonight and Rogers given the technical there for the Dwayne Simpkins One of two at the line Good Its Virginia ball and they lead it by 23 cheering How do you stop it You just dont Its been his night tonight Sprouse Sprouse tried He did a nice job getting in there but he got there too late If youre going to double team the Ritter you got to get there Get it while hes dribbling the ball Once he picks it up you got no chance Collins is fouled by Thomas Thats his second personal Only the second team foul here in this second half But I think Dwayne Simpkins feels like the Virginia defense has been a little physical and thats why he got that ethical foul and he reacted you know you know like oh finally you called that And he again hes got one tackle Hes got to be careful He doesnt want to spend the rest of his night in the locker right Out to the corner and its a three by Collins It doesnt go and tracking down the rebound on Enzo Another nine nothing run for Virginia Over to Tillis Penetszo FOUL CANT THE BASKET Madden Collins number two who plays for American here tonight star studded Monday night here If youre here that makes it a star Now youre here And here is Collins Speaking of which as he gives it up to Wyatt Nasis as American trails 5931 There have been three separate times that Virginia has been on a nine nothing run in this game as Turb fires a three doesnt go Rebound on four boards for him tonight Hall now Tillis Good rotation to the corner for Gertrude on Yensu for three Running to the heads of Tillis He goes and lays it up and hes going to end up being an assist But again Virginia with pretty good ball movement You prefer it end up with somebody in somebody other on Yenzos hands for a threepoint shot but they still scored Virginia has shot 59 from the field in this game 710 in the second half and on the ends says no thank you as its a 14 to nothing run right now for Virginia as they lead by 30 That was really a nice job by Hall forcing Jones to slow down and allowing on Yenso to just take that step and easily swat it away Thats one thing Virginias done pretty well that is stay in front of the dribbler Theres not a lot of little penetration here cheering Oh that one in I was going to say thats hard to get that over on Yenso but nobody touched that That ball just bounced up Nice roll And the ball got knocked in the hands of Mallerie And here come the Eagles once again now as it was Collins starting the break Eight turnovers for UVA tonight Collins gets bumped up and under Wild Runner doesnt go Tapped around Sebastian came up with it He gets it back in the corner Relocates Its a three and its short Really nice job by Virginia scrambling around And one of the things again we havent seen a lot of dribble penetration by American Virginias just done a nice job cutting that off Lewis behind the back Mallerie scooping to run it cheering He gets in there Youre so worried that hes going to dump the ball to Anzo and he knows that and he just gets all the way to the goal Hes got six Make it eight on four or five from the field Very efficient when hes put him up there And now Collins wants to do a little bit of a roadblock but somehow gets it over on Yenso and doesnt go Tracked in here by Europe Thats when they do get good penetration You got Onenso waiting back there So the crossover by Greg Jones to the hole and its too strong And once again Mallerie on another rebound tonight and a foul Hes done it this way but he also does it offensively here tonight too He just has a great sense of whats going on around him on the basketball court You know he knows if he gets that ball up to the basket on Yenso has great rebounding position So even if he misses it his guys going to get it and dunk it home And its not like hes only doing it here tonight in the rebounding category Dan Hes got five rebounds tonight He averages 46 a game So he just plays hard and he hes a guy who knows you know sometimes the ball just finds a guy and thats not really true The guy usually finds the ball and hes one of those guys Out of St Ans Bellefield School right here in Charlottesville Virginia And the freshman has played a strong game tonight 30point lead Here is Thomas launches from deep Another offensive board The cut back is filled by Bruno And were under 12 minutes to go in the contest Virginias size and their aggressiveness on defense have really been significant factors Very well after a relatively slow start but its their size and their strength that have been the keys to the game Heres Egan and the runner is good And thats what they havent been able to get Don Hall to the corner and a three ball and good by Sam Lewis You know they have really done a nice job moving the ball While their threepoint shooting percentage hadnt been high its been effective Time now to bring in one of Virginias alltime greats one of the best in the nation gold medalist national champion national coach of the year I mean the list goes on Don Staley thanks so much for being here Good to see you Oh thanks for having me All right so you guys got me working on my break Yeah right This is This is supposed to be your time off Uh youre here though as weve got some United College plays uh for American and they honored you here before the game Your number in the Raptors of course Uh what is it like being

a little break They need to decompress But when you got games to play you you youll pull out all the stops You youll put 60 60 65 minutes on the on the clock and say Hey lets practice Lets get some quality time and not quantity 12 and one on the season number three in the country And what how to play point guard That that has to be a big a big help for somebody like that Madden Madden has always

tonight Hes putting on a showcase We We need a little We need a little bit of that on our team laughter Well hes hes shown all night long Mike that I mean he gets going and theres just nobody on the court with the size and strength to stop him And you know Mayok you see him get out of the way That is what I would do I would not get in that guys way Smart He wants he wants a good Christmas break So get on out the way laughter He wants to spend it at home not in a hospital bed Twotime Nate Smith Trophy winner when you played here at Virginia What do you remember from those days I I actually remember going to Final Fours and actually not winning at all like you I mean you we we had some monumental years here at UVA that we dont want to overlook because we did some things that weve never done before in the programs history but you know that elusive uh national championship got away from us um but during my time here the we didnt have JPJ we had UHaul right and it was packed so it was kind of cool to see just the evolution of womens basketball get back to those days in which arenas are filled right right now WELL THATS spoken like a true coach because you remember not winning the national championship as a player even though youve won them as a coach The the losses hurt the most They do They do I dont think people would be able to understand right Unless they were able to be in a position and in your shoes at this kind of level right Because it sounded like the losses are worse than uh the wins you know sometimes right Like youre like thats almost a relief All right we got the win or a loss You were probably up all night What did I What happened in this game How do we get better It It is the losses that stick with you the most but its the losses too that also teach me these lessons So so I didnt know I didnt want to be a coach but when I became a coach it was the losses that drove me not not getting to the final four It was the losses Its understanding you know how how small the margin of error to winning basketball games and to winning championships Talking with Don Staley here We know youre a big Philly uh fan here but more importantly what do the Eagles have to do to get back to the ball here I mean we just have to be us Like I think Jaylen Herds QB1 and Dinners been a big part of that Hes made a couple of threes but for the most part he has bowled his way to the basket Yep he has literally Now let me ask you for Virginia youre up big still seven and a half to go mindset trying to finish this game off and not get sloppy and do what you have to do that has gotten you to this point which is going to be 11 and one Well I mean thats that youve youve said it You dont go you dont get sloppy You finish the game and you know your guys are on the floor Again these are all new guys playing with one another So you have to take every opportunity to try to mesh together So no you dont lift your foot off the gas pedal at all in this particular situation Good way to go into the break here for sure And thats on the inside feed from the top from Mallerie Thats actually a pretty tough catch inside But again the guy is 7 ft tall Throw it up And thats exactly what Mallerie did Virginias gone nine deep here tonight And Jakari White is out who you talked about earlier So I mean this team is built you know trying to make a little bit of a run here I mean the way that they have played and this guy is on the bench at least for a few games Hopefully hell be back sooner rather than later Well he he hurt his wrist He had that big dunk in the Maryland game and he landed very hard and at that point he he hurt his wrist Now its the wrist on its his nonshooting hand Uh and so theyre theyre hoping for the best here They dont know how long hes going to be out but he has been such a key factor White has And theres back were over 80 points again Yeah Here we go Right And look I mean its its a different style We all know that with Tony B and everything that he did I mean incredible You win a national championship It wasnt about scoring 80 plus But right now its been 80 plus in 11 of the 12 games so far this season And the last time theyve had that 80 plus points 10 or more times in a year was 2007208 when they had 11 So its a different type of Virginia team here and theyre certainly making it exciting and theyre going to be 111 here in 5 minutes and 50 seconds averaging 86 and a half points a game as well Its like the most in almost 70 years So I think the fans going to be treated to some fun basketball here as we get into the new year threepointer by Gertrude cheering Theyre trying to get 100 The fans you know yeah theyre theyre excited that you can score 80 points and all that kind of stuff but they dont really care how many points you score as long as you score more points than your opponents and you win the game May tips it back out here for I I think that you find in most places when theres one of those national championship banners hanging from the Raptors that the fans can be fairly demanding Correct You know they they get used to that success and Tony Bennett got them used to that success Well and interesting enough the head coach of the Cavaliers now Ryan ODM who was able to knock off that Virginia team we all know the 16 versus the one back in the day when he was coaching at UNMBC And you fast forward to him now being the coach of Virginia but what a run that hes had right You know from UNMBC and out to Utah State VCU now here at Virginia Well hes a hes a really good young coach and you know thats not necessarily a surprise because his dad was one of the best coaches ever Uh I dont know that you know Ive met a cheering lot of coaches during my time and I have a great deal of respect for all of them but that may be the man who knows more about basketball than anybody Ive ever met And hes very thoughtful about it And I mean before the game today he took Malik Thomas aside to counsel him uh about you know trying to get completely back on track And so this drive continues to hammer it on the inside But you know so Ryan ODM he comes from a great background And Dave ODM who had over 400 wins in his career Well I know hes a great coach Hes one of the alltime great guys right Agreed Wake Forest South Carolina ECU as well Well that Collins that time just forced his way to the basket Gert was trying not to foul him but thats what Collins does really well He uses his speed and his strength and his height to get close to the goal Hes very good driving the ball to the basket on the cut and Onenso is fouled and hell have a pair coming up here with 401 to go Back to the bucket by Gertrude Well Gertridge just he sees the opening and that time he fools Madison Collins That was a great crossover dribble He came back and Collins kept going the other way And on Yenso I said you know he has a tough time catching the ball down low but that was a very difficult pass to handle and he did in traffic One thing about our game coming up theyll be excited There wont be any joined in progress on this one Well be uh live to the top at the start of our next game which is a battle between ECU and UNC the Carolinas We got the Pirates and the Tar Hills 12th ranked Tar Hills who are now 111 on the season and thats their best start in 17 years Thats coming up next And Mike weve talked about how Virginia in the nonconference part of the schedule took care of their business and North Carolina music has done the same thing In fact the ACC teams have done that to a greater extent in this particular nonconference season than they have for a few years After we come back from the timeout well show you a little bit about what the ACC has done this year as opposed to last year because I know everybodys a down year for the ACC Well this year uh much better Um and and to your point when we were talking earlier about the net rankings and how important it is to win these nonconference games early Drive for two here by Sebastian Paul feeds it inside and off the mark that Carter Lang whos in here for UVA now 35 in white and Madden Collins fouled and hell shoot when we come back 325 remaining from Charlottesville And thats so you dont lose position while youre playing in conference play And thats the big improvement for the ACC this year There are a number of teams that have made tremendous improvements in their net ranking And that that will do nothing but help the conference Heres what were talking about Well Miami the biggest mover right Look at that Plus 190 from last year to this year you know Miami just had such a struggle last year And it was one of those things where if you played Miami and you lost the game it would be a disaster Thats not the case this year So a lot of improvement by a lot of teams and that has really helped the conferences outlook And now were going to get into a situation where theyre going to start playing one another Tisles is on the three and a foul on the rebound Now lets explain to the fans here about the net ranking I know theres a lot of factors that make it up but lets discuss it for a moment about you know who you beat you know who you play who you beat how you get to that point I You were talking about offensive efficiency Well the defensive efficiency the net anytime anything is defined using the word algorithm Im Im done with it And thats the net The net is some kind of a complex algorithm but one of the important things about it is your net your offensive efficiency minus your defensive efficiency You can dress that up any way you want to but thats the score So if you beat somebody by 50 points then you you get more credit in the net than if you beat somebody by five points And so its just one of those things where you got to play games you got to win the games Thats the primary factor Well and like you said its points per possession on offense And what do you get off Points per possession on defense Those are one of the big factors that make up the net I know that aggravates some people too because thats why you see a lot of these lopsided scores early in the season you know I mean lets think about here starters just knowing you want to you know you want to score as much as you can Yes absolutely But thats the system we use and everybody knows thats the system we use and you know part of it is secret So thats a little bit frustrating right Youd like to know exactly what you need to do But uh again the the key is to go out and the key is to win the games And if you win by a bigger margin okay thats thats that that works And the margin is big here tonight 87 to 51 to say the least Just over 2 minutes to go in this game But now now everybodys starting conference play You know were were getting after Christmas and so conference play is going to start And so cheering now you know American theyre going to go into the Patriot League and uh you know theyre not going to see any teams in the Patriot League with the size and strength and speed of Virginia And so this is an American team They won the league last year They expect to be contenders this year Theres good teams in the Patriot League Navy is probably the favorite Colgate is always very good Boston University returns four starters That is a good league and American will be very competitive in that league That was Halls first basket of the night in the last possession Now hes got it again here and he goes to the corner and a threepointer is up and in for tree But you know what The net doesnt mean anything to American because theyre not going to the NCA tournament unless they win the Patriot tournament Thats correct And that creates a whole different set of pressures All right So whats next for Virginia here As we got the holiday break coming up theyre going to be 11 and one and Americans going to drop to seven They use it too much really any challenges Just got on and said the cheerleading material has been returned has been returned There you go Thats great Roger hes the best Tony Henderson out there as well with him And we wish Leslie Jones all the best as well as he had to leave the game with a back issue And credit Roger and Tony for doing it uh by themselves here tonight and Virginia with less than a minute to go Were going to thank also uh with us here James
