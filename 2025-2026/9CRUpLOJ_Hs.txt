Assando and RJ Godfrey The opening tip controlled by the home team Boy college basketball is fun this time of year isnt it Oh its going to be a lot of fun tonight Both of these teams are basically manto man cheering Godfrey with a jump hook off the back iron Well defended and the rebound controlled music by South Carolina Dameco starting five and the return of Mei Johnson a year away at Ohio State now the leading scoreer at over 15 per game Miles Study coming in from Vanderbilt and an early look in the post Charlotte Jobs able to connect with the layup Starting five for the Tigers Justin Porter out of Middle Tennessee Dylan Hunter Godfrey spent a year away at Georgia Jake Wallen and Nick Davidson Two nothing Gamecooxs And theres Porter Godfrey off the mark with the left hand Well thats going to be one of the keys for this South Carolina team They must get on the glass especially on the defensive end screaming Both of these times teams will spend a lot of time executing in the half court Touch from Johnson the penetration and the handoff Finally a whistle Free throws coming for Sandico These two teams are so similar when you look at the tail of the tape up and down the line until you get to the last one Rebound margin Clemson better than nine than their opponent a game South Carolina only better two times in a game So thats going to be the key I think for South Carolina They must limit Clemsons second chance opportunities All of you former coaches love to talk about rebounds second chance points how to just make some shots Yeah No no no Come on dude Youre Youre talking to the offensive guy Talk to these coaches What do you have to do to win We have to defend and rebound No you dont Stop saying that You got to make shots Oddly enough these two teams are much better at defending the ark than they are making shots at the ark Porter outside to Hunter 90 seconds in Clemson in search of its first points Hunter off the mark Sand to co skies for the rebound A lot of new faces this year You look at these two teams for Clemson 90 of its scoring from a year ago departing 10 new players coming in via the portal or recruiting Similar vibe at South Carolina Kobe not splashes home the turnaround Yeah the red shirt senior had 12 midweek against the Citadel Been in double figures five times this year Justin Porter sneaks in and still a lead on the basket An 0 for four start for the Tigers Now thats one you got to make Porter would like to have that one back Rivalry game These teams these coaches and players do they get nervous Yes For about 30 seconds Johnson is short from deep and then just play Sometimes its that simple Yes Even though we try to make it more complicated broadcasters certainly do Yes Good help that time Team defense by South Carolina early on Outstanding and a foul applause Veteran officiating crew Ron Groover Ryan Okonnell Joe Lindseay Tonight Lamont Paris year four in Colombia the 2024 SEC coach of the year and giving his instructions as only Lamont Paris can do that tournament music run also two years ago same season in which he was the SEC coach of the year Hunter will feed Godrey and thats a dunk How did that pass get in there That was a tough angled pass First field goal for Clemson comes nearly three minutes in Its been an issue at times this season Their two losses recently against Alabama and BYU Some stagnant stretches of those ball games that cost that team dearly cheering Johnson to study Charm jumps bit out of control outside Johnson Shot clock at five Elijah Strong and Study hit the deck and he was shoved in the process Thatll go against Wall Bradell Youre 16 Thats hard to believe Two years ago a run to the Elite Eight lost to Alabama with a chance to go to the final four and his last victory Markw Weise was number 300 as the headman here in Clemson Quite the accomplishment really Now the dean of coaches longest tenure coach in the ACC Thats hard to believe Sharp jumps inside with a lefthanded finish at 7 to2 Sharp jumps is a mismatch problem because he can play both out on the perimeter and on the inside The Carolina defense is outstanding here in the early going Brad Rell getting set to substitute all five players on the court He doesnt like this start Thats another reason why penetrating sharp jumps Hes got a little bounce to him doesnt he Nine2 If youre on the road and especially if youre on the road for the first time this year thats a great start Porter from deep First triple Nine to five cheering And you get the sense both teams still kind of feeling each other out in this first segment Absolutely Sharp jumps the transfer from Utah His teammate last year Jake Wallen plays for the arch rival now some 2000 mi away here in Tiger Town Of course thats the era we live in right now with the transfer portal Godfrey out of control and a blocking foul called applause Itll be Clemson basketball when we come back A good start A hot start applause in the early going Roy Im always interested who can set the tone And I think here in the early going South Carolinas defense has set the tone Strong rebound by Elijah Strong off the miss after the timeout Grant Pulk on the floor for the first time and the three from the corner That right wing rather from Miles Study He was five of seven from deep last year in this rivalry matchup down in the state capital He loves playing in this game I think him and Mei Johnson both do The runner by Ace Butner who just checked in What does it tell you when a coach substitutes music all five players at the first media timeout Well Brad Brownell talked to us today at shooting round about hes trying to utilize his depth at his as his strength Well the first group had no answers for South Carolina They didnt get great shots So hes kind of searching for better offensive rhythm applause Strong off the mark on the fadeaway The Boston College transfer Chase Thompson on the floor for the first time And heres Zack Foster Thompson top of the key Thats one way to do it Do you think the juices ARE FLOWING A LITTLE BIT Hes from Minnesota I dont know if he understands the nature of the rivalry but hell take the bank shot Hes a catch and shoot guy Hes now four for 11 from deep on the year Johnson double team Strong left wide open I believe that was by design He can make that shot in that time And one of the challenges for South Carolina has been the threepoint shooting applause early going back and forth South Carolina studio as Roy mentioned he was sensational in this game a year ago And then Chase Thompson from the top of the key right in the back of the square Still counts as three any way you do it Isnt that a tough shot to make Like you stood up there and tried to do it Yes you could shoot 20 and not make one Twopoint game Carter Welling with a touch Foster nearly had his pocket picked Gets it back under the basket that shot at the bottom of the backboard and he was fouled Foster is the one guy I think on this squad who can create his own look off the bounce Now he can be really streaky Brad Brownell talking about he hits a lot of home runs but he also strikes out a lot in terms of possessions So for the young freshman the trick will be to eliminate those strikeouts Coming up next right here on ESPN 2 the ESPN app freshman Venom Darren Peterson number 17 Kansas hosting Talson live from the fog Allen Fieldhouse the place to be Roxy Bernstein John Chrisman on the call for that one You told me to keep an eye on Talson We saw Talson a couple of weeks ago down in Orlando and that is a team that was picked to win its conference has an NBA Ford or a potential pro Ford forward shall we say preseason player of the year and they should be an interesting challenge for what Kansas wants to do Were tied at 12 So a seven nothing run and just over a minute ties it up Kobe Knox off the bounce stolen That was Welling Now its Zack Foster and rejected out of bounds will stay on this end Sham but chops able to get in there and Foster remains down applause Theyre going to call the athletic training staff over as well as the head coach Brad Brownell Well an interesting development here with Foster applause and his production Bradell told us today he feels like number five in orange and white is going to be a pro Take another look Its on the landing I believe He immediately grabs that lower leg Baseline is Welling picked up by Walker and a foul called applause earlier on their last possession South Carolina Kobe Knox when you try to dribble and go somewhere Look at all the defenders around him There were three white shirted Tigers Too much traffic When that happens kick the ball out But a Johnson with a touch announced back to Butner Tied at 12 Gamecooxs without a point the last two minutes Thats a three by Carter Welling It just seems like Roy in the Brad Brenell system Bigs can cheering make threes Now I know Welling has struggled a little bit lately but if you cant make a three as a big you dont play for Bradell I think hes shown a clear history that being the case 16 seasons Kobe Knox high ball screen five on the timer Thats a three Gamecooxs track it down in a fresh 20 outside to pull Quick trigger cheering Carter Welling 6 foot wins down in Charleston on the road in Tuscaloosa They were down big They came back grabbed a lead coach and then uh against BYU they led by 20 plus before coughing that advantage up I think that win over Georgia though is going to have a great shelf life come March Clemson 30 in the net 30 in Kemp Outside of Johnson Jordan Butler just checked in Grabs a rebound A sevenfooter transfer from Missou Second season in Colombia South Carolina native Hell get a touch He can shoot the three a little bit Shot clock under 10 Good give and go Oh and Butler couldnt grab it 38 to shoot Yeah Welling got involved there as a help defender Every coaching staff will have a bevy of plays under four on the outunder So you practice this all the time We just talked about Butler from downtown Hes off the mark and the lid now on tight the South Carolina side of the floor and a foul inside Welling was trying to establish himself Gamecock struggling again at the arc just one for eight here in the early going on the year They do make a a lot of threes nine a game but their shooting percentage that ninth the game is sixth best in the league but their threepoint percentage is 14th best Hunter little stop and pop How much confidence is he playing with applause Well you look at his numbers compared this season to his previous three and it truly is night and day Not in the same hemisphere Percentages are up free throw from the field and from three Sharp jumps Lost the handle Now a scrub and they held possession Keep it on this end Tigers Dylan Hunter here now the inbounder and hell make it happen Little wrap around into the paint Plays off two feet Midrange jumper Nothing but bottom Now averaging almost 10 points a game Fivepoint game Nearly halfway through the first Five to shoot Miy Johnson trying to get going Dribbled it right off his shoe tops Hunter was right in his kitchen Johnson hit hard cheering Thatll be the second on sharp jumps up Mark just felt like they both got caught in the air Yes I thought the landing was what really was tough to handle for Johnson because he was airborne and had no way to brace his ball They will take a look at it So the first question that those officials are going to ask is is this excessive Is it a basketball 55 common foul Previous plays under review for a potential flagrant foul Take another look as Johnson attacks He brought his arms down at the review Call stands Common foul Clinton number four will shoot two free throws I thought the foul looked worse than it was It was definitely a foul I agree And I think one of the things that if you want to phrase it this way save charm jumps is that his hands stayed away from the neck head and neck area That may be the quickest review Ive seen this year too which we appreciate Fans here appreciate it Fans watching love that even if he didnt enjoy the outcome The timing isnt a bad thing But a Johnson at the stripe has not missed this season You know what that means laughter I actually looked at it and refused to say it For anybody that doesnt think the announcer jinx isnt real Im here to tell you otherwise Have a 10ear track record of making that happen He was 11 for 11 before that applause One of two Johnson the transfer from UAB cheering I like the fact that this group on the floor for Clemson right now is not giving Carolina any good looks Momentum started to swing about five minutes ago Clemsons run now at 130 in the last four plus minutes And a lot of Gamecock possessions coming down to the end Mei Johnson Corner three by Walker But thats where again the defense is dictating the quality of shot was South Carolinas defense early that set the tone A different vibe in the last six minutes or so Godfrey double teamed Hell go to work applause That is just smashmouth hoops at the rim We talked to him this morning He said Yeah this game feels different He played in it two years ago He won in this building and he said We got to come out strong today Theyve done that Meanwhile South Carolina finally with the bucket The Providence transfer Crease Asandico And Asando is now five of 10 So you must honor him at the arc on the year I mean Lamont Paris got to set up some more plays right now Yes Clemson starting to get comfortable in the middle third of the floor Lead back to seven Our conversations with Lamont Paris today he said simply this Weve got to make shots They were 0 for their first 19 from three Their last time out against the Citadel They ended up winning by 16 He called it the closest 16point victory in his career Study off the mark and its tapped out Itll stay on this end And thats a wide open look by Study But when you look up up and down their lineup now were not seeing Eli Ellis tonight But South Carolina Strongs 26 Ellis 23 Knox 24 Study who is a career 37 threepoint shooter 24 Roy its just hard to win games Eli Ellis who you saw on the South Carolina bench started the shootound today in a boot took it off gave it a go Out with what appears to be an ankle injury Theres a timer now down to four Yeah they missed the entry pass Mei no Clemson a chance to extend its lead and Gotthrey lost it on the way up right off the knee and out of bounds 225 Itll be South Carolina basketball after this One institution It didnt seem like Brad enjoyed the cold water in the celebratory maneuvers there Thats a good feeling though as a coach right I mean theres nothing sweeter But why do you have to wait till 300 to get love like that Well they celebrated him here courtside before tip off The athletic director Graham Nef came out They presented him the basketball Nice ovation from the crowd here Out of the timeout South Carolinas got to find a way to make some buckets A 173 run by Clemson Offense has been stagnant Sandico No Who wants it Weve seen both teams on the deck a couple of times Held ball Go back to the team in Georgia White Again South Carolina executes what they want They get the shot that they want Lamont Paris talked to us today about his team just needs to see some shots go in two from three to start Yeah Feels like their shot selection has been solid He compared it to a round of golf and he said You know what Were better from 10 ft than we are from five in a sense when were two wide open Yeah And it should be easy its not Yeah He said when you have a 10ft putt you dont expect to make that very often but when you have a fiveft putt you get all tense and he kind of feels like his team is shooting a little bit uptight and its spilled over into their defense off the miss high low Godfrey unable to corral it and he fouls Kobe Knox So RJ Godfrey just picked up his second That is textbook high low by Clemson But credit Carolina defensively Knox was in the right place at the right time and challenged Godfrey spent a year at Georgia last year in the SEC You go back to two years ago he was a critical piece for Brad Renault coming off the bench the run to the Elite 8 and he just missed home He said he really has enjoyed coming back and its all smiles today and shoot around just doing simple drills and flex time baseline and Knox was hammered from behind He said that coaching RJ Godfrey is pure joy I dont think Brad says that a ton about a lot of players He loves his guys Yeah but to hear that that definitively Yeah Not in the act of shooting And thatll be the four team foul Good look inside Theres a layup and Elijah Strong the Boston College transfer had his best game last year for the Eagles against Clemson when he scored 14 and grabbed four rebounds Good execution out under flex action kind of a popular play really Whenever you guys talk about flex when I say you guys former coaches analysts that I know and love I always think of something occurring on the baseline Carter Welling jump hook Is that accurate Yes it does Theres a flex cutter on the baseline but its a series of screen the screeners Now when you start the screen the screeners or you help the helper I think thats next level Thats also a next level shot by Miles Study All of a sudden both teams have found a little offensive rhythm Maybe by playing a little quicker Five and a half to go Entertaining start Porter No Mei Johnson off the carum Nowi Johnson wants to get going Hes 0 for two to start and without a point as South Carolinas leading scoreer scored 26 here in this building two years ago Six of 10 from deep and saved by Porter This is a big rotation for Clemson Big in terms of size Size Yes And off the fingertips out of bounds with Nick Davidson Show me the flex cut What are we talking about When the ball comes inbounds keep your eye on 31 black for South Carolina That would be Elijah Strong He passes to the top and gets a screen Its a flex cut along the baseline Excellent execution And South Carolina got a much needed easy two points I feel like I just learned something there Tremendous threepointer Nordon Capich UC San Diego transfer An open look Couldnt connect Davidson He can So now Wellings made a three Davidsons made a three Davidson has struggled at the arc Just four for 18 on the year If this team I think their offense can catch up to their defense Man theyve got a high upside Can I sell you on threepoint differential to start Yes Gamecocks two of 14 cheering and Clemson four of six And you look at the lead now at eight So youre telling me its plus six and threepoint differential Your math is better than mine And excuse me runner falls for Dylan Hunter And a timeout called by the Gamecocks Execution And right now Clemson is getting the better quality shots in this game Nine different Tigers have scored To your point Knox and a nice play out of the timeout drawn up by Lamont Paris move without the basketball Young players go back and watch that play again By the way your teleustrations have gotten better over the years Tremendous job by you or our producer Rick Bagby One of those two Dylan Hunter will probe around for a moment Davidson again an early heat check And the Nevada transfer off the mark Well you see that first one go down All of a sudden the basket looks a little bigger Elijah Strong muscles one up and draws the foul from Carter Welling on his left side of your screen by the Clemson bench Here is Knox Watch him move without the ball Fake the screen Slip Thats just good movement And it happened early in the possess possession I think as possessions go on Clemsons defense gets better South Carolina is a little hesitant to shoot I like that theyve had backtoback possessions where it was quick movement and then it was a quick drive by Strong Was that a ghost screen Well a ghost screen is is better known Thats a slip A ghost screen is usually done on the ball but I could Im very impressed that you asked that question I know our viewers want to know and they also are curious and learning from your basketball knowledge and insight this evening See here in this state a lot of people are still in football mode right You got to be reminded of what happens on the hardwood This is the nature of college sports sometimes in the deep south Foul inside goes against the Gamecooxs Clemson in the bonus for the final 305 And thatll be the third on Strong lead at seven after a fast start by Carolina Well the game last year was sensational You had to love you We did but it went to overtime and Chase Hunter tied it on a fadeaway bank three from the corner and then South Carolina and Colin Murray Boles final five minutes in free basketball Sensational Its a Gamecock team that tried to put a run together at the end of the year They couldnt do it Clemson ended up in the NCA tournament and got upset in the first round by McNees and some guy by the name of Will Wade who was the head coach right then for that program and now in the ACC along Tobacco Road at NC State Sando tough finish in traffic I like the adjustment though Its quicker offense early offense by Carolina Lead down to five Oh heres this middle third again with some contact The late whistle and free throws coming for the Tigers Itll be Carter Welling at the strike This previous South Carolina possession set up by Charam Jumps He attracts defenders The little drop off handoff inside for the easy deuce And then in response Carter Welling down the middle with that nifty catch Thats a tough catch for a big guy I usually dont like bouncing at the big guys but he he gathered that with a high degree of difficulty Welling at the line 73 this season applause Dont forget the most wonderful time of the year rolls on with the IS4s salute to Veterans Bowl Troy music squares off against Cam Cook the nations leading rusher and Jacksonville State That is tonight 9 Eastern on ESPN the ESPN app Good match up between a couple of Alabama schools going toetotoe Lead at six here in Clemson Sharp jumps Coach you get the sense this is a critical 2 and 12 minute stretch for the team currently trailing Grant Pulk has it Shot clock down to three Kobe Knox wanted the foul did get the whistle A lot of contact applause Dylan Hunter THE BOUNCE PASS AND THE DUNK cheering Welling in transition applause That was all set up by great defensive patience by Clemson Welling with eight The lead at eight Miscommunication That should have been a score And a foul insides going to put Hayden Simeon at the free throw line Dylan Hunter in transition attracts the defender Charam Johnson just a step up and then delivers at the right time with the pocket pass and thats an easy finish Theyre going to say O Simeon was not in the act of shooting You agree with that Yes Contact He was not in any kind of motion to shoot cheering Deep three cheering Cleared by Ace Butner whos back on the floor 90 seconds remaining in the first Johnson left open Sharp jumps the spin Gets a bounce A whirling dervish in traffic and a chance for three I talked earlier about hes got a certain bounce to his game Shov Johns this time in transition Watch him though be measured with his dribble Spins at the right time collects absorbs the contact has the and one opportunity Second look same result Spent time at Dayton also at San Francisco Mark hes the first Mongolian citizen to earn a D1 scholarship And you see plays like that you get the sense of what his potential could be like once league play rolls around next month And he can play the point easily at 68 and does a lot of times really He initiates offense Hes got nine points five rebounds And you see the double nickel coming at you running the point You better look out Lead is five Approaching a minute to go Quick trigger Welling Nowhere close And Johnson clears Well all in all South Carolina only trailing by five And its leading scoreer Mei Johnson hasnt made a shot yet Should go two for one Sandico out of control Oh thats an offensive foul applause I think Davidson drew the charge I do like the aggression that South Carolina has played with the last five minutes Asando baseline side He was just way too late Thats an easy call Nice job that time by Davidson to move his feet get into the same path that the dribbler was on Felt like a big exchange there South Carolina had a chance to cut it to a onepossession game Gamecooxs will get it back for at least one more attempt But nifty finish How about the handles Oh my goodness How about the misdirection Shot clock is off 3427 applause cheering and applause Gamecocks got to go Theres Johnson The dump off O Simeon at the buzzer And lets see Joe Lindseay waves it off applause Trying to run one thing Couple of guys trying to run a different set Johnson picked up by Porter Charm jumps really the lone bright spot offensively with nine in the first half Study No And that was a good look Yeah theres nothing wrong with that look Thats a quality look late in the clock Welling off the bounce spots Porter and poked away by Welling Hell be called over the back for the foul Mei Johnson returning to Colombia this year A year away at Ohio State banged up last season only played in 10 games in Columbus And we talked to Mei today He was very excited about this game Excited to be back in the rivalry And at some point Mark you got to think hes going to have something to say about the outcome Hes one of three guys in this game that have made a lot of career threes Skip pass Johnson No Dylan Hunter claims the rebound Now its Davidson The Euro and fouled with a left hand So on the attack two free throws coming for Nick Davidson And Knox will pick up his first foul Theres a lot to like about Nick Davidson as a oneyear transfer coming from Nevada Hes a big who can create He got off to a slow start this year but hes been in double figures five times including 12 against Mercer and they needed a lot of those You just jinxed Davidson at the line the same way that I jinxed Buddy Johnson in the first half So youre saying we were evening Well Im saying the announcer jinx is real and not spectacular if youre fan of the team in orange and white 3527 one of two at the line for Nick Davidson You see a lot of players even in this game that have transferred up a level and for the fans that get impatient where it doesnt happen right away Sometimes it takes an extended period of minutes on the court to make that transformation and adjustment I like the release this time by Asandico here inside Thats what created the space Thats an easy call on the help defense Second on Wall Johnson off the screen A little give and go Asendo rather was hammered on the rim run Joe Lindseay is saying up high was the foul Take another look Yeah I think thats a good call Im not sure Davidson would have landed in the same spot he took off on Remember the law of verticality you must land in the same spot So you you can show your hands and be straight up but if your landing spot is anywhere other than where you took off youre you violated verticality Already in the second half youve given me a paradigm shift and preaching about the law of ver verticality mens college hoops 3529 Asandicos been a spark tonight Hes got eight points five rebounds Lead down to six Porter picked up by Knox Heres the high low You caught it Nearly went in on the lob Sham Johns was slow on the pickup under the baseline or right under the basket I should say on the baseline Appears to be okay Hes being defended by his teammate last year at Utah We see a lot more of this in college basketball dont we Former teammates going toetotoe this time 2000 mi away in a turnover Thatll be the six of the night for Carolina Davidson found a crease Missed the layup Sonico the rebound And you work so hard to get it in there Thats one youve got to make Michi will jump up and shoot that on a right in his hip pocket Johnson force one up and get it back Gamecocks turn it over Team defense I talked about this time the help by Carter Welling He read that play the entire time When youre on defense Roy your body has to be in one spot clears throat but your mind has to be in several spots And thats a great illustration of that His body was in one spot but now hes looking wheres my man Where wheres the ball Wheres the cutter Good job by Welling Its like that in broadcasting as well coach laughter Three minutes in two possession game Pair of emerging teams in the ACC and SEC Ace Buckners been a bright spot Couple of hoops Got a little fearless to him doesnt he Off the bounce His dad did it here in the mid 90s South Carolina born in Dallas Greg Buckner his father now an assistant coach in the NBA And the pass out of bounds Study almost sent it straight to his head coach Buckner gets feet in the paint off the dribble handoff Good hang time See him look that all the way in though So many times when guys drive to the rim and they get banged they tend to lower their head You need to keep your eye on the prize Buger with six from the elbow 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 Now its Hunter Three to shoot Carolinas done a great job of keeping Clemson off the offensive glass Knocks high off the glass 3731 Now Kobe Knox with what you see with his length what hes been able to do defensively at times this year and the numbers over nine points per game Gamecocks to come back and grab the lead Hes going to have to play a role with Mei Johnson not doing it thus far Now its Butner scoops it and Godfrey shoot a couple of free throws when we come back underway Your wife the Hall of Fame merrywise I know is going to be in Kansas City dialed inm and Wisconsin both won on the road in their regional final Pittsburgh has the reigning player of the year in Olivia Babcock and Kentucky has the dynamic duo on the left side and Hudson and Delay Theres a lot to like in that national semifinal You could call volleyball with what Im hearing right now No No applause Mary would roll her eyes so bad right now She could give you some lessons You would be okay Probably help us both out Lead back to eight RJ Godfrieded at the free throw line Hes got six in those two fouls kept him on the bench at the end of the first half Gamecooxs tonight without Eli Ellis the talented freshman guard And Clemson has ruled Zack Foster out for the rest of this game after he went down with a lower body injury in the first 20 And a foul is going to put Strong at the stripe Yeah Godfrieded really didnt commit He was the help defender Went and read the play right but he did just enough to pick up his third foul And he knows what that means I promise Brad Rell already to the bench and hes giving instructions to Dylan Hunter and Godfrey with the three personals Well get a breather It is interesting Godfrey is the leading scoreer for Clemson coming into this game Yes Spent last year at Georgia South Carolinas leading scoreer coming into this game Mei Johnson spent last season at Ohio State Previously they were both at their current schools and the boomerang effect Yes theyre now back and ready to compete for what amounts to be their hometown teams And yet both are leading their teams in scoring that which even gives it a more strange element to it So we did our research on that and its the first time its happened in college hoops since 2022 in the American Conference Porter drains the midrange and Welling was decked in the process I like that because Porter took what the defense gave him And who says the midrange jumper is dead I do Its threes and dunks these days Watch when Porter comes in off the bounce Watch how far back the defense is playing that drop coverage Thats just a good read Thats a good decision by Porter of when to shoot You get the bucket and possession Porter was trying to think about making it a fivepoint possession all by himself Wallain lead is nine Mei Johnson a rebound My question for you is where will the offense come from Its a turnover Butner attacking the rack Butner with the quick hands defensively and then the finish on the other end Hes got eight points tonight This is like a danger zone for South Carolina cheering On Q Knox with the skip pass A fast ball out of bounds and Lamont Paris has seen enough Waiting Seniors have lined up behind us That that is a great time right Thats a great thats a great feeling Yes You complete college Youre done Graduation is coming up without a care in the world See the case when you graduated too right Uh I I dont remember Gamecocks need some buckets My question for you do they have the firepower to get back in this Not unless Mei Johnson starts making some shots Hes so key for them Strong forced that one up Cleared by Wallin applause and contact Thats Elijah Strong Thats going to be his fourth Theyre going to talk about it And it is on Strong Yeah thats a foul Now whats interesting watch this arm that Clemsons player kind of grabs Thats what Strong was complaining about that maybe he got held That was Carter Welling He wanted the lob instead of three Charm jumps able to claim the board Hes been held in check to start the second half too Try to set up a play for Mei Johnson the runner And a foul was called Thats going to put Johnson at the stripe Good look at Strong His four fouls have to go to the bench now But I do like this last play by Johnson If if you cannot get freed up on the perimeter then beat people on the off the bounce Get yourself to the free throw line see the ball go through the net one time First point of the night for South Carolinas leading scoreer this season Dont forget our featured womens college basketball matchup Joyce Edwards number three Gamecock Square music off against South Florida down in sunny Tampa Thats Thursday night ESPN 2 on the ESPN app Our coverage begins at 700 Eastern I would imagine the great Dawn Staley is watching this game tonight and rooting for her team and Lamont Paris to secure a comeback Theyve gotten off to another great start in Colombia The lead down to nine Porter off the screen Carter Welling a couple of monster steps Hell take a tumble Draw the contact Again its that middle third attacking that Clemson is so good in This time its Welling Asando gets beat off the very first bounce from down low Step slow reach in foul Easy call Welling goes back to the free throw line How about the stride there You cover a lot of real estate with two very long steps And Welling at the line 73 this year Well get one more Hes got eight points tonight One of four from the strike Wow Make it one of five And hes a 73 shooter lead down to nine Clemson defensively has put the clamps down thus far You got to shoot that Hol couldnt do it Sando back to the basket against Thompson Bullies his way inside Well Thompson held his ground as best as he could A red shirt junior against the freshman But Asando went away from the rim Power in and contact inside Free throw line extended Go against Pulk Thatll be his second foul When I made the comment you got to shoot that There was a flare screen Every offensive set Roy has a moment when its your turn to shoot And when you turn it down you may not get a second look Gamecooxs turned it on late in a comeback win against the Citadel Different story on the road just three days later More contact and the third ono Yeah I thought Asandico fouled and then he didnt get the whistle so he fouled again Take another look See where the feet are of Welling Hes in the scoring zone as a big Asandico out of position Choppy game is going to put Welling back at the line and Asando with the three fouls Its a long time to shoot the bonus Tigers are there with 1202 to go You told me Welling was one for five Make it one for six Rebound pops out to Hunter But Buckner left open THATS A THREE applause And that is news because Buckner was just 3 for 26 on the year from bonus land applause Lead up to 12 Gamecooxs without a buck in the last four minutes Kobe Knox on the attack Pulk left open and the response Big shot Thats the guy who passed up the shot the previous possession So you like that one in rhythm Feet in the paint kick out Solid offense Gamecooxs with some close losses tough losses of their own up at the Greenbryer Greenbryer Resort West Virginia at the horn trying to rally on the rope Theyre down nine with free throws coming after this And Im sure everybody had on their bingo card tonight Ace Buckner leading scoreer for really both teams if you will Hes got 11 points Only player in this contest Mark in double figures Yeah he was double figures his first three games of the season but none since has really struggled shooting but saw that threepoint shot go in Boy I wanted to mention this Clemson has gone to backtoback NCAA tournaments but theyre trying to do three in a row That would be the first time since they went four in a row back in 2008 through 11 That was the end of the Oliver Pernell era and the beginning of Brad Brownell Thats a travel stud He turns it over 12th of the game for South Carolina Meanwhile Clemson only five turnovers to start this one tonight Ken Pump says theyre the sixth best in the country in turnover rate They do not give the ball away Off the motion Look Porter ripped it away that time from Walker lead at 10 through the wickets Godfrey turns it over Man its just such a hard pass to catch I dont think the shot clock should be at 42 just yet Johnson was just trying to get a three off right there Did you see that He knew the play was whistled dead Hes like Let me try this Let me see what this looks like Dont forget coming up ACC Network has the Miami Hurricanes covered for their college football playoff music first round matchup down at Texas AM Head your way Saturday morning December 20th music 1100 am Eastern ACC Huddle is going to be down there The 1hour preview show During the game well have the Skycast version over on ACC Network The voice of the Canes Joe Zagaki on the call And after the game stick around for all the postgame details with the ACC Huddle Final Score postgame show That is Saturday The playoff my friend is officially here starting Friday night Did they get the playoff teams correct I dont think so I dont want to turn it into a talk show Buckner is going to go back to the free throw line Long story short I would have kept Bama out and put Notre Dame in but I wasnt surprised to see the committee go the opposite way What are your thoughts Youre a football guy all of a sudden Uh I think who you play who you beat where you beat them has to matter That sounds like your basketball lingo Thank you Okay Buckner And of course of course Buckner who has struggled shooting Now hes 76 at the line but Clemson was just 50 before that shot Poor free throw shooting as a former coach Yeah it gets to be contagious Yes Right Because free throw shooting is about two things and two things only Repetitions Do you do the same thing every time Is your shooting form correct every time And the second part confidence applause timeout called 4937 halfway place here in the state before the start of this season And uh we were told that Brads got perhaps a slightly more consistent game than Lamonts They were funny about that werent they I think so Lamont said you know what He can curve the ball when he needs to He could kind of produce that draw if he needs around a tree line or that power fade First of all you dont curve the ball in golf laughter Well I was just in laymans terms I said a slight draw a power fade Thats your lingo Come on Tigers get it back I get the sense though Lamont is pretty good on the green Godfrey thought about it Doesnt have a three this season Now on the low block Back to work In and out I said this in the first half and its really played out Both teams are better at defending the ark than they are shooting at the ark Johnson the runner forced it Walker claims the board and draws the foul So EJ Walker only played in a couple of games this year His third contest tonight And some important minutes and a free throw Check that Two free throws coming Fourth foul on Godfrey as well Hasnt been his night Numeral zero EJ Walker going to the free throw line for just the third time this year Walker Right now Lamont Paris is searching Not for his golf ball No hes searching for a little offense They had about a fiveminute spurt in the tail end of the first 20 where they were pretty good But some of this you have to credit Clemsons defense and Clemsons size I think And the depth also doesnt it have a cumulative effect I would think so Right I like it when you ask me the questions Thats the first time thats happened Couple of free throws Elite down to 10 Nine minutes to go Porter try to sneak it in there from 15 Couldnt do it Make yourself a three Cut it to single digits Another turnover saved by Butner Hes on the move and the finish Buckner has been on fire Hes got 13 applause That is downhill Make it 15 after that hoop And you could feel that coming near midcourt couldnt you And Johnson was fouled Foul was called on Thats his first Well weve talked about the lack of scoring And for number 55 Sharp jumps Nine points in the first 20 without a field goal attempt for the Utah transfer thus far in the second half And the turnovers are starting to mount for Carolina 13 which has led to 16 points by Clemson off those turnovers The one area that I thought South Carolina would really struggle they havent And thats on the glass because second chance points Clemson only has eight Carolina has five Thats not where where the game has been won so far Surprise you at all South Carolinas outrebounded Clemson to this point Yes And trailing by 11 Mei Johnsons been a part of that with seven boards of his own Johnson next A game like this these two fan bases it doesnt have to be pretty You find a way to win it Just want to find a way to grind out a victory if thats what it takes Either side would take one tonight Little start stop by Johnson Lefthanded delivery and his first field goal This is what Im talking about Roy All of a sudden its down to eight And Brad Brownell sensing the same thing that you are a current schools then transferred out for a year then came back to do what theyre doing Last time it happened was in 2022 Random game in the American between Memphis and Tulsa It was Jeriah Horn and Tyler Harris that did the same RJ Godfrey and Mei Johnson are doing for their teams tonight Does that make sense Professor Absolutely Goending little basket interference Crabell told us this morning that because they dont have a goto bucket getter they have to like figure out okay whos playing well whos in the game what can we run Thats that doesnt happen overnight But that was a great half court set and execution Felt like an important possession too after Carolina trim that advantage down to eight Every possession critical down the stretch Sandico almost a no look dish to Johnson and inside couldnt finish numbers five on four Johnson slow to get up WELLING cheering ATTACKING AND FINISHING OH I thought he was going to duck it instead The finger roll late and he made South Carolina pay Clemson had numbers on the play Five five on four And on the play Welling could have settled for the threepoint shot He does not Trailing the play nobody picks him up He attacks draws the contact gets the shot to go for the and one Not an easy finish No And this time he gets the free throw Not an easy finish for a guy 611 240 lbs Its a fourth foul on Assando Lead at 13 cheering Skip pass to Study Sham jumps Now its Johnson to Knox Corner three is all net Knox is one of those guys thats mired in shooting in the 20s from the threepoint line But again its the simple play that Mei Johnson made Approaching six to play Wine and a bump on strong Thatll be his fifth left right Now the BC transfer will see his evening come to a close and not the kind of performance he wanted tonight cheering Four points couple of dimes and a rebound cheering There was some some hard battles down in that high rent district you like to call it under the rack Welling with 11 two of eight at the line Heres the strong reaction I mean you just cant push in the back Thats such an easy call and he knew it applause Last Gamecock lead in this game at 1211 13 minutes to go in the half Capich just checked in the UC San Diego transfer Johnson didnt do it Sharp jumps does Hes off the mark Roy thats wide open Oh yeah And more contact inside on the tug Third on Sharp jumps That transition to high low puts the defender down on the painted area in such a quandry because do you front and risk the throw over Do you play behind and give up position I I think free throw woes continue Yeah I think I know what Clemsons going to work on this coming week in practice How difficult is it to work on free throw shooting because you have to simulate the pressure otherwise Yeah it feels meaningless to me Again applause heres one thing Im a big believer in in practice You got to put people on the line just shooting individual free throws Thats not part of the repetition part Johnson the layup Clemson 13 of 23 from the line if youre keeping score at home Way too easy there Johnson now with eight All of those coming in the second half And Miles Study with a slight shove Easy call for this veteran officiating crew Nobody alive now Carolina last possession Quick burst by Mei Johnson This is the easiest look that he has had this entire game 13 made free throws in 23 attempts Now 14 Roy I I dont know about the games youve done in November and December but Ive talked about with this new emphasis on trying to clean up our game a little bit Players are playing like they practice and you get away with more contact in practice what I call practice fouls That last foul on studio that was just a practice foul One South Carolina would love to have back K put you off the hesitation and a foul called on W Fouled his former teammate Thats his third Im a big believer that our game does need more fouls but the players they have to understand stop fouling Sharp jumps looking for his first points of the second half and hell get the bonus free throw It feels like weve been stuck between eight and 12 points Yes For about the last 30 minutes of game play does it not Yes Back to 10 This is this big lineup that Clemson had some success with earlier Welling 611 Davidson 610 Wallen 610 Well give and go Welling finds away now Carter Welling will that one in cheering and applause Hes got 14 Lead back to 12 Brads asking the crowd to GET IN IT cheering AND they do Knox was bumped by Butner That look says it all doesnt it That doesnt look like a man that just won his 300th game here at Clemson Hes trying to find a way to get a win tonight whether its by one or 25 And it doesnt matter how ugly it is right Hes seven and seven all time against South Carolina but every win you get in a rivalry like this cheering right It means everything in the state to all these fans once down in Columbia down in the low country here in the upstate You just want to find a way to win a game and then youve got bragging rights Yeah I asked him to give himself advice if he could go talk to his first year self and what did he say Find a way to enjoy it more Yeah Good advice from himself to himself Ace Butner has been lights out tonight One point away from his careerh high applause cheering Crowd back in it Johnson collects full head of steam and a great dish inside Back to a 10point game under four to play Heres Dylan Hunter off the bounce The spin and the door remains open cheering Capage for three Well that could have been huge And a foul over the back against Carolina applause Thatll be Sharp and was unable to really do much It shoot around earlier today Did participate They have held him off And Clemson without the services of Zack Foster after he went down with an apparent lower body injury near the end of the first half And one more free throw now for a struggling team at the free throw line and Welling now four of 11 Roy interesting to know Carolina has gone small ball K pitch is the fiveman He can shoot threes So theyve got five players who can all make threes and they need those threes at this point applause Welling with a season high 15 now Sharp jumps swinging around to Johnson Its been hounded all night Capich contact on the hand Hunter cant believe it Gamecocks in the bonus I mentioned this in the first half Normally when we use the term patience in basketball were talking about offense This time its defensive patience or the lack thereof Its the reach in by Hunter Thats an easy call So youve done exactly what you did not want to do and thats put Carolina at the free throw line Capich three of six at the line this season after that make first point of the night Averaged almost 11 points per game for the Big West champions last year Played for the Austrian national team Solid weapon that is yet to develop First year in Colombia and the lead down to nine Yeah he had 15 against Michigan in the first round of the NCAA tournament Game they could have won Still a good team this year by the way Heres Butner baseline And the clean strip of Welling and Johnson is saying he wants the most critical component of that sequence Man I hate closing out the year with a wrong call laughter You still got two minutes I got one more chance later in the month here A little zone First time weve seen it Buckner over the backboard One point away from his careerhigh with 17 points tonight Five rebounds He has been a spark off the bench and one of the difference makers in this game I would be really tempted to spread the floor and drive to the rim Gamecooxs will try to do that Under two and a half to go Still a ninepoint game Knocks for three Cage on the offensive glass Up and in Sevenpoint game 6558 Carolina back to the zone Two three high wings That was a dangerous pass You can feel the tension in this arena on the rise Davidson double team He turns it over A steal by Johnson And I said 23 I think its a 131 They tried to match up out of it Watch out Watch out Johnson for three No And last touched by Clemson Well Johnson had a reasonable look That was a deep triple 136 to go Do you have to have a three here No but it sure would help Knox baseline Poked out of bounds 10 on the timer Keep your eye on Johnson the trigger man So many times it ends back up with him Oh confusion on the inbounds Saved by Welling somehow And Clemson gets possession How did that happen Cich turned his head just as Johnson threw the ball in bounds More trapping zone pressure Shot clock down to seven Happened in a hurry Buckner gets it back Missed twice Yeah no need to shoot the second one Who wants it Capage There was contact and a foul Gamecocks in the double bonus And Dylan Hunter telling Ace Butner red shirt freshman you got to think in those situations that put back Maris should have pulled it out right Correct Correct No question about it And hes been the X factor in the game though No question about that So the plot thickens The lead down to seven Cage back to the line Havent seen him a ton this year averaging less than four points per game Hes got four tonight Hes been perfect at the line so far Now Carolina must go down the floor defensively They cannot play a possession game cheering cheering One of two trap in back court foul in front court Buckner gets it cleanly Cross midcourt Gamecocks electing to play this possession out Down six The dump off to Welling and theres the foul Knox clipped him Boy a lot of time ran off the clock there Yeah you had to foul there Two possession game I just didnt feel like that was the time to play a possession a full possession defensively I would have somehow figured out a way to foul Welling sooner with his struggles at the line tonight Welling back to the line all net Thats a big shot for the confidence and for this capacity crowd here Now Carolina needs a three And with that in mind Lamont Paris brings in P Now this is almost five guards Carter Welling trying to earn a living at the strike Five of 13 Hasnt happened tonight Still the lead at seven Miles Study well short Buckner clears Shot clock is off And that will just about do it I think if Buckner had attacked that Brad Brownell was going to chase him down as you see him grab Buckner right there coaching moments late in games Yes And Buckner a chance to secure his new careerh high here at the line You cannot simulate those either over Christmas Ace Buckner son of Greg applause and cheering one of the alltime greats in a Clemson uniform His dream to play here and against the arch rival tonight You know this has to be a sweet moment cheering a new careerh high game the other way Put back by knock 7 seconds remaining and Buckner ahead to Davidson Thats going to do it Final score cheering 6861
