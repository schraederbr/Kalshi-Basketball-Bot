losing streak They have not lost three in a row all season Can they get off the Schneider tonight Or will Clemson win again here at the Coliseum Theyve won 13 of their last 14 overall including backtoback games out west last week And its an early two nothing lead courtesy of Carter Welling inside And thats what Clemson wants to do Good ball movement They create an opening on the inside And Welling is really good close to the basket And thats the play they worked on the most today and they went right to it right away cheering Can the Hokes get Ben Hammond going tonight Hes their leading scorer in conference play He didnt make a shot on Saturday at NC State Loose ball finds Porter More importantly for Hammond he did not attempt a free throw Virginia Tech has made 59 more free throws than their opponents in ACC play They have to attack again on the interior Gotfrey cant connect Lau with a rebound Okis a ninepoint loss in Raleigh They shot just 26 in the first half Hanssbury had a tough shooting night Hell kick it out for Jaylen Benford And his three is good right in front of Brad Brownell Thats really good ball movement by Virginia Tech You got to get that Clemson defense moving to create some open opportunities Both teams in manto man Only meeting of the regular season between these two teams that have had a lot of good battles through the years Two veteran coaches Mike Young and Brad Brownell Shot clock winding down Godfrey recognizes and scores Thats where hes at his best They like him in the low post Theyll go to him when its important Halftime end of game situation First foul called by Brian OConnell working today with Ron Groover and Michael Greenstein This crew was in Tallahassee last night for Virginias narrow win over Florida State Theres Mike Young Talked earlier today about how he first met Brad Brownell when Brad was an assistant under Jerry Wright at UNC Wilmington Theyve been colleagues and friends for a long time Theyre adversaries competitors again tonight Bedford two for two And Bedford is a guy who can really shoot it from three Hes not hes not a driver you know doesnt get to the free throw line that much but hes pretty good threepoint shooter Clemson doesnt give up that many easy looks Thats not what they do Pretty good defense from LW Hanssburys pass deflected And heres Neo of Dallas found the range a little bit Neo did making his first five shots on Saturday Hes been really struggling though offensively This is his first shot tonight And its not often that he has to go against that kind of size Jake Wallen matching up against him is 610 and Neo at 69 is usually the bigger guy in the guard to guard matchup First turnover is Wallen throws it away looking for Welling What Brad Brownell has done here at Clemson is absolutely remarkable Well heres a guy thats on the hot seat about eight years in a row and I think he finally has gotten off of it the last three or four Excellent coach really good coach really good defensive coach You have to beat their defense to beat Clemson Tigers have won four out of the last five meetings against the Hokes but Brad Brownell is just 11 and 12 in his coaching career against Virginia Tech Hansbury able to track it down amidst the collision Hanssbury for three Now he can shoot it from out there Hes got a pretty good percentage in ACC play but Im just not sure you want him shooting that many Budda Johnson Nick Davidson first Tigers off the bench tonight for Clemson And the bench has been such a huge part of this teams success Dan Look at what they did on the West Coast getting so many points from the second unit Thats just what youre talking about They bring guys in everybody can play everybody can score But again the key is defensively for Clemson And they get inside for easy shots Thats cheering what they do A Dallas flips into the post and then Hansbury throws it away applause Two teams feeling each other out 4 minutes 6 seconds into this Wednesday night showdown to Miami North Carolina as well Meanwhile this Clemson team Brad Brownell thought they played perhaps their best game of the season at Cal on Saturday Made a season high 12 threes A 231 run in the first half Broke that game open and the Bears could really never get back into it Pretty good pass but Davidson could not handle it And Clemson turns it over for the second time Davidson was dribbling it before he caught it Really good pass You got to catch it before you shoot it He was not doing it in that order but again a good entry pass and theyre getting the ball down in low which is what you want to do And all six of their points are inside points and not off fast breaks but theyre passes to the low post counts Gertick got caught out for an illegal screen And Gerick is one of those guys he comes off the bench looking like hes going to foul Yeah I think This is a really good officiating crew so Im not going to get on him right now but I hate I dont like those calls He bumped them a little bit Girdak into the game along with Jaden Shu Didnt take Gak long to pick up the personal Hunter on the drive short Gerak grabs the rebound Van Hammond has it poked away fortuitously find shoot who flips it in for Lauo Bedford to the basket rebound Johnson didnt move Couldnt finish Bedford got away with a jersey tug in the back court Godfrey versus Gach Godfrey wins You know if youre going to give him that much time Jim applause if you dont double him hes really going to score a lot of points down there Hes really good down there against a big 610 Pokei scoring throughout about three minutes now Bedford good drive And Hammonds not going to get credit for anything on that play but he was able to get inside the defense well enough that he broke it down and gave Bedford the opportunity for that lane to drive Its important for Hammond to get a bucket early after going blank in the last game So they they need to try TO GET HIM OH PRETTY SHOT Ace Buckner high off the window off the bench He scored in double figures in four of his last five games He has really been a big factor for the Tigers You make those shots youre going to score in double f also made a three in eight games in a row coming into tonight No one scored for Virginia Tech except for Jaylen Bedford Hes got all eight points matching his output from Saturday in Raleigh And now Toby Low knocks down just his fifth three of the season Thats a huge three for his confidence He does not make a lot of those shots And prior to that shot he was two for 17 in ACC play Loose ball tracked down by Butter Johnson near midcourt Davidson fakes it takes it makes it cheering and applause They have set Jeff coming out of the bench These guys play like starters He comes in and two buckets right away I think thats a huge part of the story for Clemson They have the best depth of anybody in the league Hammond unable to corral it And they also have a really solid defense That was Hammond is trying to force his way inside and thats what he does Hes really good at it But Clemsons just giving him no room in there And hes small going against these Clemson guards Thats its not going to be easy for him tonight And the more the longer it takes for him to get going the harder it will be Gentlemen this is interesting Isaiah Pashas into the game Its his first action since January 7th against Stamford Played 4 minutes 35 seconds against the Cardinal in that early ACC game And here over a month later hes getting some early minutes for Mike Young I think thats just because Virginia Tech is reacting to the fact that Clemson is playing everybody And they are playing everybody Buckner kicks it just off the bench Case Thompson ready to go applause I mean hes been in the game 10 seconds Makes the three Its only his third threepointer in ACC play but he looked like he knew what he was doing Clemsons already got nine points from bench scorers boy And they can they continue to bring size off the bench against Abdales Hanssberry really nowhere to go Looking for daylight Double comes and he finds a way to bank it in Matching Buckner shot at the other end That was a harder shot because that was with his left hand Was it deflected Yes says Michael Greenstein Itll be Clemson ball when we return Tigers with a twopoint lead Theyre also outscoring Virginia Tech 104 in the paint Theyve outscored their opponent in the paint often this year Theyre 181 when they do that Dallas Thomas coming off his best game as a Tiger trying to make an impact too Late shot clock Porter cant bail out Clemson that possession First possession they couldnt get a shot in their in their offense but they made seven of their first 10 They were going to miss eventually Antonio Dorne singledigit minutes in each of his last five ACC games And its getting some early minutes early as Jaden Shoot shows Hokes can score off the bench too He can shoot Hes only made two twopoint field goals in ACC play He comes in to shoot the three Okis four of five from three and they lead by one Well thats why they lead by one Theyve been making those threes They got Dorne reaching in and the Hokes of Virginia Tech This isnt really a situation where they drove and caused the defense to collapse Thats just good movement off the ball by shooting If youre guarding Jaden Shoot youve got to know that thats what hes in there to do is to run around and get a three And you have to put a little more pressure on him than that Buckner finds himself free and buries the triple I mean he has played so well in recent games You go underneath the screen guys like that theyre going to stop and shoot Now nine straight games for Ace Buckner making at least one three Shoot Unable to answer Rebound Welling He didnt have as much time on that play No but its good coaching He made one They ran a play right for him and got him a pretty good shot Welling right at Dorne No good Rebound of Dallas Mike Young told me earlier today of Dallass best strength is his playmaking This time its Pasha making something happen for Antonio Dorne And thats the last thing that Brad Broel wants to see His defense is based on keeping people in front of them off the dribble Buckner not this time Time rebound of Dallas again Pasha and Dorne could not have been featured players on Brad Brownells scouting report getting ready for Virginia Tech tonight Oh nice No look and Dorne has another bucket Dallas made another nice play Thats the playmaking Mike Youngs talking about Really good play Hes made two in a row and as well as Clemsons played and played off the bench theyre behind Brad Brownell takes the timeout Hokes and made Mike Young throwing some guys in off the bench and sending a message We can use our depth too It should be important tonight Nine minutes to play in the half Really good defense again Good shot Davidson on the dive cheering Great offense Well Johnsons a really good threepoint shooter and they attacked him to shoot the three and he passed a really nice cut by Davidson Hammond cheering finds the bucket Thats got to help his confidence He needed that bucket 0 for nine on Saturday but hes been a double figure scorer 16 times He obviously had a 30point game but they got to get in front of that guy Ace Buckner making things happen Well you know Virginia Tech has had some defensive struggles but looks like defense is sort of optional on both ends here early This is more points than Clemson likes to give up in the whole half let alone the first 12 minutes cheering Two teams both shooting north of 60 for the first 12 minutes tonight A Dallas its Hanssbury who finds L Wow Really really good offense from both teams Toby Low coming off a double double 17 and 15 in a loss to the Wolfpack Porter throws up an air ball Davidson keeps it alive but a Johnson short Another hustle play by Nick Davidson And Clemson is not a great offensive rebounding team So nice play by Davidson Couple of offensive rebounds Davidson made it happen Finishes the possession for the layup applause and cheering Thats just a great job by Godfrey to see the double team and find the open gap Davidsons four for four eight points in six minutes off the bench of Dallas turns the corner and banks it in Clemson suddenly is really having a hard time guarding the Virginia Tech dribbler off the screen Meanwhile at this end the Hokes are having a tough time slowing down Davidson but I think he stepped out of bounds Virginia Tech battling this top 20 team SMU UNCC at 6 Georgia Tech Clemson at 8 womens hoops double header tomorrow Uh weve seen a lot of really good offense so far gentlemen What are you What are you looking at out there Really really good offense Both teams are more than you would ever expect coming into Clemson cheering Virginia Tech shooting 68 Toby Lwal unable to finish this time cheering Dont Virginia Tech made nine of their previous 10 shots and that was a really good one Lal just couldnt bring it down or catch it up there Hes not going to bring it down Had a really good play out of the timeout really good You feel good about it as a coach Even if it doesnt work out ultimately cheering it doesnt If it doesnt go in its a bad play Thats the way Welling ties it for the Tigers of Dallas Another nice pass and another missed layup And again Welling he gets caught in the middle He doesnt really help on the screen and he doesnt really get back to his guy They really dodged a bullet there Couple missed shots but Virginia Tech continues to carve up this Clemson defense these last 8 n minutes Godfrey and Welling traveled I think Welling was surprised by the pass He thought God was going to shoot it Dallas has got two assists He should have two more should have force right Making really good plays and reads getting layups for guys Brown now looks a little frustrated with his teams defense right now Well and I see Davidsons back in the game and Welling is out Hes really irritated I think with Welling again You go with one guy or the other but the worst thing you can do is play in the middle and thats what hes doing on those screens Well the reason the starters are stars is because their defense and the second team might be able to score but their defense isnt going to be as good as the starters Hammond feeds Hansbury Dallas to Bedford with four Bedford Nice move applause Dallas passed one up I thought Yeah Buckner looking inside Davidson you cant leave a guy there I mean he rolled it in but I mean hes three ft from the basket You cant run away from him Davidsons five for five 10 points off the bench of Dallas Apparently Davidson was straight up Hansbury keeps it alive though Bedford they dont call the contact on the potential screaming charge and Low knocks down the three to the dismay of Brad Brownell And on the Clemson fans theres a lot of contact both ways on that possession That can go either way that call They dont call charges anymore They dont No they dont like to I dont like them either I would just assume they didnt call BUCKNER WAS PUT THAT AND HE THROWS IT IN WOW WERE SEEING some offense from him tonight applause So wild sequence here Bedford knew he was creating contact but they dont blow the whistle Lau makes a three And we got an even better highlight at the other end Playing defense Dont foul We used to have scrimmages and score 50 60 points and there be no foul Nobody was playing defense applause So Buckner has 10 off the bench So does Davidson Those two guys are a combined nine for 10 from the floor 23 bench points already for the Tigers Edford too cheering and applause strong that time Rebound for Clemsons Buckner But that was a much better job that time guarding that screen But in reality Virginia Techs missed two easy layups And that was a little bit of a layup right there Low rebounds The miss Well youre not going to go up over Low to get a rebound And a whistle on Buckner who had Hansbury hog tied inside First on ace Thats the second team foul on Clemson and we played more than 17 minutes Yeah only three team fouls on Virginia Tech Well I think theres going to be a lot of fouls in the second half It usually works out that way when they dont call many in the first They start maybe just give the teams credit Bedford hit from behind and thats going to be a chance for three Boy Brad Brownell you can see him walking along the sideline He is very frustrated with the way his defense is played Look there have been a lot of questions about coming back from the West Coast where teams have struggled in this situation Well this is that time Thompson just got lost on the screen I mean you cant let a guy run like that to the basket on an underneath out of bounds You got to help your teammate It Its not uncommon for Clemson to hold an early shoot around They they they shut around at 700 am this morning which is 400 am Pacific time I mean thats early to have shoot around Jim I gave you a lot of credit for waking up and joining as a shoot around this I had two hours sleep I made it I I dont know if I remember much but laughter I I was in I was present Its what the Tigers do often when theyre at home literally before sunrise Theyre in the gym Hansbury the rebound Hokes by one Already 13 lead changes in this game Betford has a dozen points in the half Now one thing that Clemson does very well is they guard dribble penetration and Virginia Tech is just going anywhere they want to anytime they want to Bakers dozen from Bedford Hes got 13 Clemsons cooling off a little bit now Porter flips it in Davidson comes up short Another rebound Hansbury almost threw it away Clemson they like to go inside and with Godfrey on the bench its harder to do Jaylen Bedford is not the guy to leave open He is white hot right now and hes got 16 in the half I mean and just like that Virginia Tech jumped to a sixpoint lead Eight nothing run in the last 75 seconds for the Hokes Hooks look real sharp on both ends of the court Yeah I mean theyre shakes ahead They just missed three layups Davidson nobody stopped him He got there without dribbling but Im not sure how cheering Well they dont call walks anymore Oh yeah Thats true Guys no fouls no walks A lot of offense though Pokey shooting 60 right now Bedford Nice extra pass to Hammond but he cant make him pay for leaving him open And Lau taps it out of bounds Well Virginia Tech they missed that time cuz Clemsons defense reacted very well But here Bedford is just able to get past his man out on the perimeter And then once again Clemson doesnt find everybody Easy shots And you dont get these kind of shots coming down here to Clemson very often Well Virginia Tech entered tonight knowing that they would be favored in their three home games and underdogs in their final three final four row games and going three and four down the stretch would not be enough for the Hokes barring a big run in Charlotte at the tournament So this is a team that I think understands the challenge in front of them and what they need to do to prove that they belong in the dance Timeout Mike Young with 10 seconds left in the half Says Use it or lose it time out High after their West Coast trip No no other ACC coaches have any complaints about that though Hokes are fouled Plenty of fouls to give Johnson picks it up with 75 remaining I I Clemson is deep enough that I guess they can do that I just I dont like the idea of giving away fouls Well if youre not in the first half if youre deep you can do it And they dont get a shot theoretically Dallas gives Hanssbury for three IT GOES FOUL AGAIN THOUGH Virginia Tech with a brilliant first half Seven of 11 from three and a sevenpoint This is uncharacteristic Blame it on whatever you want to but their defense just is not what it standard is Tigers 27 and3 in their last 30 games at Little John All three of those losses were in overtime including to NC State earlier this season Theyre 111 at home this year And the Hokes turn it over on their opening possession in the second half Well we had one of those losses last year so they may not like us if they lose this one Welling going to work on Low with a left hand cheering applause When Welling he scored two baskets in the first half but he was not very good on the defensive end He had company a Dallas fouled by Hunter Well this is what Welling is able to do And this is what Clemson did early in the game You get the ball inside and even against a shot blocker like Toby Lwal He uses his body so well and that left hand that he can score in there One of the things you see Evan here early is a change in the lineup for Clemson Wallen is out Theyre playing with three guards now See if that pays dividends for Brad Brownells Tigers Shot clock winding down Hammond forced to create late Loose ball on the deck Hanssbury comes up with it of Dallas on the reload cheering Tigers dodge a bullet there applause Hunter going around of Dallas Pulls it back outside for Buckner to the basket and cheering one applause He scores He is looking to score when he gets the ball and he feels that contact and gets the ball up immediately Hes really good at that all screw down anymore Brad Brownella said hes not surprised by ACs emergence Said hes an extremely hard worker extremely competitive cheering Four minutes and hes ready to handle it Well he was hurt last year and so they expected some good play from him last year and he just was hurt Five straight for the Tigers to start the second half of Dallas Porter has not scored yet tonight and he has taken some tough shots Only three of them but I think theyve all been tough shots Two of them were air balls Im Dallas with a pass to nobody Well it was a pass to Hunter and he was open Nobody on his team Yes good good point Lau fouled Godfrey inside Number one on Toby Now Brad Brownell went to the smaller lineup because he was hoping that he could get better defense out on the perimeter and Abdales just goes right by Did you guys notice Michael Greenstein the official He thought about it He lifted his arm up in the air and didnt blow the whistle Not a foul Didnt rise to the level Heres heres Clemson backing in again Welling with a right hand this time and its a late whistle on LW And Mike Young whos lost his jacket does not like the call Well in fairness to Mike Young he took that jacket off at halftime Yes Well Welling again he gets the ball inside and if youre not going to help hes going to take a shot and that time Lal just moved underneath it Mike Young takes his jacket off right away Most most games hes not going to be wearing that jacket much and yet he still believes in the suit and tie Yeah that many coaches have issued since co in and out on the first for Welling Coming up next second game of our ACC double header Well get you to Mccameish Pavilion in Atlanta Georgia Tech hosting Wake Forest Also available on the ESPN app Doug Sherman and Scott Williams on the call tonight in Atlanta I was happy when we went to the warmups Im surprised the announcement things going that way applause Well weve never had that Weve never had that option No I know I know Jim I think you got the clout If you just want to show up in a turtleneck one day I dont know if anyones going to say anything Probably say goodbye Were not going to Timeout Clemson cheering Dylan Hunter with a good hustle to cover up the loose ball Should know something about college basketball And usually if you win two road games in a week 3000 mi away from home and youre 20 and four you rise up in the poll Clemson 20 last week they stayed number 20 this week Theyre underrated Yeah a little bit It depends who you are If North Carolina did that theyd move up Its just the way it works Are you saying that brand name schools are treated differently Yeah no doubt about it Absolutely Now Clemson theyve they got theyve gotten on a little bit of a roll here but Welling is you know hes an 18 threepoint shooter in conference play Im not sure that they wouldnt rather have him shooting close to the basket What have yall noticed from Clemson defensively these first three minutes here in the second half Well theyve done a much better job staying in front of dribblers Been a relatively quiet night again for Ben Hammond 0 for nine on Saturday at State Just one for three Two points so far tonight Hanssbury kicks it Hammond corner jumper is good Thats a three And thats where Virginia Tech has gotten a lot of their offense getting inside drawing the defense and then kicking it out for a jump shot Welling pass inside bounced right to Bedford and he comes up with a steal Now Godfrey couldnt handle that one That actually looked like a fairly good entry pass Hammond feeling confident now See you turn it over like that and that gives Hammond the chance to get out in transition and he likes to attack This is the largest lead of the night for the Hokes The tug on Hanssbury inside on Godfrey of Hammond I mean him getting going is huge Hes been a big time player Hes had 20 several times this year He gets going that makes a big difference for this team I mean hes coming off a zero point game You know they cant have that from a guy like him Wells going to try it again Well you know theres a reason hes open Yeah in conference play Coming into this game he was three for 17 from out there 0 for two so far tonight from beyond the ark Some guys should not shoot threes Thats the way it is Clemson just two for seven from cheering deep as a team Remember they made a season high 20 on Sat or 12 on Saturday at Cal Our next ACC Network gymnastics meet is Sunday afternoon Number 14 Clemson squares off against Pit at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse Coverage begins at 4 Eastern Like everything else also available on the ESPN app Hooks by 10 here at Clemson Moving screen Don Godfrey Sometimes Clemson struggles to score and Godfrieded he puts both arms out there you know Yeah I mean the the first half Clemson was really good offensively Theyre not like that all the time No And Virginia Techs capable of scoring So there has to be some improvement in the defensive end for Clemson tonight Hope hes on a 70 run to stretch the lead to 10 Makes a tough catch gets it back outside for Lauo and then he loses it and Davidson able to scoop it up for Godfrey That was a really good stop that they needed applause On the drive rejected by Lau but a foul called and free throws coming for Dylan Hunter They got Gerick Gerick just hes one of those guys that draws whistles Well hes around the ball Hes a Theyre going to call something on him Hes big They dont like big guys You know that laughter they pick on big slow guys Did you guys hear what Luke L did last night at Tallahassee I did not To try to create an atmosphere I did not They got Virginia in town and he wanted the fans to show up So he promised to buy 500 beers for the first 500 students 21 and over that came inside the Tucker Center last night Had an idea I guarantee you they all came too for a beer He said he gave his credit card and didnt know how much it was going to cost And they did have a good atmosphere and they were ahead of Ryan ODMs Cavaliers most of the night Well until uh a guy who hadnt made any threes started making threes all of a sudden for Virginia Thats right They win the game That is the first point of this game for Dylan Hunter and Justin Porter hasnt scored and Jake Wallen hasnt scored So you know we talk a lot about the Clemson bench and its a good one but they got to get some contribution from their starters The bench was so good they just let him play in the first half 10 to shoot for the Hokes Hanssberry with a left hand shoots guys in for the offensive board Hammond connects Big difference with that guy What a difference He makes these shots last week They probably win Im I have been impressed with his patience and his I mean hes been relentless but he hasnt forced anything Jaden shoots offensive rebound creates the second chance bucket Davidson responds Big shot and Jaden shoot offensive rebound Thats something that you dont see very often Thats his third offensive rebound in ACC play Just the third threepointer of the night for Clemson right there Davidson with 15 off the bench Clemson fans at Little John making some noise The clock winding down Hammond throws up an air ball screaming He was just seeing if he really WAS THAT HOT That may have been Clemsons best defensive possession maybe of the night but certainly since early in the game They havent had a lot Its not like you could point to a lot of different ones And Virginia Tech you know their defense has been maligned here recently but theyve actually performed pretty well down on this end Hokes have battled from the opening tip here tonight Davidsona juggles the rebound but hangs on and keeps it in bounds Well one thing that happens when youre at home you start thinking about the pressure a little bit You havent lost much at home and now youre down nine points So its theres a little mountain here to climb of he just you know about as good a player he is European players always can shoot and he is not a good threepoint shooter hes in the 20s he is foul on Godfrey in the rebound action so it stays right here well you force a shot like this by a guy whos struggling to shoot it and Godfrey he just grabs on that I mean thats the official looking right at that and sees Godfrey grabbed Dornes arm Two fouls on Godfrey Pasha turns it over applause Wallen back to Davidson Fouled by Dorne applause But talking about the Clemson defense and the Pasha just loses control of the ball But thats what you need You need a turnover and then you got to go down and convert it and that I mean they threw the ball inside to Davidson but thats a tough spot to put him in Hes fortunate to draw the foul You throw it in there against the seven foot guys Second foul on Dorne cheering Davidson makes the first Tomorrow night 10 Eastern after the womens basketball double header Nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and the look ahead of the best matchups on the schedule for the upcoming weekend Weve got you covered all season right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app One of the things happens when you play a lot of guys you sometimes look and say Now why did I play that guy that laughter long this guy You know when you play seven guys you just play seven guys you dont have to worry about it There havent been a lot of free throws in the game but Clemsons missed a couple now Five of eight Dallas just four points and two of six shooting looking for his offense here against Welling and hes called for the offensive foul Well that arm came up and got Walling in the face That flagrant foul is contact that is excessive andor unnecessary And it did snap his head back but it was just part of a regular play in a basketball game And I thought you know I would have had no objection to calling that a flagrant foul but I can see what their reasoning is They knew what I said so they went opposite Thats what I think they did too Justin Porter for three And that is a huge basket for Clemson Not only that its a three but its from Porter And those are his first three points of the game See if that gets him going Tigers have trailed by as many as 10 or by as many as 12 Back to a fivepoint game Odales lost it but he was fouled on the way to the bucket And thats a really good play by Odales recognizing hes got a smaller man against him and trying to take him to the basket But we talked about the fact that Hunter and Porter have really been struggling And here Porter hes pretty good threepoint shooter Thats the first one hes been able to score That was a big basket for him This Abdales again hes got the smaller man on him Hunter and Hunter just reaches in and knocks the ball away The officials are never going to let him get away with that Whether he got it or not thats going to be a problem Abdales five of six from the field on Saturday at state The cheering previous three games before that he was 5 for 31 He was really struggling His shooting is not the level it needs to be to be what he wants to be I think a lottery pick hes got to improve his shooting When he had the 33point game early in the season against Providence when he looked like the second coming of Luca out there in a hokey jersey Be careful there Sevenpoint lead for Virginia Tech Porter rebound Hansberry Thats another tough shot cheering Bedford had 16 in the first half and hes blocked on this drive Davidson gets it to the outlet Buckner in Porter better look Willing the rebound screaming and hes down and holding his left ankle He turned his ankle like that Carter welling down in pain for the Clemson Tigers after the stick back with 1051 to go in the game And weve talked about Clemsons depth but I I mean they they blend so well together You really cant afford injuries to anybody Thats a foul Rob And the key here for Clemson at the moment is that Welling is battling inside gets that offensive rebound and then as he comes down I think he must step on Lwals foot there and turn that ankle back on his feet Clemsons depth is going to help now They have big guys And Brad Brownell mentioned earlier today when we chatted before the sunrise this morning at shoot around that was at 700 Its not like it was before the sunrise The sun was pretty close We we came to shoot around when it was still dark It was dark Uh he he talked about how theres not much of a drop off from his starting big guys to his backup big guys And you think thats an advantage compared to other teams They can withstand one guy getting in foul trouble Now obviously they dont want to lose Welling for any extended period of time and they lose that advantage Its been a while since Virginia Tech scored but they still have a fivepoint lead Bedford to Hansberry power dribble slam Really good offense Clemson was really digging in really playing defense and they still got Mike Young is a very very good offensive coach Lets not forget that And theyve always run good stuff Of course when Mike was the coach at Wford in Spartanberg here in South Carolina he ran great stuff too And 30 years in the upstate and one cheering thats where they go late Thats where theyre going to go the last 10 minutes Theyre going to try to go to Godfrey Hes very hard to play And Virginia Techs pretty good defensively there Godfrey just does a great job getting position And Clemson does a great job find him How many times do you see a big guy work hard get position and then nobody sees him They look for him Godfrey had four points early Its his first basket in a while Another missed free throw for the Tigers Well youre trying to mount a comeback You just you got to take advantage of free opportunities into the fourth quarter of this game cheering Hammond like a whirling dervish knocks down the three He has been so solid The shot looks its kind of a knuckler but it goes in big bounceback game after going over on Saturday just like the Hokes expected from him And now the steel Hammond leads the break Little hesitation Contact but no whistle and its Clemson ball Really good call No call Well just drives everybody off with that dribble And again hes he has done such a great job being patient And that was another example of his patience He really made a good play trying to go to the basket there but they just he just did not get it Mike Young is going to challenge this You know Dan as a coach every possession theres no question about that Sometimes as an announcer I dont I I agree with as a coach I never would Coaches have better next play mentality than a lot of broadcasters though Porter was fouled and hell get two at the line for the Tigers In conference play Porters an 87 freepoint shooter Thats just a good hesitation dribble there Everybody backed away and Porters really struggled scoring close to the goal Three years at Middle Tennessee State now a grad student from Clemson applause I think Coach Darnell has tried to go with his more of his starters with a I mean obviously hes still playing a couple guys but not playing as many to try to solidify his defense get his defense back has played his his usually plays three bigger guys and two smaller guys and hes switched that around Hes playing the two big guys with three guards in the entire second half cheering to try to straighten things out defensively Jim as a coach you try to give equal weight to every game but but for Clemson they got Duke coming up Saturday We saw the let down from Carolina last night Miami This is real The players know whos next I I just I music dont think thats a factor in this game at all Once youre in the game youre not thinking about Duke Edford high off the window His contribution has been really really significant for the Hokes These are big baskets When youre in a sixpoint game and you dont score it can be a four Its a big basket And the crowd is going crazy First points of the second half for Bedford Hes got 18 on the night Hanssbury smacks it into the Clemson bench Excuse me 20 points now for Bedford And this is not an easy shot I mean he gets he goes way up on the board there No thats a Steph Curry shot Thats not an shot Four points for Jaylen here in the second half Wait its 16 in the first half Buckner Beautiful And Buckner had a big first half and thats the first weve heard of him in the second half We got a good one coming down the stretch here folks Virginia Tech has had trouble closing games Dont forget that Hoke fans certainly remember Toby Lew will get to the line here Its like a desperate team cheering And at 16 and 8 five and six they are a couple shots away from being 19 and five 8 and three Well they had Stanford completely be and then somebody hit a half court shot I dont know if so you know its crazy Nate Cali hit a buzzer beater in a game that Virginia Tech played miserably in and still had a chance to win late a loss that has not aged well against a Wake Forest team thats really struggling Two consecutive bad passes trying to throw it into transition Lau throws it down And what a great response by Virginia Tech The crowds into it Looks like Clemsons back You know they cut it to five and then Virginia Tech just makes a couple of buckets Its been a night of great responses from the Hokes Another strong board for Toby Lw Weve talked about Hammond Hes got 13 points and 11 of those in the second half And there he goes again And thats what he does really well He attacks the basket And thats thats just a poor pass You know Godfrey didnt have position and that allows the Hokes to get out and go One bit of good news for the Tigers Carter Welling is at the scorers table ready to check back in after he hurt his ankle a little while ago And lets not forget and and and Hansbury both are good low post defenders Godfrey is really good but hes a little on the small side and theyre getting around him and theyre not letting him get it in there deep Well he got it in there deep the first two plays of the game and only once since then And the Hookies are theyre knocking down their free throws This is way past the danger zone for Clemson They are not good at scoring a lot of points Godfrey around Hansbury Missed it Offensive rebound Welling right back off the bench He scores applause Now this is a situation where if Clemson is going to come back and win this game theyve got to create some turnovers on this end of the court so they can get some easy baskets on the other Deflected by the Tigers out of bounds but that was a kick ball so theyre going to reset it And Welling comes back in the game Looked like no problem there Virginia Tech was playing such good offense Its just hard to think to the punches going to just shut them down Hammond gets his balance and goes to work of Dallas Tough turn around and he traveled before the shot applause He just doesnt look totally comfortable out there right now Well hes hes struggling scoring Hes making good plays Hes made some really good passes and a couple of layups they missed or he would have had six or seven assists Now thats a turnover And so you dont want to turn the ball over but again you get a chance to get back and set your defense 10th Hokei turnover on the night First nine have led to 11 Clemson points Yeah but not easy points Welling ankle looks okay Thats not a play you want to make when your ankles a little sore Well the question is why would you get out and jump at Welling as a threepoint shooter And thats what Gertig did And that allowed Welling to put it down and go past him Probably because hes a freshman Probably Number three on Ammani Hanssbury Hanssbury the only Hokei with three Godfrey the only Tiger with three with 605 to play applause This going to be a very interesting final six minutes for both teams Can Virginia Tech close it out Can Clemson find their offense down the stretch Whats interesting its a situation where Virginia Tech you know they need to close it out on the offensive end You know as long as they can score it doesnt really matter what Clemson does on the on their offensive end They learn from their mistakes in late game situations last month Miss cheering from Bedford Rebound Godfrey applause 11 finish Buckner the leading scoreer for the Tigers with 16 Another rebound Lau Thats a shot that Buckners been making You sort of expect them to make that but theyre all not going to go in His can take another five minutes here Hammond over Welling You got a piece of it Porter one two Excellent defense by ADA Thats a bad play And Welling with the hustle Thats a great play Hunter for Godfrey Forced the pass It wasnt there It almost went in the other way Overly ambitious and the Hookies turn it right back over And Mike Young just goes No And Brad Brownell is saying the same thing I didnt know you could throw it over Toby Lal to be perfectly honest with you And they did He gets something for you You got to throw it at least 11 or 12 feet 12 feet in the air Its like overthrowing Randy Moss Its not something you saw very often Its like when I went to see Shan Bradley playing first base when he was at Utah and the guy threw a ball that nobody in the world could catch except Sean B He caught it and I said Oh hes 76 All right All right Yeah Lets get a good shot Not this one Carter come on Thats Thats a shot you give him every time every time in his defense Coach you said no as Bowden Capy drained a gamewinning three earlier this season for BC He was a decent shooter This guy is not making shots Now Dallas pulls up his dribble Tough turnaround Wont go Just cant make shots Well now Virginia Tech has been missing shots but so has Clemenal stood tall They didnt call a foul screaming And Welling has been everywhere since HE CAME BACK IN WELL ITS A THREEONONE You need youre a point guard you need to pass Whether Virginia Tech can finish which they havent done but its later in the season cheering Lets think they can now Hanssbury Bedford Lal Hammond and of Dallas Neo for two He got the mismatch and took it and made a very tough shot Little a little more under control that time Yeah Back to a ninepoint lead for Virginia Tech Hanssbury grappling inside Called for the foul And thatll be two shots for Carter Welling The fourth foul on Hansbury as well And thats just again Abdales took his time that time Got his feet set and was able to use his full height there on the inside against the smaller Hunter And he didnt have one of the bigger guys on him so it made it a little bit easier Clemson still looks a little bit like you you get in these games at home youre on a long trip and youre down and theres a big crowd here You want to play better and its tough to change that in three minutes to go in the game here They got a big mountain right now Now when Clemson struggles they tend to struggle on offense and their defense usually bails them out Their defense hasnt been able to do that tonight And I think you got to credit that to Virginia Tech The Hokes have played really well offensively Really well Welling goes one of two applause 13 points five rebounds for Carter Welling Hokes just running their stuff Well Wen is back in the game now He Theyre going to try to use size against Abdales Step back three Rebounded by Hunter applause You got to push the ball and you got to score quickly He heard you but he missed Beautiful move Just missed the shot Wallen has not taken a shot all night Limited action Hunter kicks it Welling fakes it Attacks Counted and one applause See he didnt take the three Hes going to get the three the hard way the old way But but again why would you rush at him No reason And but Well I mean hes hes a 17 threepoint shooter in conference play but hes a very smart player He gave the fake and went to the basket 0 for three from three tonight but hes six of seven from two Thats why coaches want cheering ulcers No hair ulcers And so Clemson has got it back to five a couple of times but they havent been able to get any closer Hookies are up seven at the break Have held the lead the entire second half Hanssberry playing with the four fouls Kicks it Bedford three Got it And that had that happened consistently in the first half And again what a huge answer by Virginia Tech Hes been great tonight 23 points for Jaylen Bedford His season high is 25 Important shot Justin Porter comes up short but gets his rebound Well will take his first shot of the night He will Rebounded by Lal That was really good defense by Abdales Mike Young is going low who low Lets just take our time here cheering Hooks up eight with 90 seconds to go Without a doubt this would be Virginia cheering Techs biggest win of the season Its a huge win right here They can get it Not over yet this game Thats not the way to finish Hanssbury missed the three Rebounded by Hunter Hansbury made one of those at the end of the half Tigers need points They need them quick Davidson bullying Lel and he draws the foul Number three on Toby Virginia Tech has done such a great job throughout this game being patient with their offense They move the ball they move the defense and then they can find the open shooter And usually thats been Bedford Theyre shooting over 56 from three which not bad Thats the difference in the game and theyve got 11 threes versus five Its hard to overcome that Sorry Jim Thats the sixth missed free throw of the night Meanwhile were getting you set for Wake Forest and Georgia Tech Tip off about 10 minutes away Doug Sherman Scott Williams standing by from a Cameish Pavilion for the second game of our Wednesday night double header A fun couple of nights in the ACC There are a lot of those Theres nothing easy in this league missed both free throws And you know this is a Virginia Tech team Youve mentioned it a couple of times Evan You know a couple of points in three different games and this is a they have an entirely different look an entirely different resume This is a good basketball team who came in here and played extremely well tonight against Stanford They were up 12 with two minutes to go in and a miraculous 141 run from Ibuka Aorei stole that game at Castle They were up four with 7 seconds left at SMU and Boopy Miller half court shot was the hero half court runner The thing is Im not sure the committee really factors in close losses No no they do not They do not They They say they look at everything Im not sure either Its nittygritty The game that happened back on January 7th is just either a win or a loss without a ton of context Probably that the team you played matters but you know its a 5149 game and you lose it up 10 now with 548 to go Hammond only had two points in the first half Hes got 15 here in the second half Well hes hes really been outstanding But again this you have a good team thats playing with some desperation and that showed tonight Hunter missed another layup Low the rebound and Brad Brownell might wave the white flag here Not much of a foul but a foul nonetheless Tonights player of the game is brought to you by Hardies and it is number zero Jaylen Bedford One of his best games of the season without a doubt He set the tone early offensively And I think thats the key The tone was set early offensively He got Clemson back He helped get Clemson back on their heels defensively someplace the Tigers are thats unfamiliar territory for them And then this guy at the free throw line what a job he he did in the second half keeping the Hokes in front and the Hokes are 13 for 13 from the free throw line and the Tigers are 11 for 18 Factor in that and then the threepointer disparity Clemson now five of 16 from deep Theyve been outscored by 18 points beyond the ark by this Virginia Tech team thats made double digit threes for the eighth time this season here tonight So Virginia Tech is going to get its most important victory of the season and theyll have a feisty Florida State team coming to Castle this weekend Meanwhile Clemson will not tie Duke for first place in the league Theyre now in a tie for second with Virginia as the Tigers head to Cameron on Saturday Hokes win it by 10 here at Little John They got 610 of a second to run off the clock Just a really well played offensive game Clemson does not give up this many points at home very often Brad Brownells ready to shake hands shares a hug with his longtime colleague and friend Mike Young And the fans are ready to leave Welling good if it goes Nope Makes him 0 for four from three for the night Doesnt help enough
