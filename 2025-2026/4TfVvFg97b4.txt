him on music the offensive glass in the match up with Ben Allen Luben Those two are going to be in for a physical matchup today And BC controls the opening tip Its Luca Taves the sophomore out of Tokyo Japan BC last time out 27 from the field in a loss to Georgia Tech 4 for 29 from three See right away NC State communicating well Two to the ball Boston College just needs to be cleaner on the offensive end of the floor Thats kind of been their issue finding shots with consistency good defense And with the shot clock winding down theyve got to hoist it up cheering And NC State with a strong defensive statement to open up Their head coach is Will Wade in his first season in Raleigh Had a nice run at McNees Led them to the second round last year Was at LSU as well VCU UT Chattanooga Chattanooga And hes got an NC State team that played the toughest nonconference schedule in the ACC Theyve got some scars but theyre in good shape Paul McNeel who had a 47point game last month misfires Hes a big time shooter And this Boston College team looking to play early in the clock if possible When you struggle to get going on the offensive end of the floor you try to put your guys in position to attack close out I like the raise action for Fred Payne who is a junkyard dog a Louisiana native a down south guy much like his head coach Earl Grant Earl Grant used to coach at the College of Charleston now in his fifth season at Boston College He was telling us tempo tonight will be important He said BC has to be selective when it chooses to run They do not want to get into a track meet with NC State One side you I and I think thats theres two sides to that coin Anishh because sometimes in a half court Boston College can struggle if you have opportunities with the athletes that you have at Boston College with Hastings with Payne with Donald Han You get out and you find your rhythm through speed The ball has energy I feel like Ive heard that a million times in the early portion of this season Try to play quickly and figure things out This matchups huge Thats Williams And thats a good sign for NC State He came into this game in a 6 for28 shooting slump Bowden Capy 610 bigger in size may may not be the fleetest of foot but going to try to use his size to discourage some of these jump shots He decid Darion Williams though because thats how he gets rid of them If he can stand in front face up and shoot thats how he generates some confidence throughout the course of the game Capki backto music back 11 rebound games Richard freshman from Victoria Minnesota transferred in from Butler cheering Hes a big fan of him He was Mr Basketball in the state of Minnesota before he was at Butler And I watched him play for D1 Minnesota He was a highly recruited guy 610 with skill out on the perimeter Just a really nice player Needs to be more sure I He does get sloppy with the ball on the perimeter at times though Williams pulls up and that cheering rattles in Hes been assertive early which is what Will Wade wants to see But two shots him walking directly into it Hes not having to work all that hard for those first two looks Now hes composed If Im Boston College after those two shots Im worried Darian Williams coming in from Texas Tech Arguably the most coveted transfer in the portal and a traveling violation on Donald Han So BC sloppy early Good transition offense They counted this a two I think that was the right call But Darien Williams youre going to have to find his pickup point because thats a jump shooting fourman Listed at six what 66 might be generous Anish but he gets confidence by walking straight forward You got to make him play side to side Nice block by Bowden Captain taking it away from Breed Here comes Tabes Fred Payne has almost doubled his scoring average this season Payne catch and release Got it applause I really like that offensive possession for Boston College No set play calls Quick ball screen Throw it back Hit the guy ahead Fred Payne out here working today whenever I pulled up I got here about 1000 this morning Out here getting up jumpers even before shootound Kids working hard Williams has four Missed the bunny Rebound to Jaden Hastings Cap Three rims out Offensive re or defensive rebound to Darien Williams Quickly up ahead McNeel More of a catch and shoot guy than a dribble drive guy Puts it on the floor Drops it off The basket counts plus one Thats Quadrir Copeland having the best season of his career after stops at Syracuse and McNiss Just a good drive Paul McNeel Jr more so a scorer but nice job Copeland showing off his athleticism You talk about a big guard 65 can make things happen A terrific athlete really played well over the last three games averaging 15 points and seven assists shooting great numbers This guys got a lot of talent Needs to learn how to play without the basketball whenever Darien Williams has it Needs to space out find his spots but he is electric with the ball in his hand So crafty off the dribble Yeah Among the ACC leaders in assists in some of NC States big games He showed up 22 points at Auburn 28 against Texas Heres Hand Hes been in a bit of a shooting slump from the outside Capsky the skip Payne another three Raises the front rim Offensive rebound Capsky blocked Big play there by Van Allen Luben Heres hand short Offensive rebound Shaw on a foul cheering applause And NC State getting some stops on the defensive end of the floor Ben Allen Luben get that out of here North Carolina transfer Hes played everywhere music He loves playing against Boston College too College has been when they shoot the three they shoot the three almost 44 of the time The problem is they only make 28 of their threes Yeah It just hasnt been a great shooting team And and the problem with that is Anishh is they can find open looks because even in this game tonight NC States doubling the post You spray out you get good looks If youre all grant its hard to discourage your guys from taking them Chase Forte strong to the tin And now a foul is called to reach in on Aiden Shaw his first Tough move Forte played in the Summit League last year was the Summit League defensive player of the year and and first team all league still adjusting to ACC play but watch him on the defensive end of the floor I actually got Forte on that last foul trying to defend Darien Williams whos got six for NC State Youre going to have to send a second body at him I I I just think its so difficult if youre Boston College to cover him oneonone simply because he can beat you in so many ways You put a bigger player on him he can back out and knock down shots You put a smaller player on him he just backs you through Shaw with an awkward angle out of bounds to NC State Darien Williams off to a hot start so far Hit a couple of jump shots Gets Aiden Shaw whos a little bit more slight of frame muscles his way in with the Barkley dribble able to get it up and over Youre going to have to send a second body because thats when NC State this year has struggled a little bit Still covering him oneonone Whens Kappy going to come over You have to He does not And Williams that time miss fired Forte playing for his fifth school UNCC Asheville Junior College Northwestern State South Dakota last year where he was a first team allconerence player and smooth to the rim Forte applause I like it Chase Forte being aggressive Talk about well trapped Played at UNCC Asheville GF Coast State Northwestern State South Dakota Had a really good season last year Just an aggressive guard Nice play Ben Allen Luben left it short applause Forte Capi stumbles and we get a whistle Officials looking at each other It will be a foul Thats on Copeland His first Little ball screen action from the top Forte nice read Quadrir Copeland If youre on that backside you need to slide up a little bit higher and meet him earlier But Forte nice move That little hesitation dribble that last pickup leaves the defense a little bit unsure of how theyre going to get their position Nice finish Reinforcements off the bench for NC State We should mention the Wolfpack shorthanded today Trey Hollowerman who had been starting but hes been coming off the bench the last four games Hes out with an ankle injury Thats a guy who gives you 10 a game Thats right But at the same time now you have a definite point guard Copelands your guy now right And you can add just a little bit more playmaking a little bit more shooting around him So even though he goes down a little bit more defined roles and now youre bigger and more switchable around the perimeter This is a big bunch of guards for NC State Where they lack in size at the center is how big they are on the perimeter McNeel blocked again His game is more perimeter oriented He got his hand up He had a game against Texas Southern 11 threes which tied an ACC single game record Another turnover by Capki Here comes Copeland Oakland drives kicks the three is good Terrence Arsenal they want to get him going He was a big big piece off the bench for Houston last year Absolutely he was And hes one that struggled a little bit on the offensive end of the floor And we got a 10second call Good defense NC State just making Boston College think a little bit too much You got to attack pressure to score trying to just attack pressure to get it past half court to run something If youre Boston College all NC States doing is open it up for you Go ahead and attack Talk about Terrence Arsenal in your screen there This is a guy that was a top 50 recruit coming out of high school and has a lot of tools Defensive guy for Kelvin Samson Yeah I was about to say if youre a defensive guy for Kelvin Samson my man can lock up There is McNeel Thats no good Battle for the board to Shaw the Missouri transfer McNeel came in shooting 42 from three Shaw to hand to Hastings Tic tac toe I love it Donald Han being aggressive not for his own shot but just to make things happen Terrific pass to Hastings Arsenal hit one make it two He was three of 17 from three entering play Discount day at the Kanti Two for one special for Terren Arseno Thats big time shot You got so many guys on this Wolfpack team who can hit three Arsenal starts knocking him down Thats trouble for the other team Heres Steager Catch and release No good McNeel the rebound Caleb Stiger freshman from Dallas Arsenal Heat check No Thats not really Arsenals personality laughter Some of the other guys especially one of the guys in this booth he would have let it fly But Matt Ael hell do it Abels dad is in the house A former Boston College captain who scored more than a thousand points for BC in the late 80s There he is Dad Doug able One cheering of the biggest high school recruits NC State has had in years Its taking too long 8 seconds left on the clock You got to get into something quicker Copeland with that 66 range Heres McNeel Cop looking for movement We welcome those of you watch who watch Syracuse and Georgia Tech Thats a former Syracuse player Quadrir Copeland for NC State and AR Terrence Oglesby here at KI forum NC State one and one in conference play A win over Wake Forest They lost last time out to Virginia BC looking for its first league win coming off a blowout loss against Georgia Tech Wack up and running Arso trying to go inside and its knocked out of bounds by BC NC State playing really well on the offensive end of the floor Its really hard to guard Daren Williams oneonone Where NC State and Darien has struggled this year is when double teams have come and hes had to make decisions And BC has been hesitant to double him so far Heres Ael the talented freshman Williams for three Its good Hes got nine He only had 16 points in his previous three games combined Playing really well here early Need to know your scouting report Your number nine Chase Forte You cant help that far off But that being said nice play Matt Ael driving to the middle drawing a second defender and finding the scorching Williams here early Shot clock at five BC still really not in its offense Able takes it away from hand Arsenals knocked down a couple of threes already Contested Comes back to Ael Williams the extra pass Just really good patience right here by the Wolfpack Able better better defense BC averages more than five blocks per game Very good shot blocking team But right now looking to halt an 110 Wolfpack run Hand Hastings the buddy And you look at Donald H Jr what hes come in to do this game so far Only one shot attempt but hes created plays for his teammates Two easy assists around the rim Get out Get out You got to throw that other guy at him Hes too big Williams went right at Forte the Summit League defensive player of the year at South Dakota last year McNeel too strong Hastings rips it down Ill say this so far were 11 and a half minutes in The refs have let these guys compete Donald Hand who struggled a little bit on the offensive end of the floor continuing to be aggressive all the way to the cup You can tell with Earl Grant theyve talked thats his game plan coming into this one Played okay against Georgia Tech Hasnt shot the ball all that well this season He told me today he was going to be assertive in trying to get into the lane to create some offense first around the rim with somebody who struggled with the jump shot What youre seeing out of BC tonight has been a recurring theme Slow starts and its happened quite often Theyve got a lot of close losses a lot of close losses Thats the teams that frankly shouldnt be in their weight class Here comes Breed The finish Musa Sier the freshman from Gambia How should BC clear this press It they should get they should clear this press by getting across half court And we have a technical foul Will Wade just got teed up and Will Wade is looking at Roger Ayes saying What did I do And Im not really sure what happened but Darien Williams my man is cooking Got a quick nine to start out this game NC State rolling early music Immediately applause All right fans Whos hungry for a win Its time for the jersey match presented by Jersey Mike Pull up your own scan QR code on the video board and play the game Just like that you can win some delicious prizes from Jersey Nights Fast fun and packed flavor just like your favorite sub Dont wait Play now Jersey nights a sub Eagle fans its time for the Chip City Cookie Show Turn your attention to the video board and follow along closely The shuttle starts now Thats a welcome home Will back to the ACC Did his schooling at Clemson First time back in the Atlantic Coast in some time Roger Ayers giving him a welcome card tough Fred Payne is doing it for BC early Hes got nine He hit the two free throws for the technical Williams with nine for NC State Fouled down low Theyre going to get Shaw going over the back And hes been all over the place Anishh Yeah he has Hes quite the sound bite as weve uh found out recently as well His first season was at LSU got a twoyear show cause Its been well documented how basically everything that he did wrong and hes joked about it is the stuff you can now do legally with NIL and paying players And theres Abel How about that freshman Right Come off a screen get your feet right shot pick because its so fluid The defender goes flying Wise beyond his years Off to a good start today Fourstar freshman highest rated recruit since Dennis Smith And boy did he need that Came in shooting 19 from three almost half his average from last year Just a really good shot stepped into it with rhythm Struggled with his jumper so far this year Just at 19 from three on a lot of attempts That one looked good though That time they doubled Williams Now Allan Breed who followed Wade from Mcnes Here comes Hastings BC pushes hand the other way around Able and he cannot get the basket but gets two shots Donald Han Jr He has struggled from three but I love the rhythm he plays with on this shot Attacking Shoots the ball on the way up And to me thats been the biggest crutch for him so far this year Gets the foul call Well see him at the free throw line It hes gotten out of rhythm a little bit this year Hes always had Anishh this little hitch in his shot but this year its become even more pronounced And what happens is you see the hitch right there at the free throw line What happens is he takes his momentum to the rim away by shooting it back on the way down And as we go through this game if he continues to shoot on the way up hes a terrific shooter Most improved player in the league last year Its just sometimes if you play a lot and you work as hard as DJ works youre going to pick up some idiosyncrasies but you got to find your way to work out of it And he works his tail off You were a great shooter How do you get out of one of those shooting slumps How about Copeland through the contact You work through it And I think you have to have somebody every now and then to whisper in your ear Is it something you can do in season Absolutely Because youre not changing anything fundamentally wrong especially with DJs shot So you dont want to alter the shot at all Like you can leave the hitch Thats fine Nice move Now hes got some confidence A lot of contact Nice block And he stays dangerous like this They want to make this a Tempest and Williams the three A 41 threepoint shooter Hes got a dozen to lead all scorers But you notice the quality of shot for Daren Williams today Hes stepping into it Hes playing oneonone Hasnt seen a lot of resistance I think so far knocking down shots at a high clip because theyre in the rhythm of what he does These turnovers are a killer for Boston College 10 turnovers for BC NC State with none And the slow starts continue to plague the Eagles They get out of the way This is a match up for Williams against the smaller tapes Got to bring that second defender over So far Boston College hasnt been doing that Nice defense He did Its Shaw with the help defense Watch your head PAY SHAW screaming VALHALLA We got a foul on for Payne Hes going to get two Wave off the hoop But that was pretty nice Off the hoop Nice aggressiveness Aiden Shaw This is a guy transfer from Missouri Hes another player on the floor tonight Top 50 top 60 recruit super athletic other parts of his game hadnt caught up but this is a guy who is a highlight reel waiting to happen But I love the aggressiveness so far tonight by Fred Payne Hes done a really nice job Hes also representative of what happens when you stay with one program for three years and you develop Played last year had a red shirt year as a freshman where he tore his ACL Yep and youre seeing what we used to see way back when guys didnt jump ship every year or every other year where you grow into your role and now in year three as a red shirt sophomore hes a double digit scoreer and a guy that BC leans on night in night out thats a great point when we talked to Earl Grant today he talked about hey sometimes its just about opportunity right Fred Payne playing well today I really like the flow and how NC States playing right now And Darien Williams just looks so comfortable I know he missed that shot but it its the manner in which hes getting the looks today It its its more calm Hes stepping through into them Fred Payne just a junkyard dog in the car We saw hand win ACCs most improved player last year Payne has a chance to be in the mix Quentyn Post won it a few years ago This is Marco Redunovich freshman from Montenegro Pay the baseline drive and Shaw the Thunder Just a really good job Aiden Shaw seeing the penetration getting to the top of that charge circle Nice pass Four of BCs first five shots were threes They only made one Theyre now making a concerted effort to get those kind of looks and go inside Thats too easy for Scotty Ibup the senior who transferred in from Wyoming after two years at Southern Illinois And Ibubet comes up with a steal I thought the pass by Paul McNeel was even better Williams Williams drives leaves it for McNeel Novich the rebound Haynes got 11 Make it 14 A man is cooking coming off ball screens making it happen in transition Fred Payne picking up in the full court press And all of a sudden BC has cut it to seven NC State led by as many as 13 Ib The friendly roll applause Theres a couple things Scotty Ibubet does really well He finishes layups he dunks and he fouls Thats what Thats what Will Way said Hes going to dunk it or hes going to foul it Somethings going to happen May be good may not be good but hes going to change the rhythm of the game 610 280 Nice pass Rodunovic from the outside Thats his sixth three of the year Was 5 for 222 prior And BCs found a little flow offensively with this group cheering The block by Hastings Tracked down by Forte Rodunovic front rim Here comes Williams and he slams the brakes Balls getting a little stagnant This is not what we were seeing early in the game for NC State Able gets to his spot and hits Man just a really talented young player Matt Ael quality shooter but getting his best looks off the bounce so far tonight Hes got eight points right on his season average Best game came in Maui when he had 15 in the loss to Satan Hall Lot of dribbling by Forte Tries to thread it knocked out of bounds to BC Eagles starting to find a little offensive mojo late in the first half 14 Nobody We come back from break They press go And a foul is called on Rodunovich the freshman It sends Van Allen Luben to the free throw line This is the fifth time he is facing BC He has now done it in four different uniforms Notre Dame Vanderbilt UNCC twice last music year and now is a member of the Wolf Back And right now he has a chance to ruin Burgers from Shake Shack Gives the people from Boston a rude ride home Is Boston a shake shack town Looks like it is NC State 13 points off turnovers tonight Forte defended by McNeel Less than a minute to go Now Steer down low The basket goes applause and cheering Really nice play Caleb Steager Im a big fan of this freshman from Texas Comes all the way up to Boston Hes got good skill long arms Reminds me a little bit of a young Jerome Robinson but how nice it comes off his hand from the perimeter Has some playmaking ability Boston College needs to hang on to this young man Those were exciting teams with Jerome Robinson and Kai Bowman Final ticks opening half Williams picked up his bounce McNeels been quiet McNeel hoy Thats how the first half ends applause NC State led by Quadir Copeland Picked up a couple of fouls in that first half When he was in though he played well Seven points four assists zero turnovers Quadir Copeland has been excellent over the last three games Meanwhile Donald Hand picks up his first foul Uh we remind you we have the college football playoff semifinals Thursday Dont forget on Wednesday theyve got you covered on the ACC network for the miss Miami matchup in the Verbbo Fiesta Bowl Youve got inside access at 5 Eastern tomorrow from Glenale and then it all continues on game day with the ACC huddle pregame show at 6 Eastern Breed with five step back Got it Nice composed look Breed I thought he could have had a nice shot in the corner Pass was a little bit off the mark but sure player puts it on the deck and goes out against the smaller Luca Taves NC State led by as many as 13 in the first half Slow starts have been an issue for BC Had another one today Picked it up late in the first half Taves looking for help Shot clock at five Heres Payne with THREE OVER COPELAND GOT IT Third three for Fred Kane Finds a little gold at the end of the rainbow Telling Quadir Copeland about it on the way back down the deck too or way back down the floor Copeland to Van Allen Luben The Tarhill transfer Rebound Payne 17 for Payne all the way Ky applause put so much pressure on the defense Excellent job B O B O B O B O B O B O B O B O B O B O B Ky rim running giving himself the opportunity to get over BC within five Another takeaway Theres Payne against Copeland No rebound to Breed BC back in transition Williams was calling for it puts it on the floor strong to the tin and two shots And on the other end for Boston College Fred Payne has opened up this half getting busy Quick three on the right 45 That was just a measure up and then he gets out in transition This is just terrific aggressiveness drawing two leaving his feet but finding Kapki in transition Good job by Capki though He was huffing at getting down on the floor Capki making his first start of the season tonight Hastings just picked up his second foul Payne has put this team on his shoulders tonight Hes got 17 of the 37 Hes been aggressive And its not just that its how efficient hes been too got to box out at the free throw line And Breed hits the open three off the Copeland feed cheering I really like Allan Breed This is a guy whos been in college for a long time Played on a Mckitan team outside of Atlanta in Marietta with Isaac Aoro whos in the NBA with Share Cooper He was that extra piece playing really well here in the early going of this second half Spent three years at Providence I was with Will Wade at Mcnes Here comes Payne again Tapes hits from the outside 42 threepoint shooter and a BC team that was four of 29 from three in its previous game Six of 11 today Theyre the worst shooting threepoint team in the ACC as Luben finishes at the rim and the foul called on Breed NC State trying to find some rhythm Good pass to the top and Darien Williams You got to communicate a little bit better and take away that role Youre going four or five ball screen Switch and get up underneath that giving an easy angle to the cup Taves almost out of control Now its Payne Payne the floater 19 for Fred Payne Three shy of a careerhigh Fred Paynes interesting because he shoots lefthanded but inside 8 ft hes more comfortable shooting right hand Copeland does not get the bounce on the road needs to get rid of it And thats thats Luca Tavs problem by and large He he hangs on the ball too long You have Fred Payne whos absolutely cooking something special in Chestnut Hill trailing the play Find the hot hand for a team that struggled on offense You got a guy whos got 19 before the first media in the second half Let my man cook Its been a bounceback game for Payne who last time out against Georgia Tech was 1 for13 and 0 for seven from three Only have two points Needs to get rid of the ball Dribbles too much You need to find something quickly They find pain No call Here comes Copeland 66 floor General Copeland out of control Offensive cheering foul Thats his third And I actually agree with the call Quadir Copeland out of control here The ball dribbling it up way too high And if youre not in control you know what I take it back I think I dont think Taves was in legal guarding position He was sliding there at that last moment Took a lick Thats all well and good but Eric Copeland you need to be a little bit more responsible with the basketball But he gets he he could some of his creativity comes from those things So you have to live with it a little bit If youre Will Wade in the coaching staff Taves picked up by McNeel Now Hastings down low Taken away by Copeland Stays in bounds A freshman able in the game for NC State No Trey Halman today Out with an ankle injury Hes been their top bench guy And Hastings picks up his third foul A lot of nice guys For ACC fans Will Wade is going to be a treat laughter Will Wade is quotable Hes a personality He has one of those larger than life coaching personas You dont get half a will experience You only get 100 of the will experience You and Will Wade go back to your Clemson days right There was a little bit of an overlap Yeah there absolutely was One of the guys that helped recruit me on my visit to Clemson Will Wayade was the director of basketball operations Unfortunately good hustle Unfortunately and fortunately for him took a job at Harvard the year that I got there So I never actually got to be in the same building with him but weve maintained a relationship ever since And Im a fan I I I know theres a lot theres a lot of Will Wade laughter but sign Roger Ayes found that out in the first half Sign me up Yeah If youre looking for the next quote to add to that montage of sound bites somebody should ask about the technical foul he was given in the opening half by Roger Ays Its a fantastic It was a great exchange It was It was a funny moment Roger Ays came over and just said he waved off a 28year ACC crew chief and Will Wade when the foul was called from the opposite side of the floor put his hands out and said what did I do Heres what BC did They turned it over yet again See them right beside each other Theres a good working relationship there Roger Ayes just setting the tone if you will Its conference play Absolutely Will Wade will probably see a lot of Roger the rest of the way Hey by the way great job by our guys back in the truck That was a terrific montage that they put together Just really good The essence of Will Wade Williams the jump hook Good defense by Shaw Luben tied up NC State ball L ball Saturday triple header on the ACC network NC State heads to Tallahassee Syracuse the winner tonight against Georgia Tech will take on Pitts You can give him no daylight whatsoever Paul McNeel is a shooter Would you say he went for 70 points in high school 71 in high school a North Carolina State record And then just a few weeks ago 47 against Texas Southern 11 threes which tied Craig Dawson and Dennis Scotts ACC record Shot clock winding down Kapy and one cheering Love the patience Love how Kapki is working for position Bowden Kapky rooting his way on the interior able to get an and one opportunity and Boston College starting two bigs Bowden Capy and Jaden Hastings now in the lineup with Aiden Shaw trying to get a little bit bigger a little more physical against the front line for NC State Little on the smaller side trying to take advantage of that size And Will Wade told us BC size with Kappy and Shawn Hastings the guys you mentioned that was a concern He felt Virginias size and physicality gave this team trouble over the weekend Well Ill say this about Virginias size and physicality Thats just a different level They got two very talented bigs including El Grunlo one of the top international players Terrific shot blocker Can space you out Ty de Ritter came over played in Spain last year for Bill Ba Like they lost that game Sure I I think Virginia and what Ryan ODMs done this season absolutely fantastic But also I like the aggression tonight with Darien Williams and how hes approached this game He gets a switch against a young Caleb Steager a freshman understands he has the weight advantage gets to the paint able to draw the foul His approach today has been noticeably different These people want shake shake cheering Theyre not getting it Burgers were on the line according to the jumbotron Williams early in the year had a couple of big games 32 against UNCC Greensboro 28 against BCU You wonder how much the shoulder injury impacted his offense Kick ball And you know you heard the viral clip where Will Wade was defending Darien Williams He was talking to us He said the point he was trying to make is his presence on the floor even when hes not playing well offensively hes not scoring hes not shooting does a lot for the other four guys just the threat of him being a scoreer Played at Texas Tech last year First team all big 12 Hes defending Payne Theyve been the top players in this game Bane with 21 one off a careerhigh and hes been spectacular Terrific helpside Boston College within five points Its been the Fred Payne show No helpside coming Aiden Shaws on an island Williams offensive rebound McNeel He didnt cheering have to force that up Shot clock had reset Heres Pay Hes a lefty Nice shot post Kapy goes to work on Ben Allen Luben Help coming from Arsenal Al pain to the right hand and a foul So you said it a lefty right said Fred when he goes to the rim It its amazing And I work with the Charlotte Hornets with a guy named Miles Bridges who shoots lefthanded on the perimeter but inside about 8 ft He switches over right every single time He does the same thing and he didnt get this one to go But keep an eye on that ambidextrous Fred Payne Its tough to guard You dont know where to lead him But just a really really nice floor game from Fred Payne being really efficient on the offensive end of the floor Aggressive for a Boston College team thats needed that guy a native of Grambling Louisiana and he wears his Louisiana roots proudly 318 Thats the area code in central Louisiana tattooed on his right calf 22 points for Payne which matches his career high A season in which Payne has more than or almost doubled his scoring average from less than seven a game last year to almost 12 and a half this year Heres Copeland Hes having a career year his final season And a turnover and BC with a chance to creep even closer The scouting report defense for Boston College today on ball screens on Copeland Theyre going underneath it That was a big point of emphasis today at shootaround But Eric Copeland so crafty with the ball You he gets you on his hip He uses his length and athleticism to finish Today Boston College focused on just keeping him in front forcing the turnover Payne has been the offense And thats a turnover Number 15 for BC which matches the season high Wolfpack have gone more than two and a half minutes since their last field goal Offensive rebound Able takes a hit No call Steager I thought Matt Ael got away with a push off going up for that rebound You almost get the sense Paynes got to touch it every time down Donald Hand has been a nonfactor Hes at the scores table Forte got walled up Itll stay with BC Weve got a game at conci forum The Eagles look like a different team Last year I was coming You got to be able to play off two because you have to leave yourself options Nice steal by Koko Yeah that cant happen if youre BC Off a timeout Inbounds pass Turnover Oakland backing down Forte Help coming from Shaw Arsenal with his third three Hit three threes on 17 shots on the season entering play Smooth looking jump shot What what I appreciate about Arsenal too he he just plays his role doesnt force his hand Hand answers his second three And if BC is going to have a chance to win this game it cant just be pain They need Donald H Absolutely Two of three from three What a relief its been for him Guy whos really struggled from the perimeter this year But both threes that hes made Anish run in directly at it His momentums playing forward Good defense Copeland in trouble Shot clock down to five Arsenal is fouled on the drive with three on the shot clock Terrence Arseno Terrific pass Quadir Copeland hit the man in the corner Thats a bucket Then on the other end Donald Hand you see his weight distribution He shoots the ball on the way up Tonights game has been the first time Ive seen him do that Ill have to get the shot up because the team needs it Well with him letting the game come to him a little bit more is going to benefit him greatly And his shot selection today has been significantly different Arsenal in double digits after making one out of two Hes got 10 Heres Hand Payne getting a rest on the bench Darian Williams getting ready to check in for NC State Forte tries to split the D gets it back Hold on cheering You have to reestablish yourself in bounds with both feet They thought he caught the ball and hes still up in the air Oh never mind They gave it back to Boston College Its a nice job by this officiating crew a veteran officiating crew 28 years worth with Roger Ayes Thats right laughter Rogers not going to live that down And here here it is right here Chase Forte reestablishes it himself Two feet Thats a good call Good job by the officiating crew getting that right Talk that over They get it right And BC with the ball Shot clock goes at two They got to go quickly Hand hoists in and out It looked good And cheering Capi draws the foul on the offensive glass Thats the size of Boston College Scored in double figures eight times this season Tonight his first start of the year for BC I think hes earned another one to be honest with you Anish I think hes played well Done a lot of those little things And even when they dont throw it into the post the fact that hes putting so much pressure on the opposing fiveman by rooting out trying to create space those little things they provide value Its huge onepossession game Here comes Williams defended by hand Match up of a couple of stars The drop off Copeland comes back to Ael Fresh 20 Williams using the arm to get around hand Arsenal leans in kisses it off the window And this is the thing about Terrence Arseno that you love but it also drives you crazy right Hits two threes in the corner All great and good Then he has to drive and attack the rim Hes got terrific change of pace and speed but he doesnt do it all the time And he always just kind of leaves you wanting a little bit more because the natural talent is there Hand with four and step back That doesnt go Capy kept it alive but Ael is there We told you Abels dad Doug our twotime BC captain thousandpoint scorer in the 80s hes here tonight Copeland and the follow cheering by Sier Boston College plays around with this basketball They got to get across I feel like for the better part of this game every time NC States pressed theyre getting it around 21 22 again Still not in their offense Shot clocks at 10 Need to get Fred Payne back in this ball game Kapy great position Just a little too much Williams puts it on the floor Too strong Ky had it lost it Copeland back down low to Williams But dear Copeland with his seventh assist and Williams with 16 The simplicity sometimes is your best option Timeout Earl Grant NC State on a 60 run Quarter Copeland Keep it simple Its easy chest pass Easy layup Hey use the board for me Well thats when the 6 run happened when Fred Payne was on the bench Hes plus two today When hes in the game Fred Payne in the green shoes back on their left 45 Hes in there Donald Hand is in there Heres Rodonovich Tabes to the freshman from Montenegro Volleyball down low And theres Arsenal the Houston transfer played on the national runnerup last year Williams thats not there He forced that Those arent the threes they want him to take Hastings big body against Luben and Hastings dipping into that wardrobe of low post moves Not bad defense Ben Allen aluminum Somebody better find Arsenal and cutting Copeland Able corner three rattles in Vanquid Copeland his vision as a passer is outstanding Third three by Ael and Copeland with eight points tonight or eight assists tonight cheering Heres heres a matchup I like this call right here Fred Payne getting his guy out of the way Im not sure I like the shot You want him to take him to the hole Well I do And I want the post player to get over on the other block to give him some space to operate He had no choice if he was going to get a shot up It was going to go up like that And he went for the steal Copeland Arsenal over Hastings cheering I like this patience See if you cant get something going Change sides of the floor Nice spin move and they will give Hand the continuation A chance for a threepoint play for Donald Hand BC still hanging around with 510 music Really nice floor game as a facilitator He has sitting beside money earning Vernon Hamilton over there on the bench This is a guy that he impacts winning for this NC State team because hes the one that can create shots for others I actually think you you attack pressure to score I I know youre up eight You want shot quality I would argue that NC State shot quality has been better when theyve played with some rhythm and flow and played a little bit quicker Will we talked to us today about wanting to finish teams off This is an opportunity Williams and there is Luben on cleanup duty Hey and thats just a great job by Darien Williams understanding hey I can go ahead and try to shoot this Im not going to try to overpass If I do miss it my big fell on the backside is going to be able to flush it through Thats one of those at risk shots that youre willing to live with because offensive rebounding is in play And they get a foul on the drive by hand Darien Williams continues to be aggressive today Comes off a ball screen late hedge He understands hey I can get this up off the glass Theres nobody on the backside for Vin Allen Luben Whos gotten buckets just like that for four different schools against Boston College He has And hits the free throw the foul on Ael Weve got you covered for the College Football Playoff semifinal Miami miss playing on Thursday night Weve got inside Access Wednesday at 5 ACC PM at 6 The crew will be in Glendale and they get you ready for the big game with ACC Huddle at 600 pm Eastern on Thursday Plus during the game field pass presentation crew on the sidelines commentary reactions lot to unpack Miami has been physical football team Their two playoff wins against Texas AM and Ohio State Miss a lot going on in Oxford with the coaching turmoil following Lane Kippids departure to LSU in this one NC State led by as many as 13 BCs trying to claw away Every time they get close NC State seems to have an answer and they have Darius Williams cheering The ACC 28 from the field Could be a getri game for him I like NC State coming out of a timeout Little 131 look They mold back into man after two passes Fun house with trick mirrors Tapes Heads up and Shaw Light pressure from BC NC State clears with 22 131 again How do you attack You look for the corners in the short corner And I was always taught to attack the el the opposite elbow or you could do that WILLIAMS BEATS THE SHOT CLOCK Hes got 22 His fourth threepointer of the night He needed a get right game And this is it Now you can fixate on the five losses for NC State as Taves answers at the other end but none of those losses are negatives on the overall resume And this is a quad three game And NC State 70 against quad three and four teams They have a quad one win against Boyise State Now we get a whistle Terrence Arseno injured on the side Darren Williams didnt realize that He thought he had the mismatch Is Luca Taves he was ready to go Hey nice performance today by Terence Arsenal I thought he did a lot of really nice things 12 points four of six shooting three of three from distance And no Trey Hollowman off the bench tonight at the bench goes for 31 points with Arsenal Matt Ael has stepped up Copeland with THE FOUR FOULS WHAT A FEED cheering AND a little thunder by Luben His vision is everlasting Unbelievable pass Just manipulates the defense That size allows him to see over everybody at 66 Theres pain Need it Been a while since hes taken a shot And we got a foul with players diving for the loose ball Big time shot at the end of game All but shuts the door Quadir Copeland understands this double team is coming Holds it just long enough And that patience in the paint is big time understands I dont have to be in a rush just because Im close to the rim Fake a pass make a pass give my man Vin All a Luben a flush A one and one for Hastings 58 free throw shooter A foul on Darien Williams his third Stop Stop I got one out of two Copeland trying to cross over Shaw McNeel and Meyers trying to crossover Shaw Crossover Shaw I mean hes so shifty and he understands he can make an impact without scoring the basketball Quir Copeland outstanding today 10 points 10 assists Meanwhile Donald Han knocks down a three So his shooting stroke has come back So if this ends up being a defeat but you get this kind of offense from Donald Han thats a big win for BC going forward It absolutely is And heres the deal with Boston College too And we got a minute left to play down double figures Fine Donald Han has not shot the ball well this year His rhythm in this jump shot is as good as Ive seen it all season long Hes got a little hit sure but now his momentums carrying him into the shot and theres less room for error Right His preparation in todays game has been really really good There is Copeland Hes got the 10 dimes Defended by Tabes Final minute Theyre going to ISO up right here 66 against 61 Now the help from Shaw Copeland picked up the dribble Able with seven A foul called on Hastings cheering and thats his fourth Saturday night Freshman Phenom Caleb Wilson and 17th ranked UNCC hosting Wake Forest at the Dean Smith Center Thats at 6 Eastern Immediately following that game itll be the debut of the documentary Were number one The 93 North Carolina Tar Hills the team that beat Michigan in the Fab Five in the National Championship Eric Montross George Lynch Donald Williams the late great Eric Montros Final 30 seconds Tabes front rim Shaw came over the back for the put back and well get a foul on NC State Aiden Shaw should be a high jump I mean I know this games all but over but he floats to the rim I I mean his athleticism is downright impressive How about Paul McNeel Jr working Yep Former high school slam dunk contest winner Yep No brainer But I think Paul McNeel Jr I Ive admired his ability like he had 47 earlier this season but at the same time whenever hes on the floor he doesnt necessarily force the issue Hes got 10 shots up today Hadnt shot it great but at the same time some of these shooters you have a game like that I can speak from experience on this one Okay you want to shoot it every time you touch it And hes playing within himself Not a great shooting night fine But at the same time understanding time score place and when to attack And hes letting his other guys do the work for And when we were at BC Shootaround a lot of time was spent on making sure they knew where McNeel was Uhoh Copeland cheering Hastings went up to meet him and a foul Thats going to be five on Hastings His day is done cheering Copeland going for the kill shot Oo lot of ball there That was a standby for all call Yeah it was Got to applaud Jaden Hastings Hes going to go up and challenge you at the rim Its the kind of athlete he is But Guir Copeland I I mean the story is going to be Darien Williams and what hes done scoring the ball 22 points finding his rhythm cheering Copelands got 10 assists seven points 10 assist three turnovers Its been outstanding And if you look the common denominator with all these players that NC State picked up theyve all won Theyve all got to the NCAA tournament Hallel who is out with an ankle part of an elite 8 Michigan State team Arsenal played in the championship Copeland and Breed cheering both coming from McNe And Copeland gets the second free throw Crowd unhappy They thought they were getting burgers Theres Payne who flushes it home and that gives him a new careerhigh with 24 Nice performance all the way around NC State You look Boston College played well Fred Payne out of his mind Donald Han finds his rhythm a little bit again for this Wolfback team They needed a get right game from their best player Darien Williams And it didnt come at the expense of anybody else Really nice play by him
