there And Isaac McNeely is one of those threepoint specialists Hes a transfer from Virginia where he played three seasons Opening tip controlled by Louisville in the white Boston College in the traveling maroon and gold Handling the ball right away for Louisville as Kobe Rogers He gets the start for Conwell being out Adrien Lilys been getting the start for Muel Brown Jr going out It is the first start of the season for Rogers Boston College quickly and transition for a three and its Tavs Well as I was saying the key is for Boston College to make a lot of threes Luca Tay is 55 of his shots come from behind the arc BC as a team 29 from beyond the arc at the bottom of the conference as that one bounces out from the corner by Woolly 16 made threes now on the season for Luca Taves Sophomore from Tokyo Japan He played his prep ball at the Newman School in Boston Shot clock down to 10 for BC Cap key Theyll watch another three and hit the front rim See how much clock BC work Thats going to be their plan all day if they can do it 11 and four record on the season for Louisville One2 in conference play And a miscommunication as Hadley throws it out of bounds I think were going to see a good amount of that with two of their guards being out Earl Grant from Boston College in his fifth year He spent three years at the College of Charleston And when he left Charleston to go to BC Charleston made a very smart hire in Pat Kelsey So these are two ships passing in the night now doing battle here KFC Young couple of seasons ago to the NIT tournament for Boston College However they did not qualify for the ACC tournament a year ago Back to Louisville Cards made it through the championship game of the tournament in Charlotte last year and lost to Duke in that title matchup What a turnaround from 2024 when they won just three games in the ACC all season Amanda Fu Jr from Berlin Believe thats his third made three on the season He is now three of five for the total body of work Increased his total by 50 Daves on the money again Talking to Earl Grant last night he was talking about how he needs Luca Tas to be a little bit more of a setup guy but two buckets early on TA had his big game against Fairley Dickinson with 21 points in a careerhigh as Louisville comes right back Ties it at five Soft bounce and it falls for Fred Pay Fred Pay had a really good game against North Carolina State careerhigh 24 was 1 for13 the game before against Georgia Tech McNeely missed the three BC in transition A three of their own and it bounces out of bounds and back to Louisville Not crazy about not crazy about that shot without anyone rebound Theres Pat Kelsey in his second year What incredible energy hes brought to this program this city this arena Just needs his guys to get healthy Needs a magic wand of some sort Hes in his 14th season as a head coach Should he win the game today against BC It would be career victory number 300 for Pat Kelsey 38 and 12 as the head coach of the cards Twisting shot and a miss Off balance from Hadley Wanted the foul Did not get it AJ Desai Jeff Pawn Ben Stur are officials this afternoon Taves lot of dribbling Size disparity doesnt stop TA Luca Tase game does the too small gesture for Sander Fu Had him on skates out there Oh Fu is 611 by the way Yeah he looks pretty tall to me This is F driving down the lane trying to respond and a foul was called as FU hit the deck of the baseline Fu is really good about that by the way putting the ball on the deck and forcing the action But as you can see for a guy whos 611 not a great threepoint shooter but you got to honor him out there cuz hes a good passer Pressure him and he he can definitely dribble it Free throw line is a strength of this Cardinals team 77 as a team third in the ACC Fu is 67 from the line on the season Rogers leads the game for the Cards Some changes for both lineups Kai Roots comes into the game Hes number nine for Louisville in White Crew has one of two Dont forget game two Stanford and Virginia on deck right after us on CW courtside Saturday This is a huge day All 18 teams in the conference in action today Much improved ACC Shot clock to 10 Taves trying to direct a little traffic Fred Payne late to the shot clocks to get the shot away and does That did not hit the rim Louisville has control and out on the run The feed and the jam cheering Hadley slams it through for the Cards Great finish by Hadley and it underscores how important it is for BC to execute well in its half court offense Every miss shot Louisville wants to get out and go Taves had to kick it out Hand Thats a three ball for BC Hes looking over at the Louisville bench Dont want to do that but good to see him make one When Hand and Payne are cooking BC can be a problem But its all about maintaining pace And now you see Han getting active on the defensive end Poked it away from roots It will be Louisville basketball when we come back with BC in front This is how you finish at the rim Javon Hadley getting up top Good one early on at the Y Cards down by four Season for BC and Louisville Boston College has actually won four of the last five Last year Pat Kelsey took his team to Chestnut Hill and won at Connie Forum That was an 84 58 win for Louisville in dominating fashion BC last win here in Louisville in the series March of 2024 a 6761 victory Seth they actually met in the 1966 NIT and it went to triple overtime I was there I covered it Won by the Eagles I wrote an online column after that game and I texted it to my all my buddies TripleOT at the NIT back in 1966 for some historical perspective Capki drew the double Payne with the shot clock at five a runner Was a bit of an old school 1966 shot and it bounced out for pain Got the late clock good look which is what they want Just couldnt get it to go Hes hes an unusual player in that he shoots his long range shots with his left hand and his closeup ones with his right Freddy Pay Hadley trying to work on the block Cappy defended and got it Boston College lost on Tuesday at home to NC State 7971 However the metrics for BC in that game Seth were good They shot 51 as a team Too many turnovers Season high 16 14 And NC State really beat him in points off turnovers Thats why they won the game Taking care of the ball for BC Yeah they made nine threes They outrebounded NC State as well Taves was fouled on the shot Luca Tay game early on I like his confidence with the basketball As I mentioned when I talked to Earl Grant last night he wanted him to be more of a setup guy but hes hunting a shot Hes got 11 points in his last three games seven already today And now going to the line Hes only been to the line seven times this season Five of seven for Taves Journalist and author Katie Pavlich joins the only network that is news for all Americans News Nation pushed through the left right bias to get straight to the facts on Katie Pavage Tonight premieres January music 19th 109 central on NewsNation To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsynowcom The headline today in the first half BC has the lead on the road Eagles so far this season away from Chestnut Hill 1 and two and 0 and one in conference play And its not surprising that Louisvilles half court offense looks pretty disjointed Not only without music Muel Brown Jr but no Ryan Conwell today the leading scorer out with an injured knee He was a game time decision and so were waiting to see if the GLeague recruit London Johnson enters the game at some point I certainly expect that he will Technically he is a red shirt until he steps into the game Once he is in the game he has lost the season Even though they say well theyre activating him Theres theres no NBA equivalent to activating a player in college but they have made the decision he will not red shirt Talking to Pat Kelsey yesterday he was pretty affirmative that if Ryan Conwell wasnt going to play that London Johnson would So I expect well see him at some point Fred Payne with a little runner for BC He averages over 13 points per game Second on the team in scoring behind hand driving to the rim and scoring Woolly has it after he committed an offensive foul on the previous possession for Louisville Thats just straight up bully ball Chase Forte cant handle him down there Sophomore from Tuscaloosa Alabama Adrien Woolly a transfer from Kennesaw State Payne trying to work the baseline Capki able to save it and score it Beautiful pass from Fred Payne Bowden Capy Bit of an Xfactor for this BC team Hes now started the last two games Averages almost nine points per game Ali taken in by Shaw Ali Khalifa hit five threes in the Duke game Four in the first half He he had made five all season coming into that game He was made four in the first half Staked him to a 10point lead but once Louisville cooled off from three Duke was able to make its comeback But Khalifa was unbelievable especially in that first half In just 20 minutes off the bench he was five for five in threepointers And Rogers connects music for Louisville Thats a victory because it came out of the half court offense and Louisvilles going to have to execute some half court today cuz BC is going to be very intent on managing this tempo Rogers coming back after a knee injury missed all of 2025 and now has his seventh made three of the season Payne with a little daylight for Boston College for the lefty Boston College all kinds of offensive confidence right now eight for 14 57 and by far the worst offensive team in the ACC coming in Way above their season average of 40 shooting for the year for BC Cardinals trying to go back door into the corner Roots Kappy on the weak side Uncontested now two for eight from three Louisville And GC music did not get it across midcourt in time without any defensive pressure A 10second violation Now we music have truly seen it all Jayforte in disbelief for the Eagles Back inside KFC Yum Center is what we look forward to the first Saturday in May Last years winner Sovereignty at the Derby 1913 BC shooting the lights out so far music Seth Yeah and thats definitely top of mind game plan for BC If you shoot a high percentage of Louisville music obviously you get the points which is great but along with that benefit is it takes out their ability to run There you see London Johnson Hes the guy weve been talking about a lot of chatter about him a couple of months ago when he came on having come from the G League and it wasnt until about 48 hours ago they decided that he is available to play today got his uh tshirt on and just so people understand the rule that is allowing him to play potentially has always been there this is not a new rule its certainly being applied in a different climate the difference is the London Johnsons of the world now want to play in college because they can make money and so its not the rules that have changed is the incentives Thats why youre seeing couple of other GLeague players and James Naji at Baylor whos actually been drafted into the NBA Not new rules new incentives Theres money to be made in college By the way Louisville will play Baylor later in the season Thatll be fun Amongst their ACC schedule had the last basket at the rim Now hes got the steal for Louisville Hes good in the open court too He struggled against Duke Hes been a factor in the first half so far will kick it back out Prior Boston College has it Prior has really been struggling not only with his game but his health coming off an ACL tear about 12 and 12 months ago Still working his way back BC trying to add to the threepoint total Theyre going to be cautious about sending too many guys to the offensive glass as well because that opens up transition opportunities for Louisville That thats the whole name of the game for Boston College Limit Louisvilles transition opportunities by not turning over and being efficient on offense Two things they have not done all season Shaw picked up the foul for Boston College BC seven and eight on the season 0 and2 in conference play Cards went 182 in the 20ame schedule of last year McNeely off the curl misses on the three attempts McNeely now 0 for four from three He was one for five against Duke A career 42 threepoint shooter Payne shakes the defender threw over top got it to Prior Got to have amnesia as a threepoint shooter but it helps to make a couple Remember Louisville against Duke this week at home Number six Duke had a ninepoint lead at halftime It did not end up in the second half when Duke shot 71 as a team So it back out to Capki Thats the first time this season Louisville lost the game having the halftime lead Payne with the shot clock at 10 Forte misses Long rebound poked into the back court Nice job by Hastings to get to that ball Excuse me Aiden Shaw with the tip Hadleys back into the lineup for Louisville Taves in there as well Eight points for Taves Leads the Eagles right now In fact he leads all scorers FU has six for Louisville Capki from Taves Fight on the weak side is won by Prior Loss on Tuesday at home 8473 to Duke And now Louisville turns it over Duke had three players score 20 points or more in that victory for the highest ranked ACC team In fact there are five ACC teams ranked in the top 25 after sending four to the tournament last year Yeah Well I mentioned about Ali Khalifa though He had four of those made threes two for 17 in the second half Their their half court offense is so out of sync right now without Conwell in there Ryan Conwell who averages just a shade under 20 points per game out with a knee injury missing his first game of the season He had started every game prior to today After the miss from Taves the foul goes against Boston College in the fight for the loose ball Theyre going to get Hastings there on the battle Second on Hastings Again youd rather as long as they dont pile up youd rather a foul than a defensive rebound Three OT losses this season so far for BC at Florida Atlantic against Tain and against LSU in the ACC SEC challenge In fact they havent won an overtime game since 2022 Midweek loss to NC State at home for the Eagles at Connie Forum Hadley series of moves determined to get the shot away and he gets a nice roll Javon Hadley playing in his 121st career collegiate game this afternoon and all of a sudden we got a twopoint game Payne he rips the ropes for the Eagles who had missed their last five shots All threepoint attempts Payne cashes in Thats really good movement getting that defense moving from side to side and now you get caught in a switch And poor communication on that ball screen but Freddy Payne making some threepoint shots here today Boston College offense is hanging in there Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented music by All State Two for 10 Isaac McNeely 0 for four If theres one thing that Pat Kelsey would love is to get Isaac McNeely cooking from three because without their best two starting guards their halfcourt offense is really disjointed They need McNeely to get some looks but thats why BCs leading And some shooting doesnt hurt either Haynes another reason as he knocks down another three ball for Boston College His second made three Hes got 12 Isaac McNeely has made 275 career threepointers screaming See Fred Pane getting around that ball screen from Kapki And Ruth was a little bit late Fred Payne the red shirt sophomore from Gramling Louisiana Hes almost doubled his scoring output from a season ago And another miscommunication by Louisville I know Ive said it six or seven times Im Id like to stop saying it but Louisvilles half court offense is pretty much a disaster right now Understandably so If youre just joining us Ryan Conwell out with a knee injury Mikel Brown Jr missing his sixth game in a row with a back injury So a wrinkle in that lineup for Louisville Something they did not want to have to do today as Brian Conwell was a decision right before this game and he could not go with the knee injury Hadley into the paint has to kick it out move turns it over once again as Roots lost the handle Five turnovers in the first half for the Cardinals BC happy to run that clock Earl Grant said We want to play it at a BC pace and get higher quality shots And thats exactly what theyve done so far in the first 20 minutes Taves was dribbling near the sideline in a finalist call Thats Kobe Rogers College Rogers the red shirt senior from Cincinnati Ohio who got his first start tonight because of the injuries that weve documented Sixpoint Boston College lead Theyve led by as many as seven so far in the first half Dont forget theyve won four of the last five meetings between the teams Payne driving into the lane How about Payne now 14 points in the first half Six of nine shooting for Payne on the interior Louisville gets a little bit back Really a good screen and roll with the finishing side I think thats a good way for Louisville to go Not working on the outside trying to get him on the inside Not only score but get him in foul trouble Kapi comes over late on the help and hes out of position Foul on Kapki Zugurus at the free throw line Just his eighth free throw of the season Hes exceeded his season average in scoring which was two Hes got three now Well I think its indicative of the way this game has gone that Pat Kelsey is looking to mix things up Still has not gone to London Johnson off the bench even with the disjointed offense Zugarus is seeing action in just his 10th game this season cheering Capy baseline around the defender Kaps a really active big guy can shoot it from outside He can put it on the deck He can spin you inside I think as a general rule Boston College would do well to get him more involved in the offense so they dont have to just rely on hand and pain But given the way that Freddy Payne has planned today with that 14 points here in the first half Boston College is little little bounce in their step A lot of confidence right now for these Eagles Been a rough road music for them this season Taves picked up the foul for BC He goes to the bench with eight points on three of four shooting and that includes a made threepointer College has four made threes Yeah Tay has just given him an unbelievable first half there I mentioned about Freddy Payne having a careerhigh 24 against North Carolina State He was 1 for13 against Georgia Tech the game before So up and down but hes up for the second straight game Thats a charge I thought Louisville ends up with it on the run Woolly center to Rogers for three Thats off target Fight inside Close in miss there from Woolly When you look at this game and the way its going you say Louisville would do well to throw it into the post and get more paint touches but its just not what theyve been doing all season They are a threepoint shooting basketball team In the half court in the transition off the bus in the kitchen anywhere theyre looking for threes Capki Hayne in the corner Shot clocks at three Quick glance gives it up BCs ball movement has been so good Didnt get the bucket but everybodys getting a touch Somehow Louisvilles got to try to figure this thing out Going insides a good way for them to go Stolen by BC and Shaw Kapy to the rim Doublefisted rim rocker for Kapki Bowden Capki That is how you flush it Big fella running the break If youre going to wear number 33 in Boston laughter I dont see how you got to bring it I dont know what I saw Larry do Larry did a lot of great things about that Theres a great pass from Khalifa the Egyptian magician Best passing big man in college basketball Let him play the point guard Sweet play from the Cardinals for two at the other end 3124 We go inside of three minutes to go in our first half of action And weve had plenty of that Hand Hes got a three Everything working right now for Boston College Both ends Second three of the game for hand as the ball goes out of bounds Well check on the aftermath of that How about Capki The rule is when the big fella runs the floor you better reward him getting ahead of everybody and finishing Boston College from three and now hes hit double digits 12 of the last 14 games for the Eagles And he leads him in made threes this season with 34 Donald Han had a careerhigh six turnovers in that game And he only has one turnover today Hes got six points Luca Tays eight points So you know different players go through fluctuations over the course of a season up and down I talk about Isaac McNeely being cold So if youre an athlete and you see a couple of balls go in early and as a team you see that ball go in early everybodys got confidence Everybodys on the same page Everybodys touching the ball locked in defensively managing Louisvilles transition opportunities They smell blood in the water here 15 Thats his first Khalifa picks up his first personal foul And I I am frankly surprised we havent seen London Johnson yet We may not see him today As I said they dont technically have to play him And he his red shirt is not burned until he enters a game And talking to Pat Kelsey yesterday Tom he talked about I mean hes been on campus for four weeks but hes been practicing with the scout team He doesnt even know like the terminology Theyre in the film room trying to discuss what hes going to do and what language they use Hes a good player He hasnt played in a competitive game since March so hes not in game shape Ideally if this was going to be a blowout win for Louisville you could throw him in there but down eight Im not sure a pass ready to take a chance on him Pay denied entry Had to give it back Miss on the shot from Shaw And then the larger concern is when do you get Muel Brown Jr back cheering Hard to tell with back injuries And now we get an offensive foul on Prior in the open court So yet another turnover for Louisville That is their seventh Prior who only played seven games last year because of a knee league of an injury in his second year in the Louisville program Played at South Florida Boise State for a couple of seasons Nice job by Chase Forte stepping in there I thought that was a good call BC last year struggled to a 4 and6 ACC record They are giving Louisville all it can handle this afternoon in KFC Yum Center You want to stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru Love Its what makes Subaru Subaru A preview of game two Stanford Virginia womens basketball coming up tomorrow on this very same court Highlights of stash from our first 20 minutes of Louisville and Boston College So glad that youre with us for the final 120 Tom Wy Seth Davis our outstanding production crew on CW Courtside Saturday from Louisville Kentucky Foul coming up against the Eagles Its going to be on Aiden Shaw for bodying up Prior inside Again its going to be interesting to see Louisville manage maybe a little bit of a personality change over the course of this game Say Hey I think we can beat these guys inside I think we can score inside That includes their guards They got some big guards who can you can invert them and play in the post So there there is a template there but it is not one theyve been following really the last two years since Pat Kelsey got here Louisville in the bonus for prior at the free throw line two of seven on the season from the stripe and he adds one there Grad student from Chicago Illinois 610 230 and a forward for the Cards Stops at Boise State South Florida Told you about the injury last year limiting his action Hes got a couple of free throws How about BC has led by as many as 10 in this first 20 minutes of play And Louisville cranking up the fullourt pressure Try to create some turnover opportunities Final minute for DC Thats taking the bait Pull it out and run the clock Thats exactly what Louisville wants you to do Radonovich missed close to the rim and then Pat Kelsey decides to call a timeout with 517 seconds remaining in our first half 3428 music Boston College has led for the vast majority of this first half BC shooting 44 Cardinals at 40 shooting but just two of 11 on threepoint tries for Louisville 5 for 15 from music Boston College So you make three more threes Louisvilles made five more free throws This Tuesday NXT on the CW is all chaos and no music mercy when Joe Hendry takes on Dion Lennox in a no disqualification match WWE NXT Tuesday 87 central right here on the CW Pat Kelsey and the Cards trailing the visiting Boston College music Eagles Kelsey took his team up to Massachusetts last year and won on the road music ACC coach of the year music in his first year in the league making the tournament championship game Lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Kraton in the dreaded 89 game as Louisville was the A seed Kraton the nine seed That was in Lexington Woolly Patience Exactly what Im talking about Is it bully ball or is it Woolly ball Either way its a bucket Pat Kelsey drove up lots of actions in that in that timeout huddle there and it ended up being just a straightup clear out for Woolly BC will maintain possession on the baseline with Marco Ratanovic Freshman from Montenegro on the inbounds Given the way this first half is going for Louisville to only be down four pretty good 14 points from Fred Payne The question is whether or not Louisville can put on one of their bursts Remember their patented spurts and try to get a little bit of separation Great first 20 minutes from Boston College Lets see if they can close it out Shot clock down to seven for the Eagles About a sixse second difference Shot and game fumbled in the paint Kapy got it Chance for the Eagles not getting the shot away It was Donald Han who had it last and could not force the shot up I think he sensed the shot clock was winding down but I I think he may have thought he had a little bit more time than he did Good job by Louisville locking in there getting on the floor right there Han could pull the trigger Cardinals final seconds Theyre on a twoame losing streak Woolly who led them in scoring in the first half never got the shot away Woolly had eight points How about Fred Payne and the Eagles He has 14 and its a fourpoint lead for Boston College As good of a 20 minutes of basketball as Boston College has had all year Louisville obviously out of sorts with the injuries to Brown and Conwell The game is going at Boston Colleges pace Theyre making buckets Theyre taking care of the ball Only lead by four but given the way things have gone for the Eagles they will take it And Pat Kelsey and his staff they got some figuring music out to do in this halftime locker room How are we going to adjust and win this March of 2024 the loss here was the last win for BC at Louisville Been talking a lot about London Johnson the GLeague recruit Louisville came out of locker room for layup lines London Johnson has not taken off his tshirt He was standing on the baseline watching the players going through layup lines I think Pat Kelsey has already decided he is not playing in this game They have announced they did say that they made the decision he is not red this season cheering which was the plan And Jaden Hastings with the alley finish at the beginning after a missed three from the corner BC stole it back Theyve done it again Payne got rid of the defender and Payne lays it in Complete unforced turnover by Kobe Rogers And Boston College with a quick start And heres another one Thats going to be a charge Easily cheering easily called Blown opportunity by Donald Han You got to do better than that Second foul on Han An aggressive drive results to the offensive foul I mean all you got to do is slide around and what a missed opportunity to have a quick six nothing burst Hes not even I mean thats thats almost targeting if were in football Kobe Rogers absorbing the contact Missed opportunity But how about this start for BC popped around inside able to score it That is the path to victory Its at the rim Start there and then build your way out I mean nice to get Isaac Manily to get McNeely to get some buckets going too Hes an outstanding threepoint shooter Was 0 for four in the first half F and Woolly lead the Cards in scoring with eight apiece F made the play on the defensive end with a block and then the Cardinals throw it out of bounds right near head coach Pat Kelsey Its almost like in Space Jam when like Charles Barkley couldnt catch the ball I feel like thats what Im been watching Louisville all season It starts with Sander Fu Sinander at the rim and that gets you a transition opportunity And then Javon Hadley throws it over to Pat Kelsece Again completely understandable with your guards out And they didnt have a lot of time to practice without Ryan Conwell either Fu is the leading shot blocker for this Louisville team this season Hes got 20 now on the year Caves who contributed in the first half Hell contribute with an assist to Payne right in front of his own bench So funny how shooters get super hot super cold That that rim must look huge to Fred Payne right now How about 19 points for Payne at the other end Its Hadley with a threepoint response Finally gets one to go Fans here in the Yum want something to cheer about Theyre ready This side of the corner for the Eagles in hand with the Fu in the open court The other way too strong off the glass Foul was called in the aftermath What a weapon to have a big man who can rip and run like Sandanda Fu Get that defensive rebound You dont need the outlet pass Nobody to throw to as you can see I mean thats all of 611 drawing the foul The 22yearold in his first year in the Louisville program Berlin Germany played four seasons of professional club basketball in Germany before joining the Cardinals A lot of talk about GLeaguers and James Naji getting drafted in the NBA but there are a lot of international players like Samantha Fu who a few years ago might not have been declared eligible to play in college basketball But more to the point Tom would have even wanted to come because they can more make more money in Europe So college basketball has really been blessed with the addition of all of these incredible international players Leading shot blocker and rebounder this season for Louisville Ball goes out of bounds And to the Eagles leading 4136 The one area of the game that Louisville does have an edge is in the paint 204 right now Going to have to do a mini personality transformation But again heres the fullourt pressure and maybe try to create very little offense off your defense Outrebounding the opponent a good indicator for the Cardinals this season They are nine and one in that situation Second leading rebounding team in the ACC Pay the rocket HOLE AS IT SWATTED away by Fu Louisville switching everything one through four When you have Sander Fu who can move his feet like that at 611 Look at him keeping up with the little guy without fouling music Payne forcing it there Youre better off kicking out You got Luca Tay there waiting wide open on the three Didnt get it to him BC will keep it on the inbounds Second block of the game and in the second half for Fu Fred Payne now up to 19 points four rebounds three assists Tapki little followway soft shot and it misses Kapi had a thunderous twohanded dunk in the first half Woolly musling his way into the paint determined to get to the rim Foul was called Boston College did a good job getting back Theyre not going to send a ton of guys to the offensive glass cuz you dont want to get caught back in transition Adrien Willys done a really nice job today using his physicality Kappy picked up the personal foul for Boston College Hes got two now with Adrien Woolly at the free throw line the sophomore And this is something to watch because right now Louisville has a 7 to1 edge in free throws made Now 8 to one So thats an area where they can make up some ground on a day when the threes are not falling And at the same time you get BC into foul trouble Now their front court minutes are limited and guys get in foul trouble They cant guard as hard Thats the way out of the wilderness Cards kept it alive off the free throw miss Adley Whit wants the onehanded jam Kavi went up to meet him in midair mind you and is going to pick up a couple of quick fouls Now hes got three Three on Kavki Three on Hastings Who says were a finesse team Were going to attack the rim all day long and beat you with our muscle Some life in KFC Young This is how we do it Javon Hadley 61 from the stripe on the season Tomorrow CW Womens Hoops returns as Pit looks to pull a major upset They visit number 10 Louisville right here KFC Young Center CW Womens Hoops Pit against number 10 Louisville tomorrow 2 pm Eastern 11 am Pacific Its only on the CW Here comes the pressure from the ball Broken skillfully by the Eagles Steager who just came into the game misses from tight range And here comes Louisville F with a lot of dribbling for the big man Great denial on the wings by BC McNeely found taking it to KKY with the three personal fouls Trying to hold his cant do it Fu off the square He knew exactly what he was doing going at the defender with three He knows theres no way that guys going to pick up his fourth on me And we are tied cheering Boston College leading the entire distance until right now Everybody up in the front row here at KFC Young Center Shot clock is at eight for the Eagles Taves cheering Nifty dribble and hesitation for Tav The miss applause McNeely unloads for three Batted around Roof was ready to go off on this building 0 for five for McNeely Once he gets a couple to go it could be off to the races He has not scored in the game Cards trying to back it on down with roots and it was contact Tied at 41 Louisville and Boston College KFC Young Center on the CW Colleges two starting bigs Jaden Hastings and Bowden Kapki both have three fouls each Boston College clearly cooled off in the second half at 30 So this is going to be a game where Louisville will probably take might take the fewest threepoint attempts that it has taken in any game all season Remember Conwell averages 10 attempted threes a game You see Roots attacking the rim and uh through with the follow even though it didnt go Thats the formula for Louisville and I think they are in very good position right here for the last 15 minutes Even though were tied starting to not feel that way Dont forget the Cards a team that averages almost 90 points per game Thats second most in the ACC Boston Colleges half court offense is going to have to be absolutely on point right now And thats a really bad miss from Donald Han DCs margin for error starting to get a little small Kapy has the rebound Dont like that shot Go inside Go inside Go inside Pass or the drive BC now six of 19 on threepoint attempts with the hand miss last time down the court for the Eagles Freddy Payne getting a blow on that DC bench Shaw off the entry pass and a foul was called Hadley defending second personal Thats his second first team foul into the cards Ali Ka grad student from St Paul Minnesota Second year in the Louisville program after transferring from Colorado off the inbounds Steager elevates and hits Beautiful baseline out of bounds Important bucket for BC Caleb Steer the freshman from Dallas Texas who averages just under four points per game Khalifa is open for three for Louisville Hose him down Six threes against Duke Had made five all season long Thatll help Does have over 100 made threes in his career Can hit that shot and he just did And Louisville has its first lead of the game thanks to the three by Ali Khalifa Foul coming up Ali Khalifa has not played major minutes in this game The hard screen the pick and pop Kapki is late on the rotation He loves that spot Actually banked one in to start the Duke game and that got him going Willy off of his fingertips Hadley had it for a second Boston College crashing crashing the glass with Forte and he couldnt get it up on the rim Woolly has two defenders It spins off the front of the rim That could be the fourth on Capi Thats exactly what that is Tommy starting to pile up Adrien Will it looked like he was trying to slow up Maybe a little bit of a push off Forte Cap Thats one where you just got to let him go Getting your fourth is not an option You need to not get your fourth more than you need to prevent that too And line for the cars number 14 Willie Hill shoot Two shots for Woolly Louisville in front by one That is an 84 free throw shooter at the line for Louisville Captain is officially out of the game Now Louisville is going to be in the bonus the last 1323 Only two team fouls for the Cardinals So Hastings into the BC lineup for Capki It is one of two for Willie Forte brings it up for Boston College Hand Thats a three for hand Really nice flare screen there from Jaden Hastings Flared off Kesan Prior gave Han the space that he needed Nobody takes more threes Nobody makes more threes for Boston College than Donald Han Jr In and out for Woolly Khalifa had it Knocked away defensively by Hastings Beautiful block BC on the run hand aggressively to the rim and hes earned some free throws as McNeely fouled him first on McNeely You see Jaden Hastings hes going to be strong with his body getting the block with those three fouls Little bit of a risk and then hand attacking McNeely in the open court I think its good for Boston College to attack in transition when they can If you dont get the bucket then you pull it out and run some clock Early clock late clock Looks like Neil got cut up a little bit Hes going to go over to the bench checking his left elbow See Payton SA on the Louisville bench Hero of that 2013 NCA tournament champion music School history to go along with 86 at 80 Yeah I was joking with him yesterday at practice Given the way things are going maybe hes still got some eligibility left given the way things are going at Louisville Pat Kelsey may want to put him in or his former coach Rick Patino at St Johns needs a point guard Call Pton SA We can get that done Last year was the 40th trip to the NCAA tournament for this storied Louisville program Been to the final four eight times Sweet 16 17 times Won the NIT back in 1956 as well What a history for Louisville Boston College trying to return to the NCAA tournament upgrade climb this season for the first time since 09 Free throw attempt from Han Jr rims out Donald Han with that hitch in his in his free throw form Started off bad from the line was uncomfortable cheering Put that hitch in there Dont try this at home kids Look at that Dont do that Ball went in Works for him Repetition is the mother of learning If you practice it enough itll work Definitely unconventional but Boston College has taken a gut punch Back up by two They got to manage this foul trouble Thats going to be the big story for them the last 12 and a half But theyre right in this thing Roots guarded by hand aggressively Really good defensive set right now for BC McNeely trying to circumvent the Boston College defense Lost the handle Hit the deck Shot clocks at three Woolly may have been deflected Best defensive possession of the game for Boston College Everybody completely locked in and connected Forte the grad student from Raleigh North Carolina and his teammates hanging tough with the cards at KFC Young Center Ham Nobody going to the glass for Boston College again Better to get back make them score in the half court They havent really done it today Four of 16 on three quarters now Four of 17 for Louisville Team that makes over 12 per game on average to lead the league Foul on the jump shot by hand Roots picks up his first contesting the shot by hand Well step music aside for a moment Boston College back in front 4745 on CW Quickside Saturday How does nice long rest over there I hope hes rested up because of Grant I am not taking him out Boston College got to kind of hang on here Ive been talking about this foul situation Theyre in the bonus Louisville has only committed four team fouls but if youre Louisville thats not relevant unless you get to the line And to do that you got to stay on the attack Nobody gets to the line more for the Eagles than Donald Han Jr 15 and a half points per game on average to lead the team cheering Aiden Shaw is in the game now up front for Boston College Kapys on the bench with those four fouls Jaden Hastings also on the bench Hes got three So a smaller lineup here for Earl Grant which I think helps them defensively But Louisvilles got to try to make him pay down low There you see Earl Grant one of the really good guys in the business Hes got a very very difficult job at Boston College in this era of revenue sharing and NIL BCs resources God bless them is are just way way behind whats happening around the country 12 points for Han Jr A straight came into double digits in scoring McNeely uncors a three and hits the target There it is Smacks his hands together Will that open the floodgates if he can bang in a couple of those get a little bit of separation Maybe the cards will be in business First main three of the game for Isaac McNeely in his first points Starts defending by Louisville cheering Forces a deep threepoint attempt for Boston College Shar did an outstanding job denying the ball to Freddy Payne and then getting back to the rim An outstanding mobile defender Looping entry pass Dangerous and stolen by the Eagles You got to fire that ball in there Fred Pay 19 points leads everybody Eight of 12 from the floor That includes three threepoint baskets for number five in Maroon You got to take advantage of the small lineup that BCs got in there Fancy dribble Shot clocks at five They got McNeely on him Steager trying to force his way to the rim Recovering defensively with Roots to get a piece tonight Roots has been outstanding these last two defensive possessions Willie had it blocked by Shaw And so Louisville will keep possession and trailing by one What a weapon when you have a 610 guy who can guard the dribbler Move with him block him at the rim Look at the athleticism the extension No foul call I think thats a good no call So Woollys at the free throw line They assess the foul to Shaw Thats his third with Woolly at the stripe So every front court player for BC has at least three and hes got four Hastings coming back in tied at 49 after the free throw by Woolly Leaving Shaw in there So you look at Louisville theyve got Kaman Ruths theyve got Saman Fu Looks like Steen is going to come out for BC Louisvilles had to shuffle its lineup today as well Score Ryan Conwell out with a knee injury Mel Brown Jr missing his sixth straight game with a back injury Kobe Rogers is back into the lineup for Louisville Woolly after the free throws leaves and its a onepoint Louisville lead You get the sense Seth Davis who can go right down to the wire this afternoon between the Eagles and Cards That is my sense and my hope Frank came all this way Right What a fantastic basketball game Long flight from LA Man I want to see a game Eagles trying to get to the rim with Shaw Foul committed by Roots is second So much of college basketball I always see this during the NCA tournament is winning the style battle Theres matchups Theres different ways to win Different teams want to play at different pace different areas of the court different parts of the game From the moment this game tipped off stylistically it cheering has been a Boston College basketball game Four of eight as a team from the line for the Eagles with their fifth year head coach Ear Grry cheering Tied at 50 after the free throw Fifth tie of the game BC had a fourpoint lead at halftime 3430 McNeely against Taves Shovels it to Hadley down the lane with a scoop out of bounds Boston College basketball And AJ Desai was right on top of that call on the baseline Watch this ball go out Looked like the right call No review no challenge no appeal Coaches can challenge provided they have a timeout remaining in the game The officials can go to the monitor Last two minutes of regulation in overtime but it is only for the restricted arc or basketball interference Taves double team He tried to call a timeout Arrow favors Louisville Didnt get it in time Santa tried to call timeout Thats still better than a turnover though Anything to keep the Cardinals from running I love Pat Kelseys demeanor on the sideline He always has great energy but its positive energy No panic over there from here Hes coaching up his guys He knows if he doesnt have his two best players in this game Took college at Charleston to the NCAA tournament twice before taking over at Louisville McNeely is open for three and its money from McNeely Thats where hes at his best Catch and shoot coming off the screen not off the dribble and not driving to the rim 84 of his shots come from three And thats why 44 made threes on the season for Isaac McNeely Payne for three from Boston College Grown man screed from Jaden Hastings What an answer Fourth made three of the game for Payne with 22 points Willy looking for some help in the corner There he is again McNeely provides it for three and McNeely was fouled on the threepoint attempt Much like hand a moment ago for BC hell go to the line and thats four on Eden Shaw Thats a double whammy When a guy gets hot you see him lunging out there on the close out Youve got to keep your hands your feet on the ground for a closeout on a threepoint shooter For the number So McNeely at the line for the first time in the game Hes got three free throws Hes 86 Seth but prior to that he been to the line just 22 times this season Well hes a specialist Thats what he was three years at Virginia Threepoint percentage a little bit down from where its been in the past but still 39s pretty good Attempts about seven a game So you can see why Pat Kelsey wanted him in out of the portal Bruce is back into the Louisville lineup as Javon Hadley goes to the Kelsey bench Watch Kai Ruths on Louisvilles defensive set Hes their queen piece on the defense It looks like hes going to check Fred Payne cheering There are not a lot of 610 guys who are going to try to check Fred Payne but now they got to switch off of them Theyre switching everything And now Louisville leads by three Nowhere to go for Taves Guarded by Willie Shot cheering clock is at six Taves on the hop Roots the rebound Sophomore from Washington DC with the basketball for the Cards Entry pass Fu sent it right back out Woolly into the paint over the front of the rim for Roots Cards by five in a timeout Boston College standing ovation for the Cardinals And youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State 5853 the Bill And then the free throw line has been huge 16 to five So plus 11 Louisville on the line and plus five on the scoreboard Six made threes for the game for the Cards Eight made threepointers including four from Fred Payne for Boston College as we approach the sevenminute threshold It is Payne Heres that small lineup again for BC with Aiden Shaw at the five Lets see if Louisville can take advantage at the rim Cards have a 10point advantage in the paint as well Nearly just throws it up for grabs though through it over the front rim Take advantage of that size They pulled Hastings away from the basket to clear out some space Heres that separation DCs in trouble partner 13 points for Fu cheering Oh Fred Pay didnt know the ball was coming back Oh thats the worst kind of mistake you can make right now Worst kind of mistake you can make right now Total miscommunication cheering N0 run now for Louisville And BC is not the kind of team that can come back on you fast cheering They need some points in the worst way on this possession Staring six minutes to go squarely in the face cheering This has been so like BC season Theyve been competitive in a lot of games High five to six minutes have been disastrous for them I mean how tough a shot for BC from Han Jr He almost made it Scrap on the floor Its going to stay with the Eagles 6253 cards in front Yeah you can see it Just Fred Payne didnt know the ball was coming back for him Adrian Willie gets the easiest deuce of the night A little French pastry on the finish that Tom by being the more physical team 16 to music five plus 11 on the foul line plus 14 points in the paint music And it helps to be more efficient from the threepoint line Four for eight in the second half after going two for 11 in the first And now BCs got to find some way to dig themselves out of this hole without turning it over and not fueling this run They do music have plenty of time but the way they play youre not going to have a ton of possessions here Youve got to execute in your half court offense Sandu has a double double for Louisville 13 points 10 boards Second of the season and career for him defending for the C Kapy in there with the four personals leaning towards the rim and a foul was called Jeff Pond was right on top of it to make the call Yeah Well the defender was not I dont think in legal guarding position at that point But the question is the way he cleared out space at the top You see Roots there on the move Well I dont know That could that definitely could have been offensive Youre allowed to move with the dribbler That was a bang bang call Six points for Captain at the free throw line for the first time this afternoon Billy we know how the folks here cheering in Louisville felt about the call Maybe ball dont lie there Its a misconception to say the defenders not allowed to move That is not true As long as you got two feet on the floor and youre facing the dribbler youre absolutely entitled to move You have to be very lucky still in this basketball game and he missed them both So maybe the ball really is truthful Mr Rasheed Wallace Five of 11 from the line for Boston College in the game McNeely has come alive with the three ball in the second half after struggling in the first 20 minutes Fruit trying to put it on the floor Ky has it Going to get to the rim Can roofs return to sender What hustle Winning play And now Woolly in the corner What a defensive weapon Kai Roots is He can guard anybody including Tom Wormy Fru Tough to guard Mustling his way in for two as he battled with Hastings on the interior Incredible sequence for Louisville Started with that rooouch block and the two missed free throws from Capki cheering 15 points for crew Six of seven from the floor Easy to steer at the rim Havent seen much of that today from BC Nice dish from Donald Han Jr Cats that with two hands kept alive in the corner Four and a half minutes to go in regulation Willie both sides of the rim and out Stinger hauls it in for BC If theres a formula for a comeback for the Eagles got to involve hand cheering McNeely on them Foul against Louisville That was the right call but they should have gotten in the ball sooner Second on McNeely You got Hastings You got McNeely You got to get in the ball sooner Thats Thats McNeely moving up into the dribbler that thing Youre not going to get that call My friend there disagrees Im glad the fans cant hear me when I agree with the refs Just about everybodys standing up at this point with 415 to go in regulation Both of these teams working off short twoame losing streaks It was a home loss for Louisville midweek against Duke where they had a sizable lead at halftime Three straight missed free throws and Hastings is just 57 from the line of the season for BC Cathy missed a couple Hastings a miss Rogers handles with a ninepoint lead Great switch by Hastings but hes reached in He was in position and he reached in on him And thats going to be number four on him slightly overzealous in the foul on Hastings 6455 The Cardinals have the lead and KFC Yum Center on the CW Louisville has absolutely made the pay at the foul line You go 5 for 12 Theyre already a bad foul shooting team but they do make 68 on the season And thats 293rd in the country And theyre well below that today Youre trying to steal one here on the road against a vulnerable opponent You cant go five for 12 from the foul line Although apparently you can All of McNeelys points I should say you shouldnt In the second half he was 05 from the floor and 0 for four from threepoint distance Now after the free throws McNeely with 11 Hadley with 11 15 for F Willie with 14 Now BCs got to get in hurry up mode They need to that one That helps big time He was big in the first half Thats his first bucket of the second Is there enough for BC to make this happen Double digits with 11 now for Taves Rogers may have stepped half court McNeely off the curl Catch and release Bounces out right to put the shoulder down and put the basketball in How about Fu in this second half Hes collected his second double double of the season against Cali He had 13 points and 14 rebounds That was a careerhigh backing in Fu held his ground And Fu had an outstanding basketball game today from Louisville Eligibility wise hes a junior international player from Berlin First year in the program one of those big skilled European guys who just makes you better in so many ways Blue guy McNeely Thatll just about do it partner 12point lead for the Cardinals Louisville is going to finish this game having attempted fewest threepointers of the season without their point guard without their leading score at Conwell Captain on the on the bounce drive into Fu They got London Johnson They say hes not going to red shirt Did not play today Give him a couple of more days in practice Throw him into the mix Get Conwell back Get Brown back and you got something going Your bottom line for today is just get the heck out of here with a win Any way you can do it I mean Ryan Conwell fifth leading scoreer in the ACC almost 20 points per game Thats a lot to make up for Hes such a dynamic offensive player Tom Quintessential threelevel score Burns you from three gets to the cup sets up his guys Just a veteran player 119 games in college first year of the Louisville program transfer from Xavier had 24 points team high in the loss against Duke Well the good news is you know when they look at the knee with an Xray and MRI everything was sound structurally but a lot of swelling Watching practice yesterday you had it wrapped limped a little bit Hopefully hes not going to be out for too long Yeah Louisville will play Virginia coming up next Theyre part of our double header as we take a look at todays player of the game Its brought to you by Progressive Insurance Progressive offers 247 protection You bundle auto home and motorcycles Learn more at progressivecom Yeah Sana Fruit did everything but call playbyplay Hey hold on now I know he thats one thing thats one thing he cant do best in the building Everything else he pretty much did Scoring at the rim and really gave Louisville their size and physical advantage in the paint at both ends And thats what won in the basketball game Usually its a threepoint shot Cant get much more efficient than that Seven for eight from the floor those 13 rebounds And his defensive presence along with Kennai Ruths their ability to switch off guys guard really every position on the floor and even step out and make a threepointer which he did One of those makes was from three And you know for Fu quite a response from the Duke game earlier this week where he played just 14 minutes fewest amount of minutes he had played in a game all season had two points and four rebounds took one shot and made it Its a different story today against Boston College for 13 and white Yeah Well much different having to go up against Cam Boozer and what he was able to do to them 27 points and and Ali Khalifa we talked about him making those six three five six music threes five in the first half So Pat Kelsey rode the hot hand there but Drew has been a grown man today Louisville had lost at Stanford on January 2nd They lost Tuesday against Duke This is going to stop the short twogame losing streak And theyll be five and three in their last eight games with two minutes remaining And an outstanding second half of play for the Cardinals who trail by four points to BC They only scored 30 points in the first half Team that averages close to 90 per game Woolly just shoving the defender out of the way and he got whistled Thats making it easy on the refs with that call Hes had a good game though today Adrien Woolly not super efficient 0 for four from three but hes been really good driving the basketball 6 for8 from the foul line Points in the paint Louisvilles also been dominant 346 3928 on the boards as well for the Cardinals That shot may have been deflected on the attempt by hand So Louisville appears to be on its way to its 12th win of the season Theyll level the conference record at 22 and improve to 9 and one at home and get their first home conference victory Shot clock is down to four for against Kappy Its just all caving in on the Eagles here in the most recent minutes as Kapki is fouled out Very fitting that you go to Sandanda F to put the Sharpie on the win Hes been that guy all game Looks Kapy is Dairy Queen So Kapky I think thought he fouled out as did many people in the building He was walking towards the BC bench He did not get the foul If he was on Aiden Shaw although he was defending through Yeah And if its on Shaw thats going to be his fifth Shaw is Derry Queen As Clark Kellogg would say I got to give credit to my partner BC is going to be disappointed but the score is not going to really reflect it either but technically not a close loss But again Boston College as we told you three OT losses Six of their eight losses this season Theyve had the lead or been tied with a minute to play Not the case today as Louisville pulls away in the latter stages of this second half And its not dissimilar to their losses against Georgia Tech and North Carolina State Competitive in those games staying within contact But you know again I was talking to Earl Clark last night We talked about defense wins championships and thats definitely true But the game is called basketball And if you cant score enough baskets in enough ways especially in 2026 in the pace and space era its just going to be hard to beat good teams Their offense really puts them in a bind 59 points today as you can see And BC only averages 69 and a half points per game with Kappy at the free throw line Eagles are going to drop to seven and n and 0 and three in conference play and 0 and2 in the ACC on the road away from potty for going to have a quick turnaround They got the Virginia Cavaliers coming into town This is not your older brothers Virginia team They like to score get out and go really good international player in Tesa Ritter new coach and Ryan ODM and the ACC is much improved You think about Virginia SMU is better NC State is better Clemson is Clemson We saw them last week Theyre going to send a bunch of teams to the NCA tournament this time Easy drive from Woolly SMU had the win against North Carolina Turned around and lost at Clemson to Brad Brownell and the Tigers whove won six in a row Also keep your eye on Syracuse by the way Donnie Freeman back in the lineup Jay Lucas now Miami Theyve won eight in a row How about Malik Renault and what hes doing down there A lot of good things happening in the ACC for sure after sending just four teams to the tournament last year Although Duke did make the Final Four So weve got 31 seconds to go in this game Shes very much up in the air at halftime Payne The reason BC at one point led by 10 in the first half and had a fourpoint halftime lead its falling apart for Payne and his teammates in the second half So well walk back to the other end of the floor for free throws Payne despite that most recent miss 22 points and that leads everybody in scoring Nine of 15 shooting and four made threes for Fred Payne Well he was cooking in the first half They locked him up in the second Great team awareness by Louisville Best threepoint shooter on the BC Eagles roster Fred Payne Roots at the line And so Payne will exit the game for Boston College with the 22 points to lead all scorers Was just two below his careerhigh of 24 points for Payne Steager lost his footing Kapy grabbed it laid it in Final seconds are going to tick off the clock applause 75 62 Louisville 62 Their head coach Pat Kelsey victorious That is career victory number 300 for coach Kelsey on the bench in his head coaching career But it wasnt always
