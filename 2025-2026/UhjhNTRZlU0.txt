on white zero Well have two shots Rafford basketball onto the basket So first on Kai Evans Meanwhile Jiren Stevenson stays on the bench So the flagrant won and it was because Evans grabbed the arm did

to do their job Favor one So Dennis Parker four of seven at the free throw line this year will go to the strike Still scoreless here Jonathan Powell has come into the ball game And look at the flagrant one Excessive andor unnecessary not legitimate play on the ball There you go He goes from behind and Parker knocks down both free throws So Radfords got the two nothing lead on Carolina and

early in the season applause you kind of when you watch these games you like you watch the Central Arkansas game in the case of Carolina or Western Illinois and West Virginia Westland for Rap you see little nuances but now with the Treble injury for Carolina we talked about this All the things he did offensively and defensively have got to now be cut up and redistributed a little bit No question about it For me its the defense first You know that second half what he did to Darren Peterson someone say Well Darren shot the ball pretty well But if you watch the game he didnt get the same quality shots he had gotten first Here against Block Evans cheering Bovots and Zack cheering Jun needs a timeout Thats that play that gets the crowd going cheering applause Largest leader thing we know but

Thats nine team fouls on Ratford now here in the second half And heres James Brown Turns 21 years old applause on Sunday A year ago 18 games Averaged less than three minutes Young man played in only three of the Tar Hills last nine a season ago And he hit both free throws Two for Brown applause lead is 20 for the first time tonight And jumper missed out of the corner Radford cant control it Itll go back to Carolina And Zack Chus got a couple of other things on his punch list tonight Theyve mixed defense Theyve challenged Carolina with what theyre doing offensively Uhoh missed the layup And heres Parker going the other way and he got tripped going down the floor by Brown So thatll be his first third and a half on Carolina Bradford was picked fourth in the preseason of the Big High Point

Got it back Rafford stripped it out of there Here come the Highlanders on the run Almost to the midway point of this second half And a leaner fell off the iron No good Last couple of minutes Jones had a little juice about it Well and see this is the part about Radfords team that intrigues me You got Parker and Dell Jones who had played in the ACC Now it was interesting to listen to Zach Chu talk about they were guys who were in the building How much did they play in the game Well Dell Jones didnt play in the building because Clemson didnt play here last year Dennis Parker Jr did cuz NC State played in this building Correct The interesting part is you build this team together It takes all types So youve got Tyson Brown from Georgia Southern Dennis Parker from NC State Mari Jordan two lane cheering Dell Jones Clemson Jaylen Johnson Tech Rigbys from Minnesota And thats why to your point its early Yeah When you see this team January when all the parts are figured it out and theyre really bought into what hes selling as I said earlier today when do you take the name tags away You know I mean you got to figure out where the chemistry is And thats what he mentioned Well we thought our defense was ahead cheering of the rough Well now their shot selection has been pretty good tonight Bogots too There you go Hug And likewise for Hug Davis its the same kind of chemistry project And now the added wrinkle for him I think is the treble injury Big time wrinkle Wilson rips that away Heres a loop for Brown That might be a little more than James accustomed to Wilson meanwhile almost gave you two cheering highlights and his last touch by Carolina applause And Hubert Davis wants something a little cleaner than what theyre getting right now at the offensive end He had to take his glasses off make sure he was seeing things properly So I dont see how to put his glasses back on Yeah laughter it might have been a slight erratic for the head coaches here And a foul on James Brown And Jones back to the free throw line Yeah Well Dell Jones is one of those guys where it it feels like he and Johnson and Parker Mhm can be the big three Correct Correct And tonights one of those nights where to your point earlier theyre going to watch the tape and say cheering God we got great shots throughout the game You just missed him Well if he misses this one applause theyre going to hand cookies

Chu or Hubert Davis Youre in game three tonight for both of them Youve seen some things tonight maybe you havent seen in the first two I thought both teams will shoot the ball better overnight Stevenson tried to get a hand on it Got deflected by Ratford So Jiren laid off But to your point pardon when you get into league play the guards get better And thats when the presence of Trimble will really be seen should I say In the case of North Carolina its not league play Its a couple weeks from tonight when theyre going to be playing at Kentucky Oh good point in the ACC SEC challenge Theres a drive and scored by 7 and 124 in the game now for Luca and a turnover by Ratchford Timeout coming 752 to go North Carolina by 21 tonight at Smith Center And amazingly Williams didnt try to punch you

the energy here in the second half when Radford needs somebody to at least try keep cheering it in front as much as they can Great point You want to finish the game strong so it can carry over to the next game Thats one of the things that Coach Chu is still doing Hes still coaching the game with four minutes left being down 21 Yeah because somewhere along the way in this second half therell be things that happen that help his team as they advance in this campaign Well theyre gaining confidence Yeah They can look at this film and say We were in this game and we missed a lot of open shots So
