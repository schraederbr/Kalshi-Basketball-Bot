point Heres Hollowman Donaldson went down Hollowman going to drive Kick for Ael McNeel Another one Spins out This place ready to erupt Oh yeah It was ready to erupt if hed have made that one They know what his calling card is Heres Henderson right by McNeel Couldnt finish They crashed the glass Sier did a good job keeping Uday bay Yes Got to be physical with the big fella Able floater cheering

guys Will Wade has a plan And thats what you love about the first year coaches Arsenal at the line We told you going to break The foul was on Malik Renu It was changed to True Washington during the timeout So true Washington not Renu Renew has one foul Washington has his first after the mark a moment ago Arsenal by the way hits both free throws Hes got four in the game two in each half and NC States back in front 720 to play Kicked into the corner and a three ball from Washington rattles in and true talks to the Wolfpack partisans coming back up the floor Once again poor communication They were in a matchup zone Washington does an excellent job running the baseline No one talked Wide open three 17 lead changes Here we go again Two three to a matchup manto man Arsenal with Donaldson chasing him And hell try and split the defense and then threw it away trying to dump it to Luben Miami front court under seven to play Canes by two Donaldson fighting through Traveled Isaac Barnett The turnover on the Canes Theyre seven Watch this Wes So youre in a two3 zone Watch Copeland Copelands in no mans land right now Then he steps up to renew Washington does an excellent job No communication the backside Big time pass Knock down too late Rotation Arsenal goes out Williams is back Paul McNeels sitting over on the Wolfpack bench too So Abel stays on the floor Copelan Hollowman Luben Williams and the rookie Ael Copelan left open Thats a three Uday the rebound in front of Van Allen Luben Coach Wade has to make a tough decision coming down the stretch Do you go with Hollowman or do you go with Abel and McNeel and move Copeland to the point Cuz they want Copeland to shoot the ball Theres a reason youre wide open And he hit one early Has not hit one since it feels like Right Yep And its Allen knocks down Nice little bunny off the glass But to tell people at home theres a reason youre open Youre not going to leave Ael open Youre not going to leave McNeel open So Copelands the odd man out Miami a fourpoint lead on Dante Allens third field goal Thats what you do Copeland You attack the paint drop it off for easy pass for Luben Dozen now for Ven Allen Luben on five field goals Copeland your defense your intensity and playmaking Kane still with a twopoint lead cheering and got the ball away from Renew And here goes the scrum and Williams and cheering Donaldson And now we got benches kind of emptying here a little bit Although NC States players have stayed in place and Daren Williams is up on his feet Copelan talking with Matt Potter the umpire and the crowd saw the Miami bench since it happened closer to the Kane side of the floor kind of pour out a little bit So the partisans think a technical foul is coming here We get another look at this under review But right here you come off Good hustle by Copelan Renew fighting Donaldsons fighting Everything looks And then you had Williams and Donaldson start to scrum Matt Potter deserves a ton of credit Come on Matt Come on Matt You Thats big time officiating right there Diving in there So everythings clean right there Youre hustling Thats a ball So right there in my opinion Williams kind of overreacts and get Donaldson off of him and thats when the skirmish gets out of hand Yep So do we have just a hell ball with alternating possession belonging to the Wolfpack here or do we have more I think it may be a little bit more but lets give our crew a chance to figure this out cuz I were at a great point in the ball game Twopoint game 544 left And remember the statement made at the table was the previous play is under review Thats all that was said Correct Correct Once again youre youre with Matt I mean I know a lot of times as fans you youre hard on the referees with certain calls but thats a big time move for Matt to dive in there in the scrum with grown men to stop it so it dont get escalated any further Big time for Matt Totally agree Matt Potter with Clarence Armstrong Isaac Barnett is our crew here today in Raleigh as assigned by the Atlantic Coast Conference screaming cheering You see the circumstance of the ball game Twopoint game NC State would have possession So if a hell ball is called it will belong to the Wolfpack cheering screaming Darian Williams and Claire Copelan were the two Wolfpack players in in the fray here So Potter and Armstrong and Barnett talk this over It could be as simple as hell ball Possession would then go to the Wolfpack or it could be a foul could be an array of things depending on what they saw at the monitor So there Matt Potter to the Miami bench and Clarence Armstrong to the NC State bench to talk to the coaches So right there Williams is I dont think Ill any nobody left the Miami bench per se cheering Williams number one So Darien Williams has been assessed a technical foul play technical foul contact one So Darien Williams is being ticketed for the technical which would be his third foul Its five on NC State as a team foul Will Wades not happy He thinks there was a punch counter punch involved here What film are you watching Are we all watching the same film Its a fair scrummish Copeland does an excellent job fighting for the ball Everyones on top of each other Williams did kind of kick Donaldson off of it Thats the take people And I understand you want to root for your team Watch Everythings fair game right here Its fair game Donaldson moves his arm and then Oh yeah Thats it Theres nothing else They got it right Lets play basketball now Yep So Trey Donaldson to the line Miami with the twopoint lead First one by Donaldelsson is good Hes three for three at the line So Darren Williams has three fouls State five as a team Miamis only been ticketed for two fouls Nobody with more than two at Jay Lucass bench And Donaldson has quietly got 10 and a half now and 14 in the ball game And the Canes get the ball So its a fourpoint game And Will Wade wants a word with Clarence Armstrong before things he thought

finish late in the game to get this crowd going tied at 69 now with 434 to play and Hollowman is coming back for Matt Ael in the Wolfpack lineup music You think Will Wade swaps offense for defense the rest of the way if he can And this is where I I have mixed feelings with that Abels playing well Hes being solid on the defensive end Hes making shots You cannot leave him on on the weak side of the floor Now Hollerman give him credit Great ball pressure picking up 94 ft So I understand where hes doing cheering Wolfpack in front on the 18th lead change cheering Henderson driving and gets luben Stolen by Holland Heres Copeland all the way down and hell bring it back out Guadir on the drive took the contact Hell get a couple of free throws Foul is on True Washington the junior from Phoenix

of here Your other point partner now Abels back So you have Abel McNeil two shooters in the corner Now Copeland can break down the defense and create Working against Washington whos their best defender and Copeland inside went too far Mcneel comes out of there with it And theres a foul on Miami Now Cadier Copeland drove the ball too far Yes Well Copeland has to understand even coach Will Wade has to understand they want Copeland to be a scorer down the stretch His superpower is bringing the defense and creating for threepoint shots Now theyre making him a scorer down the stretch Jay Lucas had some terrific insight on Will Wades team today And talking about Cadier Copelan he said he produces 67 of their offense from a scoring perspective when hes in the ball game Not just his scoring but his ability to distribute the scoring with assistance so far Yes thats the superpower Heres Williams Oh Donaldson turned him loose and Daren Williams scored Well we called that pull in the chair but that time he didnt fall He laid it in and Darren Williams in a Wolfpack had taken a five cheering Its my favorite part of the game now for Donaldson Good decision making on the offensive end And can the Canes get the quality stops cheering Hollowman stays in the ball game to defend Donaldson Hell take off Runner with a right hand off the window Loving the rebound applause Puts it in
