NBC our officials Ron Groover Lee Cassell and Tommy Morrisy It is the Tigers in the visiting yellow Theyve got the rock and they throw the alleyoop to start the game And throwing it down is Michael Nooku Applause up top They walk work it around the perimeter Chase Forte now Heres Fred Payne They will use the entire shot clock in the lane and he gets it Its Payne Starts it off for BC Good start on both ends The problem was it was really easy and really pretty for LSU BC really had to work and start to figure out how this switching LSU man can be attacked Music Nuoko in the post shoots over 70 from the field Misses that one Rebound comes to DC And heres Donald Han Jr Applause Payne has it Applause Driving the baseline loses it Turnover Here comes LSU LSU does a lot of switching but theyre also maintain their position off the ball which means if youre going to attack a matchup you like theres going to be hell present Music No just powers his way to the rim Gets his second bucket of the night This guy shoots over 70 74 from the field Leads the SEC Only player in the conference shooting over 70 Well Matt McMahon was talking about how we weve got to be physical Weve got to be tough Well Walco he delivered a little something on that one Applause Welcome to those who just watched Auburn and Syracuse Were inside Conte Forum on the Heights and it is the again day two of the ACC SEC mens challenge Brian Kuster along with John Crisen Weve got the unbeaten LSU Tigers who are taking on the Eagles of Boston College 4 to2 our score here early on Now LSU unbeaten They havent really yet been tested and that was by design You do some scheduling to help develop a team early particularly when you look at what the SEC looks like all year every year Music Certainly have reesigned their entire roster And thats one guy who theyve brought in this season Michael Noco Mississippi State transfer Started his career at Miami He might end his career in the NFL at three Off the mark Applause and pushing it is Mckinnon Music and turnover LSU The workers just been dominant to start I mean it started with the the lob dunk but then he just put his shoulder into the chest of the defender on the opposite block got one to go and then he got positioned early Went left shoulder right hook Too easy to start for No says the guy that doesnt have to cover him Fourpoint lead here for the Tigers LSU 70 BC 4 and four Baseline drive by Donald Hans No good Here come the Tigers Thomas first two seasons at UNLV now at LSU Applause Applause Aiden Shaw with it Gives it to Han Boston College has to be patient early Dont get too down because youve got to feel what this defense does in their switching Thats good stuff Yes Aiden Shaw You got throws it down You got to have counters to the switching And a lot of times the counter is just simply a a slip You slip to the basket you make that pass with two covering the basketball Other the other pass gets an easy one McKinnon jumper smooth Youre going to have space to work off the bounce because Duoka is going to just guard such attention on the block Theres going to be a battle for position down there which means if you can get to the paint theres not going to be a lot of help Kennan another new Tiger came over from Portland a Portland transfer played on Australias national basketball team as well And another turnover which 74 is what he shoots from the field Fourpoint lead for the Tigers Applause Markeel Sutton throws it into the post Robert Miller the third jumper is short Here comes Donald Han Euro step layup no good but hell go to the line and shoot two You can see BC compared to last season and boy they are shooting a three but the shooting percentage just 27 Look depending on what personality youre talking to of mine like I love it that theyre shooting them at the same time I dont like you you want to be able to create a rhythm as a shooter to be able to shoot shots and make a higher percentage I do believe theres a part of you that has to be committed to shooting it There are a lot of teams out there say Look this is what were going to do so were going to start doing it now The problem is if its not who you are youre going to miss them consistently and that could just absolutely tank a game So youve got to be able to develop a good rhythm to the game first so that the shots that youre taking have a better chance of going in So I think its its less about the shots youre taking its more about the other things youre doing to get those looks DJ Han one of two from the line Heres Thomas Got his man on his hook and kisses it off the glass Man that was pretty That was like old man Yes it was played against children He just works You works You work I mean theres so many guys that Id say in the old NBA but they were able to do that in ball screens and the defense was different You just keep working them in a ball screen situation You play angles like high level move Very a lot of experience showcased in that play Lost it Turn over Aiden Shaw turns it over Thomas shot No but the follow by Pablo Tamba is good And BCs got to create energy in this building I I understand is not a lot of noise here when youve got to create it Sometimes its the guys coming off the bench Sometimes its just being vocal on the floor Luca Tay His jumper is no good Heres Mag McKinnon Applause Sevenpoint lead for the Tigers That shot off the mark And here comes the freshman behind the back dribble by Payne Back to Taz fadeaway jumper off the glass is good Hes got that Hes got a nice little Ill call it a slow wiggle right Hes got a slow wiggle Very patient good poise Gets an angle to that bank shot Its a much higher level shot than I think people realize Heres Applause McKinnon Faves Got his own bucket Missed it But the follows good Markeel Sutton Thats where youve got to be able to play good defense and finish a possession That Thats a tough shot that goes up That means you did your job as a defense but you really didnt finish the possession so you didnt A lot of that is communication pays It looks like theyre going to get a reach in or a kick Don Thomas is just I mean this is just good patience You got two defenders You You continue to probe You continue to keep your defender meaning the guy defending the basketball on your hip Wait for that second defender to go away Why Why is the second defender go away Cuz you could pass Seven plus assists per game 54 assists turnover ratio I dont even think I had a a good enough pass to turnover ratio in games if that even they should track that Thats a good look at Matt McMahon Matt McMahon and Allen McMahon in his fourth season at LSU Sudden shot off the glass No again the follow is good by Robert Millard the third So the Tigers all over the glass Yeah its just been too easy You had two to three defenders going at the basketball there in transition Yet no one stopped the ball to at least deter the drive that led to the shot led to the offensive rebound Ninepoint lead Music Applause 16 to 7 our score here at BC Applause Inbound and turnover Caleb Steager checked in but stepped out of bounds Big turnover for BC BCs got to find energy Uh they theyve just got to create some sort of energy and given the lack of rhythm theyve had on the offensive end have got to think it starts on defense Be overly physical if you need to establish yourselves in this game Theyve not been able to do it Give up offensive rebounds and easy putbacks You know we were talking with coach McMahon He was saying we got to turn them over BC only averages nine turnovers a game Theyve already got five And another offensive board by the Tigers Put back No No on the boards but theres a foul Theyre going to call that one on No Theyre going to say pushed off Its like one of those fouls you get for just being stronger than everybody else You gave him a little That was a good one kind of hid hit it a little bit He did He kind of kept the arms up but threw a hip Mhm Applause Coach Micah talked a lot in shootout about physicality Be physical Be physical I think its physicality but its also a sense of toughness as you finally get one to go Yeah Voting And thats key too cuz hes a guy that can help space the floor as a four five And when you have a big man space in the floor it brings a big defender away from the basket And the way this LSU team defends theyll switch everything early clock situations except for the fiveman So if you could pull the big away from the basket open up some driving lanes it should soften the defense a bit Thats going to be another one on the wo Another one on the woko Youre right Two quick ones on him Hey coming up next third annual ACC SEC mens basketball challenge rolls on in Atlanta Mississippi State Georgia Tech and of course you can always watch it on the ESPN app Applause Heres Fred Payne They go inside Tried to get it to Cap Stagger the freshman His three is no good Coach Elgrad talked about getting Stagger more time He just needs more time and a lot of that is just getting him a feel for the game Needs to earn more minutes but sometimes earn more minutes You just got to give him some more Rashad King shot is blocked Applause Pablo Cambos right there Thought about the three Five on the shot clock both the left hand No good Rebound Hastings And here come BC back the other way Steager again Count it Good No goes off the floor with the two fouls So that gives you a a glimmer of confidence right You get a stop and a run out with numbers Stagger already got a shot up So he feels it off his hand Its much more confidence when you get that next one He came off the bench against H Harvard pumped in a careerhigh nine points Their victory over Harvard the other day Theres Robert Miller the third Did he walk Yes he did Applause Good stuff We said BC needs to create a little energy and you need to start by doing that on the defensive end Good presence get that ball out push it up the floor and then find open men When you do that you start to develop confidence on both sides of the floor Take advantage of the time with Dwoko off the court You better capitalize on this time because hes been dominant to start and foolish quite frankly to get those two fouls Applause Heres Taz Pullback rolls off Tipped out Daydon Thomas is checked back in for LSU wide open for three Too strong That went off of Robert Millers hands Sometimes I think guys like Luoko who comes in you know he didnt play major minutes last year He comes in here and hes a far more important player here at LSU than he was Mississippi State So he is far more important means youre too important to pick up two silly fouls And its something youve got to develop and learn guys that start play 30 minutes a game since your freshman year You learn how to do that That shot blocked by Robert Miller the third again Here comes LSU Theyve missed their last five shots though Under 10 minutes till the half Applause Sometimes those fouls arent bad if youre Boston College cuz we had talked about how you slow the game down What What do you have to do to slow the game down Sometimes a foul is a great way to slow the game down particularly if a player has an advantage or defense isnt set attacks the basket be physical If you dont get the call great Be physical enough to push him off his lie Do think chopping it up a bit kind of is what allowed them to get back in this game Called that foul on Luca Tay the freshman Hell have a seat Oh self substitutions by both squads Corner three by McKinnons no good Caves goes with the long sleeves What are your thoughts on the long sleeves I like it Im with like I think if I played in the game today I would definitely go with the long tights Yeah Just look more athletic You know what I mean Laughter Applause I dont have any tattoos to cover or anything but I like the look Like to stay warm Jason Asamotto has checked in Two for BC and he just turned it over Bad pass Thomas from the wing is three Too strong Hastings with the board Here comes Stagger The freshman gets the punk Hell go to the line Staggers one of those guys Youre going to ask him to play more minutes but youre also announcement yesterday and you know this was a guy one of their leaders who what had ACC a ACL toward last year like wow eighth game of the season and they were anticipating to have him full go basically this month and this happened So Matt man Matt McMahon said that about their schedule They said you know we planned on having him back you know December So we wanted a schedule that was a little bit easier for guys to develop to figure out who we are what we want to do and then that happens Now I will say hes a guy thats been around the program for now 3 four years Hes got a support staff around him I always think about that with players being at two three four schools over their time When you go through an injury and you just got to a place is it the same as if youve been there for three or four years in terms of the support within the community that you have And Im going to look away This man that was a year ago basically today when he tore the ACL and then just this past Friday ruptures his Achilles against Drake Fred Payne in the post Kapi turns little up and under Missed it Was one of those almost a good play Sutton jump stop kisses it home How was the jump stop You can call it travel So I I used the jump stop Jump stop If your voice goes high at the end it implies a question Thats first point still for LSU though in the past five minutes 630 till the half Its just been different with Zoro on the bench I Its just like trying to figure out whos who on the floor You cant get the same spacing You cant throw it in Hes not going to command that much attention Applause Thomas hasnt found his stroke yet Applause Thomas just one of seven from the field right now I tell you whats tough about that is is the fact that Thomas is getting really good looks Yeah Uh its its almost a mental game when youre getting such good looks and theyre not going down You just have to keep letting it fire Create rhythm in your feet So dont be standing still when the ball comes your way Sometimes a little rhythm dribble helps Get to the free throw line Find a stroke Robert Miller Tama in and out Applause Music Applause Some point you got to get Donald Hayden going Hes got to be a threat to the LSU defense Applause Chase Forte Thats no good Tampa again with the rebound Applause 530 until the half Millers double team kicks it out Thomas gets in that paint and a reach in They are ACC networking reactions Of course after the game complete breakdown as well Theres Thomas DRIVES THE BASELINE Count the bucket and one Thought he may have gotten away with a little bit of a hook but good players tend to get away with a little bit more Watch his left hand I want to see his left hand Yeah a little bit Yeah I do say the best call in basketball is the no call So that qualifies let that go Extra physical contact puts him at the free throw line Hes got such a good I dont even know what to call it Rhythm is not even the word but but hes just got a good smooth fluidity to his game And I think his ability to change speeds but also kind of redirect traffic with eyeballs and chin fakes head fakes he really moves the game I I think thats what separates good guards from next level guards I said not just a game manager game manipulator Do you move the basketball or do you move the game He has the ability to move the game First two seasons at UNLV Hes a Vegas kid now at LSU And the number three by Bowden Kapki Second time hes dropped one The three going down great But but I I like even better the fact that its going to pull defense and and if you get Kappy involved in ball screen situations handoff situations with a switching defense make the right read and youre going to get open shots Thomas again off the glass Applause Play angles if youre defending him Force him into tough angle shots Hes got seven 430 into the half hand spins shot wild Here comes Thomas and LSU MCKINNON THROWS IT UP AND ROBERT MILLER the third throws it down Yeah good execution in transition that thing up the wing and McKinnon did the right job of getting his head up and reading that kind of twoonone situation with him attacking Applause inside Ky got positioned rocks the rim Hes kind of the beneficiary of the switching defense and he made the right read by saying Look I got a matchup down here I can abuse Im going to stay low and not work out to the perimeter where theyre just going to switch back and get a big one Gabkis got eight And back the other way is Markeel Sutton A little jump hook Applause Fred Payne The triple No good Applause Eightpoint lead for LSU Thomas in the paint DRAWS THE FOUL COUNT THE BUCKET That was just good physical sit on two feet pivot foot with their largest lead of the game thus far Music not shooting it well Nope I mean oh a six from three struggling even to get all the free throws to go in cleanly but BC struggling as well Yeah I think BC just hasnt been able to adjust to this switching man Youve got to use the switch against the team thats trying to switch everything on You got to have counters and it takes some time to figure it out but you got to feel out the game in the first five minutes Markeel Sutton knocks down the triple The Omaha transfer Hes got nine Applause My concern if I if I had one for LSU coming in when I was watching prepping for this game is saw a team that could get up and down the floor scoring 90 plus points a game Yes But at times switching defenses can slow the game down Why Because he get in late clock situations Switch everything around the perimeter The ball never really gets attacked until late and that could slow the game down MMan talked about this LSU team being able to play even faster And I think at times it could be a shift in what you do defensively that allows you to speed the game up Credit Coach McMahon for what hes done with this roster Hes totally revamped the roster Brought in a lot of new faces Obviously hes got some support from the administration with the NIL and collectives and guys like Thomas and Sutton Manon they can they can score it Heres Sutton again and hes going to go to the line Very very experienced compared to last year Take a look how much older this group is Its always funny Typically we would do a list like this and stop at five but if youre sixth and youre in the game were calling Were going to just add to the list Thats a pretty remarkable Yeah it could be eighth and well still do it Thats a really good group when when you consider that the teams up in that list Now the thing is and this is what you got to understand just cuz youre old doesnt mean youre quote experienced right Like you havent played a lot together And I think thats one of the the determining factors is like how long does it take you to to develop continuity How long does it take you to gel How long does it take you to get through the things that a lot of us learn just by playing right The playground dynamics of who I trust in the toughest of situations Those are all things that have to get worked out But experience on the floor kind of shortens that learning curve Under two minutes until the half Good drive by hand and he lays it in Hey Sunday night the huddle crew will have the annual selection show special twohour show It includes full breakdowns of the ACCs bowl and playoffbound teams Coverage will start 6 Eastern right here on the ACC network and of course the ESPN app By the way a delay game warning on Donald Han for touching the ball there If Im at Man Im going nuts over that Im trying to play fast No way Im allowing a team to touch the basketball after they make a shot and then set up your press 90 seconds until the half Sutton has his pocket picked by Fred Payne and Freddy dumps it home Now now build upon that if youre Boston College You get a stop you get your defense set you got energy in the building Build a soft pain urging the crowd on Thomas cuts in the left hand lays it up and in Its kind of masterful Hes got 11 I mean they pressured him too It didnt matter and has it knocked away out of bounds Itll stay with allows you to get your defense set and build upon it Thats a foul of the shooter Freshman Caleb Steager Sometimes you foul shooters when youre overly aggressive on the closeout A lot of times its because your coach is saying Dont let that guy shoot So you get scared youre going to get in trouble and taken out of the game So you you overcommit Other times you get a step behind the play and you dont think hes going to take the shot Sometimes youre just getting into the close out Youre getting into the body and he rises up and takes the shot Thats kind of what Steer did Freshman only shoots 50 from the line Missed the first one Missed them both BC by the way just two of six from the line here early on Thomas throws it away He doesnt do that a lot either Its like when Pton Manning turned the ball over in his prime you you pretty much blame the receivers Tom Brady the same thing Ah he probably went the wrong way as a receiver Good point guards get that benefit of the doubt First turnover for Thomas 30 seconds until the half 12point lead for the Tigers Corner Steager Yes For three Really good stuff Really good stuff Hes got seven You had the matchup inside So you got the ball out You got ballside Throw it inside The double team led to the open shot for Seager Really good stuff offensively from BC Broken rotations What I mean by broken rotations Well no got two fouls So is it sitting now playing with a different rotation Thomas has had to do a lot more Heres McKinnon to Thomas with five Throws it up Miller tips it in Sure he did That was like he got hung and finished on the same play He did I would say if Im just picking brackets which I stink at that in March anyway but Im picking brackets it looks like they two favors the SEC in terms of matchups Outside of this shot its Arkansas Louisville Applause Go inside Hastings he knocks it down I like to play his first two You go at the guy whos got two fouls and you can see how physical he wants to defend inside No his shot blocked out of bounds by Hastings You know Hastings knows hes not going to get a double and hes got Nos got two fouls So Noos not going to be too physical You see that the no armbar the hands up in the air Thats a guy that doesnt want a foul They love Hastings They call him an elite defender as Noko with a little jump hook Its a bouncy jump hook Applause Rocos got eight Music Heres Payne for three Short front of the rim Thomas Noo back out to Thomas Applause That pass skip pass was tipped by BC and Thomas top of the key open rolls off Its right there on the shot The shot looks good He just cant get anything to fall Thomas has gotten such good looks from three They almost become harder shots because hes that open I know that makes sense to very few people but if youve been a shooter at all you understand exactly what Im talking about Sometimes the harder shots are easier to make Donald Hans just trying to create something He He has really struggled to find it and they need everything he can give them Don Thomas 0 of four from beyond the arc Donald Hay rattles in the first one This guy was the conference most improved player last season He started off slow especially shooting the basketball here Got a little hitch there in that in that shot I dont know how you do that The whole idea about shooting is it should be fluid Whatever you do is fluid Its why I made a higher percentage of step backs going to the left than I did straight on jump shots Is because theres fluidity and rhythm into a step back more so than a catch and shoot I dont know if Ill understand that hitch in the shot but if anybody should know hes doing it its your own dang teammates Turnover by Thomas and no BUT THE FOLLOW YES by Hastings Good job running the floor by Hastings The Woku was the secondary defender Comes over for the shot block And if Hastings is not running the floor hes not getting this ball But youre going to see him He takes off Pump the arms Dwoko comes by and goes for the block and no ones there to take Hastings off the glass Thats why Bigs got to run the floor Call that foul on Chase Forte Thats going to be his third Thomas splits the defenders gets in the paint good dish and a foul Pablo Tama went to dunk it home Sometimes its a bummer when they dont make the dunk dont finish the play because that was a really good play Great great look at it from up above Split And I know coaches always say things like you cant let him split Its like hes good Hes going to do it every once anyway Yeah Yeah That was a tight window that he got it through We always like the highlights and that was a really pretty play in general Right Split draw the secondary actually third defender up drive him up dish down finish That That could have been really pretty Its going to be the third foul on Aiden Shaw And I dont call that foul on Markeel second Hes second Yeah I dont know I dont see Coach McMahon is like Come on Yeah Hastings Applause Lost it going up Just keep moving a little too fast if youre a big Use your footwork Use your elbows Right Chin the ball in the turn Keep your elbows strong You get to a right shoulder left hook left shoulder right hook When youre size no ones stopping that But you cant shoot a a shot when youre back to the basket Thomas throws it up Goodness throwing it down again It looked like he was going to catch that Come down with it Pump fake five times Probably end up the free throw line I did not see him throwing that down cuz Im a mere mortal Hastings knocked away by Thomas Applause I love replays This is a great image of lets see I mean this is not an easy kick Its over Its outside of the restricted arc The other thing is he kind of jump stop jump right was almost a straight vert Not like he got steps into it A SHACKS THE RIM This is good Back the other way is Max McKinnon Lets go We Weve been asking for it A little bit of energy in here The Woko and and Shaw and three All right LITTLE KNIFE in the building Pay is cut off Applause Heres down on hand Pull up Nope Rebound Sutton Applause Whos going to build on the the little energy that we we finally found in here Thomas Sutton has it knocked away and it goes off his leg Aiden Shaw sitting here Yeah LOOK I mean he was lining up taps the head poised to spot That was a good one I think a lot of times the individual that dunks it overhypes their own dunks a lot I Im going to give him credit on that That was good and cut off and it calls a timeout Well which was a timeout Now were at the under 16 Next ball is going to be another timeout LUCATE THE three by the freshman If you can take a little energy you cut this to nine now You take a little energy a good stop here maybe get fouled on the other end it feels like a different game And what it feels like does matter to a player LSU no turnovers in the first half Already a couple here in the second No misses the jump hook Here comes Taz again Extra pass to hand They get to the basket You get to the basket you get fouled on this possession thats going to lead to another timeout Oh GOOD STUFF AND ONCE AGAIN its Jaden Hastings dunks it home Really good stuff Tapes really good about just fueling the game Very patient poised for a young guy Played at a high level Six all in this half here for Hastings Go Euro Grant loves the freshman Luca Tay In fact thinks the offense probably runs a lot smoother with the freshman Corner three no good Heres Sutton for the offensive board Back to McKinnon Second one no good Here comes Payne Lead is just seven Hand pulls off KNOCKS IT DOWN FOURPOINT LEAD 80 run by the Eagles How about that Donald Han calls the timeout with 161 Since that moment weve gotten a little bit of up and down depth Man one of the the travel didnt get it Since then it cut this to a fourpoint game I think a big piece of this is Duwoko has not been the same guy since he went out with that second foul Patience has been able to go right after him Thomas misses that layup Here here comes Luca Taz Applause Turns the corner Music Applause Music Look at the handles Pull up YES THE FRESHMAN Im telling you he hes on another level A sophomore excuse me on that one BUT WHAT A SHOT Hes special He Hes very smooth with the ball And I like this matchup Ta and Thomas fights over the screen Twopoint lead Up and under move Nope Flying in FOR THE BOARD IS BC Here we go The Eagles have not led at any point in this game A three they can take the lead Skip pass in Capki Turnaround jump hook No Applause That three too strong by Rashad King and Taz back the other way Applause Music Applause Seeing something with Tes in the game there Theres just a different level of stability and play making and ball movement Hes initiating well but also creating good action with his ball movement The jump shot he hit was was next level How about those handles Just working it through And look thats not an easy shot Youre going up against a much taller defender So youve got to get him turned going to the basket and then pull up quickly just enough of a fade to be able to get that shot off I know that Had to try to create as much space as possible on the floor to get shots off Second foul on Pablo Tamba He has a seat Michael Noco Lets check back in for LSU Theres Tay Pull up Yep Hes hot Hes hot Hes got nine Applause And Luca Magic has come to Kanti No kicks it back out Kane three No rebound Sutton and he lays it in No foul on the blockout I dont know how many steps Sutton took I mean that was like a a Eur Asian step I dont What are we doing Knocked away from Taz Kane Nope Followed Yes By Sutton All right Hes got 14 Lead is four Lets clean up the action It was a mess of a possession The hard box out No calling A lot of steps A double euro step too strong Thats the right play Applause Music Hes been the hot hand is Sutton Missed that three though Applause Oh Luca Shot is short Follows his own miss Hes got a really good poise I think hes a little windy too Hes playing a lot of minutes Well hes hes doing a lot off the bounce but hes doing a good job creating off the bounce The timeout thats coming will be much needed STAGGER YES Hes got 10 New careerh high for the freshman ONEPOINT LEAD FOR LSU OH this crowd is into it now Corner three by Rashad King No And I think he got a push underneath All right WE ASKED for it didnt we The second half The Eagles shooting 60 LSU just 29 But thanks in part to Luca Taz Hes got nine points Seven of them have come here in the second half as he gets a blow The backup point guard the sophomore for BC I like the bigger lineup too from BC Hastings and Capo on the floor at the same time Captain can space the floor but you utilize Hastings down low to block shots to turn anything at the rim and finish around the rim on secondary chance opportunities Fred Payne lost it out of bounds Turns it over Hey coming up next again the third annual ACC SEC mens basketball challenge It rolls on in Atlanta Mississippi State and Georgia Tech I played in this when it was the Big 10 ACC challenge and I will say like as a player it did matter to us They didnt want to lose to another conference We wanted to validate what we had to go through over the next couple months Its like it matters and it doesnt at the same time McKinnon off the glass Total gift right and the clock You just heave it up cuz he he looked up and he saw clocks running down I got to just get a shot up Thats the basket you get to go up three when you really havent gotten anything going on the offensive end Seven points for Max lead is three Japkkey sets the high screen Forte downhill Payne in the corner Got it Its a three Tied up at 51 Paynes got seven Eight minutes to play LSU unbeaten 7 and0 on the season BC at 4 and four Applause Yoku Applause sets the screen Markeel Sutton spins off the glass No hasty The rebound DC looking for their first lead and Payne lost it The Steiger Applause bodies following everywhere Heres McKinnon Foul on the floor Oh hes been good ever since Keep in mind BC scored 26 points in the first half Theyve already scored 25 here in the second half Were all tied up at 51 Newoko powers that one up Missed it Once again BC can take their first lead of the game Really good defense though from BC showing and then high hands to take away any pass inside Then getting back and taking away an easy one at the rim Music Khaki The three is no good Here comes Don Thomas whos checked back into the game THOMAS THROWS IT UP from Nalco It would have caught in Yeah I was going to say masking interference on Nulco I I mean that lob was going in the basket It sure was Sure looked like I think it was Did Cameron Boozer have one He went it looked like he was throwing a lob He just threw it right in the basket That could have been yesterday It could have been a week ago I I not the best with memory Music Inside to Hastings Jump hook Good FIRST LEAD OF THE GAME FOR BC Applause Music Here comes the Kanti form crowd Applause Music Applause Sutton on the baseline Puts his SHOULDER IN THE TAZ SHOT BLOCKED BY HASTINGS ONE SECOND Thomas just flicks it up Pay attent Applause And hes not demanding a double Hes not really going to command a double But if hes got a match up he likes you cant let him win the battle of position This was just all sorts of weird Definitely think he got away with a little dislodge Applause First on Hastings I think that the added physicality and the chop that comes from added physicality has favored Boston College Thomas in the paint Nope Rebound Cap key Keep in mind LSU Eighth in the country in scoring averaging 94 points per game They are just six for 26 from the floor in here in the second half HERES T LUCA MAGIC HAS COME TO CONTE Applause 12 for Taz Lead is five The three is no good Takes has been terrific And I know he saw it I didnt see it Max McKinnon will shoot him Those are tough too Im in the heat of it But man when youre rolling you got the lead and LSU has just struggled to score I really just struggled to score on the offensive end These become freebies Heres another look at it Watch number five scene right there Yeah Yeah it is That thats what they call thats the flavor definition of unnecessary borderline dump But you got to understand in the heat of the moment these things happen and you cant let them happen if youre Fred Payne Under five McKinnon ball fake pulls the three No good Hastings the rebound Its a good defensive stance and its Look they got a decent shot but you were in position to rebound Now nows your opportunity to get back to work I still think you got to include Taves as much as possible He Hes really been tough Music Heres Payne Pull up Nope Ky follow No T loose Ta comes up with it Heels reset First ever meeting between LSU and BC Kfky with one OFF THE GLASS AND ROLLS OUT Applause Heres the Don Thomas This game has gotten just choppy enough to feel like every possession matters now Miller drives off the glass and in Onepoint lead for BC Millers got eight 320 to play Applause Music Acy sets THE PICK PAYS DOWNHILL AND LAYS IT IN Hes got to play 30 minutes and its not just because of the outcome of his good play Hes just different with the ball in his hands Lucas got 14 12 have come here in the second half That one knocked out of bounds but it will stay with with a threepoint lead 253 to play LSU unbeaten so far this season Jaydon Thomas off the screen in the paint The runner is no good Follows his own shot and draws the foul Just wonder at what point Aon Thomas is is going to start to take over a little bit on this side of the floor Now something Matt McMahon talked about was weve got to be able to make shots get back and get our defense set Were good and can dictate the game when the defense is set Well they got 55 points on the board They havent been scoring it So BCs been able to play against a defense that just isnt set Applause Thomas rolls in the first one Applause Fourth foul on Aiden Shaw In fact this is this is what second point here Third annual womens basketball challenge wraps up tomorrow night SMU Arkansas 7 right here on ACC Network Watch out for SMU in the new world of college basketball Kind of the professionalized college basketball See what BYU did Go out and get the best SMU could do the same You know resources matter these days without question Where it is they got resources Yeah Third on McKinnon Onepoint lead for BC Who do you We asked Daryl Grant Who do you trust James was one of them Doesnt play a ton of minutes but but he does trust his ability to just manage and play THE GAME RIGHT AND FOULED BY THOMAS as he shoots the three and not the guy that you want to foul because Han only 15 from beyond the arc this season the thought he has struggled to shoot it does have a little hitch in his shot again you you limit rhythm when youre not fluid from your feet to the release and misses that first free throw Two of four from the line here tonight as his father looks on Hes got seven points Oh hes sitting close Im going to be quiet about the shot Upset parents over here This guy who averages 15 a game knocks down that second one Hes got one more His dad was a player too That was my error man That same was same as my brother 97 to01 time in Virginia He was a player to a three Yes he was in fact captain three years there at Virginia Donald Han senior threepoint lead Thomas Music McKinnon hangs shot short and Taz comes away with it Kiddens been flat on a lot of those shots Kind of has up and under opportunities but just been flat on the release Doesnt elevate Under two minutes Pay Keep no And here comes Thomas Hangs Shot No good HASTINGS GRABS IT 90 SECONDS to play Hed been a different half and a big part of that is Duwoko was so good in the first half and really nothing since He went out with the two fouls didnt play the last 11 minutes of the first half and hasnt really had much of an impact on this game Taves has 5 seconds on the shot clock Taz gets in the paint to Hastings He goes up Was it a shot clock violation Is is good versus when hes really nonexistent Its a different team Not enough balance around Thomas One of two lead is four Also think Boston College and Grant has figured out a little something with with the longer lineups The bigger players captain can move around the perimeter Hastings is going to play or short corner high post area on the block Its been a different lineup Theyve rebounded much better Theyve contested shots at the rim and theyve rebounded those shots as well Tigers have shot just 22 from the field here in the second half The Eagles 48 Applause LSU averaging 94 points per game BC has locked him up for 57 right now A minute to play McKinnon Applause skip pass Thomas in the lane Floater Yes Twopoint lead 51 seconds to manipulate the game Applause Heres Taz Twopoint lead for BC Applause Pay drives dishes it off and Shaw couldnt handle it Turnover Here comes Thomas Opportunity to tie the game or take THE LEAD HESITATES DRIVES LAYS IT IN DON THOMAS you said at what point is he going to take it over And he has to And that was a little bit of a breakdown Miscommunic And maybe I go to Fred Payne or maybe I use him as decoys I think he used Katka as a decoy as well I mean pick and pop guys See if theyre going to switch it If you get a matchup you can exploit it But if you wait too long youre just going to rely on a tough one down the stretch Taz they can take the last shot Theyre going to leave it to his hands Step back and a timeout I dont mind coach Grant I dont mind it Taves felt like he had a matchup Taz not switching in the corner Has it for THREE SHORT AND WERE GOING TO OVERTIME OH are we Applause all right now NOW HERES THE PROBLEM If youre Boston College youre and its the Tigers who control the tip Heres Thomas They run two guys at him Splits him Gots in the lane OFF THE GLASS AND IN JUST such a tough cover 19 for Daydon Thomas You almost cant hedge him with his ability to find just a little sliver of the defense and get through it Heres hand fades Markeel Sutton pulls the board Thomas will walk it up If youre LSU you want to string a couple good possessions together and just shift the entire feel of this game here at overtime Thomas is going to back down Taves and draws that foul on Hastings Applause Matt Mc uh McMahon went after he said I had to have a a really good point guard and he went and got him in the portal came over from UNLV and hes one of the main reasons why guys like Michael Noco a number of these guys came to LSU this season to play with him I mean look at BYU You bring in one of the best players in the country coming into college basketball in advance to and other guys follow They want to be a part of that Thomas has scored the last 10 points for LSU too Hes got 21 now Oh stripped hand in the paint Got it back Throws it up Nope Nook comes away with it And Thomas will walk it up again I I like the aggressiveness from Donald Han but its got to be with a purpose I That was just to get it in there and give it a chance We want to see No go to work again Jump hook is good That matters That absolutely matters It provides a better balance for LSU on the offensive end when hes involved Sixpoint lead for the Tigers here in OT Applause Taz the triple Applause Under three to play Applause Music Applause McKinnon had it lost it Loose ball and I think its going to go to DC I said you you got to get him you got to get him involved early Really good Particularly the left shoulder right hook Thats not an easy one on the baseline Hes not 5 feet from the basket Thats a good 10 ft Go ahead and practice that shot in your backyard Tell me how hard that one is A straight game Nos been in double figures Only played 14 minutes though tonight because of foul trouble early on Pay misses that three Taz tipped out to him Applause Kavki asking for it and met at the rim but a foul Its a great find by Taves and its all set up by the look away Kind of looks off the post feed and then makes the entry pass in the perfect spot See he just shows back out to the top of the floor lifts the defense just enough to get the pass in Thats good stuff What did Earl Grant say He goes Its like top Hes like the number three player coming out of Japan He goes Everybody talks about number one and number two Dont even worry about number three Its pretty darn good too Thats the first point for BC here in overtime Something about what it feels like It felt like LSU stole the game from them at the end of regulation So now if youre BC you you got to find ways to turn the field back into your favor Fourpoint lead here for the Tigers Applause Two minutes to play Applause Horn set Thomas turns the corner in the baseline BIG TIME THREE BY MAX MCCANNON MCKINNON knocks down that three Hes got 12 Almost feels like an early dagger Thomas just drunk four defenders with him Capki No Tipped out Payne with a minute 20 Down seven inside Capsky reach in and they caught Pablo Tanox down that three so skilled He also put it in his pocket It was a good pass It wasnt just the right find It was a good pass to catch and shoot Kevki is so versatile for BC Play a number of different positions knocks down two free throws Lead is five 118 to play Applause BCs got one timeout left Meanwhile the Tiger or the Eagles I should say 0 for five from the field Theyll throw it up break the press and is Pablo Tama who will go to the line for LSU Thats the tough thing when you get in the situation where youve got to press and you have a guy like Thomas If theres a sliver right he will find it and he will beat you with the bounce The best guards dont they dont sweat pressure They beat you with the bounce Music Tampa came over from UC Davis Applause Clutch LSU has made their last eight free throws Perfect four for four here in overtime Applause Minute to play Kapi long three no good McKinnon tied up Possession arrow pointed towards BC Applause Music Dont forget BC had an opportunity to win this game The end of regulation They did And and that probably wasnt the shot I mean you catch that on the fly Turn the corner if youre changed And Im sure he probably wants it back And follow away jumper Nope McKinnon comes away with a steel Ts a foul Thomas Applause I mean its not over but you can kind of read faces for BC and and its tough You fought back You fought back I mean youre down big and in control you had like a fourpoint lead here as we headed into that final minute It just felt like Thomas started to just take over when he needed to And thats why I say having the best player on the floor you pretty much simplify things in the college game where its like well whos the best player Who can take over the game when they need to Who can get a bucket Who can get to the free throw line Who knows how to rally troops and get a stop talk about you know you got to win free agency in college basketball these days What guys are you getting Are they winners Thomas has made the plays and has made the shots Thats why you go get that guy said you know BC 0 for two in overtime Theyve now been outscored 4023 in overtime this season Extra bonus has not been kind here to the Eagles I mean struggling to score outside of the free throw line I think there are different things you can do with Taves and ball screens Hes just really good about not only reading the initial action hes good at making the counter to whatever you do Theres a counter He reads that well Very few players do that at this level Applause I hate to do it like this but but when you see frustrated fans leaving I always want to remind them Its like yeah the dudes on the floor care more than you do Promise you that One of two by the freshman Lead is eight 30 seconds to play Music Applause somewhere being able to win games Its somewhere between learning how not to lose and learning how to win And theres a little nuance to that If you play not to lose youre going to lose Not all the time but youre going to lose some games You got to learn how to win games Sometimes that is learning how not to lose but you cant play that way Taz will have a seat 14 points for him in this one 12 of those came here I mean he have Taves brought him back Yep No question Tes brought him back He he was a weapon when they couldnt find one and he opened up other weapons and thats what youve got to build upon You learn a lot about different rotations you might be able to play with who can do what and then how to find balance around them Applause Music Applause Heres that reach in on Thomas Applause That drives coaches crazy by the way Cuz youre saying to yourself I love the effort but we got 10point lead Why foul Come on We got 15 seconds to play in a 10point lead Why foul Just hands straight It wasnt bad It was just a good play by hand honestly But go hands up Force the toughest shot possible in that situation Frankly thats what good defense is all the time Music And knocks down all three Applause Now Markeel Sutna go to the line issue two And we think about this as a coach and thinking of Matt Mc excuse me Matt McMahon How you want to play versus just winning the game I understand you didnt play this game the way you wanted to play it Thats fine you you can live with that so long as you find a way to win the game So So I think at this point you go look a lot for us to learn a lot for us to figure out We definitely didnt play the game we wanted to play Weve got to find ways to put more pace on the game We got to find ways to find balance on the floor but at the same time there are there are games where you just go man just win Just figure it out Both are good by Sutton Applause And the pull up from three is too strong And the Tigers will remain unbeaten 7869 our final here in overtime LSU now 80 on the season Boston
