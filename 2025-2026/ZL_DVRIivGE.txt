Six and two in ACC play Hurricanes in the home white Cal in the road Navy We are underway And its Cal that starts with a basketball Camden goes right to the rim and is fouled Jay thats a bad sign to start cheering We welcome those who just watched North Carolina beat Georgia Tech Our Saturday ACC quadruple header continues from Coral Gables Florida A big time conference game of the ACC Two teams trying to stack wins and route to an NCAA tournament bid And its Cal whos opened the scoring from the foul line thanks to John Camden Whats the key for Miami today as you look at the Hurricane starting five Well one is they got they got to stop the foul troubles And there Malik Renu picks up his first foul right off the tip Hes a guy that needs to stay out of foul trouble He means so much to this Miami offense Donaldson pull up pop Got it blocked 5 seconds to shoot The freshman Shelton Henderson fires it up and hits Shelton Henderson is the X factor Again Ive said it as many times that hes the key to this Miami team Hes a guy that has a chance to elevate this group because of his versatility on both ends of the floor You can see hes built like a tight end ready for the NFL and he defends every position on the floor If hes knocking down jump shots then look out Shot clock ticks down to six Day aims in attack mode Step back Missed it Really good defense there by Dante Allen He plays with so much energy on the defensive end of the floor Donaldson down the lane with authority for two Has to be assertive Had 13 points in the first half against Stanford 10 minutes of game time He only took one shot I think he needs to stay in consistent attack mode tonight Back doors open Ames runs right through it for an easy layup The opportunity to attack the paint will be there for Cal but their ability to shoot the three They space you out so well Allen had nobody on him This is the floater Cal a team that lost midweek at Florida State 156 record three and five in the ACC Thats something these two teams have in common Their worst performance of the season has come in a loss to Florida State And Florida State plays a weird style They shoot so many threes Theyre a team that if theyre making shots they can beat anybody They switch defenses Luke Loss is got a lot of things good things going in Tallahassee Renu the onehanded hammer fires Miami in front The Hurricane 174 62 in the ACC Midweek win against Stanford Starting lineup unchanged from that win against the Cardinal The one thing is Dante Allen came in for True Washington that game Washington did come off the bench as Chris Bell drains the three He is out today for personal reasons So itll be these five for the majority of this game for Miami Thats 12 points coming off the bench He played 35 minutes a game Hes essentially a starter Who makes up for that The the 12 points to production U good spin move for two Bonus points there you get from Ernest Suda His job is to anchor the defense and control the paint on both ends of the floor Second leading rebounds in the ACC Bell from the same spot Same result Backto back threes for the senior sharpshooter Chris Bell Thats the key for Cal Theyre going to spread you out Can they dribble drive force rotation spread Miami out and knock down threes Both of these teams have started redot That rims in for Henderson Miamis made five of their first seven Cal three of their first five Offense clicking early Thats how both teams want to play Kyles affected from behind the threepoint line Miami wants to score inside They had made a three yet Thats why they lead the ACC in field goal percentage Everything is attacking the paint They build out Miami plays out in Ames Another tough take Both of these teams tiled in to start This is a heavyweight fight right off the rip We didnt come here to watch defense Jay We want to see some offense baby We want to see some shooting going on Right now both teams are seeing the rim Well trading punches early Both teams have made their last three shots Anderson great hesitation The fadeaway Great touch from the freshman Shelton Henderson doing a great job of not settling for threes Putting his head down getting in the paint being patient playing off two Hes got six of Miamis 12 And Miami is for 10 of their 12 points in the paint Ernest U has a tough job defensively He has to be in the paint to clog everything up but then hes got to come over and be active in the dribble handoffs First time either team had missed in three minutes of game action An electric start here at Coral Gables Two teams desperate for an NCAA tournament resume win Our bracketologist Joe Lonardi has Miami projected in the field Last four buys Cal just out Get the next four out And it has been a terrific start Our ACC Network quadruple header a great one here and Coral Gables for him because he has shown up for us despite everything hes going through He said you know he said he drags himself in here even on his toughest days He tries to make it over and really a big motivating factor for this team His teammates are here to support him and a huge rallying cry for this Hurricanes team and Allen so active pregame giving everybody love and support and theyre trying to pay that back not just today but throughout the rest of his cancer fight 12 of Miamis 14 points in the paint they continue to pound it inside how can Cal counter that Randolph I dont think they have anything in interior to do that I think they got to make threes just to keep pace you just want to stay between the ball and basket in Miami and try to make them continue to make contest Thats the shots You cant give up point blank layups In Cals five ACC losses theyve been outscored in the paint 176 86 Thats a clear weakness for this Golden Bears team Theyre missing their starting big man Lee Dort Camden spins in Tough take Falls off the rim No good Mark Madson year three is head coach of the Golden Bears And his biggest puzzle is exactly what we were just talking about replacing Lee Dorts production both on the glass and the defensive interior Yeah he you cant replace him One hes a lob threat on the ball screens What helps your guards and then his presence at rim protection is so vital for this group Theyre going to have to fill that void by committee here this afternoon And theyre not doing a really good job here to start And thats got to really hurt Madson because throughout his basketball career thats what he was Rebound guy rim protector He knows what that guys supposed to look like and hes missing that guy here Shelton Henderson been terrific A perfect four for four eight points for the freshman Picking up the slack We talked about where the offense going to come from but Drew Washingtons out Shelton Henderson is picking that slack up right here Called a two and a half minute scoring drought Ames kick to the corner Good look for three No good Nolan Dorsey cant connect Miami looks to run off the long rebound Count it Plus the foul Team O Malovich And thats what the Hurricanes do better than anybody in the ACC Take a teams miss and turn it into points Yeah Number one team in the ACC in fast break points You have got to get back against Miami Thats got to be your first assignment Five guys getting back touching the paint building out Miami will make you pay How about the jerseys today The Hispanic Heritage jerseys Wearing that for the first time this season Los Huracanes Are you sure about that Is that how you pronounce it Thats as close as Im going to get laughter Miami an eight nothing run over the last 2 minutes and 20 seconds to gain control of this game And now its the freshman from Slovakia completes the threepoint play the oldfashioned way Yeah we talked about the lack of interior for Cal Bears at the rim Put so much pressure on these guards to make shots and create not just for themselves They got to create for the John Candons and the Chris Bells That rims out no good from three Cal has now missed their last four shots Stove rat bis fires Ames in transition Rejected Uday flew in there and swatted it off the rim Good hustle from Ames to win it back in transition Chris Bell draws the foul Great chase down block there First challenge by Trey Donersonson And music U comes in He cleans it up Both teams are giving you the great hustle You want to see knowing how important this game is Well he is a national defensive player of the year candidate for sure What he means to this Miami team on defense Well at that time they lobb it over Uday Great touch on that pass Justin Pippen lays it in Watch the minutes now when you play against you know for Cal when you play against Miami they dont have a lot of depth right now You got to test that Drew Washingtons huge Donaldson called for the travel Thats Miamis second turnover today Theres first year head coach Jay Lucas What he has done to turn this program around in a single season 174 record 16 and or 62 in the ACC This is just the fourth time in program history the Hurricanes have started 62 in ACC play The three previous times they all went to the Sweet 16 or better Good take there by Chris Bell to make it a one possession game Jay I think hes a star in the making I think hes one of the best young coaches we have in the country and Miami is fortunate to have him and lucky if they can keep him Malik Reuben very quiet for his standards today Hands it off there So Miami in front by three We expect this to be Lucas here Got quite a few stars around Jay also here I mean its I mean what do you expect What do you expect Hey its a 305 laughter Theres stars always around Asia Wilson was here earlier uh for a little shoot around playing in the unrivaled league right down the road One of if not the best the player in womens basketball right now The as coach Prime would say not one of the the There you go A good start offensively for Miami Nine of 13 shooting just under 70 I think its a good start for both teams and for Miami Its really good The question is can they sustain this with their lack of depth and can these guys come off the bench continue to keep this energy up and shot making cant connect on a three Tapped out Second chance opportunity Donaldson buries it I think he can score 25 to 30 whenever he wants Hes just so unselfish and he has evolved into an elite point guard His floor game his generalship has just improved so much as hes improved his game Good luck Coachunis The immediate answer from three Now thats a game changer Now if Kunis can knock down threes that will pull Ernest U from the rim And now I think if he does that that would make Miami to have to start switching five Doorat left alone This fires it You see Cal pushing tempo and pace They want they want the pace They want to see if Miami will use that bench and if not will they fatigue Hurricanes dont have a lot of depth Dorsy off the mark from three That would have tied it Malik Renu been very quiet for his standards Draws the foul there Only the two points for Renu who has been in double digits in every single game he has played in a Miami uniform Well hes going to have to do it differently here this afternoon One theyre going to trap him every time hes in the post So hes got to get it on the move attack it facing the basket Every time he catches it with his back to the basket hes going to face a double team So hes going to have to be more of a point guard in the half court when he touches and he has to be aggressive on the glass as well On Allen a lot for U way off the mark Those two not on the same page there Pippen the blow by and the finish at the rim Count it Plus the foul for Justin Pippen Look at Justin Pippen come down What the he has he here Freeze and Im gone Nothing you can do there but foul him at that point Youve got to engage the basketball a lot sooner when youre guarding a player thats as shifty and crafty as Justin Pitman is Great move Great finish Malovic comes out quickly Now Jay Lucas knows I got to keep a really good defender in front of Justin Pitman I I cant get caught in any cross matchups from him Hes going to take advantage of it Justin Pippen has really raised his game in ACC play the last three games 18 19 and 18 There he ties this game at 22 midway through this first half Been a terrific back andforth battle Two teams that feel like they need this game to boost their NCAA tournament resume Renu lost the handle Turns it over Jays got to know hes going to have a crowd today Hes his game today to be really effective is going to be as almost a point guard in the half court When he get catches it theres going to be a crowd They know they dont have anyone to defend him inside So every time he touches it expect two to three defenders Good back door cut Camden Hell get two And thats the second foul on Malik Renu Tell you thats a bad foul by Relique Renu Thats his second here On Tuesday we got a double header for you right here on ACC Network Duke hosting Boston College And then Pit is at Virginia You get to see the likely ACC player of the year as well as perhaps the national player of the year in Camboozer I think hes two games away from just putting that award in his pocket right now I think its rookie of the year player every laughter year agency player of the year Wow It just hung on the rim for a couple of seconds and falls in Eight nothing count And when youre getting rolls like that on the road you know things are going your way And lets remember thats Malik Reus second foul Hes going on the bench Cal has stolen all the momentum on the road trying to shake off that midweek loss to Florida State If you can leave with a road win against Miami I still say its a successful trip to the Sunshine State as Camden rocks the rim Golden Bears on a 10 nothing run side of the bubble Perfect start Theyre making shots and more importantly for Miami with the two fouls of Malik Renu You take one of the weapons that you were game planning for out of the game because youre going to double him every time he touches it Puts a lot of pressure on a freshman here Shelton Henderson and Trey Donaldson Hendersons had the hot hand Hes up to 10 points for Miami Five of six shooting Miamis going to go to that zone Great job Great call here by Jay Lucas He realized Celia Alunis is outgunned on the perimeter He cant defend the three and the paint So the zone is going to help him stay inside use his strength Camden shoots off Alutas It makes Miami pay Thats going to be a difficult matchup for him guarding in space Right now early in his career hes much better at defending in the post Miami really shorthanded with Drew Washington unavailable for personal reasons Uday and Renu out of the game right now Thats a turnover That was a big losses Jay With Renew being out in true Washington I mean youre talking 30 points offensively with the scoring in for both of those guys This is just a combination of five that hasnt seen much court time together for Miami this season No not at all And they were really small out there Shot clock down to five Pippen hangs in the air Cant hit it Campbell shoots the three Buries it off the offensive rebound No hesitation from DJ Campbell Matson challenged his guys on the glass to try to win on the offensive glass and the defensive glass That time they rewarded themselves with the offensive Donaldson big answer from three Jay hes got to be aggressive I I think his game plan needs to be put your head down try to go for 30 if Miami wants to survive this one Pip in a corner three that rims out No good Donaldson calling for it Logo three Missed it Hes got to stay aggressive Not a lot of scoring options on the floor right now for Miami If hes not shooting hes got to create it Great ball movement here by Cal Pippen Lost it on his way to the rim Henderson in transition and hell get two at the line No one turns defense into offense like the Miami Hurricanes Your shot is blocked or you missed at the rim you got to get a few more signature wins and I think they can find themselves on the right side of the bubble Theyre playing well enough to get this one here We got a lot of time left Well see Yeah this would certainly count as a signature win A quad one win for a Cal team thats desperate for one Miami does not have that signature win But what they do have is a lot of quality wid and four A lot of those coming quad two not quad one outside of the Florida State game they hadnt had any what you say quote unquote bad losses and those things are going to happen within a season and theyre fighting and surviving and theyre going to be tested Theyre not deep enough right now and healthy enough Theyre not whole to to pull away from anyone Theyre going to be in a dog fight here As you see now they ran their two two one pressure back to their zone I think theyre going to have a difficult time guarding Kyle in manto man Malik Renu and Ernest Uday back out onto the floor for Jay Lucas team Camden goes right at Renu with those two fouls Renu cant guard him as physically as he would want but its a layup Difficult difficult matchup here for Miami because of the shooting that Kyle has They burned you early Theyre knocking down shots Miamis got to figure out a way to get stops Renu steps out for a three No good Got numbers if they push it Pippen sees that right to the rim Cal is getting to the rim at will and its a sixpoint lead for the Golden Bears on the road Great job pushing Tempo This team likes to push it Get up and down the floor That time they had numbers They run a lot of motion and a lot of movement shoot the ball really well in the half court but better get back Allen knocks down a big three to cut the lead in half Miami is going to need another guy to step up One of these guys from the bench whether its Marcus Allen whether its Dev someone someone else is going to have to step up to Jay Lucas You just want to get through this half without Malik Renu picking up the third foul Deep three right on the money bullseye for John Camden and Cal is back up by six And they are using John Camden He is going right at Malik Reu who despite having two fouls hes going to have to put an effort in on the defensive end of the floor and just try to defend without fouls Henderson double team Freshman passes out of it Good feed inside Uday is fouled Ernest Rudy steps to the free throw line which earlier this year he would have dreaded but with the help of his assistant coach Cy Young he is feeling a lot more comfortable at the free throw line his nonconference free throw percentage 34 that is up to 81 at ACC play and he credits Cy Young for helping him So we talked to coach Young How did he get that progress How did he find that improvement And he said he had to hit rock bottom Yeah So once he hit rock bottom with that 34 and hes never been a great free throw shooter career 55 But shooting in the 30s he was embarrassed about it He came to CY and said What can we do So they made some adjustments His balance his release point and most importantly he put in the work Yeah And and I credit CW for allowing that to happen too because sometimes kids have so many different people in their ear their trainer different people And then finally hes like Hey I got to let you fail until you want to listen to what Im offering you And credit Ernest Hudday for doing so Well one of two from the line but they get the offensive music rebound And it leads to three points on that possession after the Allen bucket cheering And Miami back within three Now theyre trying to keep Ernest Sud inside so everything needs to go over him Good strip by Donaldson Itll stay Cal Ball underneath their own hoop Feels like two teams that wont get much separation of this game We expected it to be close and competitive Thats exactly what its been Cal up three here Game three of a quadruple header on a busy college basketball music Saturday in the ACC Very impressed with Cal in this first half You take a look at the Golden Bears threepoint shooting on the season fourth in the ACC today They are 50 five of 10 Redot This is the story of the game I mean Miami is the worst three defensive threepoint defense team in the ACC and theyre having a tough time right now guarding Bears at the threepoint line And Ames is foul taking it inside He is so shifty difficult to guard Day Ames the transfer from Virginia And now we see for Miami with the lack of depth that they have and Malik Ray knew in foul trouble theyre forced to play a lot of zone Fortunate for them Shelton Henderson is playing really well and so is Trey Donaldson and hes going to have to play offense and defensive stops with Rene Malik Cal Six for six at the free throw line today Look at Days by year Three different programs but hes found ways to improve every single season You go back to his last 10 games in the ACC Last year for Virginia he averaged double digits and hes carried that confidence into playing for this Cal team in the ACC Well he averaged what Eight points for Virginia Thats like 17 anywhere else Come on now laughter Yeah that was particular Cavaliers team that struggled to score last year Theyre playing a little different this season Yeah Not the Ryan ODM play Wahoos team Hed average 17 there now I can tell you that Camden foul shooting three Trey Donaldson asking for a review Hes adamant that its not a foul Theyre doing a great job of flying around By the way Im with Trey I I I think he runs out Hes right there Hand over the ball Something caused the hitch in Camden shot but well it was just contact on the ball Theres a shooter Its natural that you do that and sell the foul John Cannon is having himself a half here So he started the game by getting to the free throw line Yeah And he is six for six from the foul line 15 points Huge shot in the arm offensively for this Cal team that now takes their largest lead of the game seven Donaldson still not happy with that call He knows you never want to foul a threepoint shooter and he was there on the close out to contest So Mark Madson went into the transfer portal and he got guys with ACC experience We were just talking about Ames from Virginia John Camden coming in from Virginia Tech Chris Bell coming from Syracuse And those three have all come together Played some great basketball arguably maybe their best basketball of their careers for the Golden Bears Hes found guys that can score it and can shoot it And its for a coach that didnt shoot it great but he played hard and he hustled So he went out and found guys to do things well that he couldnt do well I think hes one of the most underrated coaches in all of college basketball Coach really good coach So impressed with how theyve come into the ACC And every time you and I have seen them they do not beat themselves No I think thatll be the hardest award decided this year in the ACC itll be coach of the year I think thatll be the toughest one I think a lot of the other votes are I think we know player of the year and first conference guy first team guys I dont think those are difficult Chris Bell pulls up Missed it Offensive rebound Cal cant cash in Good recovery by Miami Thats the presence of Ernest Uday there at the rim You know hes around when hes in the game You got a shot like him Donaldson patient and its a onepossession game after the Donaldson bucket Cant speed him up Jay He goes at his own speed Cant speed him up You got to continue to be solid defensively with him Keep him in front of you I think Trey Donaldson has to log Jay maybe 38 minutes or so and at least get them to the second half until Malik Renu I dont think theyre going to allow Malik Renu to take over this game And I think Shelton Henderson and Trey Arnison got to be steady forces and find another guy Camden the hot hand burries another one John Camden Hes got 19 points in this first half Been the best player on the floor here in the first half Been unconscious knocking down threes getting to the cup driving it to the rim drawing fouls Hes done it all Lob Ernest Duday hammers it home for the answer Great job there by Miami that possession getting to the second and third side Allen attacking the paint and if you help up hell help over all you got to do is throw the lob with Ernest U at the rim So this is highlevel basketball on the offensive end Both teams shooting better than 56 in this first half Great possession here Alovish turns the corner at his size at 68 Hes going to look right over the defense And great catch and finish there You watch this first half and its two teams are playing with excellent energy and effort tells you how much this game means to the bigger picture of the NCAA tournament Miami in the projected field according to Joe Lonardi Cal just on the outside looking in And this could very well be a game that if Cal gets in it could be because they came and got a quad to one win in Coral Gables Were positioning time now of the year I mean every game matters You know wins either hurt you or they help you right now and this is a win that can help both of these teams Miami at home has more pressure on them to find a way to win Chris Pal nearly intercepted it Instead Allen steps up and drills the three Dante Allen biggest shot of the game for the freshman Hes had himself a first half year Talk about stepping up You dont have to tell him to play defense He defends and he flies around Hes making shots Just a bonus for the Heat for Miami Shot clock down to 10 Pippen lets it fly No good Miami a chance to take the lead headed into halftime Hurricanes have made their last three shots Swinging the momentum right before intermission Donaldson clock down to five Donaldson tried to split two Draws the foul Miamiys in the bonus So Trey Donaldson will get one and one here Just a heady play He was trying to tell U to clear out He came to set the screen with 6 seconds left Knew there was going to be a lot of help So great job splitting the screen drawing a foul and getting to the line As a guard you want space in that situation Under five or six seconds just clear out I dont want to screen because if they hedge takes too much time You only leave me one option is to try to split the screen Great job by Treyson Donaldson misses the front end of a one and one And Cal goes into the locker room with a onepoint lead Cal 11 and point lead What a difference a couple of days make for the Golden Bears They only had 23 points in the first half in their loss to Florida State midweek 45 in the first half today when Miami goes manto man in the defensive end of the floor I think theyre going to have to put Malik Renu on Bell and I think John Camden is just mean hes just too aggressive right now and hes scoring it on all three levels Hes really involved in the offense You dont want Malik Renu picking up that third foul Renu spins in draws the foul and now Malik Renu an opportunity to put Miami back in front at the beginning of this second half Good way to get going there Get him on the offensive glass I mean to the rim drawing fouls Its hard to trap him when hes dribbling and attacking you from the top of the key So lets see if they can continue to put him in ball screens action in the middle of the floor You mentioned the foul trouble with Renu Only played 14 minutes in the first half Only had the four points to show for it Theyre going to need a lot more out of him in this second half The good news is if youre Miami you still manage to score 44 points without your leading scorer firing at his best Offensively has not been the issue Cal has their offense humming and theyre just difficult to match up with and their guard play ability to get the paint off the bounce and then their shot making ability Theyre hitting threes and thats the key for this Cow Bear team Alive Chris Bell everything but the finish He was fouled by Uday That Ernest Uday knows all about an alleyoop finish Hes had plenty of them this season Had to commit the foul there Knew he was beat Pippen has six assist in the first half and he is diving guys up Great vision there and throwing the lob Chris Bell known as a threepoint shooter Didnt see a lot of lob catching in Syracuse cheering No he was usually camped out behind the threepoint line that rattles in and falls for Bell Now I think thats the theme for this Golden Bears team is a lot of players on their second or third school but playing their best basketball here at Cal Credit Mad Dog Matson I mean his style of offense is fun to play for Finding ways to get everybody involved Donaldson coast to coast Ernest Duday throws it down And we were just talking about him as an alioop threat First time Kyle Bear has picked up fullcourt pressure May be the last time theyre going to give up lobs at the end of the press Pippen good pass to Ames Steps up Cant knock it down Offensive rebound Pippen And he was fouled on the putback attempt Thats two quick fouls on Uday here in the second half Its a great job breaking the pressure Step up and stop the basketball And you dont want to do that against Ernest Uday Hes going to catch a lob if you do it Right now Miamis chasing a lot on the defensive end of the floor Jay Lucas knows how difficult a job he has So hes trying to run a lot of zone And this is a wellprepared Cow Bears team Theyre attacking this zone really aggressively spreading them out still getting every shot they want Pippen one of two from the line shooting in front of six time NBA champion Scotty Pipp And his father was just off camera under that hoop And dad just told him Pick up play defense And there werent many guys better than that guy on the defensive end of the floor Justin is like Dad Im not 67 with your arms Youre winks man Scottys like Pick up Defend Its funny Been watching Scotty throughout this first half and doesnt seem too active in terms of while the games going on And Im sure they have plenty of conversations once the game is over You know what that is like You coached your son Brandon They never listen They never look over They only look over when its something good So trust me laughter when Justin does a really good play hell look over at that When he screws up he misses a free throw He aint looking over there He Hes He will really Hell turn the other way You can believe that They have selective hearing like they do with all parents And uh Coach Madson told us that Justins mother Larsa had the team over for dinner two nights ago Lives in the Miami area Its a good opportunity for some team bonding Right now trying to come away with a win in the state of Florida after the midweek disappointing loss to Florida State And it was kind of out of nowhere for a Golden Bears team who had just beaten North Carolina and Stanford Arguably two of the better wins certainly in ACC play that Cal has had the nonconference win to UCLA Camden lines up the three buries it and John Camden fires Cal back in front You mentioned those wins One common denominator they had in those wins is John Cam is being really good on the offensive end Already over 20 points Donaldson trying to shake free and draws the foul going against Pippen Thats been a great battle to watch all afternoon Justin Pippen against Trey Donaldson Watch the adjustment being made I think he has to take Malik Reu off of Dunan I think hes going to have to put a smaller defender chase him over and maybe put him on Chris Bell Hes not as involved in the offensive today Chris doesnt put it on the floor as well as Jon does Its the only way I think he can keep right new in the game without playing the whole half of zone on the defensive end of the floor Donaldson knocks them both down and the Hurricanes knows in front This just has all the makings running off of a back and forth game until the final possession You got to empty everything in the chamber right now Both teams are desperate for a win and again it tournament runs they m they ramp up now and this is a fun game Both teams are playing really well As the calendar turns to February tomorrow everybodys going to talk about brackettology even more I tell you what Shelton Henderson is becoming one of the better twoway players as a wing Ive seen him clamp down on point guards guard pullman Joe Lonards last four buys Miami you think 17 and four six and two in the ACC They should be more comfortably in the field than last four buys But missing that signature win the Cow has a signature win in beating North Carolina and a good rivalry winning at Stanford just mentioned the win against UCLA What theyre lacking is conference wins just three and five in ACC play and today would certainly provide that quality quad one win on the road that bolster Mark Matsons teams resume I think you felt that from both of these teams just from tip off the energy the importance of this game They know whats at stake and Miami theres different ways of getting to the tournament I think between the two Cows probably had a better nonconference schedule and they were able to get a couple of wins but they also gave some back Miamis been solid on their uh with their scout I mean with their scheduling as well they didnt schedule the strength of schedule but they hadnt had as many bad losses The only loss that really hurts them is the Florida State loss The officials have stopped play just to make sure they got the timing right and they added eight seconds back onto the clock Tony Henderson gives the thumbs up and we can resume play Yeah the running pressure Theyre not trying to do anything but just slow Miami down Ball back into their zone Miami had prepared for this because Stanford gave them a ton of zones So shouldnt come as a surprise Henderson right to the rim Slips it home twohanded with authority from the freshman Shelton Henderson Hippen lost the handle Miami finding their rhythm in this second half Renu rejected but itll stay Miami basketball Take another look at Henderson rocking the rim Hes been good all game long here Just drives it U does a really good job of shielding the defender No help can come over and no one wants to get in front of that guy Anderson playing with so much confidence You look at him both the way he approaches the game and just his size at 66240 Does not look like a freshman Offensive rebound Renu trying to clean up the spill is fouled Thats where Malik Renu can continue to get opportunities here in this game Theyre not going to allow him to play with his back to the basket He does a great job of going to the offensive glass here Hes attacking Mo off the movement Hes going to find a way Put his handprints all over this game Malik Renu a perfect six for six from the free throw line today Talking with first year head coach Jay Lucas He was telling us about his formula for a team win and he said If we get to 19 free throws six threes 15 offensive rebounds and 15 second chance points that is the formula to win And why thats interesting and unique is a lot of teams want a lot more than six made threes in a game But he said if you look at the top programs Yukon Arizona Florida decided Gonzaga big teams they they dont do it by shooting the three They do it by grabbing offensive rebounds turning into second chance points and taking advantage at the foul line Well if youre going to be big thats where you got to kind of impose your will on the game When youre playing small ball like Kyle is more threepoint perimeter shooting more the analytics Jays constructed this team where he wants to control the paint be really good defensively score in transition and score more paint points than behind a threepoint line Heres Pippen Takes it into the lane TOUGH TAKE COUNT IT Plus the foul and one for Justin Pippen I cant tell you how good a move that is I know Shelvin Henderson played excellent defense fighting over that ball screen battling to get back in front of the ball but Justin Pippen is so shifty He changes directions and speed So well once he gets that angle on you hes crafty Can finish it Cant complete the threepoint play Henderson tracks down the rebound Miami only has two fast break points today They lead the ACC in that category They have been forced to find points in the half court set Donaldson splits two kicks to the corner Heres Henderson lost the handle Reathers cant connect and Ames wrapped up without Al Tunas toss that is 62 against 610 tangled up with former Duke assistant current Miami head coach Jay Lucas and we asked him what makes that rivalry special Jay Bis says it every year It always delivers He said it comes from real hate Yes When you put on that Duke or North Carolina uniform it comes with hatred for the opposing school You can I I think I can attest to that Just being a part of the big four and that rivalry just is much more rivalry than had Ray knew is starting to impose his will here in the second half Tried to run out of clear out in the left giving him his left hand here John Cannon does a great job Hes like Im tired of chasing you all over the place John You got to come inside and battle with me Takes the contact finishes How about the spin on that ball It goes off the backboard under the hoop and then spins up and in and renew a chance to make it a threepoint play The officials have come over to the monitor to take a look at something Theyre like me Jay They cant believe it went in That looked like me sometimes playing golf I just hit it and dont know where its going I dont believe he put that type of spin on the ball for it to get in I wasnt going to bring up golf considering that uh your golf clubs were lost in transit here to Miami Yeah I dont want to bring it up either It was still hadnt found them Oh we began the month talking about a golf analogy January moving day in golf which is Saturday in a 4day tournament that finishes on Sunday As we end January these two teams still trying to position themselves both in the ACC and the NCAA tournament race This game will swing Clear momentum headed into February for one of these two programs Big three John Camden delivers Hes got 25 for Cal This is the problem he has with the big lineup Malik Ray knew has to guard that stretch forward And you and I talked about it John Camden was going to have a big game or he needed to have a big game because I think those foul trouble early for Malik Ray knew changed his aggression on the defensive end Dante Allen cashes in Bent money Hes been really solid today Just gives you defensive effort Everything he gives you offensively is bonus Hes already at 10 points here Day Ames wasnt ready for the pass Has to commit the foul Anderson was about to take that for an easy two Really impressed Michelle Gennison defensively I mean he battles through screens He guards point guards He guards anybody you put him on I saw him do as good a job on Ibuka Cory here in the second half of that game And it would surprise me at some point if Jay Lucas puts him on John Cam Now the officials are over at the monitor once again in this second half Theyve been there frequently I believe theyre confirming that this is a common foul instead of a clear path foul Great job officiating No free timeouts here Lets go Made the call Committed to it Now it is a common foul but Miami is already in the bonus So well be shooting one and one here Off And you had the possession arrow if there was a jump off It is So now hes got to be mindful with that one timeout here in the last 1445 even with his challenges Now that is a lot of game left with only one timeout to use Miami has three Hurricanes already in the bonus when it comes to fouls as well Ames fires in the three with the shot clock winding down They say he was on the line counting for two for Day Ames Can that shot get Day Day Ames going Hadnt had a big part of this game yet Great pass and it leads to a rim rocker Donaldson put it on a T for Malik Renu Concern you got to have if youre coach Matthew Malik Renu was starting to get field goal attempts up You would a great job of eliminating him in the first half and now he have 12 points here in the second half and thats scary Just a great step back opportunity there shooting over the length of Malovic Look at that pass and that finish Henderson Oh thats just bully ball from the 66 240 freshman Thats exactly what that was Jay Its just Im just stronger and more athletic than you and theres nothing you can do about it Henderson averaging a team high 17 points per game over the last six games Hes already got 16 tonight Ames who just knocked down the deep two draws the foul And that is the third against Renu who battled foul trouble in the first half Yeah I would continue to attack him Hes just so good And theyre so much better when hes effective and involved in the game offensively And youre going to see Jay Lewis J Lucas try to manage his minutes Second half hes got to be mindful He cannot pick up another foul Donaldson comes out of the game for the first time today Very similar to the first half Both teams executing a lot more on the offensive end than the defensive end Theyve each made their last three shots Chris Bell about to run a clear out here Campbell picks up his dribble Kick to the corner Bell got his three blocked Cal has 3 2 seconds here on the shot clock to make something happen Plenty of time music here Watch cutters to the rim Back door cutters for strong side corner threes Campbell travels Excellent defense by Miami Hurricanes there Well aware pay attention to the scouting report Defended the back cut screen to screener action really well And John Camden comes back into the game for Mark Madson Camden already has tied a season high 25 points Third time hes done it this season Good opportunity to beat that season high with just under 13 minutes still remaining in this game Miami playing through Henderson Freshman has it here They reverse to Allen Misfires a three California Now this is a small Miami lineup in where the last two games Miamis been forced to play with Malik Renu at the five and theyre better offensively with that group But lets see if they can rebound TT Carr draws the foul and thatll count for a goalend with a chance to make it a threepoint play for the freshman TT Carr Great job here catching it driving the close out taking a bump with the angle here And Malik Maru was just late coming over to block that shot And Carr completes the threepoint play Cuts the lead in half Back to a onepossession game Two teams or neither team is led by more than seven Been a great back andforth battle in the ACC Car had to foul there on the entry pass Thats just great basketball There it is Seeing a double team come Cows got to adjust their defense They see it coming Reu ducks in and seals that guard Theres nothing he can do but grab and foul And Miami is in the bonus So Renu heads to the free throw line On the next Miami foul Cal will be in the bonus So both teams will be shooting the rest of the way Renew makes the front end of the one and one If this turns into a free throw shootout that favors Cal Theyre number one in the ACC Miami is 14th But today the Hurricanes have been the better team from the foul line They are making free throws Like I said they missed 12 against Stanford Only missed four here this afternoon Can they continue to make free throws And theyre headed to the double bonus soon so thatll be huge Renu knocks them both down Its fun to watch the chess matches going on with the coaches with the substitutions When one team goes big the other one goes big When one goes small theyre taking advantage of their opportunities here Carr fade away Missed it Heres Donaldson OH SO CRAFTY Trey Donaldson scooped to the hoop for two John Canders John Canders been really good this game But guarding Trey Donson at the threepoint line is something hes going to have a difficult time doing Great reject to the ball screen there by Trey Don Getting to the rim Miami has tied their largest lead of the day at seven Pippen got Donaldson in the air Leans in Cant connect Home team Hurricane starting to separate here in the second half Theyve made four of their last five Allah bud gathers it goes up strong and it leads to two Jayen has taken over this game is whats happened Hes come back in and again Miami team knows put the ball in his hand and let him make plays for us and hes done so the last couple of possessions Miami has 40 of their 70 points in the paint Carr is fouled Will get two at the line Trailing by nine Yeah I mean this is I I I think what he means by that as well if youre thinking you know as a fan youre thinking theres a lot of basketball left The problem is the opponents next that the Cow Bears play They play Georgia Tech They that makes the Clemson game a mustwin because after that Syracuse BC and Stanford are not big resume boasting wins in the next five games This game particularly because its on the road their best chance at a as a resume quad one win their Clemson at home right behind that And theyve got some quality wins with North Carolina Sanford and UCLA just trying to add to that group And right now in the danger zone this is the biggest margin either team is led by today Ninepoint lead for Miami Hurricanes have the ball Renu so smooth with the left hand Malik Renu 16 points in this second half after only two in the first Hes so good facing the basket and they like to give him that clear out on strong hand giving him that left hand Clearing out the sides so no one can tag on that twoman game with he and Trey Donovan Pippen well defended cant connect and Miami an opportunity to extend this lead Already an eight nothing Kanes run right now Donaldson cant drain the three Cal in a threeminute scoring drought Camden he misfires on a fade away Itll stay Cal Ball What has changed offensively for a Golden Bears team that had been in rhythm all game long until this scoring drought They stopped moving the basketball right now You see there that was a quick shot to get back and run your offense Identify what Miamis guardian in there manto man Youve been you were running great stuff early carving them up and just get back to sharing the basketball Chris Bell goes baseline for two and that ends the scoring drought Great job there Ball started on the right side went to the left second side then came back to the third side and you drive it downhill and you get a layup Plenty of time left Renu great patience got Bell in the air and finishes at the rim Thats Malik Renus 13th 20point game of the season Only Caleb Wilson has more in the ACC Its why I think hes a lot to be a first team guy Hes been consistent all year long and the reason were talking about Miami having an opportunity as well Hes been so solid Banked in for Justin Pippen and Cal needed that the renew down Tony Henderson the official checking on him Just trying to get his foot back in the shoe I think bench of Cal Bears is telling their guys we got the best player on the floor You got to help him out Talking about Malik Reu on the other end of the floor needs to see more bodies when he touched the basketball But I think for the guys sake its difficult to do that because now earlier in the game he was getting it on the post They were able to trap him Now Miamis done a really good job of flashing him at the high post allowing him to attack off the dribble giving him space He gave the bench a thumbs up Looks good to continue 18 points in this second half for Renew Allen draws a foul and he will shoot one and one Theres no coming out of this game what this game means to both teams Well as you say that Renew does come out of the game Well he deserves a rest laughter Thats a different reason for coming out If I scored 18 in the second half coach give me a blow so I can finish the game Then right before the under eight immediate timeout is a time coaches will do it Allen makes the front end of the one and one Made the first to earn the second How about the Hurricanes in this second half Clear game plan Points in the paint and points from the foul line 20 points in the paint and they are 11 of 13 from the line Whats the Spanish name again Oh on the um Hispanic heritage jerseys Yeah Los Huracanis Los Hakanis Thats how you pronounce Okay I just Youre saying thats her ball I No I No threes laughter just free throws and points in the paint Thats the way the Los Sanos play Thats the way they play baby Well thats the Jay Lucas formula He said we can overcome the lack of threes which theyve only had four today None in the second half by getting to the free throw line getting second chance points They have done that today That they have Chris Bell knocks down the front end of the one and one And Cal needs to do more of that as well Theyve got theyre in the bonus next So just continue music to drive the basketball again Get the paint Get Miami back in rotation the way you did early and spread the ball out and start knocking down some more threes Miami a sevenpoint lead with eight minutes to play Foul off the ball biggest difference in the second half of this game for Kyle They had six threepoint made threepointers in the first half They only have three here in the second half Credit to Miami defense Theyre getting out the shooters but I think some of that is on Miami They did a great job in the first half of attacking the paint off the dribble and getting Miami in rotation Allen misses the first but now Miami in the double bonus so he gets two here Hes been really good here this afternoon Hes always does a great job with his effort and energy defensively Hes picked up the slack for true Austin and not being in the lineup here Bell goes right into Donaldson and now Cal will shoot two from the line when we come back Executing executing at a high level shooting over 62 from a field In addition the 12 made free throws in this second half for Miami In the first half it was free flowing It was high scoring Both teams in great rhythm and flow The second half very start stop Both teams getting to the free throw line Lack that same rhythm Yeah its hard to make jump shots for 40 minutes like that the way teams were shooting And again its sometimes you play a free flowing style of play and you forget how you got that the ball movement body movement A very highscoring game though 7670 Little less than eight minutes left in it Everythings going to end up with Trey Donaldson and some type of ball screen Wide open three Malovich will usually make you pay Missed it that time Cal has numbers Pippen goes right at Donaldson trying to kick it to the corner with John Camden who has 28 points a season high Californias been has been really effective during this game against this small ball lineup Aims a corner three cant connect now on the offensive end of the floor Now you can post Malik Renu at the five because now hes surrounded with full spaces So its going to be some type of ball screen action in twoman game with these two guys How do you defend it Malovitz misfires another three Hes got two really good looks on the last two possessions this time drives it in and gets the layup Thats a really confident move there Known as a threepoint shooter youre not expecting him put it on the deck like that Covers a lot of ground Aims a three No good How about this for Miami 46 of their 78 points have come in the paint Without Lee Dort whos out injured for Cal they just have no rim protection They dont The other thing is they theyre having a tough time controlling the dribble Allen trying to save that ball and it does result in a turnover That time for Shelton Henderson You dont want to jump to make the pass You want to make sure you can jump past it but make sure its open and available That one sailed on him Cal trying to stay within striking distance here Down eight Just about six minutes left in this one Ames kick out He had TT Carr but the pass wasnt on the money Foul called on Malovitz And thatll send Cal to the free throw line Hes caught it on his on the push him John Camden Theyre trying to switch off Youre taught to be physical at the screen when youre switching Sometimes you push up Helps the guard out to get under the screen so he can switch And that time got called for the foul Got that foul off the ball not on the Ames drive And Camden money from the free throw line Announcer jinx there He was nine for nine before that miss Definitely jinxed them I can own that one Both of these teams shooting 75 18 of 24 from the free throw line They do need to find a way on the other end to get John Cam the ball He needs to be more involved in the offensive end He has the hot hand Renu going to spin his way free Loses the handle and turns it over Great defense there holding your ground being strong point of attack Donaldson called for the foul It was good defense up until that point Thats his third Hes fired up about it And he up until the whistle blew Played as good defense as you can against the shifty day as that left arm got caught inside there I thought he did a great job moving his feet and that rims in for Ames Back to a twopossession game Cal is staying in it with the free throws They havent had a made field goal in more than 3 minutes but getting to the foul line and converting big part of this game And theyre the best free throw shooting team in the league So if youre Kyle and youre in a bonus its free points for you Miami is a team that has had moments where theyve struggled at the free throw line Both teams are the double bonus the rest of the way And Jay Lucas takes a timeout one they dont have a ton of depth and then for them if they start fouling late as later gets in the game they have to start going situational basketball going offense defense and then I think once they do that that tends to favor Cal so just run your stuff and I think Shelton Henderson has played well everyones played well just continue to move the basketball you got one of the best finishers in in the college basketball Allen draws the foul again and Miami goes back to the free throw line where they are 18 of 4 on the deck And as long as you can keep this at 5J as inconsistent at times as Miamis been in the free throw line this takes the pressure off because now youre in the double bonus So you know every foul youre going to shoot two And you want to keep this at minimum a two possession game so you dont have the ball in the wrong guys hands at the free throw line Allen misses the first So the question mark for Miami in these final five minutes will they regress to the mean Their average for free throw shooting this season which is 14th in the ACC compared to Cal whos first in the ACC And two misses from Allen there wont help No not at all Thats an empty possession there Pippen hands it off E Leech throws it down the Serbian and its a onepossession game 7875 Off ball foul here and Justin Pippen just getting to the basket And you got to know when youre playing Miami Ernest Us coming over to rotate Great job there finding teammates He had a rest early and now hes got back in the game to finish it And that foul was called against Milos Elich who just had the bucket to put Cal within three And it is his fifth foul So he is fouled out of this game with a big foul there An already depleted front court for Cal with Lee Dort out Now one interesting fact here Jay is coachunis comes in for him Hes a threepoint shooter Hes knocked down one here earlier there And that changes the way Ernest Uday as you can see see why is happy Hes making free throws Well hes worked so hard with so hard at it Yeah this is a big opportunity with but Allen just missing the previous music two We told you the story in the first half See why Youngs worked with Ernest Uday to improve his free throw shooting from 34 in the noncon to over 80 in conference play but just one of two on that trip Pippen trying to shake free He does Justin Pippen makes it a twopoint game Now the match up starts with Pippen and Donson Now he gets funny Both are clutch Both are crafty and both are finishes Feels like Cal has been called for a foul the last six possessions And that foul against Montas Patunis and hes fouled out of the game So much for him stretching the defense with five fouls I mean thats so on backto back possessions Mark Madson has lost a big man and hes already without Lee Dor I think the foul if you go back a little bit foul was earlier and again youre taught when the screen is coming you try to use your body a little bit at that point of the screen and really physical there and officials called him So in comes DK Manuel the red shirt sophomore from South Sudan who has played limited minutes this season getting thrust into a major ACC game in crunch time Two teams desperate for an NCAA tournament resume win Hes only played in seven games all year Theres not a lot of minutes for a four string big And with Dor out and both backups fouling out hes thrown into a difficult situation Two clutch free throws there Ernest Uday does his job Checks out for Malik Renu as we tick down to four minutes A fun finish coming in Coral Gables And another foul called Now these officials have tightened it up Theyve been calling fouls all game long But now if anybody lays a glove its leading to free throws with both teams in the double bonus with two more coming here for Days Yeah both coaches have had their gripes with the officials but theyve been consistent Both teams have been at the free throw line a bunch Its going to come down whos making them and who doesnt cheering Dains an 85 free throw shooter Knocks down the first Makes it a onepossession game cheering Got it applause One possession game If Cal Bears can you secure defensive rebounds here with this lineup on the floor Donaldson lost the handle Ripped away by John Camden Kick to the corner Ames got it Day Ames fires Cal in front The Golden Bears last led when it was 5150 Just a great defensive possession there Then come down Takes advantage of the numbers Jay Ames is a score now Renu in a double team and a timeout take a lead changes nine ties at a thrilling 3 minutes and 14 seconds remaining Miami 8 seconds on the shot clock Freshman Henderson rolls off the rim No good Got a good look Couldnt finish it Tried to run a clear out for Shel Henderson to get to his right hand and he was able to get to the rim just unable to finish Three minutes remaining Cal clinging to a onepoint lead Were going to put Spray New in the action Ames fading away Tough shot Cant connect and its Miami ball Excellent defense there by Dante Allen on the ball Got a foul And they do Got a foul He gets it low Nothing you can do Make Malik Renu earn it from the free throw line where he is 10 of 11 today Malik Renu has done a really good job in this second half Well he only had two points in the first half 18 in this second half to your point Randolph done a lot of good things Hes made the adjustment I think he he has to know when his backs to the basket theyre coming a double Hes got to get back to catching it on the move getting back to the middle of the floor And if he does post up its got to be low like he did there and close to the basket and try to score before the double team comes Renu makes the second ties this game at 82 Everything through Cal going to be with their back court dynamic duo of Dayday Ames and Justin Pippen Pippen has it here Find the matchup you want Mr Malik Ray Pippen into traffic cross the foul and will shoot two music Yeah when theyre going to run their action when it all breaks down theyre going to find Malik Renew put him in the ball screen force him to switch because they have to with John Camden in the game that hes playing That time I thought Malik Mayu did a really good job of staying in front Malik Ernest U comes over too late and gets the foul Friendly roll there from Justin Pippen the sophomore knows Cal in front 8382 211 remaining music Pippen makes a second Hes been solid all game has eight assists as well Its had a really good floor game Now Miami does not have a field goal in the last 4 minutes and 42 seconds They do have six made free throws during that stretch And dont settle again I drive it again Renu right down the lane Count it Plus the foul Malik Renu Hes got to see bodies that time Its just a complete clear out Theres no one there to help him Just a heck of a play by a guy Like I said its going to be a first team all ACC guy I dont know how you dont vote him as one of the top five players in this league Hes just been so consistent and hes been the biggest difference in this game for Miami here in the second half 22 points in the second half and that point fires Miami in front The crowd comes alive and Coral Gables onepoint game under two minutes to play Ames kick out Bell thought about the three steps back cant connect This is the big lineup and like to run some DHOs and some clear outs for Renu But great job here by John Can See the difference in experience Hes sitting on that left hand Ames reaches in got the ball They feed it right back to Renu Shot clock ticks down to seven Renu lobs it for U Rejected at the rim It stays Miami basketball with 14 seconds left on the shot clock Cal saying Mark Madsons challenge with one timeout Do you even want to use it Because theres only 14 on the shot clock Not worth the risk right Well his his bench told him to do it laughter Im laughing everyone because he went down to his bench to ask him could he should he challenge it They said no at first They said no at first that somebody saw something on an laughter iPad and Matson was at half court trying to get the review They thought ripped his shirt off telling him to challenge So to me Randolph and Im sure they saw something that will prove that Cal is correct But lets say theres not a look that is indisputable you lose your final timeout and theres only 14 seconds on the shot clock But thats a big possession here The difference in having the ball at a minute and 10 that doesnt look like its off Yeah what a block by the way by DK Manuel Well not just this block which is great I thought that possession was John Kansas coming in music He denied Malik Renew that left hand They tried to run in isolation twice And its a really good defense possession there by Kyle And I think theyll get just overturned to get the basketball All right I stand corrected When its that clearcut you could use your coachs challenge You like it now huh music No I think its worth the risk now Youre at the guts of the game and theres a massive difference in Miami having the ball on the bounds up one and you having the basketball now You need opportunities here So lets turn it forward Cals going to get the ball Down one a minute 10 What are you drawing up If youre Mark M Im going to try to run some shooting to get a shot for either John The call has been overturned Its Cal Ball Game clock will be set at 1 minute 12 seconds So Cal Ball with a minute 12 Continue Randolph Yes I think you run something for John Camden Hes been hot all game long hadnt got a lot of looks here in the second half and I think if not him then Chris Bell and then you find out where Malik Ray Newu is and you put him in a ball screen with either Dayday Ames or Justin Pippen and you let those guys go to work Well buckle up Fun finish here in the ACC Game three of a quadruple header on a busy college basketball Saturday And it comes down to the final minute Two teams desperate for an NCAA tournament Bootst down the lane Followed up Manuel Dude there to clean up the spill And Cal leads 8685 with under a minute remaining Mark Madson onto the court Thought he used his final timeout I dont know He was just urging his team on Malik Reu comes over the block Manuel D I mean look at that I mean hes had himself a possession here late in this game with the offensive rebound the block on the previous possession Its great to see coaching like this when you know guys that deep in the rotation just comes in and makes gamewinning plays Now neither team used their final timeout It was the officials that stopped music the game to make sure the clock was right Now from Miami I think Jay Lucas has one of the best clothes in college basketball Im putting the ball in Trey Donaldsons hands and Im asking him to make a play for me Pick the matchup you want Is it a ball screen Is it an isolation Here it is Donaldson IT RIPS OUT NO GOOD DONALDSON WHO HAS DELIVERED all season misses the layup Pippen has it Finds Ames You dont have to foul here Its only 14 seconds difference in the shot clock You dont have to foul Miami is going to play this possession out Mark Madson barking orders at his offense Shot clock ticks down to eight Heres JD Ames with one second on the shot clock Missed it Thats off Henderson It will stay Cal Ball with 12 seconds remaining The freshman couldnt corral the rebound and it goes out of bounds Guy guys are asking for it I looked like it was off Shelton Henderson here If youre Miami here you have to foul Both teams still have that one timeout remaining The inbounder is Day Ames Thats who you trust with the basketball to get this inbound safely cheering Knocked away by Donaldson trying to squeeze it into John Camden who is eight of nine from the free throw line today round is if we stay under eight turnovers were going to win this game Well theyve got seven He did If they dont turn it over here and Miami has to foul could be the difference between winning and losing And they have not been destroyed on the glass Hippon is the inbounder Two seconds to get it in Crosscourt pass finds Camden Great job Lets go Dorsy Yeah Dorsy set the screen and both defenders went with Camden and left him wide open Well small sample size but Nolan Dorsey is four for four from the free throw line this season He had shot in this situation This is the first the best Nolan Dorsy can do is make this a twopoint game Miami has their final timeout with 96 seconds remaining music Big free throw here The substitutions music make him to think about it a lot more music Missed it Dorsy missed them both Miami with 6 seconds and Jay Lucas uses his final timeout You like taking he makes one more It all comes down to this into Henderson The freshman takes it himself Missed it Battle for the rebound THE CLOCK EXPIRES AND THIS GAME IS OVER Cal hangs on and its
