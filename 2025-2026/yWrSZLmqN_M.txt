a ton of games at this level Now keep an eye on 22 in the white a freak athlete whos averaging 18 points a game in his last five games Hes starting to come into his own and hes become the second option for Pitstra cheering of basketball to start a five and four record But in those four losses theyve lost by a combined 19 points to teams like Temple Columbia Iona and UCF They start with the lob inside as victory onetu could not handle the dish and itll be pit basketball in the white uniforms Youre going to see Hofster in the blue playing mantoman defense Pit loves to run their set play action Coren is the leader of this team Hes the guy they play to and play through Pit similarly five and four on the year Theyre coming off a loss against Texas AM the other day when they led by four with six minutes left to go Texas AM then finish the game a perfect five of five from the floor and 13 of 13 from the free throw line to close out the victory as Pit turns it over on their first possession Well thats because Hostra forced the catch a little bit deeper and they had active hands Cruz Davis straight away That one lipped out Davis a 43 threepoint shooter on the year averaging 20 per game Officer loves to put hard pressure on the basketball Theyre going to have to do so in this game to keep it out of the paint cheering Theres Roman Ceppa inside The big Aussie former rugby player in high school Shows you why he uses that physicalness down low When it all comes together for Roman Caleeppa Pit is going to have a major X factor in the ACC Strong plays with force and he has good skill Hes still learning the speed of the game 66 220 from Brisbane Oh he is like a freight train right from Australia Joshua to Katy for Hoffra against Caleppa Caleppa stands his ground Decat gets it back Three on the shot clock Tipped Loose ball out of bounds Its going to stay with Hofra but the shot clock expired and itll be a turnover applause I mean look at that body folks He touched the ball under his shoulder Thats what he does when he drives to the basket Thats what happens when rugby meets basketball He is regarded as one of the best high school rugby players in Australia Also played for the pro league in Australia the MBL1 starting at 16 years old So a dual athlete as hes got the ball in the paint Kicks it out to the near corner Demarco Miner a midrange jumper And see Alppa has great IQ Its the speed of the game here in the United States Spoke to him today after shoot around He said Im still adjusting to things but I feel more comfortable as the season goes on after looking for their first bucket coming off a twopoint loss against Columbia on Wednesday And theyll get a chance to get their first points at the free throw line as Preston Edmme drew the foul Hell shoot three Edme leads the team in free throws attempted Look at him wait for the screen Utilizes the the butt screen they call it And then he takes advantage of the contact clever shifty lies beyond his years as a freshman Theres Victory Anuetu with the glutamus maximus screen for you coach But I dont see a lot of freshman cheering be the leading free throw attempt maker and taker of their team And he converts at 82 I know he missed the first one Watch his free throw preparation He gets close to 10 seconds Watch this cheering Its like a golfer with 15 waggles before you take the driver and hit the ball When the referee hands the shooter the ball they have 10 seconds to shoot it Hes the Brian Harmon of free throw shooters If youre a PGA golf fan you talked about it Hes a freshman leads the conference the CIA in assists per game Coach Speedy Claxton said Listen I didnt envision how good he has been He is by far our hardest worker on the team Most competitive player as well number one in the blue Hes been a pleasant surprise for Speedy Claxton Ever more assists in eight of nine games this year Marco Miner was the one who committed the foul Hopster trying to make Pit catch the ball a little bit deeper behind the threepoint line Nothing easy on catches Look at that cheering hand deflection right there by Hostra Good job by Decati to get in the passing lane Hes on the run out and he misses the layup cheering Joshua Dei had a golden opportunity and he missed the bunny after he made a great play defensively Yeah they are up on the ball tough Their stance is low but their hands are high Look at the activity by Hoffra Threepointer off the mark for Barry Dunning Jr started his career at Arkansas Didnt play much Spent a year at UAB and then last year at South Alabama cheering Twotime Alabama high school player of the year Yeah hes not a threepoint shooter but he can make the occasional open shot He needs to drive to the basket and finish Thats where hes best 33 from distance on the year 10 to shoot for Cruz Davis tried to muscle one over the rim Loose ball picked up by Corhead Great run Dunning Euroep collision and a foul underneath is called against Hofra It was the big man German Platnikov who gets called for the foul This is a heavyweight defensive game Each team challenging the ball hitting the glass hard Dunning Jr tries to avoid the defender with a little side step euro step Just enough contact to get to the free throw line My apologies You know both of these coaches tell us defense is what our game is And you look at the stats Pit on average their opponents score 68 points per game Hopra their opponent 70 points per game So nobodys getting out and running on either of these two teams Jeff Cable in his eighth season here at Pit Took the team to the NCAA tournament in 2023 That was the best finish theyve had in the ACC in his tenure when they finished third in conference play And he has a top 10 recruiting class coming in Hes done a terrific job here at Pittsburgh rebuilding the program from the bottom all the way to the mid near the top Maybe not last year They didnt finish as strong as he would have liked but two years prior to that they were a very good basketball team in the ACC See Aleppa just had interception go right through his hands He had a touchdown on his mind It was a pick six Instead its Hopster basketball Under 10 on the shot clock Thats Cruz Davis with the left hand Coach Cable said We want to make him go right And you see why Well its easy to say Its hard to do Hes an experienced scoring guard But the defense in this game early its a heavyweight fight Two teams that are not going to allow easy catches Theyre going to be contested shots and they are going to battle on the glass You want to play division one basketball you got to watch this because its hard to get open and its hard to get shots Corin whos been the leading scorer for Pit He hasnt got a field goal attempt yet in this game Dishes it off Its Elmari Witherspoon Caught midair Good recovery defense by Ha And another Pit turnover Defense on both sides music of the floor Tied up at four 1521 to go in the first Its the third turnover by the Hofster defense Speedy Claxton fifth season at his alma mater Was the CA coach of the year in 2023 when they won the regular season title Spent nine years in the NBA Hes got his number 10 retired The Raptors at Hofra Hes back doing really good work 20 or more wins in three of his first four seasons at the helm of the Pride And that is a deep three for Cruz Davis as Hopra takes their first lead of the game And hes a shot creator which he just did He created his own shot and hes a shot maker So hes a guy who can get a bucket by himself He doesnt need a ball screen Cruz Davis to score See Aleppa trying to do it himself for Pit loses the offensive rebound out of bounds and it will stay with the Panthers And watch the footwork by Cruz Davis Triple threat hard dribble the step back He clears the threepoint line two eyes on the rim beautiful high release and you see the rotation on the ball Played for Iona and St Johns both for Rick Patino But coach Claxton telling us neither of those stops he was he he wasnt the guy and now hes the guy and hes really embraced that role here with Hra this year to the tune of 20 points per game and also five assists playing a lot of minutes as well 37 per game as Ha struggles they do not have a deep bench so they need him to play early and often Yeah but Pit needs to get closer to him because he shoots it at 43 cheering Low on the shot clock See Aleppo hoist up a three Offensive rebound by Dunning but then threw it out of bounds as he was falling into the Hofra bench Speedy Claxton told us before the game we have to stay even or win the game on the glass and we have to make some outside threes right now Theyre doing a good job on the glass They have a threepoint shot This could be another one That one riked by Edme Neither of these teams shooting particularly well Hopster two for eight hit one for five from the floor to go along with those three early turnovers Make it four on the last play So four turnovers and only one field goal for the Panthers And Corham hasnt gotten a bucket yet Hes going baseline here They double team him again Coach every time he puts it on the deck theyre going to come with the double See Alpa on the offensive glass That was a big key for coach Claxton Limit Pit to one shot per possession They dont come on the catch They come once he puts it on the deck Its a big difference Heres Platnikov for three Not there Still loose Kept alive as Pit regains possession 13 and 12 minutes to go here in the first half Hopra an early threepoint lead When Coran throws it out other guys got to make shots or finish plays inside Sepa just missed one from that same spot Missed it again That one looked even worse Well right now hes not a threepoint shooter but he should be able to finish plays inside Hes three for 18 from three on the year And he gives it to you on the defensive end with energy and force Cruz to his left cuts across the lane and scores Jeff Cable cant be happy with Cruz going to his left They went over it today in the scouting report to make sure he puts it in his right hand 70 run for HRA Cruz Davis has seven of the Prides nine points They are really denying Corhan the ball making his catches deep Hes only taken one shot missed it Averaging 15 points per game Indraitis with five on the shot clock Rattles in a three Now he is the X factor all season long in my opinion for Pit Hes a guy who can drain the threepoint shot It opens up the game for Barry Dunning Jr and Cameron Cohen Transfer from Iowa State who had 15 points in the loss against Texas AM the other day He played his high school basketball at Brewster Academy for a great coach to Jason Smith injight Some good defense there on the freshman Preston Edby forced an awkward shot but then Miner throws it away on transition as Pit just cant keep control of the basketball Cruz Davis he loves it when its oneonone Hell take the ball screen Look at that snake action He goes outside then inside and finishes to his strong left hand No Andrewitis with a quick trigger Hes got great elevation on the jump shot He is Pitts best threepoint shooter The Lithuanian hits just the second made field goal for Pit in this game Theyve got five turnovers with those two field goals made and they trail it by two Just under eight minutes into this game Eric Rothman Paul Biancardi here with you at the Peterson Event Center in Pittsburgh PA Enjoyed a weekend here in the Steel City Nice and warm I mean for for December its warm Its not snowing or at least it wasnt when the game started Well Cruz Davis misses the three See this is where Pit has to score And they do Barry Dunning Jr the senior from Mobile Alabama Pit still trying to find their offensive identity You can score in transition You help your offense It takes pressure off your offense and it certainly adds energy to your defense Five straight games of 14 or more for Dunning as Cruz Davis lines up another three Hes got 10 points His second triple of the day Jeff Cable and his staff talked about it at Nauseium today Anything with Cruz Davis you cannot go under a screen or a handoff Thats what happens when you go under You get burned Already halfway season average 11 minutes to go in the first half That is Benjamin Mayhew underneath standing tall coming in off the bench for coach Claxton I love his confidence level Hes really hard to defend because he makes contested shots the midrange level and hes a 43 threepoint shooter He can make it off the catch or he can create his own shot And he is at the top of the scouting report in this game And Pit has not done a good job staying attached Lefthanded drive by Brandon Cummings is a sophomore who missed three games earlier this year with a lower body injury Good leaping ability there on that play Yeah hes made good progress here at Pit Prior to his injury He was playing very well Davis cut off on the baseline Thats not going to stop him though Its not good enough because you allowed his dribble penetration to the paint You have to level the drive which means you want Cruz Davis to go east and west not north and south Hes got 12 of Has 14 points here in the opening 9 and 12 minutes Thats Cummings again this time with the right hand Offensive rebound for Corin Hes blocked underneath by Mayhew Nothing easy for Coran in this game He Hes got to get some isolations Its a guard heavy hopra team but Mayhew playing well coming off the bench down low Hes calling for the ball right now against Cororehead Edme off the top of the back Im sorry thats Silus Sunday not Mayhew My apologies Silas Sunday the sevenfooter underneath for Hofra Theres the handoff See the hesitation the herky jerky the fake spin He comes back He inches his way into the paint and he comes back to his right hand What a beautiful finish Now you dont want to send a double at him but you may have to if he goes left Well he tried there on the baseline It didnt last very long as he kind of squeezed his way through the pressure Cummings on the elbow Maybe hes the one to get this offense turning for Pit I like his game Hes a goodlook prospect Fundamentally sound with his footwork Beautiful touch And he has the ability to score double figures And Pit needs more offense He was scoreless in the loss against Texas AM Hes got four points here in only a couple of minutes Theres Silus Sunday the sevenfooter by way of Ireland Well he could have a big game today because its Sunday Dad a former pro boxer He was born in Milan grew up in Ireland Theres a big body down low for this Hopra team Barry Dunning Jr straight away off the heel and then drops in Speaking of Sunday father son and the Holy Spirit that one in Barry Dunning Jr can make a three but Id love to see him catch that ball at the top of the key rip it drive it and finish it strong His first two Sunb Belt last year for South Alabama before transferring over to Pitt Cruz again Cruz Davis the fadeaway midrange jumper Jeff Cable is not happy on the sideline He talked about it today at shootaround Our oneonone defense needs work and and Cruz Davis is a hard covenant but someone needs to take the challenge and stay in his chest Averages 20 points per game Hes got 14 here in the first half On the shot clock for Demarco Miner and Pit Morris swarm underneath again hit Silas Sunday in his face Cornhand struggled with the girth and the size of Silus Sunday at the rim He may have to pump fake it when hes in there 7 foot 280 lbs And a little touch Cruz Davis cannot be stopped Okay When he starts to put the ball on the deck youre going to have to send a second defender or stunt a little bit harder to make him pick up the dribble Biggest lead of the game for Hostra Davis up to 16 points Cummings thought about it Now Corin the straightaway three Offensive rebound Wow Indra Situs missed it Silus Sunday doesnt run real well but he is a beast A monster in the paint Watch this screen Some contact on DeMarco Miner to free up Bruce Davis Hes now oneonone against Dunning Jr 16 points on seven of 10 shooting for Cruz Davis And hes looking for more Edme for three Yep Theres the duo Davis to Edme for three The switch was good on Cruz Davis but the recovery back to Edme not good enough And my apologies Thats Jaden Roberts another freshman on this Hopstra team Hopra young talented in the back court But they got Jaden Roberts to hit the triple Yeah Roberts looks a little bit like Ed me without put out the headband Seven and one Similar numbers Well hes from Boston Massachusetts 70 run for Hopstra Indraitis for a euro step That was a run through Meaning when Noas Andraitis caught it he ran right through the defense Thats what you want to do You want to have runroughs if youre pitting Just over six minutes to go here in the first half Offers made their last four from the floor Roberts again just nobody stepping up Oneonone defense Thats all its been Now I will say team defense wise you got to stunt when the ball starts to get going to the basket Stunt and recover I dont think Jeff Cap wants to double their guards even though their guards are really playing well right now Corin has bricked two threepointers badly Theyre settling Theyre settling for jump shots because Hostra is making it difficult for them Five and a half minutes to go in the first Ha 10 of 20 from the floor and its been all Cruz Davis whos got 16 He needs to go on a cruise after this season How about the step back He makes tough twos He drains deep threes and hes crafty music inside with the right hand Davis has had the majority of them Hes got 16 points already today He music averages 20 points per game on the season Davis seven of 10 here through 14 12 minutes of the first half And its the efficiency in which hes doing it Hes not hunting his shots Hes not forcing the action and hes doing it in a variety of ways Meaning hes off the dribble step back threes some midrange shots And if Pit starts to double him in any way he has the vision and the ability to make the assist Five on the shot clock for Davis Draws a second defender Baseline Dumps it off inside Silus Sunday as the shot clock expired See you have to shut off the baseline Its one thing to influence the dribble towards the baseline then you have to shut it off He can dish it as well Five assists per game on the year Hes long hes ranging hes got great touch and hes quick to put it up Good pressure by Hostra There you go Get to the rim Witherspoon Good crossover Step back for Dunning Short on the three Heres the freshman Preston Edby You know thats a great play if youre a good threepoint shooting team Pit is not a good threepoint shooting team You get that deep make the layup you need points 33 as a squad this year Theyre the piters from three Were two of eight here in this game Ed me searching Got bumped as he was tiptoeing the baseline cheering Oh you know he did not get it bumped He stepped on the line Yeah Brandon Cummings moved his feet number three in the white Well enough to force Edmeat out of bounds Thats the third turnover on Hopstra Hes a better look at it right there And they got a double team as well So you got to put pressure on the dribble to make them pick it up Preston his brother Malik plays at Marram Marramac and the two teams played each other November 29th and Prestons Hoffra Pride won that game by 20 So good thing it was after Thanksgiving Youre not having to argue at the at the Thanksgiving dinner table with your brother as to whos whos better Maybe itll come up over Christmas Brandon Cummings little too much dribble Hopra scrappy This Hopster teams got some fight We talked about it earlier coach Theyre five and four as you see Jeff Capo there for the also five and four Pit Panthers But Hofra and Coach Claxton those four games theyve lost by a combined 19 points Speedy telling us you know we just didnt get off to fast starts in those games Well theyre getting off to a fast start here against Pit And hes such a quiet person Speedy Claxton always under control and his team plays a lot like him Speedy and scrappy Sixth turnover on pit They trail 2718 under four minutes to go in the half Hra is shooting 43 from three Coach Cable said its simply our oneonone approach We have to tighten up our oneonone defense So if we rotate then were allowing shooters to get open So we got to make sure that we stay tight on the ball Edby inside Good block underneath It was Barry Dunning Jr who got a piece of the shot by Biggie Patterson and sent it out of bounds Hopster does a really good job of driving the baseline They put a big that time it was a flash cut right down the middle to the dunker spot Edme goes inside again This time its Victory Anduetu with the finish So every time Hostra drives the ball they have someone in the dunker spot Whether its a big or someone making a 45 degree angle cut very active off the ball Near three minutes scoring drought now for Pit 6 run for Hofra over that period incitus Misses off the front of the iron 132 run over the last five minutes for the Pride as we near three minutes to go in the first half They double team Davis feeds it inside Anuetu with two hands You want to know why Cruz Davis is special The scoring yes but the willingness to make the assist and to see the assist Great vision His third assist of the game Baseline jumper Nothing but net for Omari Witherspoon Good looking freshman Witherspoon I like when Pit gets to the midrange and in the paint Cable telling us we need Witherspoon to play better We need him on the offensive end He hits the midrange jumper there How about that feed The sling from Cruz Davis inside to Anuetu That was a hook pass from 28 ft right into the post Unbelievable What a first half for Cruz Davis Nice back cut Situs was patient but just missed the shot Pitts missed layups inside Multiple guys have missed easy shots near the basket 16 points four assists from Cruz Davis in the first half Under two minutes to play Baby Patterson nowhere to go Finds Edmund Davis the southpaw Its another three cheering music 16point lead for Hofra on the road against Pit How about it music Cruz Davis a slingshot for an arm Coach with some of these assists you got him in the trap but you got to body him up You cant allow him to make a pass from 30 ft They have him again in the trap Watch They let him out Just enough vision Yes he has a slingshot for a left arm but still you got to move your feet and keep the pressure on him That time they let him go because of penetration Knocks down another triple Cruz Davis 19 points eight of 11 from the floor Threepointers and four assists Hustra up by 16 here on the road against Pit Corhen in the lane It has been a quiet first half for the leading scorer for Pit Thats just his first bucket on six field goal attempts If they can get him on some post ups its going to score some points Now look you got to make Hostra feel you And what do I mean by that You got to take away their airspace Youve got to be chest to chest Rare miss from Davis but an offensive rebound by Biggie Patterson and hes fouled from behind We have not had too many whistles from this officiating crew of Pat Driscoll Evan Burroughs and Jamal Spearman Its the only the fourth foul combined between these two teams Eric theres a difference between playing defense and competing on defense Pit needs to be more aggressive and they need to be more collective as a unit Much better That time the shot was contested Hand in the face Missed shot Defensive rebound 45 seconds to go in the half DeMarco Miner Good ball movement Another missed threepointer for Pit They are now two of nine But that shot came in rhythm from a good defensive stop to ball movement I like that shot by Pit 10sec difference between the game clock and the shot clock in what has been a very fast first half here at the Peterson Event Center 14point advantage for the Pride Bruce Davis Oh I think that was intended to be a pass Yes Dunning slips it inside and Corin is foul They forced Cruz Davis to his right hand Number five in the blue And he tried to make that law pass Put too much on him Watch this See when he goes right its a little different Hes got to pick it up Little too hard that time It led to a run out by Pit So Corin at the free throw line Misses that one Hes got just two points here in the first half He averages 15 points nine rebounds a game for this Pit team Talked about Hashra not having much of a bench Well Pit doesnt have much of a ben bench either They average 16 bench points on the year Thats 336th in the nation So they really rely on Corin to get them the production they need offensively Final 5 seconds of the half and fouls to give on both sides That foul is against Mari Moore the freshman for Pit who just came in Davis will inbound Just under six seconds to go 3 seconds Edme gets off a good look off the back of the iron but what a great first half for Hofra here on the road music They have not beat an ACC team on his way as Hofra starts with the basketball and the lead here in half number two I want to see whos going to be the leader for Pit on the court by their defense and by their voice Corh their leading scoreer who we highlighted in that package there coach she had just three points on one of six shooting in the first half So Pits going to need to get him going Seven on the shot clock for Davis They double team again The Howitzer inside And again its Victory Onu who is the beneficiary When Cruz Davis picks up the basketball youve got to take your body and put it into his body Take away his airspace Get your hands up so he cant see that pass Might get a try out with the Yankees the way hes throwing that ball or the Red Sox But easier said than done but its a mentality on the defensive end Eric Its not skill Dunning Jr lift out Hes got some skill as well Weve seen it now Hostra the run out and they just pick up right where they left off Victory on Uetu off the feed from Preston Edme and a quick timeout taken by Jeff Gable and the Pit Panthers Astra transition too easy ball and most importantly protect the basket 247 run for the Pride Victory Anuetu now has 10 points All of them have come off of those great passes from Edme and Davis Anuetu who played 20 minutes in the loss against Colombia didnt record a single point Hes got 10 points here already in this one His season average seven points per game And Pit offensively these are their top two scorers on the season coach Minor zero points Corh just three Theyve been out of sync on the offensive end and its affected their defense as well You see the timing cheering between Cummings and Cor One guy thought he was going back door The other guy thought he was coming for a handoff That will change in practice Not what you want out of a timeout No certainly not Turn over There are final exams right now And Im not making an excuse for Pitt in any way but when kids are taking final exams their head space is usually somewhere else When semester break happens and Jeff Cable can get this team with no school no final exams they can have two practices a day tons of film work This will clean up Cable Panthers have lost three of their last four The only win in that stretch the buzzer beater against Ohio State And that shows you the potential of this team by pit They beat a good Ohio State team and they had a chance to beat a very good Texas AM team Straightaway three off the mark by Edme Whistle Mentioned that Texas AM game You know Pit led by four with six minutes to go And thenM they make their final five shots from the floor and then 13 straight free throws in the last six minutes to win that game Yeah it was a lesson for Pit but they made comebacks They were down 12 at one point in the second half if they fought their way back in the game Texas AM I think is a very good team in the SEC Certainly the Buckeyes are going to do well in the Big 10 So it shows that Pit can do the job but they have to do it collectively They cannot do it individually Cummings two minutes into this second half hits Pits first field goal of the frame And you may see Pit pick up full court try to get their juices flowing right now on the defensive end because their half court defense was not very good in the first half Seven points for the sophomore Brandon Kenn off a scoreless performance in that Texas AM game Cruz Davis answers on the other end See hes got such elite footwork Cruz Davis five in the blue that he gets you on his heels and then he pulls back to the step back three Cummings thought about it goes inside to Corin draws the foul hand up cheering It was victory anuetu drew the whistle Cruz Davis now 22 points on four of seven shooting from three Okay Miner has him Dunning Jr has him now Corhen switches See the step back that makes Corhen back up and hes quick to get into a shot So when you switch got to switch out and stay out You dont back up The patience of Cruz Davis it seems like hes circles the arc until he finds the defensive matchup that he wants and then he goes after that play He is playing slow in his mind fast on the court but his mind goes at a slow pace and hes just trying to get a defender off balance or out of his stance to get a shot off Top five in the country in field goal attempts per game top five in minutes per game He is the guy for this HRA team and you see why here today 22 points and a 4327 lead Its a good time right now Pit made two free throws Lets see if they can get consecutive stops and scores against Corham Trying to go back door on the baseline Intercepted by Dunning Theres one stop Good help by Dunning Fourth turnover on Hofra Miner still yet to score He averages 12 points per game Was the hero against Ohio State Now Cummings his second three of the half Nice find by Corhen They throw it to Cameron Coren right at the kneel the middle of the court They play through him Thats his third assist tonight Stay closer Get up Take away his space Deep three by Davis Corin was in his grill He didnt back up He got closer to him Cummings looking for three in a row Rebound saved from going out of bounds It was Preston Edme with the acrobatics Little quicker pace here with 16 minutes to go in the half Davis drive floater short They made him go right Something they did not do at all in the first half It was a key to the game for coach Cable when we talked to him earlier today Corin corrals extra pass Witherspoon in the corner and Pit is starting to heat up Theyve cut the HRA lead down to 10 When Pittsburgh has balanced scoring theyre a dangerous team Coren with the pass Cummings with the knockdown Pit on a seven nothing run The extra pass The scoreboard changes Panthers We went to Ireland for a coaching clinic so he can golf and drink Guinness very well Well hopefully we get back to doing just that very soon Our thoughts and well wishes with coach null and we appreciate coach you sharing that story and highlighting that here as we celebrate V week And I have to say it again his spirits are so high right now He he is going to beat this stomach cancer Hes ready for the surgery and hes working out all the time Cruz Davis gets to the rim yet again and now he is up to 22 points to make it 24 on the day for him 24 on 10 of 17 shooting just when Pit was starting to make a little bit of the run Threepointers here in the second half for Pit Theyre three of four from deep in the half Cummings has hit a couple Saw Witherspoon hit one before the break And now a foul underneath on Anuetu Yeah Cruz goes with speed and then he can go on some cruise control He changes his pace very well and his direction whenever he goes left He is a high percentage layup maker Hes got six assists to go along with those 24 points as well That is one over his season assist As the big man Silas Sunday you talk about Ireland sevenfooter from Ireland checks in Its the first sevenfooter to play at Hashra since John Burke in 1992 And Anuetu comes out with his foul issues Picked up his second Had a ton of whistles in this game So two is a lot for us here today Cummings has had the hot hand for Pit trying to get something going offensively Hes made his last three shots and that one with a hand in his face A dozen now for Brandon Cummings a sophomore from Midland PA Now before break Pit made two stops two consecutive stops and they led to good shot quality and good ball movement See if they get another stop Nearly rattles in Offensive rebound Silus Sunday swarmed by White jerseys and waiting for the call A 3second violation Havent seen that call much Nearly college basketball Yes Lets Lets try to count it out here One two three three and a half Close enough Hes got to put the ball over his head That way he can throw the pass that he was trying to make Boy Hopster really making it difficult for Pit to catch the ball near the threepoint line Cummings drains another one Well he has that capability cheering scores at a high level and now hes playing with confidence and that is such a huge thing in the game of basketball when it comes to shooting the basketball believing that you can make it 11 of his 15 here in the second half Another dime from Cruz Davis This time Silus Sunday finishes it off And when you look at his facial expression Cruz Davis its like hes at the poker table in Vegas You dont know what hes thinking Seventh assist as Pit is on a 124 run And Davis picks up a foul as he was mismatched against Cameron Cor Cummings creates his own shot Hes feeling it right now and he should shoot it Look at Cruz Davis very stoic very matterof fact a onehand pass and a big fella Silus Sunday with great hands to catch the ball Cummings missed three games with a lower body body injury Returned to the last game against Texas AM played 19 points didnt score He seems to be much more healthy as DeMarco Miner hits his first field goal of the game Hes got three points now and some jawing underneath the hoop after the basket Pit five for six from three here in the second half as they are within six points 13 minutes to go here in the second half DeMarco Miner has been quiet Take a break as the referees sorted out HRA clinging to the lead on the road up by six So we had the made threepointer by DeMarco Miner before the break and then there was some extracurriculars underneath the basket Initial the foul a common foul on Dunning The call on the floor is a common foul against 22 White Itll be blue ball length of the floor So after the bucket is made Dunning commits the foul against Joshua Decati and was clearly upset The referees go to the replay monitor determine if there was anything more than the common foul There was not So bucket counts for Miner The foul on Dunning goes against him Thats his first personal And its Hofster basketball up by six But Pit is starting to change the tides here at home coach Well they got it to two possessions right now but good job by the referees to get in there separated Nothing more than a few words after the common foul by Barry Dunning Jr Pat Driscoll Evan Burroughs and Jamal Spearman three referees You see Pit theyve picked up full court a little bit more in the second half to try to get their defensive juices flowing a little bit stronger a little bit more aggressively Its led to some stops Its led to threepoint shooting but theyre playing with more of a purpose right now Plus seven here in the second half Offra led by as many as 17 cheering points Shot clock dwindling Edme pushes it and a threepointer by German Platnikov who has been very quiet in this game That is his first make And the grad player whos been with Hra for four years gets a big one there Really good defense for 28 seconds but you got to finish it off Minor air balls right into the hands of Barry Dunning Jr and thats where hes so good Dunning Jr in the paint with putbacks hard drives The ability to make a face up jump shot after hes established himself in the paint Runnings got nine Heres Edley bodied No whistle Knocked around cheering Defensive rebound by Omari Witherspoon Now Cummings to the rack switched it to his left hand and drew the foul Pit showing some light trying to avoid an upset here at home They trail by seven under 12 First half deficit Theyve cut the Hofster lead down to seven Eric Rothman Paul Biancardi here with you Coach you look at Pits numbers They scored just 23 points in the first half and were not even halfway through the second half and theyve already got 20 Brandon Cummings has gotten hot here in the second half He is a confident scoring guard Wants to shoot first drive second and hes a young man who when he gets hot hes not afraid to continue to shoot the ball 11 of his 15 points have come here in the second half Make it 12 What a womens basketball matchup we have for you next Sunday afternoon right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app India Navar leads number 11 North Carolinas balanced attack when they host Laura Seagler and number 22 Louisville Thats at 4 Eastern at Carmichael Arena Fivepoint lead for Hofra The pressure is on and so is the defense for Pit Yeah this is a zone press though Different from manto man Oh Edme was calling for it Thought it got tipped Instead its a turnover So Jeff Capables played manto man the whole game Out of the timeout he went to a zone press Three quarter court soft trap Hofster does a nice job getting it to the middle but they speed up just a little bit and turn it over Its their sixth turnover of the game Cummings has 17 points to lead the way for Pit Driving to his left settles for a midrange Nothing but the bottom of the net When guys can feel it you have to give them space to shoot it and put the ball in their hands Brandon Cummings is doing that in the second half for the Panthers Heaven of nine from the floor and cheering his teammates are giving him the basketball and coach Cable is giving him the green light 15 points in the second half for Cummings Deep three from Edme No Silas Sunday the rebound Quickly delivers it to Biggie Patterson for his first bucket of the game Well Brandon Cummings got caught on a switch and hes 63 and Silus Sunday just punished him inside the offensive rebound and the assist cheering And Cummings bodied off of his line and hell shoot two 19 points today for Cummings and you know those numbers the last couple games a lot of that having to do with the injuries that he had Missed three games returned in the last game against Texas AM Played only 19 minutes Didnt score That was his first scoreless game of the year In fact there wasnt a game this year where he scored less than seven points before that So this is much more like the Brandon Cummings they want to expect here for pick Well as a freshman he averaged six points a game He has the ability to shoot it 37 last year as a freshman The numbers of six points a game have doubled Hes a guy who can score 20 points in a game And theres that 34 court pressure again Try to speed up posture into a difficult shot maybe or get them out of rhythm a little bit It worked on the first possession Then they go manto man Nearing the midway point of the second half and a reachin foul on DeMarco Miner Its the fourth foul on Pit Ha has six So the next foul committed by the Pride will send Pit into the bonus for the remainder of regulation It Its crazy to think Pit was down 17 Now if they get a stop and a score especially a three they tie the game up That was the third foul on Miner as he guards bruise Davis and one for Davis If its on Miner its his fourth foul It is Demarco Miner No excuse me Its on Brandon Cummings And Cruz Davis knows how to use his body He felt minor shading the inside so he spun to the outside Help was late Cummings got to slide over step in and take the charge Cummings got elbow to the nose for good measure Right But cheering if he got there early he would have been able to take the charge on his chest 27 points now for Cruz Davis as he quiets pit at least for the moment He should be called the answer Cruz Davis because he has all the answers in this game Was the great Allen Iverson was the answer Pit has made six of their last seven Trail still by six Dunning Thats stripped away Cor and one See thats Pit basketball The hard drive by Dunning Jr And then the offensive rebound put back by Cameron Coren Watch this Dunning hard to the rack Hes athletic Hes strong He forces help Corhen beautiful left hand for the second chance opportunity and a chance to get three He does just that Went over a000 points for his career in the loss against Texas AM earlier this week They continue with that one 122 34 court trap Lets see if Costa shoots quickly They do And its Platnikov His second triple of the half Was scoreless in the first half Six big points so far in the second Well thats risky cuz if you miss that shot Pit is going in transition Well great chess game here between Speedy Claxton and Jeff Cable Pit has not led since it was four2 And thats an offensive foul against Corin going the other way Just moved a little bit Shoulder elbow Good call by the official Watch this He throws it He screens it He gets that left shoulder Just kind of leans into the defender Hra led by as many as 17 Pitts come within three a few times but nothing closer as Ha continuing to shoot the ball well 53 from the floor Davis waits Now goes high off the glass and in as Cruz Davis has a careerhigh 29 points Theyre going to force him to his right hand You cant let him get all the way to the basket Its as simple as that 28 points in a game against Delaware in February of last season 29 points here on the road 12 of 20 shooting for Cruz Davis The lead back out to eight Eight on the shot clock Witherspoon for three Not even close I would have liked to see the shot fake and then the drive by Witherspoon Tough contested three Astra so far has been able to keep Pitts rally at bay This showing you his patience wants the matchup against Corhead He just dances with it Three on the shot clock Pattersons got to get rid of it at the elbow Sunday another offensive rebound Put back rolls off and Platnikov is there to bump it back in The role players for Hofra have done their job in this game Silas Sunday setting hard screens rebounding on defense offensive second chance opportunities Hes been terrific inside the paint 70 run for Hofra Foul against Hofra Its Biggie Patterson who gets called Hes a hard cover Rear high day for him on the road against Pit 29 points on 12 of 20 shooting Seven assists to go along with the scoring as Ha on top by now nine with the free throw by DeMarco Miner He never gets sped up Cruz Davis they trapped him or they tried to trap him He threw out for layups When he has a oneonone matchup he takes his time He decides which way hes going to go and then he creates space with great footwork Cruz Davis is playing at a high level right now The points in the paint really show it whether its him driving or feeding to somebody in the post Hoffra plus 20 points in the paint today And Pit has forced him to his right and he still made layups that time He goes left Hes lefthanded The scouting report says sit on that left hand Did happen Two points for the Pride Vicky Patterson the baseline drive His second bucket of the game You notice his teammates just wait for him to make the play Hostra they they just wait for Cruz Davis Are you going to shoot it Are you going to drive it If you shoot it well go rebound it If youre going to pass it well be ready to score Its a team that has harmony and rhythm on the offensive end Exactly To your point it doesnt feel reactionary It feels natural for their offensive flow He doesnt He didnt hunt his shots in this game Took a few He has 29 points just by flow Nine turnovers on Pit now as Offsters made six of their last eight from the floor Another threepointer for Cruz Davis He has 32 points Well they had a little give and go action or what the NBA likes to call it a boomerang action They throw it throw it back His defender relaxed He got the ball back knocked it down One of the best individual performances you will see Cruz Davis has nearly half of his teams points as Brandon Cummings offbalance hand in his face Somehow gets the deep three Well hes been just as good here in the second half Hes up to 24 points now Tough match up for Amari Witherspoon 20 of them second half Foot on the line Too strong by Davis cheering Number for Pit Indraitus Blocked by Plotnikov Pit will keep possession as Biggie Patterson fell out of bounds with the basketball They just had a twoonone Youve got to score or get fouled And a layup is what you want to get Twoonone Okay He has the ball Cruz Davis Watch this Theres a ball screen He throws it They throw it back Cam Coran relaxed just for a second He got the shot off Cummings fouled in the corner When you play somebody Excuse me hes out of balance My apologies coach When you play somebody like Cruz Davis you can never relax on the defensive end Again when you think youre close enough you need to get closer You must make him put it on the deck I think it was a foul And now theyre looking if it was a two or a three I believe Foul on Patterson as he was reaching in That looked like three to me I saw space between his right foot and the threepoint line I think youre right The call on the floor is confirmed It will be a three shot foul There you hear it from referee Pat Driscoll Excellent call The referees have done a terrific job in this game Theyve officiated this game with balance And look at that You see the right foot about an inch behind the line Thats toes to the line but not over The individual performance by Cruz Davis has overshadowed a little bit the individual performance by Brandon Cummings who now has 25 points Still plenty of time for Pit to get it back to two possessions one possession get themselves feeling good again I like the pressure by Jeff Cable the one two two three quarter court press but they cant give up layups and they must let somebody else shoot the ball beside Cruz Davis I dont care if you have to face guard him at this point Dont let him touch it Thats a great way of trying to limit his ability to score Maybe you just take him out and face guard him Cummings at the free throw line gets pit within seven 540 to play here in regulation Edby trots it up the floor Freshman Edby turns a corner baseline Hell shoot two All right So if you take Cruz Davis out then you have a fouron four game Youve got to stop the other guys Thats oneonone defense Again Jeff Cables going to work on this in practice They push it to the baseline but Andrew Situs just stands up You You cant stand up on the defensive end when the balls coming at you You got to stay down slide your feet and keep moving You want to shut him to the baseline and then shut him down cheering With all the scoring from Cruz Davis Austra has not needed their second leading scorer Preston Edmme to do a whole lot but he has been very quiet offensively 0 for six from the floor A couple of points both from the free throw line But this young kid is unafraid So if they take Cruz Davis out or they try to limit his touches Preston Edmme will not be afraid to take shots cheering and hell certainly find his teammates Deliberate free throw shooting style of Preston Edme Yeah hes 9 and 12 seconds at that free throw line Pits already in the bonus Hra will be in the bonus with the next Pit foul Five of six from the free throw line Pit 14 of 16 Lets see if they can get Corand to the basket Cummings comes up well short on the three now Hes been hot but that was poor quality early in the shot clock Corhen didnt get a touch The ball really didnt move Corhen Pits leading scorer on the year 15 points per game Just seven points in this one Two of seven from the floor Off has done a good job limiting his opportunities Davis once again gets the mismatch he wants against Corin Hes done that consistently all game A traveling violation Turnover on Biggie Patterson Cruz Davis wanted the ball back He was playing that little boomerang action where he throws it his defender rest they throw it right back to him and then he attacks He has tried to get Cruz Davis one excuse me Cameron Cameron Corin on him oneonone almost every possession And Pit has not made an adjustment Pit needs to get Corin a touch Miner bobbling it Spacing in the corner Its Dunning Five to shoot He loses control on the floor Biggie Patterson has it and he called a timeout The 5050 hustle play by Big E Patterson Outstanding defense by Zero in the bloom Another pit turnover as Hofra get some energy from music their big man Biggy Patterson The big stat for me is paint points Hostra with 36 Pit with only 14 Hostra has taken away the paint game for Pittsburgh Theyve closed down the driving lines They do not allow Corhen to catch it in the low post And when he did they would send the double team Dont forget Pit had 38 paint points A lot of screen and rolls and low post touches by Coren against Ohio State It took us nearly a hundred years of basketball at each of these two programs to finally get them on the court together And weve enjoyed it thoroughly so far see what happens in the final four minutes and change Heres Cruz Davis on the pivot flips it up and in See you have to play defense till he releases the basketball He gets you to hesitate He changes pace you relax you stand up and then he takes an extra step or an extra pivot and you get beat Between points and assists hes accounted for well over 50 of his teams baskets Gets a rebound there Yeah his usage rate meaning the points he scores and the points he creates has to be off the charts Hes involved in every play just about for Hopstrom See the 14 flat They just going to give him space and isolation here in the last couple of minutes Its a switch again Coren Thats the matchup he wants and blows right by him Just couldnt finish the layup Offensive rebound onetuary Speedy Claxton saying Get it back to Cruz Davis And flatten out fellas Its a high screen this time Threepointer on the way Too strong Another offensive rebound as Edme tracks it down Oh and Edmeat is going to get called for the foul as he was fighting with DeMarco Miner for the basketball Would have been nice if Miner could have got that Bust out in the open court and get an easy two points Pit has not got easy points in this game They only have four fast break points Good hustle but you got to come up with that long rebound When teams take threepoint shots from that far away that means theres going to be long rebounds Miner hits the first of the one and one Coming up next the Huddle Crew will have the annual selection Sunday special a twohour show that includes full breakdowns of the ACCs bowl and playoffbound teams Coverage starts at 6 Eastern right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Fullcourt pressure by Pit They need consecutive stops They need a fast break basket Nothing has been easy for Pit in this game Under three minutes to play Edby the freshman milking the clock Under 10 on the shot clock He got pushed Yeah but you bail out Hofra 7 seconds on the shot clock So you play good defense for 23 seconds Youve got to live low in your stance Youve got to slide your feet and you have to have the discipline to finish the play And I think for Pit today a lot of possessions last five or 10 seconds theyve had some breakdowns Yep And I wonder you know I mentioned Edmeat as a freshman I wonder how much of that patience that we just saw on lap possession hes learned from Cruz Davis so far in their tenure together Sure hes learned a lot by watching and covering Davis in practice Astra now in the bonus after the foul on Corin his second This kids an elite free throw shooter 82 As I mentioned earlier he leads Hofra in free throws attempted and free throws made You want the ball in his hands here at the end of the game Great win this would be for coach speed claxton on the cheering road against an ECC opponent that had some close losses this year to Temple Columbia Iona and UCF All four by a combined total of 19 points So theyve been in every single game but this would really be a statement on the road against Pit if they could close out the final two and 12 minutes And Cummings got tripped up trying to squeeze through a double team and theyre going to get Victory Anuetu for the foul Thats his third And thats perfect for Pit The opportunity to score points You stop the clock You set up your defense If Im Pit down the stretch I am driving the ball as much as I can to get to the basket for a twopointer or to get fouled I want this game to last another 20 minutes Pit last led when it was 42 They trailed by as many as 17 the end of the first half and then gotten within three points The closest they were was 5552 Ha Every single time Pit has gone on a run Davis has slowed things down hit a big shot and really sucked the momentum away from Pit Oh hes made a big play He is a shot maker and a playmaker Cruz Davisov on the press break And now youre going to see him pull it out and run offense If youre pit you have to trap right now You have to speed up Hofram on the offensive end You just cant sit and play defense Trap it again Late in the shot clock 5 seconds for Davis Works his way inside Another foul late in the shot clock 4 seconds to go And Davis will go to the free throw line to shoot two See watch Cruz Davis He He goes to his right Watch Witherspoon He opens his stance Hes sideways Youve got to square up the ball You got to level the drive And when you open your gate that much penetrations going to happen Already a careerhigh 34 points for Cruz Davis cheering And this is where hes not great Its the free throw line believe it or not 67 on the free throw line this year The lefty the back end 35 points for him also has seven assists For Pit you got to go quickly space it and drive it Cummings has been the star of the show in the second half for Pit but it has not been enough Marco Miner weaves his way inside the paint Corhead lost it but it went off the knee of Anuetu And just no rhythm for Cameron Corhead in this game And the spacing was difficult on that pass Miner got into the paint You got to shoot that If you miss it Corin is right there for the offensive rebound Anuetu and Corh have been going after it physically and verbally Hopsters had a twoheaded monster on him this afternoon Executed the scouting report for coach Speedy Claxton Miner misses the three Dunning goes over the back and theyre going to call the foul on Preston Edm They moved Dunning with his backside Speedy Claxton is saying Dunning Jr pushed him The officials saying Well he rooted him out He backed him out Dunning misses the free throw Lets see this tussle inside Edme Yeah Dunning pushed him He pushed him first Edme kind of dislodged him but I wouldnt have called the foul on Edme on that one Harry Dunning Jr Pretty heralded recruit out of high school in Alabama Twotime player of the year in that state You had him number 74 on the ESPN 100 He was a highly ranked player out of high school committed to Eric Muscleman in Arkansas Played there for a year has had stops at UAB in South Alabama now trying to get Pit a comeback win here with 137 to go in the second half And Hofra has really controlled this game from the start and a testament music to you know we talked about Pit in the open and them trying to gel trying to find an identity Well on the flip side Hofra has seemingly found their identity and its the face of Cruz Davis because whatever he wants it seems like he gets and the offense for Hofra just kind of follows behind He got in a rhythm early in this game and he has not took his foot off the pedal The confidence has been brimming all game long Hes long Hes rangy Lefthanded And Pit in their defensive assignments were not tight and connected to him enough And basketball is a game of rhythm And Cruz Davis got into a career night from the outside music and with his dribble penetration and he also made some beautiful passes Davis sprinting to the inbounder Biggie Patterson Good press break by Hofra Minute 30 to go Lets see if Pit traps it or plays the foul game Both teams in the bonus Pit has one more foul to give before the double bonus They let it go deep in the shot clock 7 seconds left before they commit the foul Thats the second time they foul inside of 10 seconds You always tell your team Look when the shot clock gets inside of 10 we used to have a call We used to say Butter Butter meant dont foul I dont know why we came up with that word butter laughter but thats what we came up with And that was a signal to our entire team that the shot clock was at 9 seconds or less See Alon Brown saying Dont foul now Well if were going to follow lets follow early in the clock Yeah Why wait 23 seconds Oh thats a film session That will be on the film tomorrow And its going to be a long film for the Panthers And knowing Jeff Cable like I do theyre probably going to watch the whole game as a team Cummings little runner Patterson the rebound Minute to go as Hofra Last time they beat an ACC opponent it was Florida State in 2015 Theyve got five program victories against the ACC and they are 56 seconds away from number six And make no mistake about it Hofra came in confident and unafraid Having won three of their last four games they took this game away from Pit They never relinquished the lead Got to tell you what coach theres another ACC road game on the horizon for Hofra against Syracuse at the dome Adrien about a week from now And I bet that this game for Syracuse just became a little bit more concerning with the performance from Hopster here today Speedy Claxton has always been a quiet confident young man I remember when he came out of Christ the King High School in New York obviously had a long successful career in the NBA Talked about how Don Nelson the former coach of the Golden State Warriors got him into coaching Told him he would be a good coach Don Nelson is a Hall of Famer So when he tells you youre a good coach you get into coaching Coach Claxton said he had never really thought about it before Coach Nelson said Well if Hall of Famers telling me I make a good coach I might as well listen Under 40 seconds to go Dunning made the three for Pit And now Cummings a touch foul to stop the clock 373 to go And Don Nelson was actually the inventor in my opinion of small ball He started small ball Its a guard heavy team that Claxton has here at Hofster So he is carrying on the torch of Don Nelson This young man at the free throw line Preston Edme and Cruz Davis departs cheering He is the future screaming of the back court for Speedy Claxton Poised mature under control Theres not a moment thats too big for this freshman And even Speedy told us before the game I knew he was good I am shocked that he is this good this early They have not needed him to do a whole lot in this game given the production of Cruz Davis In fact Edme has yet to make a field goal on the day but his impact has been felt in other places and he plays with much more maturity and poise than you would assume as a freshman Yeah he played for a bigtime club program the New York Rens Oh thats a tough shot for Nick Cummings whos had a highlight real performance here in this second half Now 31 points for Cummings but it appears like it will be in a losing effort with 27 12 seconds to go Well Cummings music has been a bright spot for Pit obviously but also I think the heart for Pittsburgh the ability to come back down 17 to get it within three points But then Cruz Davis continue to open the game How about this acrobatic finish by Brandon Cummings 27 of his 31 points have come in the second half That one the most impressive It was the spin that he put on the basketball that allowed it to go in once it hit the glass Lot to clean up for Pit but theres a lot of promise in this team I do believe that I know this was a tough game today They lost to Quinnipiac They beat Ohio State We talked about this in the open Whats the identity going to be Jeff Cable told us today Its got to be our defense More oneonone defensive drills more film work more ball movement more touches for Cameron Corhend And when they double Cor inside what is Pit going to do in the future Cuz other teams are going to start games doubling him They had a good scheme but they couldnt execute it Couple careerhigh performances in this game with Cruz Davis 36 and Brandon Cummings 31 27 and a half seconds to go Hopra has not made a field goal in the last 3 minutes and 40 seconds Theyve gotten it done at the free throw line again Pressure the full court from Pit Shot clock turned off Edme fights free trapped by three players in the corner Forces it ahead to Cruz Davis and able to break the plane to Jaden Roberts across the timeline and hell go to the free throw line You know Preston Edmme number one in the blue and Cruz Davis number five the back for Hostric They dont play in straight lines meaning they they are shifty Theyre clever They start they stop they hesitate they go but they keep you off balance defensively And tonight its been a great example of that You cant trap them Theyre hard to contain oneonone off the bounce And Cruz Davis especially can make shots even with a hand in his face And they like the man at the free throw line too Another freshman comes off the bench for them David Roberts from Boston They played for the BAPC That is a timetested club program out of Boston coached by Leo Papil Has done it for 30 years Well if youre in the New York or New England area why would you not want to go play for Speedy Claxton if youre a guard growing up Good program hes got going 20 or more wins three of his first four seasons as Cummings adds to his career night 34 points now And this team will put it together Pittsburgh Theyll get organized Theyll get in rhythm work on timing in practice Big time win for Hofra and the CAA Hoffra goes on the road the first meeting ever against the Pit Panthers and comes away with a sevenpoint win Cruz Davis a career day 36 points
