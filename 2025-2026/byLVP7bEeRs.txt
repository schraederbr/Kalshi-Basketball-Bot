remedy issue And there is Ven Allen Luben a Tarheel a year ago winning the opening tip for the Wolfpack cheering here in 2026 NC State at home starts with the ball And we watched Will Wade rehears this with this team Had a designed play He actually threw the ball up in their shootound today expecting to cheering win the tip And the first shot of the game is a three short from Trey Hollowman cheering So North Carolina with Derek Dixon Seth Trumbull and then Luca Boabots again And we have an injured Trey Hollowman after taking the first shot The NC State senior guard limps to the bench just 27 seconds in And Hollowman who shot the three right in front of UNCCs bench as he backs up on one foot cheering You can see him turn that ankle tries to get back defensively but nice job by officiating crew stopping it to allow him to get off the floor And Matt Able in the game instantly The bigs for Carolina Heres one from Jiren Stevenson He gets tied up by Ael and the arrow to Carolina as you meet our officials Patrisco Brian OConnell and Michael Greenstein as Trey Hollerman will limp past the bench and toward the NC State locker room And Trey Hollowerman who had a strong performance against North Carolina a season ago when he was at Michigan State in the Maui Invitational was planning to play an important role in this game for the Wolfpack Heres Zayen High who fills out the lineup Had a careerhigh game Saturday playing four to two injured bigs High had 15 points seven rebounds in 32 minutes Deep shot clock for Seth Trimble guarded by Copeland Trumble has to put it up and he hits the back of the rim as theres a whistle in there Copeland is hit for a foul right at the expiration of the clock And the conversation has begun Guardia Copeland is going to have to be calmed down by his head coach Will Wade in his first season at NC State And Will Wade who brought Cuadier Copeland with him from McNiss knows him as well as anyone has put the basketball in his hand and has him at the point guard position this year And you see Will Wade I rate about the call after watching it Well the question is and Pat Driscolls just said this into the mic here whether or not that foul occurred before the shot clock expired Thats what the officials will review when Will Wade hits a makeshift tuttle just 67 seconds into this game So its been an interesting start to say the least as Seth Trimble is trying to get position to get a good look and it seems as though in live action It looks as though he got that shot off cheering and officials will confirm that it is a twoshot foul Copeland with the games first And Will Wade still pleading his case with Pat Driscoll after watching the replay on the iPad on the sideline Disappointed with that call cheering These officials will likely have their work cut out for them tonight as Treble rattles out the first free throw cheering Will Wade is still talking to Pat Driscoll about it and he up and gives him a neck massage If anyone ever wants to know Will Wade in a 30 second span that is him Thats his personality Hes iate but at the same time it ends up with he and Pat Driscoll laughing about something Wills press conferences this year have either been a shade of irate or a shade of laughing It was the former Saturday after NC State blew a late lead against Miami Barry Williams gets an early paint touch and he has the games first field goal And thats an important sign OH MY TRIMBLE TRIED TO WOO in the rim and then off the miss Dixon is hit with a foul Let me tell you what KB there is some juice I have been on Seth Treble for years about attacking the basket as such and he went to the rim with reckless abandon unable to finish it Copen gets the rebound and gets fouled but Seth Trimble bringing his best to the fight early Thats not a misd you like the aggressive attack to the rim NC State n2 start in the league Lost two straight last week crushed at Louisville and then against Miami an 80 run for the Canes in the final minute There is the former heel Van Allen Luben and NC State scores on backtoback trips and Ven Allen Luben a topic of a lot of conversation in the preeason cheering between these two scorers really more so from the Wolfpack but cheering theyve been able to attack the basket and score twice The first was Dariion Williams This time its Vin Allen Luben going to the jump hook and then just a little gesture of just too small to guard me in the post Luca Bogots wraps it around to Dixon into Zaden High High will slam it off a careerhigh Saturday Zayen High in big minutes with another big bucket Zaden High stepping up cheering when his number is called and looking forward to this opportunity to play against Luben who Cuba Davis decided to go a different direction not bring him back NC State had a home for him after he finished the season so well a season ago Tarheels 7965 winners over pitch Saturday never trailed That game was really never in doubt cheering playing without their top two scorers for a second straight game Trimble sticks with an open look breaks the three badly Williams flying in for the rebound which is last touch by Williams and will belong to Carolina Darien would like a challenge but its awfully early to do that Well youre going to go look at the replay regardless but Hubert Davis in his fifth season and of course playing at the University of North Carolina very familiar with this rivalry and understands the importance of this game especially here within the state of North Carolina Out there in the late 80s has been affiliated with the Tarheelss cheering ever since Fifth year as head coach and hes won 20 or more five Stevenson Somehow that ball found its way to Jiren Stevenson who has a threepoint play opportunity Jiren Stevenson really picking up his offensive output as of late It started at the game in Charlottesville You and I did that game Jared Stevenson scored 17 points in that game The majority of that in the second half and he has now had double figure scoring in three of cheering his last six games and is able to complete the threepoint play to get off to a good start here this evening Season high 19 Saturday for Jiren Stevenson has an outsized role now with the loss of Wilson and Vessar Five straight for Carolina to jump back in front Williams brings it home from around the elbow So remember what will Ray told us earlier today What happens with Darien Williams normally is based upon what he does with his first shot attempt They ran action to get him a jump hook in the post He was able to get a bucket to go and that normally is a sign that hes going to have a strong offensive performance Heres Stevenson for three cheering Rebound Paul McNeel Jr Great shooter for the Wolfpack applause Williams with a transition triple on the other side cheering Tremble cannot answer Thrown by High to Abel Stevenson collects a loose ball Zayen High just went and took that one away from Ben Allen Luben Luben thought he had a shorthanded rebound Zayen Hyde making the extra effort to come up with the offensive board cheering Theres Bogavots A great ball handler this year but he turns it over A very rare occurrence for Luca Bogots Copeland on the run out Copeland aball STICKS IT A CORNER THREE Stevenson cheering runs the floor and he gets to the line as Williams lands very hard Trey Hollowman left this game remember about a half a minute in and now ground but unfortunately he was able to get up and walk off on his own power into the training room and I would not be shocked not to say thats going to happen but I would not be shocked especially in this game in this rivalry and what Daren Williams in the first time of this rivalry has already meant to it I would not be shocked if we see him back on the floor hes already scored seven points and hes a guy who at ACC media day said I hate UNC said that before even playing a game at NC State Hes a big reason why State has an early lead Arsenal has replaced him Luben finds a cutting Copeland cheering the big to the point guard for two The the big and the point guard are pretty much the same height Heres the craziest part is this is a smaller cheering NC State team with Ben Allen Luben at 67 manning the post but a 66 point guard and Guardia Copeland gives them the right size to be able to play especially against the perimeter a taller perimeter teams cant connect is 0 for five from three to start going to bully his way into Trimble shot fake and finish cheering and then makes the the same gesture Youre too small We talked about a 66 point guard Jonathan Powell off the bench answers Carolinas taken three chances to run after mates and has been successful early And this is what Huba Davis talked to us pregame about He wants his team to play faster and he felt like they did that Saturday verse Pittsburgh and they dont have their two bigs up front So a smaller team but theyre able to play much faster cheering off the Matt Able Miss Here is Dixon Tar Hills have been at 18 assists only four turnovers cheering They have the best assisted turnover number right now in Carolina history on the kick of three off the top of the backboard from Dixon cheering Heres Copeland off a tough couple of games He is asserting his presence early His shot is tipped out to Paul McNeel looking for luben against Stevenson One dribble lefty finish The ACCs leader in field goal percentage does a tremendous job of burying Jiren Stevenson under the basket making it simple for the left cheering hand layup cheering Seven gone by Packed by seven Heres Dixon Not a clean look Skips it all the way to Trimble who hesitated on a three Left it short for two Luben has the rebound I agree Se had a good look from three that he gave away And thats the same spot where he made the gamewinner vers Duke of course in a different venue And then Copeland attacks the basket picks up the foul against Trimble Guardia Copeland and Vin Allen Lubman connecting on a number of plays Copen gets the layup off of a nice find And then the rolls of reverse as Copeland finds Vin Allen Luben for the post up Hes able to go to the left hand and finish over Stevenson Claudia Copelan misses on the first free throw cheering Remember NC States coming off a devastating loss score on Saturday They led Miami by eight in the final minute or by seven Miami went on an 80 run in the last 52 seconds And a big part of that Copeland missed the front end of a one and one leading to Garen Williams fouling through Washington who had all three free throws Miami absolutely stole a game If theres any more desperation you could have for NC State against Carolina they may have a little extra They they do have that extra when you also consider the fact that this team and this rivalry and there are guys that came here with already predetermined hate for for North Carolina wearing their retro uniforms in this game But thats part of being here with the Wolfpack Its bred as Allen Breed gets into the game We havent seen a lot of him in ACC play Started the first five games for the Wolfpack Hasnt played much since Arsenal knocked it off high Itll be NC State ball And thats an area where the Tar Hills have been so good as of late Only four turnovers cheering against Pit on Saturday Already the second turnover here today Yeah you mentioned we havent seen Breed a lot Boy the second time in nine games Usually Darien Williams operates the point when Copeland takes his seat as Ael buries his second three and NC STATE IS ROLLING And Matt Able is around that territory now where you dont consider yourself to be a freshman anymore Hes been a contributor and his role has been increased with Trey Hollerman getting injured on the first offensive possession Treble and Namusa Sier cheering back up big reaches in for the foul NC State is 9 for13 three for four from three and up 11 on Carolina with seven points three of three from the field already Right now Hubert Davis probably doesnt like him much either So I think that that feeling could be reciprocal but we did get an update Daren Williams is being stitched up has not been cleared from the trainer yet but is still likely to return Williams took that hard spill early cheering He left the game Trey Hollerman left the game 27 seconds in Hes back on the bench after appearing to roll his ankle NC State hasnt needed him Trimble splits the pair The Wolfpack up 10 But that just gives you an idea Cory of what kind of tension there is in this rivalry Darren Williams before hed even played a game at the Lenovo Center was already saying I hate UNCC Well I mean again when you decide that youre going to be a part of the Wolfpack then you understand what goes with that And what goes with that is hating the rival UNC And you can tell you know I was walking around taking the poll pregame talking to anyone that I knew existed in this rivalry before 1989 and asking what is a bigger rivalry Is it this or is it Duke And from me as a viewer watching ACC basketball growing up when there were eight teams in the league this was just as big of a rivalry coming into that time as was the UNCC Duke rivalry if not bigger Certainly in the 70s NC State was on a roll in this rivalry Theyre on a roll right now Matt Ael is taking this rivalry and making it his own Hes three for three from deep and without Caleb Wilson and Henry Bessar on the floor There are a lot of NBA scouts here and one of the reasons they want to see Matt Able and he is absolutely having a strong performance to start this game Shimble against Sier trying to cross him up Sier holds his ground now Zaden High and High will roll it home Great patience by Zayen High pump fake gets two Wack defenders in the air allows him to spin for the jump hook NC State eight of its last 10 offensively and the only player on the floor who scored for them tonight is a Arsenal trying to change that His shot deflected cheering applause bodied by Trimble and then blocked by High Heres Ky Evans our backup point guard cheering and you got the mismatch Trimble has to be in drive Sier cheering stuffed him but High is there for the loose change in a second straight bucket Zayen Highs got six And Zaden High coming off a careerhigh 15 points and a careerhigh 32 minutes to go along with a careerhigh seven rebounds on Saturday is having an impact here applause and cheering in the first half as well Carolina fouls on Jaden Young as we go back to High is Zayen Hyde The pump fake allows him to spin back go over the left shoulder that right hand jump hook and then Seth Treble is unable to get past Sier But for the second time Zayen His absolutely takes the basketball away from a Wolfpack player with his hands on the basketball and turns it into two more second chance points Height barely played as a freshman was away from the team last year served a suspension for an offthecourt incident returned to the team university this year He was averaging 16 six points per game coming into Saturday And Hubert Davis said its its a great story for a coach No better example of wait for your number to be called You never know when it will be And he high took over the game against Pit Hes got the last two buckets here as Carolina has the ball down nine cheering Pogbots gets the switch onto Sier and bounces away from it And that ball was knocked out of bounds by NC State with 15 to shoot But when you watch the Tar Hills trying to penetrate all you see is a pack of white jerseys pun intended But when theyre taking away all the driving lanes right there and the Wolfpack doing a great job staying in those gaps not making it seem as though theres much available to any of the Tar Hills off the bounce They have been at times this year an elite defensive team NC State just not with consistency Young misses a three and high draws a foul Going to go on Trey Hollowman his first much to Will Wades dismay Its the Wolfpacks fifth Michael Greenstein gives Will what he considers an unsatisfactory explanation Right We see Trey Hollowman trying to keep Zaden High off of the offensive glass You think he did it legally Uh I I thats why I stopped talking laughter Leave it up to interpretation Deep shot clock Evans misses a three and a bounces it to Hollowman Great job by Ael keeping that in bounds Reed Ael shopping driving and Abel throws it to Sier as an outlet Sier cheering with a lot of dribbling here will leave it short Hes on the ground and he is hurt Hubert Davis is going to be upset about this because with Sier going down that stops the break for the Tar Hills Yeah Michael Greenstein whistled the dead immediately And weve got the third member of the Wolfpack injured in this first half as San attacks the basket Turn the left ankle on the fall But the problem for Hubert Davis is that the injury timeout from the officials happens while his team has numbers going down the floor looking for an easy bucket Thats the reason that hes having that conversation with Michael Greenstein at the moment NC States third string big man 610 senior Scotty Ibubet Doesnt play a lot only 12 games but he is also out and unavailable today So at the moment Sier is out Darian Williams has not returned to the bench after we were told he was getting stitches on the left side of his head They dont have a Bubet for backup depth which is going to be a lot on Ven Allen Luben and of course on the other NCA No Caleb Wilson no Henry Vessard tonight So this is starting to turn into a war of attrition in the first half Yeah if there is a game for the Wolfpack that they may not need their size as much it would be this one simply because Uhoh You hear that ovation Hey WHOS NUMBER 34 cheering DARIEN Williams with a new uniform and a new left side of the face has returned to the floor and he runs out of the tunnel to the ovation of the Lenovo Center We wont call it quite Will Reed but it was definitely an ovation cheering And Darians going to the table as Zayen High tips in another bucket off the Bogavots miss Thats six in a row for High whos got a Carolina high eight Yeah one of the things that High is doing is taking advantage of anyone thats on the floor and their lack of size for the Tar Hills cheering on the offensive glass Three Carolina players one up for that rebound Bogots bounces gets it back from Stevenson in and out A great look for three High is in there again and he is adjudicated Short touched at last cheering and look whos coming back applause I think it will be a big ovation The NC State fans got a little caught up in the last play who the ball was off of But Darien Williams wearing a nameless number 34 the typical number one has returned to the game And I this Hubert Davis is going to challenge this one I think this is a very good challenge when you consider who has elected to challenge the call on the floor Matt Ael coming in for that rebound takes that basketball out of bounds I think this is a good challenge Well look at it when we return This will be our 8minute They will keep their challenge as well as the timeout Kev said thank you Another amazing day of college hoops we have on the menu Carolina did win the challenge The ball was out of bounds off Matt Abel So UNC retains its challenge Well have one remaining for the rest of the game Yeah we saw this one in live action Pretty simple to overturn this Matt Abels momentum taking him toward the sideline but he did a great job of selling it afterwards forcing UNCC to use the challenge to get the basketball back NC State by seven Heels have led for just 30 seconds Theyve stayed in this game on the offensive glass and they have held NC State scoreless for over three minutes now Trumbo with three to shoot over Williams off the side of the rim North Carolina is 1 for 11 and three Here goes Copelan plays it home Those are the attempts that Will wants to see from Claia Copeland Playing fast and using his size to attack the basket not settling on the perimeter cheering Copeland is three for five seven points three assists and Mary a turnover Bogots got switched on to Luben And thats the first foul on Ben Allen Luga The Wolfpack want to be able to take advantage of mismatches And its a mismatch when youve got Guardia Copeland with a head of steam attacking Luga Bogots able to get to the basket with a beautiful move and easily score the layup over the top And heres the thing with Cadier Copen Will Wade was telling us in shootout its not always ideal when he takes a lot of shots Theyre 14 less than 10 field goal attempts Now hes already got five tonight but you said Cory theyre a good five Yeah if he if he gets 15 layups well wait that He doesnt want him taking a bunch of threes I think hes about to get a layup cheering A turnover turned into a pick six out of Zaden Highs hands And the Wolfpack Fateful are on their feet again cheering cheering Stevenson fouled by Itll be the new 34 Daren Williams Thats his second foul although first wearing that uniform Hey tonight Georgia and Kentucky continue our Super Tuesday right here on ESPN Bulldogs slumping a little bit right now music trying to stay in the NCAA tournament picture against Otga Ooway and the Wildcats That will follow us ESPN and the ESPN app And Darren Williams will stay in the game with two fouls Jiren Stevenson four for four at the line He was four for four at the line Saturday and hes now got seven How about this front line for the Tar Hills Jiren Stevenson and Zayen High have provided the majority of the offense for North Carolina throughout this game Theyre going to need to get some production from their guards if they want to try to get a win here on the road Heres Williams wearing that new jersey after the bloody fall Lift it short but Luben would not Well its been Zaden high on the offensive glass for the majority of this game Ben Allen Luben gives his own team a taste of his own medicine attacking the offensive glass and slamming home two second chance points cheering and applause Under six to play in the first half dominated by the home team cheering Dixon step back short knocked out by Powell to Stevenson Another offensive rebound for Carolina And Powell breaks a three They just cant hit from out there Trimble has yet another offensive board Stevenson three Another miss one HIGH TIPS IT OUT TO DIXON The fourth shot attempt could be coming in this possession And they might as well take it from two cheering as Hyde misses badly on a three Carolina is 1 for13 out there applause Copeland going into everybody applause cheering We might need to update that cheering 10 shot attempt graphic once again as long as his 10 layups and he is putting so much pressure on North Carolinas defense trying to keep him out of the painted area and out of transition Hine spins around Luben finds Powell Another missed threepointer Its a broken record Copeland penetrating He is fouled smacks the floor roars to the Redclad faithful and he will shoot free throws with NC State absolutely feeling themselves Claudia Copeland is absolutely a fan favorite here in Raleigh and he is showing why He was standing at midc court as he often does pregame not warming up just standing and looking talking to himself talking to cheering anyone who is willing to talk to him from the opposing team as Jaden Young has a little bit of conversation and he lets him know what hes hitting for here tonight And his play has shown absolutely that If there was an all entertainment team in college basketball this year youd have to put Claudier Copelan front and center Well do you remember when I asked him what he had for him tonight What did he say You tell the folks what he said Well sorry the fact that you dont pay attention but he said Oh its going to be a show It was that simple It will be a show And it has been a show as he checks out right now with a conversation with his coach Will Wade after knocking down the second free throw Well the other thing he said he touted his success in rivalry games Now we dont know if hes played in a rivalry game quite like laughter this one High is cheering undercut by Breed and fouled Well Will Wade did tell us to fact check that Quadier made it very clear that hes undefeated in rivalry games cheering but this is the first time participating in this rivalry cheering Reed with a foul Its the seventh on state as part Copeland gets a rest cheering Zayen High who is six of 11 at the free throw line will shoot two and cheering now six for 12 Drake is happy about it Stanley from the office is enthralled Morgan Freeman is very sternly looking at Zaden High cheering Think Mike Wazowskis back there All nature of man and beast High miss them both cheering applause cheering 15 the lead for NC State which has not turned it over in a shooting 61 Sier is fell A much needed stoppage for North Carolina featuring the black Absolutely Coach Greenberg And you know so much about this rivalry As a matter of fact when you were an assistant coach at Virginia you knew that this was the rivalry in the state of North Carolina Before there was North Carolina Duke there was North Carolina and NC State And a lot of it has to do with arguably the greatest player in ACC history DT Thats right David Thompson in the building 1974 national champion but also with the statue outside But the 1973 team was undefeated here for the Wolfpack DT one of the best to ever do it on the ACC floor He was part of nineame win streak NC State had against North Carolina as they owned this rivalry in the 60s and 70s before Carolina really turns it around And theres the number 44 hanging forever in the rafters here in Raleigh First of those two Wolfpack National Championships cheering Zayen High cheering was a one andone situation and High goes two for two Foul was the second on Allen Breed who takes the seat Copeland and Luben are back in for Breed and Sonia Texas State barely gets it across in time Six assists one turnover for the White Pack 14 for 23 shooting McNeel has been quiet until now The fourth assist for Copelan but more importantly getting Paul McNeel cheering established can pay heavy dividends for the Wolfpack is Derek Dickens Dixon was able to get to the rim for the layup UNC starting backboard hit but 0 for 12 before that Dixon drive Copeland again rebound to cheering power and those are the shots that will wade can do without No one else touching the basketball and it turns into an easy bucket on the other end for the Tar Hills Trimble with another fast break bucket Thats the pace you Davis told us he saw more of on Saturday and wanted to see today Luben just toasts high Van Allen Luben perfect from the field Hes four for four And we asked Will Wayade did he need to have a conversation with Ben Allen Lugan going cheering up against his former team Similar to what we he had with Guardia Copeland playing against his previous team when they played Syracuse He made it clear to us no dont have to say a word He is solid as a rock We know he will show up and be consistent Copeland spinning missing Copeland though wrestles the ball from Trimble and NC State has the arrow Well well applause wait through a little fuel on the fire Speaking this summer to a group of one pack members at a dinner on Ben Allen Luben The other school was too dumb to play him I dont know why the hell they didnt play him but were going to play him So hes going to average 15 and eight Were very excited about Ven How far off is he Not far Hes averaging 14 and seven and tonight hes got eight and four which are both careerh highs and youre talking about a young man who started 20 cheering games for the Tar Hills last season Ended the season very well as their cheering starting center and really the one of their most reliable players Meanwhile McNeels bucket stretches the lead at 16 Cop has picked up two straight assists and McNeel wedges that ball away from Dixon cheering NC State has been all over every loose ball tonight Thats poked away from Trimble Abel takes it Ael is denied Itll be State Ball with a minute 24 in the half Thursday night great double header for you on the womens side Duke is unbeaten in the ACC 140 and host NC State at 7 Eastern followed by seventh ranked LSU visiting number 17 Miss in Oxford ESPN and the ESPN app to watch three top 25 teams music Heres Copeland off the inbound Copeland left it short tried again cheering and poked it away from Powell Well hes made it into double figure shot attempts already Copeland Hes five for 11 in this first cheering half but he does have five assists no turnovers to go with it Only one maybe two of those shots will Wade would do without but everything that hes done has been in the painted area Hes been attacking off the bounce just unable to finish on the last two possessions cheering Theres an offensive foul applause going to get Zayen High trying to get post position against Vid Allen Luben First foul on High NC State Cory 30 field goal attempts 23 from two seven from three North Carolina 28 cheering field goal attempts 15 from three And that should be opposite because NC State is the really good threepoint shooting team As a matter of fact they lead the ACC in percentage at 396 But theyve been able to attack and dominate the painted area simply because theres no Henry Bard and theres no Caleb Wilson in the lineup in Carolina Blue Another miss three by Dixon Theyre one out of 16 And theyve had eight different players take a three Lubens going to get hit with his second foul here at the end of the half an offensive foul And Will Wades going to get Luben out of the game Sier will come back in to make sure that he doesnt pick up a third on a defensive possession As Lubens unable to come to a stop before the collision with Powell picking up that second foul So Luben and Williams each with two fouls Theyll set out final half minute Neither team has used a timeout in this half Bogots way short Good defense by McNeel in the pack He was able Shot clock turned off and Arsenal will shoot a three anyway and leave it Arsenal didnt know the time He didnt understand the time to score And Copeland also needs to bring that one back out to make sure the pack get their last shot of the half cheering Dixon instead with a very tough two Follow up from Powell wouldnt go and thats the half NC State owned it They had three players leave And the Wolfpack are in the gaps leaving no driving room So make sure you use Seth Trimble as a screener to possibly get him open Worst shooting half of the year for Carolina 8 for 32 cheering Theyre 100 in the second half but Stevenson scores How about that note on the right Wacks largest halftime lead against a ranked team in three years NC State trying to snap a twogame losing streak And again North Carolina playing without Caleb Wilson out with a broken bone in his left hand He injured it last Tuesday at Miami His return is TBD out indefinitely Next to him Andrew Vesar who was more of a game time call He found out about 90 minutes before he was out with a lower extremity issue Daren Williams not on the floor to start the second half for the Wolfpack who did return applause in the first half So not starting the second half of this game and also has his number one jersey on but does not have on the headband that weve become so accustomed to got some stitches on the left side of his head Do you make anything of Williams starting the half on the bench Obviously it could be injury related as High fouls Luben but he did come back into the game He did come back into the game and with him changing back into the number one jersey I would expect to see him back on the floor However he did hit his head on the floor So anytime that there is any trauma to the head you have to take the concussion protocol in place Even though he did come back on the floor was cleared by the trainers symptoms often are lingering Im not Im not saying that thats the case but without him starting the second half well hopefully see him in this game at some point Sereno started the half for him Three fouls picked up by Carolina by the way in 38 seconds Dixon Bovots and High Dixon and high with her second Morgovage with his first The free throws are good for Luben whos in the double figures Little pressure applied here Carolina breaks it with Dixon Dixon Trimble Boavad Stevenson and High A makeshift starting five for a second straight Tar Hill game And the second straight possession where the Tar Hills have gone to Stevenson in the post He was able to get a bucket on the first possession of the half taking advantage of a mismatch with McNeel Jr cheering trying to defend him This time the Wolfpack bring the double team forcing him to get rid of it Dixon unable to knock down the three Did you like that look from three Yes because it was created by a teammate And again youre Derek Dixon You have to take that shot And if youre a Tar Hill fan you hope that they start to make some of them Now one of 17 from beyond the arc Cop fumbled the ball there 10 to shoot it He feeds Luben who is denied by Zaden High Theres a great block by Zayen High from behind Still able to get him on the basketball Heres another three Another miss from Trimble Offensive rebound High and he was pushed and fouled This was looking like a shore too from the ACCs leading field goal percentage but Zayen High able to come through and get the basketball And I know that there are fans that will be saying Yeah but he fouled him At the point as to where that ball is out of his hands that is no longer a foul with the follow through making cheering contact on the shoulder 10 and seven an assist and two blocks for Zayen High The one area has dominated is on the offensive glass Theyre plus nine though theyre only plus two in second chance points That ball was deflected cheering by Copen So the officials decided two to shoot it Trimbles got to get it up in and out applause Seth Trimble now one of eight Hes played in this rivalry more than enough Only one double figure game in this rivalry and that happened last year in this building The Dar Hills were over State with a one possession win Sher had 15 points in that game Off a miss McNeel three They had Stevenson open under the basket the Heels Instead Dixon finally hits Carolinas second three and its going to be necessary for the Tar Hills to make some threes Anytime you are making a trying to come back from 16 points down youre going to have to be able to make some threes and put that pressure on the Wolfpack to guard you beyond that line Holan had a quiet first half Leans in for his first points applause Also necessary in a comeback attempt is stops They dont get one there The well packed dont anyway as Stevenson delivers with a highflying finish from Dixon 11 for Jiren Stevenson He and Zayen High are both in double figures But thats North Carolina basketball playing fast after makes or misses Even though the Wolfpack were able to score North Carolina gets it out of bounds and down the floor quickly for an easy bucket Holland rebounded by High whos got eight of those Tarheelss on the run again Dixon smother from behind by Arsenal applause and Darien Williams will check into the game 322 into the half replacing Trey Hollow Glad to see Darien Williams back on the floor For those that dont recognize him with without the headband he does have his jersey back on probably put it in the washing machine for a little while cheering Knocked away by Copeland The steal off the inbound Copeland feeds cheering McNeel who was fouled though before the pass applause Already four fouls in the half against North Carolina And remember North Carolina this isnt the doesnt have the depth especially in the front court that they normally would have as Copeland picks up another steal gets a hand on the inbounds play attacks the rim but after passing it off hes fouled will not shoot free throws because he dropped that one off And a big foul Zaden High maybe been their best player today has three So High leaves the floor Stevenson the lone big now for North Carolina Williams goes to work and scores it Well picking up where he left off This is how Darion Williams started the game cheering Attacking the paint The turnaround is good On the switch with Luben cheering feeds an open Dixon Rebound Copeland Williams Oh hes got the switch on Dixon and sensed it immediately cheering Williams goes to work Left hand dribble right hand miss A 16point halftime lead has only been cut by one cheering Theres a travel against Dixon cheering Seventh turnover for North Carolina Dar Williams checks in Were uncertain as to the cheering length of time that Henry Bessar will miss And again without both of these players in the front court which is one of the best front courts in the country you would have to think that Florida is probably at the top But North Carolina with these two players right there But without them on the floor you can see the way the Wolfpack have been able to dominate the paint there NC State plus eight in the paint today 26 points there Williams Copelan denied by Stevenson with one to shoot Copeland gets fouled A total bailout at the end of the shot clock and its already the fifth Carolina foul Nice pass as Copeland sneaks along the baseline Jiren Stevens does a tremendous job reacting and blocking that shot but Seth Trimble getting in the mix and bailing out Copeland sending him to the free throw strike off with the offensive rebound Is now three for five at the line today The foul was the third on Trimble applause He will check out Zaden High who has three fouls checks back in Powell leaves the game Evans is on the floor Goes one for two applause Should say Powell is in Derek Dixon off the floor for Carolina which was down 16 at the half and still is cheering Tar Hills the six seed in Julonards projected bracket NC State is an eighth likely tournament team Not locks Bogot strokes a three And great action to give Bogabots on the move Double screen as Evans is able to find him to knock down the three ball 13point game right now But this is the end of the floor that the Tar Hills are going to have to be able to get some production on if they want to cut into this lead McNeel pulls up and cheering buries it as pure a shooter as youll see in the nation cheering applause Tired Stevenson may have a bloody nose here cheering Pat Driscoll stops the game And I believe it might have been Guadia Copen who went and told Pat Driscoll that there was blood on Stevenson All this games missing right now are tears Bloods on the jersey right you see on the right side on the right shoulder Stevensons jersey Wades pulling his team together with this stoppage their second bloodrelated stoppage of the game after Darien Williams fell hard on the left side of his face four minutes or so into the game See Williams has some stitches right there at the eyebrow That is a basketball player injury Every basketball player has that And yes look at my left eyebrow You see that its partially missing But you if you Thats one way to know a true baller is if their part of their left eyebrow it could be on the right side also but its normally the left that their left eyebrow is missing simply because of stitches When did you get your first ingame stitches Popeye Oh first ingame stitches Oh that was probably What were your worst worst ingame stitches Well the the eyebrow was Popeye Jones He bit me in practice But he he bit you I went up So I went to the basket I felt something warm on my face and my teammate Nick Vanexual looked at me and said Hey CA youre leaking But Popeye was the one challenging me at the rim cheering As we have a turnover an offensive foul applause and cheering turned it over Lets get back to the biting just quickly We got to finish the story Well I I know that it was Popeyes teeth that I know So it wasnt an intentional bite holding It was not that It was not that Maybe your eyebrow look like spinning Williams Big size advantage on Jaden Young muscular cheering move for two but hes been able to take advantage of that throughout this game Regardless as to whos guarding him Jaden Young Derek Dixon cheering Seth Jumbo doesnt matter Darren Williams has had success and has made it the largest lead of the game for the foul Copeland knocked it away from high A Carolina team that cheering has the lowest turnover per game number in UNCC history has coughed it up nine times Williams again fades and nearly had another cuts inside Luca Bogots with five and a half Davis has really been excited about the progression of Bogavas feel as though hes getting more and more comfortable And when you look at this North Carolina team assuming that theyre able to get BSR back healthy soon and Caleb Wilson at the end of the year this stretch of being able to play without those guys will eventually help them establish some experience for other guys especially like Zaden High giving them true depth off the bench inside Young leads free for two Carolinas bench performing now Young with a basket Tar Hills down by 18 a moment ago or cut it to 14 They cannot trade stops for the rest of this game Copeland off his own miss Fully ball from the NC State front 16 for Cuadier to go with five assists cheering four steals and no turnovers Step back three missed by Evans Highpointed by McNeel applause Theres having an all ACC type of night HES HAD A LOT OF THEM cheering Theres Carolina Blue in a spin cycle right now as Copeland has once again taken over this cheering building But his size has been an advantage A 66 point guard A senior who is strong getting the job done on the interior as he would take his time to speak with anyone have a conversation and will absolutely be missed Accepted a football scholarship to play at Illinois transferred to North Carolina ENT was defensive end was a fullback ended a quarterback there and that was only a small part cheering of his extraordinary life story Powell with a finish for North Carolina here at Raleigh with a 5842 lead for NC State WAC led this game pretty much the whole way Carolina only led for 30 seconds early on Copeland with 18 Heres Darren Williams CA with 11 But heres the thing Now hes playing against a bigger player but it doesnt stop him We talked about he is taking advantage of everyone turning his back going to the paint And its nothing complicated about it Its simply you have to guard me oneonone or Im going to get a buck Williams leading the defensive effort as Ael steps in front of that pass for another takeaway Great job defensively by Matt Ael really standing up to the physicality but Zaden High player cheering knew there was an open player There was Williams MISSING FROM THREE ABEL cheering SNEAKS IN THERE in the middle of a trio of Carolina blue shirts cheering Young cheering for three We havent been here the whole season applause Weve been here a lot and its hard to imagine its been much louder in this building for an MC State game than this Theres no team that you can bring in here to make this a louder building than cheering the men in Carolina Blue This rivalry is like no other Im disappointed in the fact that these two teams will only play once this year the ACC When you think about this conference North Carolina should play Duke and they should play North Carolina State twice every year Nine hits a three ACCs done a lot right this year They cut their conference schedule They embraced nonconference Theyve scheduled better The league is much better But theres one thing we agree that could be rectified next year Get these two teams to Chapel Hill and Raleigh 250 meetings deep They deserve to play twice a year and especially when youve got this type of action going on Darien Williams playing against a bigger player takes an elbow right to the starred area However doesnt stop him from getting a bucket A little went on the way back and checks out afterwards But still 13 points for Daniel Williams and an efficient six of 10 from the field Four pack players in double figures Ables one of them HE ADDS THREE MORE FOUR OF FIVE from deep 14 for Matt Ael and Williams leads the war And how about the fact that Matt Ael as a freshman is able to play his first rivalry game against the Tar Hills and have this type of performance Remember Abel was able to check into the game 30 seconds in after the injury to Trey Hollowman So its almost as though he started this game and has been great ever since he stepped on the floor season high just three days ago Hes just three points away from matching that kid who is looked at as a potential NBA player maybe as early as next year 66 freshman cheering high for Stevenson Copeland Reick Its another Carolina turnover You dont see this very often North Carolina minus N in the turnover battle today And these are two of the best teams in the ACC as far as turnover percentage But the Wak have been very cheering disruptive on the defensive end of the floor throughout this game To be fair to them they may lead the ACC in turnovers created able the whole bench jumping when he caught the ball This great defensive recovery by Seth Trumble and thats going to be a back court violation Thursday night North Carolinas womens team is in action taking on Virginia Tech in an ACC double header on ACC Network Stanford and Miami follow those games are both streaming on the ESPN app Tar Hills trying to bounce back from a loss at Duke on Sunday cheering Under eight to play Trimble cant get cheering past Top Powell applause A brick wall built by the Wolfpack defense has led to a bevy of bricks Hollerman not the highest percentage shot of the evening Finle might have gotten away with a walk and thats out of bounds or first Itll be a foul Free throws coming for High Its been all NC State on the six line NC State on the eight line NC State only has three wins right now against the projected field Clemson SMU and then Liberty whos unbeaten in conference Cory for the Wolfpack try to secure an NCAA bid It would be absolutely But when you consider that NC State with a careless turnover Terrence Arsenal throwing the basketball in to Sier who is not looking But outside of Duke no one in the ACC has more quad one and two wins combined than do NC State Duke I believe has 15 NC State has 12 So they may not have as many quad one wins but outside of the Georgia Tech game they dont really have bad losses Three and six in the first quadrant nine and one quad two Well those are determined by the net rankings as Ohios got his first career double double is fouled And right now NC State ranked 29th in the net North Carolina at 25 So a quad run opportunity for both these teams as Will Wade not happy about the call that sends Zayen High to the free throw strike You know from the look of that I dont believe that Will agreed with Pat Driscolls explanation Boy you are a body language expert laughter Dr Alexander I as five in a row from the line Certainly makes for good theater will we Hed be great as a silent film star Hes the best interview in the ACC I mean hands down press conferences interviews and hes an open book Hell tell you exactly what hes feeling Oh yeah applause I think hes taken the postgame press conference championship belt away from Mick Cronin this year though Its been quite a battle between those two Will had another dandy Saturday Ael misses a three Musa cleans it up first bucket for Sier Powell slips and turned it over Arsenal attacking long steps missed it and Sier got pushed in the back applause cheering Be careful to make sure nothing gets out of hand here in the final six and a half Thats the fourth foul on a high Well Sier staying on the offensive glass gets fouled chasing one possession and then Will Wade excited about the action from his team Sier coming off the bench and giving them quality minutes after being injured in the first half and having to leave the floor The will wink We might see that one again on the internet signed a sixyear deal in March Will Wade who uh has certainly returned from college basketball exile for being fired on the eve of the 22 tournament at LSU for multiple alleged NCAA infractions went to MC won there for two years and has resurfaced in major college basketball at NC State signing a sixyear deal into the year one of the winningest coaches by win percentage in the country San hits the front end of the one and one Will Wade is perfect for todays climate in college basketball applause and he tells his players the truth just like hes he does with the media He does not mince words He tells his players the truth He understands that todays game is much more transactional cheering College basketball used to be more of a relationship driven game Now it is much more transactional and Will Ray tells his players the truth about their performance He broke the rules He admits it Arsenal cheering My goodness So a fourpoint possession cheering for the Wolfpack gives the Tar Hills their largest deficit cheering of this season now down 23 in this rivalry game Box with a three When your biggest concern is making sure your players dont spill out on the floor in celebration youre having a good day NC State by 20 from Will Wade said he would bring the red reckoning to Raleigh and it has been a red reckoning from the getgo tonight 20point lead for NC State Zaden High has just fouled out of the game for North Carolina And Will Wade pumps his fist knowing thats the fifth foul But more importantly excited for Ben Allen Luben to be able to get to the free throw line against this team cheering cheering Claudia Copeland Oh my Just were whispering in Zaden Highs ear That I believe that nothing laughter Zaden High is unceremoniously saluted on the way out 12 and 10 for High in his second start in a row Second career start The context for North Carolina is once again they cheering were without their two leading scorers Caleb Wilson and Henry Vessar We did get by the way an amazing stat for you from Steve Kersner the North Carolina sports information director that they tracked the Carolina history all the way back to the start of the ACC They said only once since the inception of the ACC in 1953 One time 73 years had North Carolina played a game without the players who would be their top two leading scorers at the end of the season One time in seven decades and theyve done it now backtoback games And that one time was in 1978 I believe And I know one of the top two scorers was Phil Ford And they lost that game here at NC State not in this building It was at Reynolds Coliseum And they lost that game by five Michael Corin was the other February 23rd 1978 a week away from the anniversary as NC State won 7267 applause Three times in the ACC air So they hope theyll get both players back and they hope Henry Vessar relatively soon He was sick last week They say the Carolina folks hes no longer sick but still dealing with a lower extremity issue And Caleb Wilson with a broken bone in his left hand is also out indefinitely There they are Wilson and Bessar You said one of the best front courts in the nation up there with Florida among others Michigan certainly has to be in that conversation playing at Purdue tonight 101 for Ael applause Dont forget Georgia and Kentucky will follow us here Super Tuesday double header Wildcats have played well in the league Eight and two in their last 10 right here on ESPN A great SEC matchup to follow as Ael goes two for two applause 16 for Ael one shy of his season high Set just a game ago Double team against Stevenson Carolina didnt get out of it quickly enough Trimble Really tough night for Seth Trimble One for nine Well and when you take away Vesar and you take away Caleb Wilson Seth Trumble immediately goes to the top of the scouting report at 19 points for Pittsburgh on Saturday and hes the one guy that will way wants to make sure they take away and theyve done that here with a strong defensive effort Grabs the miss by Young cheering Carolina has never been within single digits in the second half face their largest deficit of the season at 23 Dixon misses a three What do you think Carolina cheering will learn from a beatd down like this Not much you really can learn from this especially when youre playing without both your bigs You hope to be able to get Bessar back in action relatively soon But if not I mean one I do think that North Carolina did a pretty good job when they were executing running guys off of screens trying to open them up for threepoint opportunities in comparison to an old school SEC battle in Lexington guys as we look at what NC State has coming up Theyve got a week in between games Cory and a tough road test at Virginia next Tuesday But remember this team has been even better on the road than they have at home in ACC play 61 on the road And when you give Will a full week to prepare for a tough task at Virginia going to be a great matchup between two of the better teams in the ACC Tough closing stretch NC State still has a shot at a top four seed That would mean a double buy in the ACC tournament starting in midMarch Jonathan Powell gets the little bounce to call Tough shooting night for North Carolina which is at 32 And we talk about getting Henry Bessard back Possibly getting Caleb Wilson back in the postseason maybe even ACC tournament You dont anyone but I would absolutely for a rematch of this game with those two guys in the fold McNeel Paul McNeel becomes the fifth Wolfpack player in double figures and Claudier Copelan adds his seventh assist Stevenson cheering will finish That was great hands by Jiren Stevenson at full speed to be able to catch that basketball and bring it back in for two Stevenson and Zayen High have performed You couldnt have asked any more from those guys in this matchup However its been the perimeter players that really have not shown up for the Tarheelss in this game Luben a little shove to Stevenson and the old Tarheel scores over the new Tarheel to make it a 24point lead cheering And NC State is going really deep into the bench right now Its going to be Jordan Snell cheering coming off the bench as Will Wade takes a substitution timeout And cheering listen to the ovation for zero Well be back in 30 seconds Soak it up Jordan cheering applause Back to Raleigh where the Wolfpack are emptying the bench Allan Breed JORDAN STELL NO Tracked down by Jonathan Powell who is fouled

Wolfpack roster Has been here His dad was a coach here for three years Hes now a senior and cheering decided to stay with the new staff with Bill Wade and with the missed free throw Now this crowd even though its a technical free throw but they miss there will be cheering three Ill let you guess what restaurant sandwiches for everyone cheering No chicken tonight No How often How often do you see Cory a walkon get a technical Well and not a walkon complaining from the bench Lets start with even though although hes one of my favorites hes also a favorite of Will Wade Will absolutely loves Jordan Stale Jordan Stale was in cheering a boot a walking boot during the sixgame winning streak for the Wolfpack And so out of the boot they have not won a game So this is the first win in a minute

career points in now his 27th game cheering Able Oh yeah Tell you what he has been special this evening No season high Well stepping in the game Well thatd be a careerh high for a freshman Stepping in
