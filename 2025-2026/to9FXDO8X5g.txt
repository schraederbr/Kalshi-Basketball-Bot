set to jump and its Old Miss who rocked it all the way out of bounds Malik D is looking at his teammates saying I hit that How come you didnt go get it and hes looking at Ilas Cumber Its going to be NC State ball underneath the Old Miss hoop I I cant remember the last time I saw an opening tip result in the ball going 50 plus feet out of bounds Unique opportunity Store Cardine Perry Dia and Chest start for Old Miss McNeel Breed Copeland Williams and Van Allen Luben the other way They move it around passed up the three takes into the paint for a contested two and a rebound ripped by Cardine The Old Miss offense averaging 75 points a game Hardly a high wire rack towards the 9000 point cheering Travis Perry great shooter Kentucky transfer wide open Burries the first three Yeah good action to put Travis Perry inside the paint And you know when he goes in hes going to make that exit cut to a wide open three NC States defensive issues have been in the backside for a lot of this season so far But Copeland has it now Gets it back and hell throw up his own three and find the bottom An NC State team right now They they come in making 11 threes a game at 39 And if youre Old Miss you have to run the team in white off that threepoint line Copeland averaging almost 17 a game over his last six 33 early Is just bigger than everybody else on the floor And he settles for an 18footer and knocks it down Revy hes too versatile to give him air space and let him see the rim and count 10002 You got to put pressure on him Ball pressure or lack of ball pressure can make a nonplayer a player And Malip Dia is too good Williams gets the high screen to open up the three No good And a contested rebound for the Rebels Yeah rebounding for be a big concern for the team in white Theyre not the most physical team coming out of the ACC Dia didnt score 47 in his last game but he did score 27 Eight on the shot clock Will launch another three And that one is off out of bounds off of Old Miss If youre NC State defensively you come to this game Randy Old Miss has been really good offensively the last two games Why Cuz they have been a downhill grab the paint team So for NC State you have got to guard the ball and set the rules defensively to start this game Williams has gone to the bench Jimmy Darians been hurt a little bit And one of the things that well hear when we come back after the 16minute timeout that tirade that Will Wade went on addressed the teams lack of internal leadership toughness physicality consistency Some of that may have been directed at Williams and hes on the bench early And theres a foul in the back court applause Well when you make a statement like that as a head coach youre youre addressing the entire team but you do have three or four names in mind And just without watching or listening to what Will Wade said if you watch the film for me from Darien Williams the last two or three games that consistent fight energy too casual at times and that that will not work or should it work for the ACC preseason player of the year So Musa Sier big 610 freshman is in the game He got 20 minutes in his last game Pretty drive on a spin move up and in for NC State He has been really good has he not An 8 and5 guy at North Carolina and 13 and seven right now for Will Wade Their best offensive rebounder as well at just right three a game to get double team quickly has to back it out 10 on the shot clock Cardine brought a dribbling difficult fade away Thats off the right side of the iron Just guarded himself on that possession Old Miss did never got a piece of the paint Alioop set up beautifully and cheering again Van Allen Luben Yeah hes he plays so hard for Alan Luben He has his entire career from Notre Dame to Vanderbuilts in North Carolina now NC State A really good portal pickup for Will Way Corner three left wide open Another one misses Old Miss Cold early to start here That is not Old Misss plan for attack again They are a downhill team First McNeel a little too strong Rebound inside Sier will get fouled and go to the line for two Watch the Luben This ball gets in the middle third of the floor and a lot of guys staring at the ball and you cannot allow a guy to get behind your back line of defense Its exactly what happened to Malik Dia He steps up because of that dribble penetration threat coming in for Miss is about to bring in four players A line shift here in an arena that feels like literally theyre playing a hockey game Its about 39 degrees out here Yeah we Well Chris Beards bringing in four guys because Hes got four guys in mind right now that are not playing offensively with the game plan in mind and without the effort that he demands Hes all over Cory Chest right now Hes in the chest of Cory Chest So Pinkkins is into the game Jeff is into the game You look at the other substitutions Casia Hes 88 looking to set a screen here on Breed and he will Both teams have been clean with the ball so far Only a right at 10 turnovers a game All starts with Cardine for Old Miss being the play starter Jifer and Cardine both played in France together when they were younger Theres a double team 3 seconds on the shot clock NC State playing some tough defense early just ate it up did they not NC State guarding the ball guarding the yard and even when that ball screen comes up they just trap the life out of it the air out of it One second now for Old Miss to work with on that shot clock And inbounds and a quick shot No idea No idea If he had an idea Alan Green had a better idea ball pressure putting heat on and really hot a hot start for Will Weights club on the defensive end of the floor Ball will be out of bounds on the side It looked like Old Miss had it been under the basket was about to apply fullcourt pressure and it looks like theyre going to stay in that You and I have known Will Wade for a long time He gets players and he can really see the game like an elite level high IQ basketball mind inside that red jersey The 66 senior out of Syracuse two years at McNe came over with Wade Great pass and a basket What a pass and great hands and a layup by Ben Allen Ruben whos having his way early here Randy that was a scoring screen by Ben Allen Luben up top Theyre going to 701 now But man the physicality of NC State really well done so far ESPN that was a strong message sent to start this game much more like a Will Wade coach team Shot of an 80 run now The largest lead of the game And Williams has been on the bench since he got subbed out early looked like he was supposed to be guarding Travis Perry on that opening three I mean just cannot get inside the teeth of the defense Right Carbine has tried Meanwhile Jifel launches a lefthanded three No good Rebound NC State Were going to get a foul before the travel If you cannot go by your guy talking about Old Miss it could be a long afternoon And again Chris Beard been very pleased with this team We talked to him last night for about 30 minutes you and I did and theyve been a downhill aggressive but they they just cannot get inside that defense to start this game All right Williams is back in Timmy he was the all preseason player of the year in the ACC We saw Cam Boozer who was clearly the front runner for that even though Duke lost last night to Texas Tech Well were talking about one in white He was one of the most soughtafter portal guys in college ball this year Watch out Yeah McNeel 0 for two to start and a chance here Twoon one Another three ball is missed by Old Miss Jimmy they continue to struggle They are one of six Its not their strength Theyre making just seven a game at 35 Thats 15th out 16 in the SEC Ravi good hands Good hustle by Miss to get on the ground and then a fullon rugby scrum So lets think about that music Old Miss only averaging seven threes a game 15th in nonconference play in the SEC So if youre NC State theres no reason to get overstretch You put hard ball pressure on you get in those gaps and you see if Chris Beards team can make enough jump shots to beat you So far the answer is no Is it a question of taking what the defense is giving you Why are they doing something theyre not very good at Well yeah So far Miss is taking what the defense is allowing them to take So theyre going to have to get the ball side to side and somehow get NC State in some closeouts and get to the what is normally the painted area of the floor which this floor is not painted Now Hollowin great defense by Scott He relocates for a three Got it I say it all the time In an odd way the basketball knows when it should go in and it always knows when its been an offensive rebound Remember Perry started this game off by bearing a three They were two of two and they have missed their last five shots Look at those white jerseys The ball pressure just in the space Free throw jumper way too strong And another miss for Miss Can he knock down number three No he cant Off that 47point effort Hes missed his first three threepoint field goals And good hands there by Copeland to blow up what would have been a corner three or a layup NC State runs a green light system where they race that ball up the floor reverse it around as well as anybody in the ACC But thats what Im talking about That offensive rebound that ball knows it should go in on the next shot because defensively you did not clean me up And NC State makes him pay Matt Ael good shooter is into the game number three and hell guard the inbounds Will Wade we know this Jimmy hes a very good defensive coach and he will make sure that he takes advantage of the assets he has offensively We weve seen it for years at LSU and of course at Nick Nice He feeds the hot hand He runs good actions and hes like I said hes got a brilliant eye in mind within the game where I can have an advantage It feels like Diaz has got the advantage sizewise Theyre going to get him going Zero in blue Keeps dribbling into trouble Will pumps his fist five times on that sideline Real heavy That was nail protection 10 out of 10 by NC State by Darian Williams Just sat on that nail and attack that basketball with two hands And Chris Beard right now has got his hands full How do we generate some offense in this game Heres your answer Fullourt defense trying cheering to do something Chris Pier to create something off of this end of the floor Holings to push Jifa out of the way Williams away from the basket challenging Dia whos got one foul Well that is five out offense is it not And Hollermans got five on the shot clock Williams is going to have to pull the trigger here And he steps through No the shot would have counted Sier in there And another loose ball jump ball going to go to Miss So what are we seeing out of NC State in the half court offense Were seeing five guys outside that threepoint line And then late in the clock like 12 or less they run a guy to the dunker spot and turn it to four around one Why do you do that Now the gaps are bigger You have double gaps A simple but very effective offense for NC State Williams 0 for two to start this game Diaz out at the threepoint line And there is another three well short No blue shirts underneath That is exactly the shot that NC State wants Old Miss to settle for in this game chest fouled by What are you doing there How are you riding like a sea biscuit up the side down the stretch I mean you jam the basketball in the back court I get it to slow Miss down but you have been outstanding with your half court defense Why even flirt with getting into foul trouble 1211 left Jimmy they havent scored at all miss a point in six minutes Well you mentioned Malik Dia leads him in scoring and Malik Dia has to be good every single night in SEC play Old Miss is going to be any factor looking at postseason play Perry three way off Scott tracked it down threw it off of an NC State defender Good hustle that time by Old Miss chest was the one to go and hes going to come up and just set a big time ACC screen and then dive right out of which is really good action But watch the force bam right there I mean he just delivers the blow and just gets his eyes quickly on the ball But that type of physical play man thats what Will Ways been asking for from his entire team and it shows up in different areas That time it was that on ball screen and dive out Vin Allen Lubener is seven today And has been around Notrere Dame Vanderbilt North Carolina and now here NC State Perry cant get it to go Their struggles have been brutal One of nine from three Two of 11 overall Nine of their 11 field goal attempts Threepointers And a foul there against Old Miss Its going to be against number one Thats Cory Chest So in that timeout Im sure for Will Wade feeding his guys confidence Hey we can lock these guys up Weve got them doing something offensively they dont want to do Just stick with what were doing Will always has that look like are you really thinking what youre saying Does he not There are many looks of Will Wade Thats definitely one of them A lot of teams have gone to baseline out of bounds under putting size on the ball Thats what Miss has going right now And they squared up Theyre not so concerned about taking away this angle like we used to be That size on the ball has become pretty prevalent Brad to his right able to swing it Hollowmans got an open three and that thing nearly stuck right between the rim and the backboard No pass ahead by miss in their transitions Theres a very slow opportunity running off of the defense Good defense by NC State though as Dia will try to back Williams down Difficult fade away but he gets it to go You know what though Will patt him on the backside when he ran by and said Hey good shot But you know why He made a tough two You live with that all the time Theres a quick three from Williams That one didnt go and its out of bounds and will stay with NC State In the last shot I think as all five white jerseys are in the paint maybe one on the ball when this shots taken They are just absolutely suffocating those gaps turning Old Miss into a jump shot team Really well done offensive Yeah you can see cleared some space to Copen to get to the basket and our official was all over it Here and the guard that transfers from MCN State with Will Wade Hes going to get that off arm right there Thats an easy call to make on 11 and White But the one thing about Copeland Rabbi he has had some turnover issues at McNaging about two and a half a game right now But boy such a weapon when you got that size at the point guard at 65 Jifa picks up his dribble far away from cheering the hoop Thats one of the things you notice here too Jimmy Old Miss their inability to have the point guard drive by and create any opportunity You know what I mean Nobody can You can just sense I can just looking in the eyes of NC State like coach I got mine Yeah we can lock these guys down You mentioned Copeland He started his career at Syracuse alongside Malik Brown who of course is now at Duke But here Copeland talking about 11 right on the ball He he gets Will Wade So that alone puts you in a unique category Will loves his voice Hes got some dog in him and hes that nice guy that will wait said I want you with me in the ACC And a little penetration whipped away by Hollerman Out of cheering bounds with a catch Some more stifling defense by the pack Now thats thats ball pressure cause and off ball pressure caused to force that was normally a pretty straight line cut to the ball to get crowded on that sideline NC State just kicked one to the curb last weekend They they had Kansas in a great opportunity to win that game And Copeland pretty left hand spin applause cheering get you at 65 with that long reach can make guarded tough twos at the rim Copen just did everything cheering that Old Miss has been unable to do the entire game Get by your guy get in the paint and make a layup Not a surprise given all the threes that they were taking 80 in the paint for NC State the advantage Well theyre getting anything they want right now Certainly that threepoint shooting tightens up that offball defense Now the gaps get bigger and you give a big gap Hes going to get to the rim Like I said a 65 with a long arm He can make challenge shots at that spot on the floor Classic He is a good shooter who like most of the miss players hasnt found his shot yet Foul line jumper off to the right Good rebound in traffic by Cadier Copeland Challenging shot Had three white jerseys from the cup at the rim Just a clinic defensively Looked up Copeland pretty move Oh he had an open three and he couldnt hold on to it Braided no good Battle for the rebound and its Old Miss Perry Thats his shot and thats good Until Miss does that theres no reason for NC State to change their defense Theyll just stay gap heavy I know youre late recovering to a pretty good shooter but so far you have been really good at taking away that downhill action of the Rebels But Allen has that ball ripped away Perry comes up with it Old Miss despite the fact that theyre shooting this way theyre only down six They have 10 points with 832 to go And Perry gets the roll When youre the alltime high school scoring leader for Kentucky the state of you can put the ball in the basket And Travis Perry known for his threepoint shot at that time with a tough deterrent too And to your point Old Miss just down four Quality as theyve been on the offensive end Copeland why not Its his game right now Copeland pounding his chest in front of the misb You cannot dare NC State to shoot the ball Too many guys 40 or higher in their top five scores All five of them penetration kiss off the window A little too strong numbers for NC State after he falls cheering a shot off some score in a beautiful defense cheering Nice slow lazy nonaggressive defensive play from behind by Miss Means Store just casually walks in allows a threepoint shooter to squeeze one off guy Miss has got a shot in SEC play If hes an 82 two rebound guy They dont have a shot in USC play Theres not enough there to go along with Commerdine and Dia D has been held in check Four points Perrys got the other eight now Hes in the paint And that is what Malik Dia is certainly capable of doing Hes a very good versatile player of a below the rim guy that just carves out space like that match up against Perry McNeel Jr That one looked better from the shot and it drops Gunners know how to get open I say that as a compliment to McNeel cuz thats what he is Does a violent cut right behind that penetrating drive Feet were set Perrys feeling it Thats no good Largest lead for NC State Williams has it open place with sort of a freestyle doesnt he Now this is a mismatch right here Theyre going to get a block on Perry who was run over by Williams Thats what happens though Ravi If youre NC State and you bring this ball up with speed youre going to get a mismatch right off the bat That is a mismatch All created by NC States urgency to push that ball up not letting Miss talk it out and make sure were naturally matched up First foul on Perry Four fouls against NC State six against Old Miss And Williams trying to take advantage again He threw Perry out of bounds We saw Travis Perry whos just a phenomenal shooter and he certainly has put on a little muscle and a little weight at Old Miss this year his high school team his graduating class rather from Lion County had 65 in their class I mean his old school Hooers they won the entire Kentucky State Championship where all classifications play for the state tournament Diaz feeling it a little bit Hes going to go to the free throw line A great move on the baseline Ravi think about Travis Perry from Eddieville Kentucky graduating class He had 65 kids per class and they a storybook ending similar to Hooers cut down the Mets his senior year Free throw good Jimmy Coming up next here on ESPN of the app mens basketball showdown Cincinnati Clemson will be at the B course Wellness Arena Thats in Greenville Final game for each before the holiday break as Dia makes one of cheering two Something that typical ACC team just watch out Jimmy Mr McNeel made two in a row on the freezer f Its all about the speed that they bring it with Thats the green light mentality that will way plays with Dia cheering gets called for leaving his feet and walking on a lane Hope is not a plan You heard me say that before He was just hoping something good would happen out of it Leak D is a good player but he just drives in trying to create something out of nothing Hoping that something good is on the back end and its not This is a Rubiks cube for a group of guys that right now how to figure it out They have 15 points with 547 to go And you got to be careful McNeel coming off that 47 point effort has made two threes in a row He had 11 in that game Good pass to Williams He trips and hes going to go to the line now with the seventh foul against Old Miss And we have questioned I have his motor a little bit to start this season But you can see the skill package that he packs 230 lbs Hes probably 65 standing by in pregame warmups talking about Darien Williams But boy a really tough cover And what an area that he does need to improve Hes shooting less than three free throw attempts a game with that body and that versatility and the isolation the freedom that he plays with That number should be at seven or eight a game Elite eight last year with Texas Tech He became sort of the second option on that team JT Toppen who we watched last night and that Texas Tech win over Duke Heres what hes done as far as points per game and this year up by one youd like to see him get to the line more I would Some guys are just not wired to be the guy like JT Toppin Christian Anderson from Texas Tech are wired like that But this is a guy that has to be really good for Will Wade in ACC play And how good was Texas Tech last night Just another monster win right for the Big 12 Yeah theyve had a lot of them more than any conference three corner Yes sir They are raining right now for the Wolfpack Seven for 15 from deep Theyre going to get a foul before the block Members will tell you NC State They see a big rim on that perimeter but it all starts with that paint touch Grabbing the paint by Copeland and Trey Hollowman right there to knock it down A 43 threepoint shooter Didnt shoot the ball at that high of a clip at Michigan State He also did not start Wednesday for the first time this year So maybe that after game rant was directed a little bit of Trey Hollowman as well Yeah a veteran coach There are times where you can not start your star players and there are other games you really cant do that and there are games you issue the ultimatum like he did knowing whats coming next and he he did both of those things effectively as Pinkkins knocks down one of two Well were talking about Texas Tech Christian Anderson Texas Tech played all 40 minutes last night almost the entire game and never never any moment did he play tired And that is a great quality as a player McNeel three in a row Great look too as he set up the corner NC State has made six Streaming White went off for 47 points in the last game tied the ACC record with 11 made threes a new school record and thats one guy you hung up to the entire game if youre Old Miss McNeil is the only scholarship player back from last year Of course Will Wade changed this whole thing And thats going to be a foul cheering on the floor against the Wolfpack Second foul against Williams Williams coming back in His hands are raised wondering like who in the world am I taking out going to be Cory Chest uncharacteristic you think about Chris Beard whos in year three now at Old Miss in his third year at Texas Tech they played in the NCAA title game and at least through the early part of this season and certainly this game there doesnt appear to be a lot of traction a lot of cohesion they went through a four game loing stretch Iowa and Utah on neutral floor Miami Florida and then at St Johns and all those games they were in the 60s7s scoring but just have not its interesting its not the only team rather you know a lot of teams only return one or two guys but miss only return one guy hes played a lot more live basketball in practices this year just trying to get some separation like who are my best five or six dudes and doesnt have the answer yet will try too strong with the offensive board McNeel to the corner Open three Hes got four in a row What did I tell you about runners They know how to get over The ball went opposite of him He didnt stand and watch He slid and made a quick scoring cut The ball finds cutters Travis Perry He pushed right there Copens mouth may have some blood trickling out of it And another three that is missed for Old Miss The frustration for Beard Rose And watch out for McNeel There he is No good that time AJ Stewart Not even close Copy continues to dribble through a maze The alleyoop Pretty play and the finger roll from cheering Sier NC State having its way every way such cheering that Chris Beard is ready to switch all five miss players out This is ugly for Old Miss Youre being kind because Christmas is a few days away I mean Old Miss right now just discombobulated on both ends Confidence not there but credit NC State They throw strikes and they know who to throw strikes to Its two in white Yeah I I am And uh Seth I would agree Just theres no life theres no fight theres no purpose right now in those Old Miss uniforms And we know Chris Beers a ball coach man Hes just got to be just wrecking his inside to see his guys play like this But I credit what Will Wade has done the last couple of weeks as his team Chris knew coming in that Will Way was getting his team right He watched that same rent and NC State playing like those MC State teams just a pack of dogs A bad pass Dia would have had an uncontested layup Another loose pass and Klaskki got his hand on it But with all that lack of intensity and effort you literally could run the Will Wade postgame rant about Old Miss You know you could put him in an Old Miss uniform as a head coach and say the same things about the way the Rebels are playing And they are certainly putting the miss in Old Miss with their shooting Theres a terrible turnover Was it deflected The officials look at each other and say No they are shooting six of 20 from the floor and two of 12 16 from threepoint I I can tell you where Chris Beard is This is not a shot at Zack Day but Zack Day number 31 for Old Miss that far right corner has played a total of six games 38 minutes And Chris Beard saying Im just going to play someone thats going to play hard And thats about all he can try to accomplish right now before he can get in that locker room Sier back in Were at the 230 mark of the first half And it has been all Wolfpack Miguel Jr throws it to Breed He buries a three They are sharing the sugar today Out of their 12th assist their 28th field goal attempt Theyve made 15 12 of those have been assisted And Wills so good at scoring and setting that 221 press to shorten your shot clock Bad pass And the worst pass Yeah that wasnt good either Thats right I I see your bad pass and Ill raise you one Theres a decent one Thats up and in Finally a point in the paints Thats their first two Check that Thats their second field goal in the paint tonight Typically NC State will change their defenses throughout the course of the game Theres no reason to change it if youre willing Your half court manto man has just locked Miss up McNeel on the floor is able to keep it alive Alan Ruben shared it Another one comes back to him and the loose balls are going to NC State Wipe the floor up But we talked about in the open miss NC State neither one of them coming into today had won a ball game against a team out of a power four conference and miss looking at a steep steep uphill right now And that loss Seth knows it being a head coach that loss prior to Christmas especially when your team has not lived up to expectations so far sticks with you It more than sticks with you It will steal your joy if you dont guard your heart as a coach A lot of individual dribbling going on day is into the game and there are five on the shot clock Perry Klaskky he got everybody in the air and hell draw the foul Revy Old Miss its look where they are the season They won seven games They they can win with paint touch offense Miss can they cannot be good teams with no paint touch offense and that has summed up this first 20 minutes Perry and Pinkkins can knock down a three but it all sucks up with Misss ability to get inside the T3 defense and it just has not happened for Chris Beard in this first 19 minutes Klafky knocks it down Later on more basketball here on ESPN on the app will have a second annual Invisalign Bay Area Womens Classic An old rival square off in both Stanford in Oregon at 6 Eastern 3 Pacific and then Jazzy Davidson and the 19th ranked USC Wington and Cal Chase Center Two good ones before the teams get some time off for the holiday break Womens basketball double header coming up later And of course a womens volleyball championship which has been outstanding An all SEC final on ABC at 330 this afternoon Now that is huge Kentucky I think beatsm in the regular season Three sets to one Look at moving He launched a three No good Why not Just quick shots no rebounds They have one offensive rebound all day Cop Great pass underneath to Sier and he will draw the foul Boy Copeland is having fun today Hes having fun and Chris Beard is not Yeah I mean look look at the guys Chris Beard has on the floor to finish out the first half and all the dudes that hes got sitting on the bench to finish out this first half This this this is about an overall message This is about whats not acceptable what is acceptable within this miss program right now And man just what a disheartening way to enter an off week for Chris Beard in Oxford They had some plane troubles We were uh scheduled to meet them for a shoot around 600 pm Eastern time Would they land around 9 Yeah And just it it does throw off your mojo and as a coach I wasnt as a head coach I wasnt a superstitious head coach but I was stitious Like when things happen you like okay this just this not getting off on a good foot Probably kind of felt like that for Miss last night Arriving 3 hours late Still no excuse for not playing as hard as you can play Carrie got his hand in there They got a chance here to at least go into half feeling a little better as he knocks down another three Hes been outstanding So Avis Perry has done his music part No one else has done theirs Hes got 11 on three threepoint field goals Halftime 45 Will on his bench I think it was Chris said it really well Polar opposite of the message at halftime Yeah if youre Chris Beard Im sure its centered something around everyone in this room has 20 minutes left to show me who you are Forget about the score Show me who you are as we head into Chriss break and then well address it once we all get back together in Oxford in five or six Oh thats not a great start for Miss An easy bucket inside the paint Good penetration by Williams And and the patience of Chris Beard is over So now were checking in If youre Old Miss hes bringing in Nico Mandalo who has played a total of five minutes because Chris Beard obviously not happy at all with the opening defensive possession What a what a miserable spot rabbi for coach to be in at this point of the season So weve taken away the short leash to no leash There theres zero leash in the second half You can tell by his starting five Hes playing guys started in the second half with guys that never played Williams is having an easy time getting into the paint and getting deep And that one is going to stay with NC State So theres the defensive mistake Trotting off Agusto Casia the opening defensive possession Chris Beard said out So Bundo is in And hold on I think Chris Beard wants to take a look at this And this is the old appeal Jimmy That ball was off of plays basket interference goalending If theres been a call you can challenge that as well And those restricted arc plays I hope in the offseason we have a conversation about giving both coaches two challenges and going away from the appeals We have appeals and challenges It can get a little confusing Appeals are different because an appeal you dont have to have a timeout left to appeal something If you lose the appeal then its also an administrative technical foul And the appeals are more centered around timing issues We think it was a playrint foul but was it a two or a three Those type of plays So a little confusion but Chris Pier right on top of that last coachs check Yeah I agree Rare miss inside for Williams after Dia powered his way in for two A bundelo is into the game He wears seven As Jimmy pointed out Chris Beards leash has now disappeared An effort will keep you on the floor Lets see if Dia can go to work again on the baseline with seven Who will pull up line drive shot too strong and move blue shirts underneath Man how many of those shots has almost had to take in this ball game Just tough challenge twos and white jerseys all over that defensive glass McNeel what a pass Really cheering good look down low to Finn Allen Luben Well the disparity between the two teams paint touches and paint passing and penetration is so stark Its interesting Ravi because after the basket Chris Beard walked down cheering to the end of his bench where his normal minute guys are and Im sure he said something like Thats on you Williams Ty Arer no good got a chance to go get it and its out of bounds Does that make sense though Hey if you if you were in the game this wouldnt be happening to us But I cant trust you cheering to play you right now So every point thats getting scored against us its against guys that dont get a lot of time So you get dunked on Chris Beard looks to the end of his bench and says that thats on you This should not be happening to us but this is on you right now Williams Perry will launch a three Another one that is just off the backboard before it makes any contact with the rim Man if you want a lesson on how hard youre supposed to play watch it go back and watch that Houston Arkansas game yesterday And both those teams brought a high motor especially Houston or go watch Caleb Wilson from North Carolina He had a 20 and 15 game against Ohio State I havent seen a freshman consistently play harder than Caleb Wily from UNC all year long It was pretty interesting too listening to Cal as the three balls missed off the back iron You know hes been in a bunch of tight games won a couple lost three of them He said about Houston that was the one game he said we didnt really have a chance at kind of a different level And thats thats what Houston is with Samson and poor Keshu We were talking with Will Wade prior to the game about the Big 12 has legitimate five national title contenders maybe a 16 possible Elite 8 final four They are this years version of the SEC last No doubt That is where they have gone to The quality depth at the top Texas Tech entered that chat conversation How about cheering a throw down and another one where Beard will probably send a message to the end of this bench Oakland Rabby I I will be shocked if Chris Beard plays those last four or five guys settled there this ball game Perry Clafgate cheering one more Even the extra look doesnt work Well we got 1548 to go here It cannot go quick enough for Chris Beard and miss And how good is part of your offensive burst That should be unbelievable television A chance for a big blue nation to have one heck of a weekend right Kentucky kind of got right over the weekend and backtoback wins over Indiana and the St Johns team I thought was just average yesterday But man credit Kentucky defensively and Jaden Quaintance he changes how Kentucky looks especially on that defensive end He just changes how they look He does We can credit Mark Pope for saying you know what I I love to shoot threes I love to have a free flowing back and forth game but thats not who we are this year So he has rebuilt his team over the last two or three weeks since we saw that beat down they took from Gonzaga Theres a long pass from Perry and another three ball that goes high off the backboard Loose ball ends up in the fingers of NC State Both Dia and Mundo had a chance at it Thats going to be a foul on Buffalo But yeah Beard gets up out of his slapping for the effort I mean thats what youre thats how youre supposed to play the game I mean Nico Bungalow five minutes total coming in Hes going to get 15 or 16 here in this second half And I I know Chris Beard well enough I I will be shocked if he plays store and Scott and Chess Comedine in the second half Harry and Dia are the only guys that started that are on the floor right now and that is Hollerman a 61 Flight was delayed three hours Which flights more enjoyable Last nights dreaded delay or this one Easy Easily last night Last nights pressure from Hollerman Theyre going to get a foul on He pressured Klafky and they got him and Will is like Nah I dont think so Third on Trey Holland Trey Holland he was really good for a late stretch for Sparty last year and he had a twopoint two assist game in the loss to Auburn But just a solid old veteran just a good college guard No Yeah there were a lot of people surprised when he left They figured he was an okay He was like our kind of guy at Michigan State Playing time diminished a little bit as McNeel lands another cheering one I I love him as a shooter but hes got some dog in him man He He plays with energy Hes always fighting to get himself open Dia no good Look at McNeel right there I mean he aint got a traffic rebound You dont go up again Jimmy Why not Rabbi when Will Wade got hired he instantly brought the smoke and the spotlight on NC State as he talked about in his opening press conference Chris Beard going to do what I didnt think hed do Hes going to bring these guys back in for another shot Was the first six minutes sending another message to pretty much his main guys But Will Wade from the opening getgo has said Were NC State We have to be different than what weve been in the past And you build that by being different by having dogs and playing hard playing a style Hes had success everywhere he goes He may not do things conventionally but in the NIL world that that is real wage the way it is You know NC State is a very supportive community when it comes to basketball They theyve had some glory days there for sure Well if if you hire a guy at NC State that doesnt have some type of an edge to him youre cheering just going to continue to get Oh chance for McNeil with his sixth of the game He will continue to get shoved to the side by North Carolina and Duke and Wills not going to get shoved to the side by anybody Whether it happens in the first year or not I dont know But it all starts with 11 and white Copeland Again you just watch Paul McNeel move as the ball is moving away from him He doesnt stand and watch Hes not locked into a certain real estate spot on the floor He knows angles He knows how to get himself open as a shooter He is a tough cover cuz hes all rev Hes all up 65 McNeel and long arms for a shooter Cop penetrated kicks for a three Theres some penetration and a tough shot that finally goes down for miss Difficult shot by Jifa Williams No he continues to really struggle Hes been the one guy Jimmy 0 for seven from the floor that has struggled today It wasnt lost on you though when the five guys came back in the first play Cop goes into the paint kicks for a three Yeah he hears back to that offense that just no no purpose There you go Knocks down a three And that was the right pass It wasnt the extra pass It was the right pass Turn down one that was pretty good to get one that was wide open Penetrates again And hes got his buddy who gives up the three Hot potato for a three And a layup An air ball from Hollowman It is put back up and in by Copen Air balls are hard to rebound defensively but still that it will not set well with Chris Beer I dont know I might go back to the end of the bench again I think thats exactly what hes doing He he has seen enough I mean he gave his guys another fourminute opportunity to show me something and they did They they showed him coach right now you cant trust me You cant trust my effort You cant trust my execution You cant trust my voice You cant trust my body language Its a lonely walk when you walk by the coach and not only does he not look at you he looks away from away from you Its so discouraging That Seth Greenberg can speak to it as well as a coach to see your team just be this much of a funk Im not saying that Seths guys ever were but you can you know the feeling youre absolutely sick at the pit of your stomach to watch your guys lack of competitiveness Well and you mentioned it often Its your holiday break but it means when the calendar turns were in conference play This is where you should really have things together as Hollowman lays off that little righthanded finger roll Chris told his guys last night Christmas break doesnt start until the end of the game against NC State and we circle up and say the Lords Prayer They they missed that message They never started in this game A paint touch that comes up short and finally actually a cut in the middle of the paint Watching Kley start thinking about point guards that are really performing at a high level How about Braden Smith yesterday What he did against Auburn A phenomenal 88 to 60 win What do you have 14 assists in that game He he to me Braden Smith is the best passing point guard I remember in college basketball in the last 10 or 15 years He He is that good Good for him The only holdover right from Kevin Keats say Coach I think Im one of your kind of guys and Ill prove it to and he has he got himself into the starting lineup last couple of games and uh the future is bright for McNeel And in a world of college basketball where threes are so important hes going to be an important guy for Will Wade Will Wade saw two outstanding backtoback shooting games Unfortunately one of them was from Melvin Council Jr at Kansas who made nine and his guy made 11 next game That was big body on big body and Abub will get called the foul team Diaz is 250 Im thinking just maybe what do you think 244 as hes coming out Wayade gives him a high five Talking about Texas Tech beating Duke last night giving them their first loss You look at the ACC I do as Duke to me would still cheering be as we finish up nonconference play I would put them number one in the ACC A little bit concerned I heard Seth talking about it I think at halftime or maybe in a cutaway But whos the second guy that youre going to count on every night to go along with Cameron Boozer I think is a issue with John Sh right now Watch out Here comes Dia contested OH MY GOODNESS And thats why Chris Beard has kept him in the game that the other starters have to sit and watch He He trusts where Malik Dias heart is He cares about the right thing He works and Chris Beard rewards him with playing time His other starters have to watch I love Trey Hollerman Its 6336 and a train at 250 is coming at you What are you doing Yeah You know right there behind Duke I I think is is North Carolina That combination of Caleb Wilson and Henry Vasar you could argue the best twoman front line in college ball Seth Trimble showed up big against Ohio State Boy he missed an easy one there He gets it back and he threw it to Beard But do do you agree the ACC is better this year Not back to where we are used to the ACC being but certainly better No question Watch out right here Youre playing Holland He tried He did Dia looked at him like Wait a minute Sometimes youre the windshield Yes Sometimes youre the bug Yep He avoided being the bug which was good I like North Carolina though Yeah theyre better I mean to me thats sort of the X factor in the conference cuz it was always Duke Carolina or Carolina Duke To have them back into that conversation its critical to the conference And Rick Forest is better Theyre better And Im Im a little disappointed in Louisville Now you and I have called their two losses You and I have had them at Arkansas and at Tennessee But you know what we wont have anymore is that Louisville game Yeah But their lack of physicality is alarming when they go up against a physical team Thats a real concern Im sure for Pat Kelsey heading into Christmas break We saw against Arkansas and Tennessee Two physical teams They just beat him up Absolutely beat him up Speaking of Arkansas Tennessee good game coming out of uh New Years January 3rd right Arkansas 10 Tennessee at Arkansas in open conference play You and I will be there Darius Aub for Arkansas is as good of a wellrounded point guard as Ive seen in a long time Was able to shoot that basketball The separator go with his downhill speed First three ball of the game for Smith who just entered it about 2 minutes ago Hes played a total of six minutes prior to today Yep Hes now two for four from the threepoint line so he needs more shots Go cheering Trapped in the corner out of bounds and it will with NC State as they bring three back including cheering I think a lot of people are here waiting for McNeel to continue to shoot for the 63s Rav I would be so embarrassed if I was an miss player over there right now cheering going down the line of those guys that are starters with store and chess comine Scott like that Thats embarrassing on national TV to not have any more care and fight and passion and and effort than you have played with to the point that the coach has to sit you down and not play you and allow guys that are practice players to take your minutes cheering Sit you down twice Yes He he sort of said to you you know what you can go back in the pool but if you splash somebody youre coming out right away They cant get back out Yeah Yeah Its its going to be fascinating to see the challenge that Beard has ahead of him to see how this team if possible to turn it around He has a huge challenge because theres Travis cheering Perry doing what Travis Perry can do But they they get back to Oxford tonight off of a charter and they disperse for Christmas break A lot of time for coach Beer to sit and stew and try to figure out what buttons do does he push when they get back together He stood up there and he went over to the scorers table to try to get Travis Perrys attention and he got ripped down did Travis Perry Help back up by Williams But those two remember Jimmy have been battling since literally the first minute of the game and Williams threw him down Thats going to be number three on Darian Williams You talked about it when came to warm up today Theyre theyre not an oversized team at all So theyre going to get caught in some untraditional matches like Perry had to slide up and guard a bigger guy today in Williams but it just it is what it is And the SEC is an unforgiving league Its not at all what it was last year but still a league thats going to have nine or 10 bids you know and thats itll be right there with the Big 10 and Big 12 in terms of numbers But the teams that we have our eyes on I say we in college basketball are the legitimate national title contenders Theyre coming out of the Big 10 the Big 12 Gonzaga Duke Yukon Yukon maybe North Carolina Its the list is pretty short as we head into Christmas It could change NC State draws the foul on CIA Well theyre stuck on 63 by the way Perrys got a career best for points in a game Hes got 16 Its an 110 run for Miss Shoot more Chris Beard was involved with Travis Perry out of high school It came down to Kentucky and Miss and Travis Perry Fouronone Jimmy Shoot it or pass it Yeah cheering Pretty flash Theyve outscored him 23 18 The five that Chris has played in the second half has played harder than the five he played in the first half That was an aggressive defensive play which Im sure will resonate And Chris Beard is a half court clapping right now Klavky went over and saw the loose ball like a football and went on it like they should recover the fumble He took the player with him His dad Rogerio was on that Brazilian national team in the I think he played in the 1996 Olympics But you got to Yeah thats a slip on that sticker with a with a sticker slip You got to protect those guys in loose ball situations But I mean its just plain as day what Chris Beard is thinking right now about his team Hes not even acknowledging the guys on the end of the bench Three ball corner pocket That one is good Theyve shot really well from three today Over 40 now 13 of 30 Its almost like Chris Beard is sending the message Ive got two starters as we head into Christmas break Dia the kid with the ball and now Travis Perry with a fake handoff Those other three spots thats off are are are wide open when they come back after Christmas cheering break I mean wide open cheering And he is a really good kid The senior to Belmont first Just a really good kid whos done a ton Put in extra work Jimmy he he shoots late at night He shoots early in the morning He does yoga like you do Hes changed his diet Hes done a million things to make himself a better player cheering And hes still sitting here man Hes working on this bench You know Chris Beard will describe Malik Dia as a guy that works He and he cares about Old Miss and his hearts in the right place He has one of the higher usage rates in the SEC last year and again this year He will He had a monster 188 game in the second round win against Iowa State last year in that NCAA cheering Good player like really good player 14 points seven rebounds today for Dia That three is a little too strong on the rebound from traffic is Williams Ravi if you want a team that plays really hard you know the secret Recruit guys that play really hard I just dont think you can take a guy thats got a four as a motor and make him into a nine or a 10 Ive never seen it happen You can take a guy that comes in playing at a seven or eight and get him to a nine or 10 but those guys that are three or fours Im not saying the guys hes not playing right now have a three or four of a motive They did in the first half Im just saying if you want guys that play hard a team like Harrys doing Yeah thats who you recruit Like you said you dont pull the Whos your story in the state of Kentucky title unless you got some toughness in you No you do not Relocation three Perry have a game son Travis Perry 19 of the game for Travis Perry I I know its only 6 minutes to go and it doesnt feel like the games a threat but look up and its a cheering 66 to 52 game because Chris Beard has rewarded the right things about basketball Just play as hard as you can play and youll get some time Down low challenged by Dia but a good finger roll there Ben Allen Rubiks had a very consistent good game Its important that Ben Allen moving stays on the floor for NC State Good hands And here we go Cop Oh baby A little show for the NC State fans here in Greensboro applause And a Sports Center top 10 dunk cheering for Quad Deere Copeland Theres a reindeer named Rudolph that gets up like this this time of the year Merry Christmas cheering cheering inside this stadium You can hear the wolf pack and it was being led by Quadier Copeland who just brought the entire building to its FEET with Perry one more time That one is off Good rebound by Dia Spin move Lost it Regained it No cheering Sam Smith Yeah I love I I I love the motor of DM Perry Theyre out there playing with guys that are normally on the practice squad and they just continue to battle and fight Theres a foul Well it becomes a message that is going to be received or not and your own personal pride I mean the mirror is the greatest identifier and you got to look at it Those guys going back on the end of that bench have to know They didnt pull their weight at all from the beginning of the game No no no no question So now Rabbi the question is whos going to be in the ear of those guys at the end of the bench that Chris Beard said Ive seen enough of you today When they go home are those voices going to blame him Chris Beard Are they going to have a real mantoman grownup conversation about that aint who how I raised you thats not who you are thats not how you play the game Like theres so many factors man that coaches deal with but whos going to be in the ear of players in Christmas is a huge thing Yeah Perry lays another one in and Travis Perry continues to add to his careerhigh with 21 I dont know how you blame beard when two guys have played the majority of minutes Like you cant on the floor No if if youre logical you cannot you cannot blame Beard if youre logical Holman and Perry whos on the ground and this may be one that the officials will take a look at It looked like Hollowman looked like may have extended his arms to get Travis Perry away from him It looks like right now theyre calling a common foul And Chris Bearden may say we should probably think about this being a flagrant one I didnt see excessive unnecessary should have been a flagrant one on Hollow That Thats how I saw it Yeah You agree I agree 100 Theres no more than 100 that I would agree with That Thats Thats it Its a ringing endorsement of your winning ringing endorsement And Chris Beard saw the play the same way I did They free up Perry with a ball fake Hes been outstanding Good hands by NC State to take that one away It hasnt been a a work of art in the second half for NC State They just had such a big lead at the break 4526 Theyve been outscored by three here But Will Wade certainly has to be encouraged by some of the fire his team showed And theyre going to get Luben there with a moving screen And thats the right call I mean Luben never got set Certainly his feet were way outside of his shoulders And anytime theres contact occurred thats an illegal screen But had the defender Eduardo Klauskey not made an effort to fight over the top of it never get the call Oh yeah that didnt look good Thankfully hes okay He will get fouled The the really the only knock and its not a knock but just the only thing that I would like to see more from Malik Dia in conference play Hes still only getting six rebounds a game and that was an emphasis in the offseason with Chris Beard with him Hes got to be a eight or nine guy right Because of lack of size cheering Well they have Dia and they figured too they were going to get some more rebounds from Cory Chess That didnt happen Dia does have 10 today bowl season rolls around tomorrow afternoon Uh the the very famous Idaho Potato Bowl the Blue Turf of course Albertson Stadium Boise Idaho Washington State Utah State 2 Eastern 1100 am Pacific on ESPN and the ESPN app It was more unique when it was the only blue turf but now you got basketball courts that are blue Everythings blue you know that NBA Cup stuff actually worked a game at Boise Its a college football sideline reporter way back in the day cheering Theyre going to count that bucket from Reed Finish that story Well the turf was blue and lips were blue And the high was probably 19 I remember NC State has not been perfect in this second half but they continue to have downhill determined drivers I like what will told us about Allan Breed He said You know what Hes hes hes not going to be the best player Hes not going to be the worst player on the floor He just I I know what Im getting out of Alan Breed Just a consistent guy Three years at Providence one at McNe State his six years of college basketball because of injury He was the first transfer to commit for Wade Well he was averaging 17 last year when he before he got hurt Yeah Dia Pretty shot from the baseline The numbers are adding up for Malik Dia and Travis Perry on whats going to be a losing end for Miss So Ravi the game is lost for Miss but the message has I think resonated because Chris Beard has gotten some good stuff out of Travis Perry He knows he can trust the heart of Malik Dia Let me look at Malik Dias jersey right now It is soaked through and the guys on the end watching theyre not a perspiration drop on them So Malik Dia you can see see the difference in the shades of blue I dont know if he shows up right right there Thats a guy that cares and plays hard man Didnt know what the score is or who his teammates are Hes still playing the game that the way that Chris Beard demands So maybe they maybe on the flight home theyll give his shirt its its own seat to say this is this is what we need here It should certainly a disappointing way for Miss to head into Christmas break way more questions than answers But he Chris Beer did get some things accomplished in the second half He sent a strong strong message to four or five of his main guys He got Travis Perry going as a shooter He can still trust Malik Dia Great shot fake Yeah it has worked all day too One thing about NC State theyve left their feet on a Travis Perry fake I would say this marry someone that loves a shot fake as much as you do and youre in for a good laugh Well someone that appreciates those kind of things So you and Tiff actually you and Tiffany watch games and say Honey how about did you see that shot all the time Well she normally brings it up to me She says Jimmy gosh yes Shes on shot fakes before I am laughter Well I go back to the rant by Will Wade after their last game and what do you say We got good kids good GPA Im all for that stuff but were not running a daycare And I need some dogs I need some guys that arent casual not cool Casual and cool get you beat at this level And hes hes trying to to get that stuff out of whoever hes trying to get it out of I think they took a really big step in the direction in this game Ravi miss has struggled We know that But both teams came in without a win from a power conference and NC States going to get one I think its so interesting that theyve gotten one point from Darien Williams the ACC preseason player of the year All Big 12 first team last year Theyve gotten one point Virginia North Carolina highlight tomorrow nights ACC network mens basketball double header The freshman phenoms that are leaving many countries lead these teams Tess Ditter leads the number 23 music whos against American at 6 Eastern And then Caleb Wilson of the 12th ranked Tarheel So its East Carolina at the Dean Smith Center Both available music on the ESPN app Thats the one thing you look at NC State and even Will Wayade told us We can shoot it We can move it Were just undized And you get one point right now from Williams and four rebounds If if he can find whatever hes missing then that that makes them even more formidable It is He comes in as a leading score But theres more in that tank out of Darien Williams that Will Wade has to have If NC States going to finish in the top three or four of the ACC Pop dribbled himself into a spin cycle and the layup no good but D will add to his total D has got 20 in the game I just have a ton of respect for Chris Beard and what he did in the second half Setting those dudes down and saying I Ive had enough of you They gave him a little bit of a window and he just they prove the same thing all over again So terrific job by Will Wade in terms of how they played but thats a thats a good coaching job by Chris Beard to just put his foot down and draw a line and say I I Im not budging Im going to be at Old Miss way longer than you five dudes are Right Well the valuable lesson here on all of it Jimmy is the idea that both coaches have done very well beard today and Wade even after a victory to undress his team publicly the way he did Chris Beers ready to have this game over Hes at half court and you can see in the top of our screen the cheering handshake Beer has a ton of respect for Wade applause We started the show with the two coaches and we will end the show with the two coaches applause Message sent by Beard message received at least in this one from NC State They win it 7662 They shoot 50 from the
