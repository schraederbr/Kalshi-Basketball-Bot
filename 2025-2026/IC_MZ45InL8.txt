here on the hilltop as SMU tries to move to 6 and0 Theyre 50 for the first time in five years matching up with Arkansas State from the Sunb Belt Ted Emmer David Padet our entire crew A state coming off a loss at St Marys in the Bay Area a couple of nights ago and Aate almost starting with a turnover here but Chandler Jackson their point guard the Florida State transfer recovered it and it goes in A state on the board first Same starting five as the last three games for the Mustangs The veterans returning and Boopy Miller and BJ Edwards from that team a year ago that finished tied for fourth in the first year in the ACC along with cement Yugatlu on the interior SMU turns it over on their first possession And as for a state entirely new team David 15 newcomers 10 transfers five freshman for Ryan Penon the former Alabama assistant Jackson is the leader at point guard the former semol Obviously very early here in this young basketball season but Ryan Penon has done a fantastic job with this roster getting them off to a good start to Chandler Jackson right away being very aggressive Both these teams are really going to look to get the ball off the glass on the defensive end get up the court quickly Don Pierre was the fourth leading scoreer in the country at Jacksonville State a year ago Missed the three and here comes a state So tough two games in three days on the road for Arkansas State The Red Wolves turn it over Here is Boopy Miller Preseason second team all ACC Edwards missed the three but an offensive rebound by Cory Washington And Washington left it short So a lid on the basket for SMU to start And that was going to be a concern for Ryan Penons team coming into this game Can they handle their own on the backboard And very lucky right there SMU unable to convert with a couple of offensive rebounds Ali Tumara is listed at 73 and he just gave Sam Yaglu the two small on that bucket And that was a tough finish It wasnt bad defense there Now get a little tangled up here top of the key Arkansas State coming out confidently getting that ball inside early David as a big man yourself you got to love Tukar at 73 and Yugatollo at 72 Here is SMUs first points PJ Edwards hits the three Well thats what has made SMU such a dangerous team this season The score guard lineup around Yigatola the spacing is so good When he rolls you got to help but youre leaving a shooter wide open in the corner The floater goes for Christian Harman coming off a 21point game in that loss to St Marys You see right away Arkansas State making a priority to get the ball in the lane and attack the basket Having some success here in the first couple of minutes and now Washington at the bottom of the pile and Timara just staring at him from above But the whistle did blow and its going to stay at this end Yeah And and David to your point if if you watched Alabama the last few years right the pace and space under Nate Oats Ryan Penon coordinated that offense He has brought that system to Jonesboro and Arkansas State Yeah theyre averaging over 80 points a game and theyve played a very difficult schedule This would be their fifth road game out of their first six games hung up at St Marys Its a very difficult place to play the other night out in California So getting tested early on in the season but hes hes going to have a very very good team by the time conference play rolls around You said it they love to get up and down And this is a team in SMU thats really going to look to push the pace with him Expect this game to be in the 80s and 90s if not more And what a unique resume for Camilone Coached overseas coached in the GLeague was under Willie Green as an assistant with the Pelicans in the NBA in the last three years at Alabama Washington right down the shoot to tie the score Yeah pretty good defense there by Arkansas State Just got a little bit lost there when the ball got inside but those are the best kinds of threes right there Inside to out basketball A three by Edwards and a three by Washington for SMU TJ Caldwell is back home The Dallas native so fired up for this game Under 10 to shoot for Arkansas State and Chandler Jackson turned it over One of the best times to shoot a three is off the kick out from getting the ball inside You see right here Arkansas State just clogging up the lane just slow to get out on Cory Washington knocking down the three SMU a very good threepoint shooting team as you see a little fullcourt pressure there for the first time from the Red Wolves shooting almost 40 as a team so far in the first five games of the season Just a very potent very dangerous offensive basketball team Heres Poopy Miller trying to three Its offline Overall you do love the spacing that SMU provides here in the early go This four guard lineup it almost happened by accident See a turnover here Pierre looking to get out on the break and Washington an acrobat in the open floor Counted on the foul Talking to Andy Enfield today thats what he wanted to see his team improve upon is their defense And right there turning defense into offense Just a good anticipation there by Pierre Jr getting out on the break Good find in the threeon two and Washington off to a quick start here offensively Youre a team like Arkansas State going on the road The one thing you cannot do is turn the ball over SMU will make you pay in a hurry And Washington caps off music the threepoint play The transfer from Witchah State He was second team allAmerican conference a year ago Really an X factor type player for SMU Harmon in a little bit of trouble Gave it up to Jackson Harman is the best threepoint shooter on the team and he cashes in Picking up right where he left off the other night His best game at St Marys and that time Poopy Miller went underneath the fade screen A guy like Harmon the numbers are a little misleading percentagewise He has been shooting the ball well Knocks down the open three He started the season two of 26 from downtown but he was four of nine against St Marys the other night Pierre Short and the rebound by Trudy Dearama the transfer from Sacramento State Oh Harmon threading the needle Somehow that pass got to Jackson Arkansas State turns it over anyway AND PIERRE SCOOPS IT IN WITH A FOUL AT the other end Mustangs getting off to a quick start here offensively Creating a couple easy steals getting out music on the break Don Pierre Jr Chance with a threepoint play when we come back SM coach Andy Enfield stressed at shootound earlier today Hey Arkansas State wants to push the pace We want to push it right back So far theyve done exactly that Well and Arkansas State has gotten good looks when theyve music taken care of the ball But they already have four early turnovers in this game and SMU has made them pay every single time See here just being active on defense getting their hands in there getting out on the break and they do as good of a job as any team in the country of getting from one end to the other turning those turnovers into points Geron Pierre Jr here with a chance at the old fashioned threepoint play Yeah So Pierre was the Conference USA player of the year last year at Jacksonville State now in his sixth year of college basketball He came off the bench David the first two games as Andy Enfield told us today he wasnt playing the right way in music practice leading up to the season he was taking bad shots He wasnt trying on defense And once he started to show that in the in the gym here off to the side he earned his minutes on the floor to start Well its amazing how the bench can be the ultimate motivator sometimes as SMU goes a little 221 full here back to a matchup 23 type zone But theres always a little bit of a transition when you transfer from a school like Jacksonville State a historically pretty good program You mentioned it Conference USA Player of the Year a year ago but now youre playing in the ACC You dont have free range to just come down and shoot the ball whenever you want because everybody else youre playing with is also very talented So a little bit of an adjustment period but give him give him credit He has really figured out his role and has played extremely well these last couple of games I mean its a resume thats not uncommon these days in college basketball That nomadic lifestyle from Southern Miss to Witchah State to Jacksonville State and now here an opportunity at SMU Edwards the former Tennessee Volunteer knocks down the midrange Jen Great move there by BJ Edwards Didnt force it trying to get all the way to the basket under control Came to a jump stop knocked down that nice little midrange jumper Jackson Ellingsworth is familiar with the Metroplex Played across town at UT Arlington last year Jackson missed the three The follow is good Ellingsworth got a piece of that and a stoppage Now Ellingsworth brings an edge to this team Ryan Penone talked about it earlier today Just something that every team needs He has just enough without going over the line Hell fight you inside Well you hate you know a lot of people use the old cliche he does all the dirty work but he he really does do whatever is asked of him He can step out and knock down threes He can facilitate scoring side See that time get to the offensive glass for the tip in Got to have guys like that on your team if you want to be successful I dont care how talented you are You need guys that sacrifice their role to do whats in the best interest of the team Miller being hounded by Matt Haymon Miller coming off backto back points assists double doubles against Butler and Arkansas Pineluff Washington with nine to shoot Mitchell Holmes the backup big off target Washington the offensive rebound Pierre lost the handle A scrum got it to Edwards Still plenty of time for SMU The shot clock didnt reset there So under 10 here Miller working against Haymon and a foul called That is just a killer possession right there You play very good defense initially give up an offensive rebound and end up fouling after playing about 45 seconds of defense Yeah its 14 fouls now on Arkansas State And by the way Christian Harmon has two of them and he is still on the floor for Arkansas State Hes got five of their nine points Arkansas State not a very deep team and when youre on the road against a team like SMU youre just going to have to trust your veteran players to kind of roll with it and hope you can avoid picking up that third foul You get tool back inside for SMU Miller the rare air ball Jackson lost the handle Another turnover Edwards the run out And again another turnover But give SMU credit They are being very active with their hands around the basketball early in this game Eight points off five Arkansas State turnovers And now the miss by Diamama Miller has not scored yet until now Right on Q Right on Q is exactly right Arkansas State knew coming into this game that their priority was trying to limit Miller as much as possible They just cannot keep him contained for too long And another turnover by the Red Bulls Edwards throws it up Oh a little miss time for Germaine ONeal Jr the son of the former Allstar ONeal can fly Could not finish it and Washington The defensive play in the corner on Harmon Itll stick with Arkansas State and SMU again just a little back tip with the deflection and the advanced pass SMU changing ends of the court quickly turning more turnovers into offense Mustangs firing on all to making the tournament a year ago in their first year in the ACC They were a surprised team last year Theyre expecting to contend in this league this year I was a little surprised to be honest that they were picked sixth in the preseason poll based on their fourth place finish a year ago in returning three key starters which we were joking about before the game is almost unheard of this day and age very talented team got one of the best point guards in the country but nonetheless a team thats going to be reckoned with all season long the shot clock Yiglu one of those returning starters doing work inside and I love that get the ball inside against the zone a lot of times teams settle for jump shots Thats against the zone SMU throwing the ball inside right there He could totally easy lay him TJ Caldwell the Dallas native on the attack It was a 175 run for SMU bridging across the timeout A state that really needs stops at this end now Washington got cut off The deflection by Dearama Miller saves it Seven to shoot Got the step on Haymon The kick ONeal knocks down the triple And what a pass there by Miller He could have very easily forced that with the shot clock running low A great vision to find ONeal wide open in the corner Millers got this quick little crossover there You see that left to right crossover Could have forced it but great vision to find Germaine ONeal Jr wide open in the corner very good threepoint shooter freshman getting in the scoring column early on but Miller thats the improvement that Andy Enfield was talking about just making the right basketball play Average 20 points a game and almost eight assists So defensively you got to pick your poison Are we trying to stop him from scoring or facilitating Calwell too strong on the three Yeah Enfield said it that hes bought into being a true point guard this season ONeal Oh trying to hammer it against Torama got blocked K State though could not save it SMU ball You got to love the aggressiveness here by the freshman Germaine ONeal Jr going strong Had a ways to go but he ran right into diarama Probably needed another step or two but I love the aggressive mindset though Would you expect anything else Hes wearing his dads number seven after all Man was his dad a good player We were talking about it earlier today Those Pacers teams were so much fun to watch His dad coached him in high school just across town in Irving at Dynamic Prep Made it to the Chipotle High School National Championship game back in the spring on ESPN Called well too strong and an offensive board for Arkansas State Diorama in the forest and a foul SMUs first foul of the game Yeah So Germaine ONeal senior coached Germaine ONeal Jr with Sun in high school ONeal senior an 18year NBA veteran sixtime allstar And the memories that they created at Dynamic Prep about 20 minutes west of here so special played on a big stage on ESPN back in April It was ONeal and ONeal with Dynamic Prep facing off with the Boozer Twins Cameron and Kaden at Columbus High School in Miami The Boozers won out and claimed the high school national title Well cheering and lets not forget about SMU with a great freshman recruiting class Obviously Germaine ONeal Jr a huge part of that but their highest rated freshman Jaden Tubs whos missed the first five games of the season with a wrist injury Theyre hoping to get him back soon The most talented freshman and talking to Andy Enfield today says when we get him back itll take him a little while to shake the rust off but he will provide an element to this team that they just dont have right now at 610 can do it all So a lot of young potential on this bank roster And now ONeal with the jumper By the way Trooms was on that dynamic prep team with the ONeals as well Yeah exactly Theres a reason they played for the high school national championship Another steal by SMU Heres Pierre swinging against Haymon I thought for a second there Gerard Pierre Jr was going to try to dunk that but an incredible finish and give him a lot of credit Has really done a great job on the defensive end of the first 10 minutes of this ball game Nice drive by Jaylen Hampton and the foul is called SMU has scored seven in a row to widen their lead See theyre just getting in on the active hands defensively creating the deflection getting out on the break and he wanted to try to put that one down but a great athletic finish Even some contact should have been a threepoint play but Geron Pierre Jr really doing a good job defensively allowing him to get out on the break and get some easy baskets Jaylen Hampton at the line for Arkansas State as Yikatu picked up his second personal So he takes a seat for SMU Hampton does a little bit of everything off the bench for Arkansas State Transfer from Missouri State right now Boopy Miller off the court for the Mustangs and this was going to be a little bit of a concern and right away its TJ Caldwell climbing to the top floor That is where where does the offense come from for SMU without Bookie last year when he got hurt BJ Edwards who has the ball right now kind of had to run the point guard hasnt done it hardly at all this year because of how well Booby Millers been playing But he cant play all 40 minutes of every game So be interesting to see how SMU reacts with him on the bench Pierre shot swatted by Tunara State going to try to make some hay here with Booby Miller getting a breather Royal Blue Smith feeding Hampton inside Holmes challenged it and SMU with the steel Edwards ahead to Pierre for two more Beat this horse to death but SMU just does such a great job when they know that theyve secured the ball defensively The rest of their wings get out and run Just making it too easy Almost like a pick six in football And another one coming right here Edwards the ultimate disruptor on defense This time he feeds Mitchell Holmes Its now 16 points off turnovers for the Mustangs Your point guard sitting on the bench and you arent too confident maybe running your offense Thats one way to do it Oh Edwards trying to come UP WITH ANOTHER ONE TIMEOUT CALLED Edwards is everywhere on defense He set an SMU record with steals Been one on fast breaks Now and Ryan Penon a states head coach says Listen nobody on this team theyre all newcomers Nobody has played this system that Alabama up and down pace and space threes and at the rim He expected growing pains as Pierre misses the three Jara clears it for Arkansas State But you want growing pains how about this here in Dallas Youre seeing it on the floor And thats definitely part of it but at the same time you just got to be stronger with the basketball too A lot of these are just getting a deflection and losing the ball Edwards in transition draws the foul And a state is without a key piece that was coming off the bench their first two games Joey Chama the transfer from San Diego his right foot in a boot He has a fracture in his leg They hope that Chama can come back right before conference play late December early January Yes small sample size just two games but he came in was averaging 19 those first two Yeah tough to go on the road when youre not fully assembled and fully healthy But give SMU a lot of credit too They are doing a lot to cause a lot of those turnovers But just even that last time just a missed shot that turned into a twoonone break on the other end Theyre just not even being forced to run half court offense right now Got to come up with something off the missed free throw Ellingsworth got closed out by BJ Davis Ray Harman hangs and banks it in A good finish there by Christian Harmon going in against Mitchell Holmes Able to finish off the glass Thats one way to get your defense set is to score a little bit to start They were turning it over almost every possession there for a 4minute stretch Edwards offline on the three Jacksons been quiet so far Hes had trouble with turnovers and got it stripped Itll stay with Arkansas State More ACC mens basketball coming your way music here on ACC Network uh this weekend Sunday and Monday First number five Duke big winner earlier tonight music back home against Howard at 400 pm Eastern on Sunday Then Monday night sixth ranked Louisville big win on music the road against Cincinnati earlier tonight they face off against Eastern Michigan 700 pm Eastern Monday night here on ACC Network How about Mike Hell Brown the freshman for Louisville of course anything Louisville David you are tuned into He looks like a superstar already Without question one of the best talents thats come through there in quite some time probably since Donovan Mitchell But how about the freshman talent across the country one of the deepest freshman classes I could remember in a long time Just so much talent across the board Even the ACC this year a lot of people said last year the ACC was quote unquote down a little bit only getting four teams into the NCAA tournament but this year I think the ACC is going to be very deep You see another heralded freshman Cameron Boozer music had a great night tonight for the Blue Devils But the freshman talent this year across the country has been a lot of fun to watch so far here in the first couple weeks of the season Ill tell you what at the McDonalds AllAmerican game again another event that you know all about David NBA scouts were raving about this particular class including Boozer Brown and even few of the players that SMU has pulled in including Jaden Tombs who has not seen the floor yet because of that wrist injury Pierre Short on the three Edwards chased it down trying to fit it into a tight window and its a steal by Arkansas State Harman playing with those two personals and off the hands of Jackson out of bounds You know it is one thing to deal with the pressure of SMU Its another thing to have an unforced error like that Well when it rains it pours And that thats just a byproduct of being sped up because of the way this game has gone with turning the ball over so much Now youre starting to think about it Youre trying to force it a little bit more and just lose focus for a split second I guess maybe if theres a silver lining in anything thats one of those dead ball turnovers I was talking about They can at least get back on defense this time But Arkansas State just completely out of sync on the offensive end You see Andy Enfield there Looks like he could have caught it Even he wanted to get out of the way just to make sure his team wasnt the last one to touch it Washington hits Hes had a nice first half for SMU He sure has Just again under control along that baseline there hitting that little midrange jump shot Caldwell the nice step into the lane for two Product of Faith Family Academy in Oak Cliff about 10 miles to the south of here Now Pierre thats good So Geron Pierre Jr has nine to lead the Mustangs The infield trying to switch it up there a little bit defensively Wanted to go zone Not sure his team hurt him so they stayed with the manto man but they are a team that will look to switch it up keep the offense off balance a little bit but it seems like no matter what theyre doing tonight defensively seems to be working Harman probing He throws it in with a foul Boy what perseverance there from Christian Harmon Just a little high ball screen and roll and SMU playing that drop coverage where Yatola is just dropping back until the guard can recover But the guards unable to get back in front Somebodys got to step up at some point But great finish there by Christian Harmon getting downhill to his right hand Arkansas States had success when theyve gotten a shot up As crazy as that sounds theyre shooting a good percentage but theyve just had so many possessions they dont even get an attempt up 13 turnovers for Arkansas State in this first half But theyre shooting 50 from the floor So when theyve gotten a look its been a good one and theyve been able to convert Shot themselves in the foot too many times Washington matched up against Jackson Ellingsworth Oh Edwards picking the pocket of Sila OUT TO BOOPY MILLER BINGO for Boopy Miller Thats a three And that is just so deflating if youre Ryan Penone in Arkansas State You got to stop You got a clean rebound Just careless with the basketball And then they knock down a three in the corner cheering Pass a little too tall for Ellingsworth but a foul called against Miller inside And a timeout here in Dallas Just a deflating play for the Red Wolves But give credit to BJ Edwards A heads up play Boopy Miller relocating to the corner Give that much time to two and white Hes music going to knock down that three Mustangs rolling here at home player I I really dont A lot of times you hear in sports Oh thats impossible Thats about as close to as impossible as youll get 16 steals in a division one college basketball game for one player Incredible stuff She is absurd For context SMU has a lot of steals tonight in the first half Theyve got 11 as a team Thats it Thats all compared to 16 for Halgo against Akan A 15point SMU lead Mustangs 50 on the year First time theyve started the season that way in five years Trying to make the NCA tournament for the first time since 2017 Hard to believe that but boy they sure believe they have a team that has a the makings of a tournament squad by the time we get to March And this is why Another steel Edwards feeding Yigatlu and he comes through again Its just too easy if youre Arkansas State You just cant sit and play directly behind Yigatu Hes too big too skilled And another turnover for the Red Wolves Just Mustangs running out the gate and TO THE BASKET PIERRE for two more And if youre Ryan Penone at halftime I mean what what do you say And almost another one What would you say if youre in that locker room coming up I mean look you got to give SMU credit They are doing a good job of being active defensively Dont get me wrong but at some point you just you have to value the basketball Its that plain simple I mean theres been too many times in this game where guys have just gotten the ball knocked out of their hands had it taken away from them Youre going to turn the ball over once in a while but its I mean its almost become mental at this point to where theyre starting to theyre starting to play to not turn the ball over instead of playing to do something good for their team And you just cant play that way Christian Harmon one of best players taking a seat here And TJ Caldwell converts inside Caldwell the old miss transfer And again we said it a few minutes ago when theyve gotten to the rim and gotten a shot off theyve been very successful over 50 this game just have not had enough opportunities based on not taking care of the basketball Again Edwards has been such a hound defensively doing work at the offensive end How about the footwork Acrobatic finish there for BJ Edwards and not a whole lot going wrong right now for this SMU team Heymon taking inside No chance trying to recover it Its out of bounds to SMU Beat it BJ Edwards doing a great job putting the ball on the floor Didnt have anything Didnt have anybody And just great footwork pivot and a little scoop shot Somehow able to get that high enough off the backboard and get it to drop And Andy Enfield has been on Edwards early this year Youve got to score more They lost so much from last years team Pierre draws the foul You think about Chuck Harris and Matt Cross and Cario Aquendo Edwards averaged 10 points a game last year Hes up to 14 here in the early going this season Yeah And hes a very efficient player Thats the thing I Im most impressed by watching this SMU team here through the first five five and a half games of the season now is the scoring is very balanced but theyre all very efficient Theyre all shooting good percentages They all have good assist turnover numbers Its not like theyve played a cupcake schedule I mean they had a great win against a good Butler team here last Saturday Played a very good Murray State team a couple of weeks ago So this SMU teams got to feel pretty good Again very early on in the season but they got to feel pretty good about their chances of making some noise this year in the ACC And Pierre was the hero last weekend against Butler Had the gamewinning layup with 37 seconds to go Hes got a dozen to lead all scorers Edwards has 10 Final two minutes of the half Step back by Caldwell Germaine ONeal Jr THE DISH TO YUGATU AND A thunderclap at the rim How about the pass from Germaine ONeal Jr Great little pocket bounce pass Big time vision there by the freshman and Heymon at the other end to cut it back to 20 Boy ONeal Jr checks a lot of boxes Hes going to contribute on defense as a ball mover early on and the shots are starting to fall for him as well Yiku on the block against Torama A mismatch Yeah thats just too easy Now thats the second time weve seen I get Holu just get the ball with a guy dead on his back If hes too big and too skilled youre going to have to do a better job of getting the ball out of his hands or double and send somebody after him Ellenorth had his head down Iu ends up with the rebound 50 seconds to play in the half Edwards feeding the big man cheering and Haymon lands on top of him Its a foul We see why Andy Enfield is so excited about this freshman class and why they were so highly ranked Germaine Oil ONeal Jr with the great little pocket music bounce pass You can able to catch and finish Germaine ONeal having a great first half here Knocking down to three Great vision there on the break when SMU is firing on all cylinders offensively Obviously weve talked about the the fast break abilities but even in the half court getting the ball inside they can shoot the ball from numerous positions on the perimeter Going to be a very tough team to stop defensively Got to pick your poison on what you give up Missing the front end here He does have eight 40 seconds to play Good look for Sila Got his own miss Shot clock resets to 20 Sila threw it up Another offensive board this time by Hampton Heymon downhill and he scoops it home A great effort there by the Wolves all around creating a couple of extra possessions there Some obviously going to hold here for the last possession Good chance here for Boopy Miller to get a little bit of a break here over these last couple of minutes And SMU has been just fine without him See if they can cash in at the end of the half Pierre off the mark The tip by Washington It counts They might check here in the first half tonight See if Arkansas State can find any juice Can they just hang on to the ball for a few possessions Thats a good start Chandler Jackson who was limited to two points in the first half gets the bucket to open things up here A good sign there coming out of the locker room just trying to get some movement going and maybe just calm the nerves a little bit We talked about it in the first half It does become mental at some point where you start to think in the back of your mind all right dont turn the ball over here And what do you do You turn it over naturally Loopy Miller lines it up and Jaylen Hampton with the rebound for Arkansas State Miller just five points for SMU in the first half coming off backtoback points assists double doubles averaging 20 a game on the young season Caldwell Dallas product back home A strong take and Arkansas State not shying away from attacking the rim which is what they did in the first few minutes of the ball game You see right away much improved in the first couple of possessions just being stronger with the basketball and just taking it to SMU defensively Nice swing Pierre in the corner Hes now 0 for five from deep But the offensive rebound by Edwards who had a big first half and Edwards continues Hes now got a dozen to go with seven assists and six steals Might be on triple double watch here in the second half Jackson ran into Tunara Tunara gave him some room after all Hampton on the drive Out to Jackson for three and Edwards on the move for SM whos got Washington ON THE WING AND WASHINGTON THROWS IT DOWN cheering You see there just the the floor balance from Arkansas State Shot goes up They didnt have one guy back above the top of the key Its just too easy And again another turnover leads to a fast break on the other end PIERRE in the It is really really impressive to watch in person how quickly SMU changes into the floor I mean they get the ball down in such a hurry and theyre so athletic and are able to finish that you just cant get back And here we go again Once again Boopy Miller on the steel Edwards had to gather Floats Washington in the lane Blocked by Tunara and a tie up It is SMU ball with the arrow Arkansas State first couple of possessions here of the half did a great job of attacking but these last few again just leading to easy baskets easy dunks out on the break Giron Pierre Jr not going to get much easier of a field goal attempt than that here tonight Just no defense in the game of basketball that can defend against a oneonone break like that after a turnover and an offensive foul on BJ Edwards And maybe a little bit of a hook there getting the bench fired up Coach is yelling at him to get back on defense We can celebrate laughter later Well you got to pose first I mean you did that at Louisville right Just sneak that in Then he can run back No posing after a duck was not in my strong suit as a basketball player Rick Patino was not on board with that You know what would have happened if somebody would have pose like that Yeah There already would have been somebody waiting at the score table to check in for you Fair getting in on the act at the rim Yigolu now six consecutive games in double figures to start the season Hes taken a jump this year so far Jackson trying to secure an offensive rebound Hampton comes away with it Harmon good look Haymon gives a state another 20 seconds Good effort there def on the offensive backboard for the Red Bulls And Harmon pays it off finally with the three Thats one way to give yourself extra opportunities to just get on the backboard which theyve done a good job of in this game Oh nice pass either to Pierre Couldnt finish but the foul called You know talking to Andy Enfield earlier today he says Obviously were a very good scoring team but were at our best when its the wealth is spread out because we need to have four or five guys every game at scoring in double figures We dont need two guys here or two three guys here carrying the scoring load for everybody They want it to be distributed evenly And this team can really really pass the basketball You see just how unselfish they are in just sharing the ball and making the right play The ball never sticks in one guys hands for more than a second or two Just a very impressive offensive showing And David to your point SMUs got four guys in double figures already here early in the second half including Geron Pierre And thats with Booby Miller their best player and leading score on the season having a somewhat of a quiet night by his standards But it just goes to show how dangerous this team is going to be all season They just have so many guys that can get in on the scoring column So you focus which Arkansas State did coming into this game at shootaround spent a lot of time talking about how they were going to defend Boopy Miller but when youve got this much talent around him its hard to focus on one guy Pierre splits the pair Hes got 15 to lead all scorers And Pierre takes a seat DJ Davis Ray the freshman taking his place Heres Davis Ray matched up against Matt Heymon Arman thought about it He does pull the trigger Left it short Long rebound to Caldwell No look to Haymon He cans the three Andy Infield not going to be real happy with these last couple of possessions Giving up too many offensive rebounds and Arkansas State making them pay hitting backtoback threes So lead back under 20 Miller the step back over Heyman rims out and a foul inside a timeout with Red Wolves turnovers last year in Enfields first year as the head coach The season high was 30 there 27 here early in the second half Youre going to win a lot of basketball games if you force that many points off turnovers But Arkansas State had a couple coming out of the locker room at halftime but done a little bit better job doing a good job of staying on the offensive glass which has enabled them to stay in this game despite those turnover numbers Came up with a stop against Igatolu They climbed out of a big hole last week against Missouri State They were down 16 and won a dramatic game Thatll help here Jackson Ellingsworth from downtown And its a 16point game now Well whats the great equalizer in the game of basketball The threepoint line And thats three straight possessions where theyve knocked down a three Washington brings it up at the other end And that wasnt even a fast break That was after a made basket Get the ball in Advance it up to the corner Going to get an offensive foul here Cory Washington after knocking down that three Taking the charge on the other end Big smile on his face And thats what he can bring for SMU Just doing a little bit of everything at both ends Just when Arkansas State looked like they were going to get a little bit momentum going Cory Washington knocks down that three Arkansas State going to go back to that zone here See if they can throw that rhythm off just a little bit SMU did a good job in the first half of getting the ball inside into the middle against the zone Dont want to settle for jump shots And there you go This time doing it with Mitchell Holmes in for Yigatu Now Edwards inside the threepoint line Hes got 14 to go with nine assists and a careerhigh time six steals Miller being active with those hands again Almost creating another steel Edwards the close out on Haymon but an offensive rebound Diorama and Washington picks it up for SMU Mustangs on the run again Miller the pull up three Give it to him Thats why they are just so dangerous as a basketball team Arkansas State knocked down a couple of threes Looks like they may be making a little bit of a run Next thing you know SNU goes on a mini run But the one thing Andy Enfield is not going to be happy about watching this game is Arkansas State dominating on the backboard especially on the offensive end But we see here another steal Great job by Cory Washington getting in the passing lane Luke Miller just recognizing defense backing up Im going to step in and knock it down Opening that lead back up And heres your update Points off turnovers SMU has already surpassed last seasons high in that department Now 32 points off turnovers in this game And you saw Miller with a state at the free throw line going to Andy Enfield There was a mindmeld developing between Enfield and Miller Their second year together here on the hilltop Miller misses the three This time Miller has truly embraced being a point guard this season A state throws it away again Edwards the crafty dribble Millers pass deflected stolen by Ellingsworth And Edwards takes it right back His seventh steel And Edwards draws the foul A career high Seven steals for BJ Edwards tonight Well BJ Edwards on track for a potential triple double here You mentioned it music seven steals and not very often do you hear about a a triple double and steals being one of the categories but that was just great awareness there after to the turnover by Miller just read the eyes of the passer anticipated really well incredible instincts on defense more ACC mens basketball coming your way Sunday and Monday on Sunday number five Duke back in action at Cameron against Howard chance to see Cam Boozer and the Blue Devils back on the floor that blew out Niagara earlier tonight here on ACC Network And Monday night 7 Eastern number six Louisville with Mike Hell Brown Jr another standout freshman matching up with Eastern Michigan It was a hardfought win for Louisville earlier tonight on the road 7464 Brown had 22 in that one Ryan Conwell the Xavier transfer had 25 Yeah its about as good of a back court as youre going to come across in college basketball between those two Theyre going to be a tough tough team all season long especially in the ACC Another offensive rebound here for the Red Bulls Make it 14 on the night for a state Nice look for Hampton thats in and out BUT CALDWELL SOARSES IN FOR THE PUT back and the foul Well that has been Arkansas States best offense tonight is the offensive backboard Just relentless pursuit All five guys going in Great kick out and a really good look But again you see just all five guys for SMU just kind of standing around not really making contact with anybody just kind of ball watching I would venture to guess that thats going to be addressed tomorrow in music the film session watching this game And that is always going to be an emphasis David for Ryan Penon for his team to crash the offensive glass He talked about it as a key tonight specifically against SMU But youre trying to give your team extra opportunities extra possessions running that Alabama system that he ran under Nate Oats the last three years Well and a lot of times when youre playing a team like SMU who loves to get out on the break what you do is you say All right lets not worry about going to the offensive backboard Lets just get back on defense send all five guys back Arkansas States not taking that approach and it had paid off to a certain extent with creating extra possessions to try to make up for the possessions where they turn the ball over Pierre drew the foul from Jaylen Hampton and like music Penon told us he knows that its going to take time 15 newcomers This is a brand new team As he says I didnt have a team when I was hired at Arkansas State He went on the road 20our days seven days a week He ate out with recruits for all three meals Said he gained a lot of weight in the process but bringing in 10 transfers by freshman and teaching them this pace and space system the three ball high percentage shots at the rim Its just going to take time knows how his team looks right now in November is going to be vastly different by the time we get to March We talked about it in the first half I mean this is their sixth game in the year and five of those six games have been on the road against good competition Thats only going to benefit them as we see Caldwell again getting to the rim showing the explosiveness but thats only going to benefit them once they get into Sunb Belt play kind of getting beat up a little bit early on will help kind of develop this team and grow as the season goes along Oh Miller the creative finish for SMU Lead back to 21 and Boopy Miller in double figures now with 10 Haymon way off on the three and out to SMU A timeout 20 Yeah a lot riding on that one And couple weeks ago I would have thought that would have been even a bigger game Louisville struggling here the last couple of weeks but SMUs had a great season See SMU just tearing that fullcourt pressure apart Ceette Yigatu now with a dozen A native of Istanbul Five Mustangs in double figures Theres Caldwell inside Hes had a nice second half now 17 points in the game for Arkansas State Miller going down low and weaving around Ellingsworth for the deuce Another terrific kind of scoop finish there that time by Boopy Miller Knows hes not the tallest guy on the court You got to get a little creative Well had the mismatch against the big missed the three and SMU on the move again Germaine ONeal Jr back on the floor The freshman pure Thats a two And you can see why they are so excited about his potential Just effortless right there on the midrange And a great finish on the other end by Royal Blue Smith Little bit of contact there but no call Yes his name is Royal Blue Smith A timeout here for Andy Enfield and SMU is ONeal might be shaken up here So ONeal Gimpy coming off the floor Well step aside Now it is an injury timeout We will stick here just for the moment but for Germaine ONeal Jr again the son of the former NBA Allstar is down behind the bench and didnt see what happened in real time but a great little pullup jump shot right there Very smooth very effortless Lets hope hes okay It was the following possession where it might have happened Under 10 to shoot Yiku couldnt convert And here comes Royal Blue Smith Blue is the name on the back of his jersey Herman flips it up with the foul Christian Arman might be shaken up after a great finish there the rebound So watch bottom of your screen here ONeal seven and white and clearly having trouble crossing the timeline David Yeah grabbing that left leg Couldnt quite tell what happened He was pretty quick to exit the game there Hope hes okay Well well step aside now Time out SMU up big Hopefully Germaine ONeal Jr is all right me as a big the gun user Yeah All all the time Like just working with you I I I have it under the table here By the way we saw ONeal there gave the thumbs up Im good Its a good sign for SMU Well yeah he wants to go back in because hes playing really well I would too laughter Seven points tonight Ball went in for him the other night against Arkansas Pinluff hit three threes had 15 points Hes starting to come on here in the early season figuring things out But again this SMU team really led by that veteran back court of Boopy Miller BJ Edwards to go with the transfers Pierre and Washington Six to shoot Pierre against the picker Ellings rising up for two and Sila has the board And the ball never got into the paint on that possession for SMU Kind of played catch around the perimeter and got to attack the interior there Get that defense to collapse a little bit Heres a three ball for Royal Blue Smith So his given name is Royal Smith David but blue is on the back of his jersey Thats a family nickname and he somehow convinced a state to put that on his jersey I love it Its amazing If you look at if you would look at just the stats from the first half with the turnovers that weve talked about numerous times obviously big story line in the game you would think this would be much more than a 17point deficit Give Arkansas State a ton of credit for hanging in there Portion of turnover of their own right here Robin Holmes the big man hit the dead Pierre Lofting and cleared by Tunara I mean the effort has still been there from a state but when you turn it over 23 times now this is what happens SMU has tied its program record with 19 steels on the night And Blue hits again from the outside applause This is going to be a little bit of an embellished statement but it has really either been a turnover or a good look And in the looks that theyve missed theyve gotten back because theyve done a good job on the offensive rebound Just a a strange game for the Red Wolves In and out from BJ Edwards Washington working inside and he draws the foul The record tying steal coming from Booby music Miller Booby Miller just doing a great job reading the passing lane How many times music tonight have we seen the Mustangs out on the break Green just could not say enough about how much of a mentor Green has been for him Said that Willie Green is the same guy every day And he says No matter how this game goes tonight I want to be that way In fact way he put it is when I grow up I want to be Willie Green Well when you coach in the NBA you have to be the same person every day because 82 games is a grind But Ryan Penon the the way this game has gone we were talking about it during the break If you look at just the stats 23 turnovers the other team has 19 steals You think youd be down 25 30 points but then you look at the backboard Arkansas State is out rebounding SMU 3721 They have 17 offensive rebounds So they even though theyve given possessions up great pass there great set coming out of timeout Even though theyve given possessions up by turning the ball over theyve created extra possessions by getting on the glass to kind of equal it out So give kudos to Ryan Penon and his staff for keeping this game a little bit closer than you probably would think based on looking at the stat sheet Yeah there are going to be positives that they can take away from this as they finally head back home Five of their first six here have been on the road again They were in the Bay Area Wednesday night against St Marys Fought hard lost by 13 to the Gales and trying to hang in there tonight but its just its all about the turnovers here at SMU Without question that is you can thats the one thing you point to on the stat sheet and say that is why this game is not closer than it has been But again give them credit for hanging in there There were a couple times where it looked like it could have gotten away from them and gotten ugly but they found a way to hang in there Theres no such thing as good losses I hate when people say that That was a good loss No theres no such thing as a good loss but there are lessons to be learned And this games a long way from over obviously But just again another turnover They just got to learn to take care of the basketball And if they do theyre going to be a very dangerous team in the Sun Belt this year Washington hangs and out of bounds Yeah So Washington misses the layup but that goes down officially as the school record 20th steel tonight for the Mustangs You dont see that very often And switching it up here a little bit Go a little two3 zone Trying to attack the interior with Ellingsworth against Yigato banging inside and ONeal comes away with it Edwards got the bump No whistle Tim Carara clears it for a State for SMU Germaine ONeal Jr back on the floor after getting that treatment behind the bench And another steal How about 21 on the night Edwards feeds ONeal I think hes just fine applause What an impressive finish for Germaine ONeal Arkansas State When Ryan Penone goes back and watches this theres going to be so much frustration Just got theres an old expression you try to pass inside of a phone booth and just theyre just not on the same page with a lot of these unforced turnovers Its going to be a very frustrating film to watch But SMUs defense has been pretty good for the most part Active with their hands Oh Edwards nice wrap around to Yatu for the flush Edwards with his 11th assist to go with 16 points Again watching out for that potential triple double because hes got seven steels as well And a timeout for Arkansas State Now Germaine ONeal Jr went off the floor to get some treatment Hes okay now Looks just fine to me Getting way above the rim for the easy finish music ONeal is 65 Of course dad was 611 but ONeal Jr showing that he can get to the rim himself just like that Well he hes been very impressive to me in this game has kind of done a a little bit of everything The block shot has knocked down a couple jump shots Hes gotten you see the athleticism there going to break getting out above the rim Had a terrific bounce pass in that first half on the break that led to a dunk music Just kind of doing it all No surprise Has a very good feel for how to play the game of basketball Of course dad didnt play college basketball Went straight to the NBA out of high school back in 1996 playing for his dad at Dynamic Prep here in the Dallas area Dad had great advice when ONeal Jr was going through the recruiting process He said Look at a coachs past players Do they get better Do they develop Hoopy Miller is fouled here in the back court by Jackson Ellingsworth And so they look at the resume of Andy Enfield Uh eight NBA draft picks music in his last seven years at USC Yeah that sounds like a good spot here at SMU Without question Andy Enfield has developed players everywhere hes been I mean I even go back to the Florida GF Coast days Remember that run in the NCAA tournament That was absolutely incredible But also too for Germaine ONeal Jr and Jaden Tombs you get a chance to stay here at home and play college basketball in front of your family So an incredible opportunity and give kudos to the SMU staff for keeping these kids here at home One and one for Miller Hell have one more Saturday morning 1000 am Eastern ACC Huddle is in Atlanta for the Pit Georgia Tech game Massive game there Theyll get you set for another full day of college football The 2hour pregame show that is tomorrow right here on ACC Network and also on the allnew ESPN app Again four teams with one loss in conference play Still a lot to be decided down the stretch here for the ACC football championship And SNU is in that group by the way And theyve got Louisville here tomorrow 1100 am Central noon Eastern on ESPN 2 So a 21point lead for music SMU David going to move to 6 and0 for the first time in 5 years Again chasing that first tournament birth since 2017 nine seasons ago Thats its really hard to fathom its been that long for SMU considering what the program has turned into They were knocking on the doorstep last year See another turnover here Just cannot seem to find any rhythm whatsoever music But I I will be shocked if this SMU team does not hear their name called come tournament Sunday or excuse me selection Sunday I know obviously its early Its not even Thanksgiving yet but laughter just based on the talent the experience Thats not a word we hear a lot in college basketball anymore Not only are these guys experienced but theyre experienced together They returned three starters that played a lot together last year You had this freshman class We talked about getting Jaden Tombs healthy And this team is going to be a force to be reckoned with throughout the remainder of the season No doubt And NSM fans certainly dont want to hear it but they remember late last year when Boopy Miller went down with the foot injury missed five games The team went two and three in that stretch And they wonder oh what if And this year the what if is when Jaden Tombs gets on the floor again still out with the wrist injury he suffered before the season Hes ramping up his activity and the team really hopes that he can be back by the end of next week when SMU starts a run of four straight games against SEC opponents that begins in Starkville next Friday night against Mississippi State Yeah the schedule obviously gets a lot tougher here as we get towards December which most teams do again had a great win last weekend against a very good Butler team Beat Murray State earlier this year but certainly the uh the level of competition will increase pretty significantly here Again that is a microcosm right there of how the night has gone for Arkansas State Just simply dropping the basketball without any contesting whatsoever from the defense Just a frustrating evening for the Red Wolves And Edwards splashes a three at the other end 19 for Edwards SMU running gunning all night Ellingsworth misses the three and another Mustang stampede Edwards to Boopy Miller Ellingsworth takes it after all Harmon trying to tip it in and out of bounds off SMU Timeout with 311 to go Well not a whole lot has gone wrong for the Mustangs here tonight BJ Edwards having music a terrific basketball game knocking down the three Mustangs on their way to the sixth victory of the season Now hes coming out of the huddle He is on the floor Edwards led the ACC in steals a year ago Two and a half per game A careerhigh eight tonight Hes trying to become the first Mustang to put up a triple double and a unique one at that Since Jimmy Wit Jr in November of 2018 but does he know how close he is Thats the question Somebody say something to him Thats what I want to know Here No Keeping it alive DJ Davis race swatted by diarama Got to think he knows somebody had to find a box score and slip it to somebody in that huddle No For what its worth SMU has set a program record with 24 steals tonight Offensive foul on Mitchell Holmes the red shirt freshman So 24 steals for a team Ridiculous number David we were curious during the timeout We looked up your outstanding career starting at Kansas of course then at Louisville twotime all Big East selection How many steals in your fouryear career You actually had more music than 24 You had 47 I definitely would have taken the under on that That surprises me But hey maybe the uh the stat guys were just being kind to me But were obviously a terrific defensive team but we played a lot of zone and I dont remember getting a lot of steals but Ill take it But Rick Patino he he stressed deflections right So you had to be a part of that I guess So I dont remember it but hey laughter stats are never wrong But lets go back to Hannah Halgo So she had 16 in a game by herself Yes NCA record Yes BJ BJ Edwards has eight right now So just halfway there I I still cant wrap my head around that Hannah hitting that gamewinner for Notre Dame against USC earlier tonight Caldwell at the line for one and one The Dallas native will have one more And Caldwell has actually tied his careerhigh 18 points to lead the Red Wolves here tonight to play for Chris Beard at Old Miss last year and a really big second half for Caldwell 11 of his 19 coming since the break But again the story tonight all about SMUs defense coming in They had scored 100 points two of the last three They ratcheted up the intensity of defense OH AND GERMAINE ONEAL JR is ratcheting things up himself Another big dunk by the freshman Diarama the finish in traffic with a foul So that play was very slow developing I saw it happening Great recognition by Edwards but when he threw it I thought there was no way Germaine ONeal Jr was going to be able to finish that He almost had to turn in midair His back was almost to the rim Just an incredible finish Id be surprised if we saw that on Sports Center later on Maybe not I mean just an unbelievable catch and finish A great find but the timing of it you see his body is almost going away from the rim He had to turn in midair Just a ridiculous alley finish by Germaine ONeal Jr You remember about midway through the second half he was limping off the floor and the trainer was attending to him That seems so long ago Then the son of the 18year NBA cheering vet Germaine ONeal Jr was in the ESPN 100 for this class of 2025 ranking 84th one of four ESPN 100 recruits that made their way to SMU the number 10 recruiting class overall to join the likes of BJ Edwards and Booby Miller And all Texas products too Yes And making a big point about keeping the local products home Obviously knocking it out of the park with this freshman class Holmes on the block Oh Neil soaring for another tip up try but its cleared by Royal Blue Were just going to drop the Smith at this point Its not even on his jersey And Dear Ram is fouled now And Andy Enfield you you said it David All of them Texas products Enfield has made that a point of emphasis This is such a basketball hotbed In addition of course Friday Night Lights football we all know about that here in the state of Texas But that has been a goal for Enfield cheering who built his teams at USC in a similar way Its not all about the portal Its about being selective there But your foundation comes with an outstanding freshman class and developing Well Andy Enfield has been obviously at USC for 11 years You got all of Los Angeles and all of Southern California to recruit from Now living in Dallas you got the entire state of Texas So certainly just from a number standpoint youre going to have plenty of options to choose from from a high school talent standpoint but mentioned it earlier their staff deserves a lot of credit for keeping these guys home You see BJ Davis Ray knocking down the nice little turnaround jump shot Also part of that recruiting class Hes from St Louis but spent part of his high school career here in the Dallas area Caldwell also from Dallas missed the three Offensive rebound by Harmon Thats really the one sticking point for SMU tonight Arkansas State giving up a ton of offensive rebounds but a State turning it over a ton as well Arkansas State out rebounding SMU 48 to 30 But again go on the road and turn the ball over 30 times where home road doesnt matter where youre playing You turn the ball over 30 times its going to be next to impossible to try to win Edwards rattles in the three Yeah hes got ice in his veins 22 for Edwards And one more turnover And one more run out for the Mustangs Its Edwards with the exclamation point The crowd now eyeing the 100 point mark on the scoreboard Looks like they might get it How about right here Edwards gives it up this TIME TO THE FRESHMAN DAVIS WAY helping SMU hit the century mark cheering applause For the third time in four games SMU notches 100 points And thanks to their defense music tonight Andy Enfield
