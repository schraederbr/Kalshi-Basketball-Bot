them developing consistency as the Eagles have had an up and down year Stanford has had their share of inconsistent battles as well but the Eagles control the tip as we are off and running at County for Payne looks for Jaden Hastings An athletic big for Kapky on the baseline but he stepped out of bounds Bowden Kapsky has been a nice addition for Earl Grant a transfer from Butler And John I I I think the biggest music thing for BC is to set the tone early and be aggressive They want to attack Stanford Get in the paint create opportunities that way Stanford starting five with a Cory Geler Agarall Young and Rozie Young and Rozie part of their front court for their secondyear coach Kyle Smith Stanford active on the offensive end McCory trying to shake Luca Taves McCory with a left hand shot but he drew contact And I think were going to be seeing that a lot tonight Cory getting to the free throw line Hes getting to the line almost nine or 10 times a game And you see right here just being aggressive attacking and he can do it with the right or left hand I tell you what Toes hes has his hands full tonight with the Cory Stanford offensively nine and one when scoring 80 or more points Thats their magic number as ORI hits one out of two Pretty good free throw shooting team On the other side BC is not Thats been a problem with the Eagles We look at their starting five Donald H They expected a lot out of him The reigning ACC comeback player of the year Good move inside by Jaden Hastings I mentioned it as athleticism If they can get hit more paint touches that should be good things to come Well they just have to be aggressive They have to look to get to the basket finish and play through contact And thats what Hastings did right there Foul on Rajosi of Stanford with Hastings trying to complete a threepoint play Our officials are AJ Desai Kip Kissinger and Jamal Spearman You see 65 free throws If you shot 65 during your Syracuse career that might be a few suicides after practice Exactly 85 or better Come on John Im not surprised Agarall uncontested dunk Breakdown on the defensive end We talk about it Cory know about him But who are the other guys for Stanford thats going to step up Agarwall is a guy who can shoot it from deep We like seeing him being aggressive getting to the basket finishing Hastings working on Rajosi Nice baseline move too strong And here comes Stanford Ryan Keeler with the basketball I talked to K Smith earlier today about him and he just loves him Calls him one of those glue guys a gym rat Hes always in the gym trying to improve Good move by Payne to the bucket Oh nifty dribble And for Boston College they want to try to get out in transition ahead of the defense and score that way rather than having to play against a set defense in the half court Great job by Payne pushing the pace Killer cheering and tip rebound by Hastings to Capki Ger up top on Pay whos improved his dribbling He can play the one and the two Luca Tay also a combo guard Hastings baseline Thats a shot he has to hit Have to finish it Great job getting into the lane by Taves Dropping it off Hastings upsetting himself with that one And an offensive foul Stanford doing a good job of moving the ball You see the kick out playing off the close out and Agarwal whos usually shooting it from deep finishing at the rim and paying a semitransition opportunity Great job finishing with the left hand at the rim Good energy by BC off the tip and Stanford I think everybody makes a music lot of the travel issues Its five and a half hours here Its five and a half hours there Its just something as Cosmouth said weve learned to deal with Yeah And I I dont think coach Smith wants to hear those excuses I mean thats just a part of it and how it is Theyre out here ready to play and compete Oden Capsky strong power move and he puts it up and in John really love what BC is doing early on trying to feed the post and set the tone being aggressive at the basket How about the substitution pattern early Oscar Hilty number 15 in black in the game Deep three by Giler and they keep it alive on the offensive glass trying to take Taves off the dribble and a foul on the Eagles Luca Taves whos a member of the Japanese national team And how about Tay whos just doing a great job of penetrating finding the open guy And Kapky if you dont get it once then were going to get it twice Just continuing to play through it on the wall So Stanford is off Cardinal shooting one for five from the field and Payne gets it stripped Here comes Ger with a three cheering Donald Hand into the front court John thats one thing that BC has to do They have to be able to take care of the basketball You see two turnovers the last two possessions Quick hands denying the ball Geler No look pass by hand and he got sloppy And thats really what hurt him at the end of the Miami game Donald on hand with the turnover towards the end of that game and they had a chance to win it a many games like that for BC and Ryan Giddy in sixth in division one Well I think he was ranked 300 or something coming out of high school his senior year So Stanford got a diamond in the rough and boy I tell you hes having one of the best freshman year in the country scoring the basketball making plays and he also does it on the defensive side as well Bowden Capy in the post They are getting their paint touches BC now with seven And thats something youre going to watch And I think thats what they need to do They need to be aggressive but they cant turn it over three times in the first five minutes of the game Eden Cam is in the ball game 52 in black Hes from Andover Mass about 40 minutes from here going towards New Hampshire Here comes Fred Payne in transition Pulls the double team Both teams cold much like the temperatures outside Is that just a product of maybe a later start as well Well I you know what I think for BC theyre doing a great job of playing fast and getting out ahead of the defense Again it it all boils down to can you take care of the basketball Foul on Stafford Lets take a look at Earl Grant in his fifth year for the Eagles 16 games under 500 But you know BCs record not clearly where they want to be But one thing about Earl Grant teams they play hard He practiced hard Hes passionate You talk to him media friendly No question about that And he gets it He knows you know its not easy But hes trying to establish a culture and I think hes done that in four years here Fred Payne for the baseline And thats maybe an overused term in all sports but it still means something doesnt it And I think the biggest thing is you you can never tell if theyre winning or losing He hes always going to be the same He hes positive with his players with the media I mean Coach Grant is a great guy How about Benny Geler giving Stanford a twopoint lead averaging 10 points 113 in his last four games Three is wide of the net An air ball Good pass and a layin for Dent Smith Transfer from division 2 Cal State Dominguez end of the shot clock guy He can get his buckets Division 2 allAmerican last year Stanford riding a seven to nothing run And how about Geler He he hes a guy who had an impact last year but even a more of an impact this year just being a leader and getting guys organized Great pass ahead to Den Smith who finishes Late in the shot clock Kapky cheering Okorei trying to fight with Aiden Shaw Missouri transfer for the Eagles Good hustle on both ends Talked about Geler Look at him just getting inside and Cam with the kick out And the former walkon he could really shoot the ball Hes hit a bunch of big shots this year and then pushing the pace getting ahead to Den Smith who knows what to do with it around the rim Hand on the baseline shot tied up Good defense Jump ball and its Stanford on the possession but active defense by the Cardinal and for BC John talking about Donald Han Hes a guy who really has to get going You talked about Fred Payne being the guy for most of the year You see right here great job by Camman just getting his hand on the ball and creating the tie But down on the hand he needs to look to be aggressive and not play hesitant against the Stanford defense and averaging 14 points Dad Smith and the rebound for Chase Forte a guy they had high hopes for coming out of University of South Dakota First team all Summit League last year one of the many welltraveled players in college basketball This is his fourth stop and a giveaway DC approaching four minutes with no field goals and thats been a problem for the Eagles Well that last possession was just bad spacing They had the mismatch inside with applause with Smith and he just wasnt able to create that space that he needed and you see Stanford coming down out of their side and converting Third point of the game for Okori approaching Todd Liys freshman Stanford scoring recorder cheering Yes sir 12 to nothing run for the Cardinal An energized Stanford group for Kyle Smith And a timeout Largest lead of the game He ran eighth in the ACC in threes per game He already has his season average of two So hes big part of what makes them successful Fred Payne to the rack Open pass for seizard And thats what BC needs to do Be aggressive getting into the paint Theyve done a good job of getting paint touches They just havent done a good job of finishing and taking care of the ball Pay the Eagles leading scorer for the season with 15 Hes off to a fourpoint night Dad Smith Stanford moving around the per perimeter They usually play four routes They call it a Floridaike offense Rebound for Chase Forte See BC went a little zone that last possession John trying to mix it up And working on Giler Nice job to the foul line And thats what you want to see aggressiveness and he and he could do that especially with Geler on him He has a size advantage Go ahead play with contact Get to your spot rise up and shoot over him That was a great job by Donald Aar Wall for Stanford down to D Smith Awal blocked by cheering Hastings He averages more than one block per rowdy Here comes Forte and cheering an offensive foul D Smith had position and Forte overzealous on the offensive end BC got what they wanted Defense turning into offense on the other end Dan Smith just does a great job hustling back Get in front of Forte and drawing the charge Thats six turnovers for the Eagles O Cory and contact to foul on Fred Payne Kyle Smith the Stanford coach Some pensive moments for him now But they clearly established an early win streak 21 wins last year Had a terrific year 17 wins at home A great hire He was terrific in Washington State Hes been great wherever hes been Won the CIT for Colombia 2015 Columbia is not an easy place to win in the Ivy League And one of those guys thats a program builder Well hes a guy who gets more out of his players Hastings on the baseline Eagles with some life with a six nothing run Good time up by Kyle Smith Be favored in a lot of those games So theyre still in contention for NCAA play also considered says our ESPN brackettologist Joe Lonardi Right now number 83 overall Our lost it but picked it up Keer thought about the three Now he takes it off balance and the roll And you know what BC is doing a good job of putting bodies around a Cory and what does Stanford have to do They have to have other guys stepping up and Geler is doing that in this first half Geler has 11 of their 18 cheering and fade away Tapy keeps it alive for the Eagles The Butler transfer throws the ball away Seven turnovers for BC Giler feeling it Not this time Despite that miss he has been all over the floor on both ends defensively and offensively just making an impact What would you do on the offensive end if you were BC More paint touches Well theyre doing a great job of getting there We talked about taking care of the basketball When they get to the paint they have to be able to make the right decisions and then finish at the rim cheering 10 late in the shot clock too strong Come on Ball loose hand on the floor Tied up Good hustle on both sides Another frustrating moment for BC on the offensive end Theyre doing a also theyre holding on to the ball They have one turnover Paid cheering continues to lead the Eagles Thats his sixth point of the night Well John its BC has been doing a good job of of getting some good looks and opportunities They just havent been able to knock him down Aiden Cayman Nice move applause And John I I think thats what Stanford has to look for more so get the ball into their big Z Hilt Tay and Camman Camman has been playing great as of late Careerhigh 19 points against Clemson But take some pressure off from Cory and get your bigs involved Another giveaway by BC Dad Smith to Giler Cam trying to show some athleticism but they throw the ball away cheering Take a look at that last Stanford possession and ball fake by Cammon and then to the hoop Well we just talked to him Hes had a career 19 career high 19 points for Clemson and hes been making an impact for this Stanford team Looking to be aggressive and good defense swarming defense Hilty got a hand on it Aore nice through cheering So good off the dribble And now an injury for the Eagles Donald Hand is down He is dealt with leg injuries in the past We will take a timeout Back to Chestnut Hill after this Get out applause looked like he was grimacing before the shot even went up on the double team and he tore his ACL Eric 2022 on that right knee Hopefully were just dealing with a uh incident here where he can come back quickly but unfortunate moment for him as hes five points shy of 1000 in his career Yeah its tough Were just wishing him the best and and hopefully its not a serious injury Caleb Steer replaces him Freshman from Dallas Misses the three Stanford Game of runs for them in the first half They have an 82 run on going And theres the nifty ball move Oh my By Oi That was a prolike move And I tell you what he just got in his dance a little bit Head fake And then how skilled do you have to be to have a left hand floater That was an unbelievable Did you ever do that I did have a left hand floater John Yes I did laughter You set yourself up for that That was an unbelievable finish by Cory Yes it was Kafky blocked Stanfords defense more tenacious here in the last three minutes Theyve been picking it up getting out in transition and tell you what AOR just needs one to go down and then hes feeling it One man wrecking crew He has 10 points Thats 21 out of 23 games for Ibuko Cory in double figures coming off a 40point game against Georgia Tech A Stanford freshman record Florida by Luca Taves Bill Grants been a huge Luca TA fan since hes come on campus and they feel like he can develop an offensive game Its been a bit slow thus far Well with hand out of the game he has to look to be aggressive getting to the basket making plays for himself and others Cory and it goes out of bounds Good defense by Tazuka Oy The last two buckets a mini five to nothing run for him What a move with a left hand floater How about this A little head fake And I dont think people really understand how skilled you have to be to have a lefthanded floater And then just pulling up in transition And hes starting to feel himself BC even better watch out Came for Dent Smith Fade away Hes got it Threepointer for Dent Smith cheering Five for 13 for Stanford from three John another guy Dent Smith who who Stanford they want to see him be aggressive looking to score the basketball 12 to nothing run as they built their largest lead of the game Taves cheering hes got the last four BC points And I like Taves He has to look to be aggressive We talked about hand being out He has to look to be a scorer When you do that things will open up Hell have opportunities to make plays Dad Smith uncontested on the baseline Slow close out by the Eagles Fred Payne Youre wondering what happened there Well there was no helpside defense He just walked in for a layup BC has to be careful before this thing gets away from him Payne nice shot from the elbow Its a great job by Payne right there Just continuing to be aggressive When you continue to be aggressive good things are going to happen But now they got to get stops here on the defensive side of the floor Pilty cheering and a travel Rare turnover by the Cardinal freshman Oscar Hil Hilty from Belgium But D Smith they bring him in from division 2 Cal State Dominguez and hes given them a nice lift especially from long range And the coaching staff they wanted to be more aggressive and hes capable of scoring the basketball and making plays And see on those last two possessions great job knocking it down from deep and then attacking the basket finishing with the right The division 2 Cal State Domingus team almost won the national championship last year They lost in the title game Payne from three too strong Good defense cheering but DC keeps it alive Thats good hustle by Chase Forte Taz what a pass Slipped it in the back door for Hastings And the power move And a great job by Hastings continue to play If he would have handled it right away it just been an easy finish but he continued to play when he finished at the rim And its a great job by Hastings Hes playing hard on both ends of the floor Hastings averaging six points six rebounds Red shirt softball from Orlando A wall applause and Hastings the rebound And they have to look to go and get out ahead of that defense and try to get easy looks Pass to the post for Kapki out of bounds and that will bring us to immediate timeout So an up and down advantage Ibuka Okorei music starting to feel it Hes in double figures and theyve just been a better allaround game BCs turnovers have hurt You cant have eight turnovers in the first half He only averaged 10 a game Theyre doing a good job attacking the paint and getting there They have to finish but eight turnovers is why theyre down 10 right music now And Stanfords done a great job of converting off of those turnovers Capki for three Its his first three of the night BC its funny Just when you think theyre losing steam they come back with a run of their own Its now seven to nothing for the Eagles Well they have that fighting spirit and it starts with their coach Coach Grant Theyre never going to give up Theyre known to be a scrappy defensive team I think they excel offensively when theyre able to push it and get ahead They have to figure out in the half court how they can get some movement and get some easy looks Ger thought about the three but instead we have an offensive foul on Hilty cheering And now a technical foul applause Technical foul on Oscar Hilty As we will take another look Yeah you dont you you didnt really see what happened I dont know what Hilt was complaining about but regardless just run back on the other end I guess it wasnt even on Hill Was it on Hastings cheering You think he called you back Yes it was on Hastings Strange play Yeah I mean you see him theyre just battling down there I mean thats its physical Thats whats going to happen Kane for three off the mark Find your shot Thank you Jay Alter You just called the thriller Syracuse 107 100 win over Cal in double overtime Good to have you with us John Mina Perrell alongside Eric Deondorf as BC drives and chase 14 converts and draws contact Stanford has carried the play throughout the first half but BC tough to shake the Eagles Stanford built a 14point lead in Forte drawing contact and making an athletic move And John this is where BC really excels at getting out in the open court and see Forte doing a great job of head down getting to the basket finishing at the rim and a chance for a threepoint play And the Eagles up to 45 from the floor Stanford shooting 46 That foul was on Benny Giler his first And Forte completes the threepoint play It is a 10 to one run for BC Well its really been the eight turnovers that BC had that got him in that deficit early in this first half but theyre doing a great job of just fighting on both ends of the floor and attacking the rim offensively Also big story Donald Han left a couple minutes ago with an apparent right leg injury BCs second leading scorer Cam and hes fouled in the post Hes relentless off the offensive glass one of those developing players for Kyle Smith You know one of those guys maybe not hotly recruited but hes had a Brewster as well and hes become a much better player Well a few guys on this team have really taken a step up We talked about Giler early on really playing well He took a step up this year and then Cam a guy who has gotten more responsibility with Akar being out for the season for Stanford and he stepped up and answered the call Yeah good point on Chisan Akara Akara played down the road at Harvard This is his second year of the Stanford program after he transferred and he was one of their best offensive players Hes out for the year with the leg injury So that was a big loss for them But Stanford trying to remain alive at least those under consideration for tournament play Forte Baseline move by Chase Forte showing a glimpse of why he was a first team all Summit League performer last year for South Dakota And John but that was all set up by Taves Good job attacking the paint getting two feet in there and then Forte cheering playing off the closeout finish And here he goes again getting out in transition Great job right there off the terrific distribution by Chase Forte 10 points for Payne the only Eagle in double figure And suddenly they are down by two points riding a 142 run And Forte doing a great job of just bringing energy for BC getting out in transition dropping it off to his partner Payne And he knows what to do with it Yeah Fred Paynes offense last two years BC has relied upon him to give them what could have been You dont want to live in that area but those are a lot of close losses to to deal with Well John uh and a lot of it comes down to just taking care of the ball You know we talked about last game against Miami Donald Han had a crucial turn turnover at the end of the game So if they can take care of the ball make good decisions with the ball theyll be much better for it Cam misses for Stafford with Capy grabbing the rebound Luca Taves in the front court for BC with one minute remaining in the half Fred Payne Taves fade away Nice touch screaming by Luca Taves BC ties it up How about Taves cheering Hes playing today in this first half Looking to be aggressive looking for a shot And he is definitely cheering stepping up and answering the call applause Dad Smith trying to stem the tide of a 162 BC run And John you know what Taz has done a really good job of of getting them organized in their half court sets Hes finding the advantage and then looking to attack off OF IT cheering Kappy 4 second differential shot clock eight clock baseline no Hilty to Jeremy Denn Smith down the lane tied up cheering and applause and a jump ball quick hands by the Eagles Aiden Shaw so BC trail by as many as 14 points and here they are tied up and theyre just fighting Theyre being aggressive We talked about theyre a defensiveminded team and theyre just continuing to fight despite the turnovers in this first half Still a tie game Four lead changes Stanfords last field goal was at the 516 mark BCs 162 differential since that point John right here its crucial for BC just to communicate on this out of bounds play and some inconclusive evidence about whose ball it is Oh tie up by Aiden Shaw Jump ball called AJ Deside Kip Kissinger on the far side trying to sort it out The arrow is wrong It is BC ball Theres not much he can do right here He just got to get in and throw one up Pain from midcourt would not have counted anyway But still BC impressive comeback Industrious on both ends of the floor Stanford did a good job early on of getting a head take against Payne Hammond foul line extended Hilty couldnt grab the loose ball Here comes BC It was a good job by BC keeping guys in front and forcing a tough shot right there by Stanford You liked what Luca Taz number 10 in white gave BC in the first half a bounce on the weak side block John really liked what TA did He he settled BC down in the half court He was able to take advantage get in the paint and then create opportunities for himself and others A wall to a Cororey Cory played at Brewster Academy in New Hampshire Great dribble He just nice through the defense like its I tell you what he is so fast with that ball That left to right crossover Euroep finishing same hand same foot This guy is a talent Amazing handle demonst laughter ball DC regains possession but paying gets blocked and then Aorei capitalizes Yeah how about A Cororey I mean just that left to right crossover and then being able to get in the lane and then maneuver his body and still finish at the rim exceptional Stanford did not score a field goal in the last five plus minutes of the first half Fade away by Tavs What a touch And hes been doing a great job of getting to that elbow area and then making a really good decision rising up and knocking it down He averages six points and DC takes it away TAZ with eight numbers Hastings has six Paid away by Payne And Giler grabs it for Stanford And those are the shots John that BC can do without early in the shot clock Minimize those right And just continue to be aggressive at the rim Dont take a tough fadeaway shot Nice move by Came That was nifty on the baseline against Hasty Stanford needs these other guys to be aggressive and take the pressure off a Cororey We know a Cororey could shoulder the load but to be consistent and get these wins Stanford has to have these other guys make an impact See Stanford going to a little bit of his own right here Taves screen by Bowden Cowky elbow and hes got another one Hes a double figures and hes channeling some offense Well how about the patience right there playing off the pick and roll keeping a Cory on his backside and then getting to his favorite spot right now on the floor that Elbra area Hes been able to knock down that jump shot all night Boy Cam slipped past his man Capy and it goes out of bounds DC ball How about Taves John Hes just been getting to his spots great patient keeping him on his hip getting to his spot and just rising up and knocking it down BC really needs him especially in this half court Theyve been struggling all season long in the half court set Hes doing a great job of settling him down and making plays Yeah hes helping compensate for the absence of Donald Absolutely Three by Capski and hes got it Bowden Capskys improved offensive player Didnt score much for Butler last year Just three points per game but for Earl Grants offense he averages 10 And hes a guy that can bring the big away from the rim Hes capable of knocking down that threepoint shot Good ball movement by BC Kapki And rebound for Stanford So Oill alum so Im Im biased I know you are laughter Just there might be a slight agenda Thats all right We wont hold it against you You go into that Oakill gym and you see the AllAmericans on that wall Unbelievable Are you on that wall I am laughter But Jason Smith has done a great job over at Brewster Academy Just the second lead of the game for BC They have an early six to five advantage Geler ball fake Hoisting the three and a loose ball scooped up by Chase Forte Well that was just bad spacing right there by Stanford on that offensive possession And good job of BC crowding a Cory when he has the ball Giler good court vision Jeremy Dent Smith No Geler active McCory kept alive Geler takes a three and makes the three Well when you give them three opportunities to make a shot in the half court theyre going to take advantage of one And BC turns it over Stanford comes down gets three opportunities knock down the open three Ger has four of their six threes Theyve missed 16 threepoint attempts Shooters six for 22 Luca Taves crosscourt Payne and the rebound We know thats not Fred Paynes strong suit He really could have attacked that close out and tried to get to the basket Rajosis been quiet up and under though on Bowden Captain Maybe a concentrated effort by Kyle Smith to get the ball inside more Yeah its a good idea Again take the pressure off of Aorei Theyre kind of been stagnant early on in this second half So get the ball down to your big See what he can do Good job by Roi just being aggressive and attacking the rim Finishing Aiden Shaw gave it up He ran into Aiden Cam and a turnover by a very rare turnover in transition And for those who missed it earlier Donald Han BCs second leading scorer went down with an apparent leg injury as he ran into a double team was grimacing as the shot went up And I mean tries to shake but he throws away Here comes O Cory to Dent Smith and he lays it in Turnovers turn in the offense Well the last three possessions two turnovers by BC And if youre a coach you hate to see when your player jumps in the air to pass the ball Play off two feet If you dont have it you can kick it back out and get a reset Seven to nothing Cardinal run Pay Four to shoot Baseline Nice pass to shot and he missed the slam and hes fouled And thats what you have to do if youre BC Just continue to attack the rim You have almost 30 pain points You just have to continue to do whats been working for you Payne doing a good job of getting in there drawing the defense and Aiden Shaw when you go up two hands on that thing finish it Could have had a threepoint opportunity but chance to snorts knock down two How many times did you hear that from Jim Bay Well I never uh I never was getting up that high so I was laying it up real fancy though Yes you were Heres next weeks Thursday night womens basketball double header on ACC Network and the ESPN app Number 21 North Carolina takes on Virginia Tech at 6 Eastern Then the Miami Hurricanes host Stanford and Coral Gables Terrific basketball action all season long on ACCN How about that Miami team I tell you what Coach Lucas has got those guys playing Big win versus North Carolina last night and they got NCAA tournament hopes for sure Theyve been a fun team to watch like many teams in the ACC Roi feeling more confident on the baseline AJ Roi And now John what this is doing for Stanford is the BC defense has to look at that a little bit more Now it might loosen guys up on the perimeter give him a chance to be able to play out some close out if Roosi kicks it out A three by Fred Hayne and Rajosi engulfs the board Roosi played for Kyle Smith at Washington State 2023 2024 Last year is a Claremont mud scripts Thats a division three school and a 397 GPA He was a finance major and hes got another one Well you just talked him up and hes got three straight buckets And you got to give coach Smith credit Hes finding these guys Talk about Dent Smith a D2 allAmerican Rajosie a D3 guy Out of bounds and we have a timeout So Stanford revitalized They are on a 92 run as they lead BC by six They would be in the ACC tournament as the 15 seed Well the ACC conference has come leaps and bounds from last year If you look at those standings its probably eight nine teams that are in the running for NCAA tournament bid cheering Joe Lennon has eight teams in the tournament ESPNs brackettologist Eight coming from the ACC But the Eagles in another cold stretch and you said theres a correlation with Luca Taves off the floor I I think Taves just did a great job in the half court of settling them down and and getting them good opportunities with him out the game cheering They have to be able to do this and then look to push the pace and get ahead of the defense Raosi whos been hot with three straight buckets gets the ball taken away by Caleb Steager as you see BC with no field goals in the last 6 and 12 minutes Kappy wheeling against Rahosi BC has to have some off the ball movement when Kappy gets the ball in the post thats the fifth three of the game for Benny Geler applause and cheering hes just a gamer like he just comes comes out and plays hard He doesnt complain When things go bad you cant even tell Kyle Smith had so many good things to say about him Instrumental in their success 142 run for the Cardinal And this bucket or Cory nice and easy in transition Well and if youre BC you have to be aware of Benny Geler on the wing and in transition shooting the ball And I think Kyle Smith does a great job of recruiting guys who just compete at a high high level Benny Geler is a guy who competes at a super high level every single game Two points shy of his careerh high He is at 18 points Kyle Smith has a analytical system They call it nerd ball in Palo Alto as Captain with the athletic hook but 55 statistical categories are charted by the Stanford staff Dont ask me to name them all Yeah I I I dont know Im not a huge guy in analytics I think you go out there and you compete at a high level and you see what happens But I theres a place for it I understand that I think sometimes music you know you get too much of it you you start to get guys overthinking Well its been a great system for him and all the stops hes won Colombia San Francisco Washington State now with Stanford He says you know what Im not going to be a big portal guy Ill use it when its necessary Its all about having guys to come in and building a program playing two three four years at Stanford Well its guys buying into what hes selling right Hes getting guys from D3 level D2 level and then theyre playing at this level and excelling Rahosi high percentage shot but he missed it He missed Young right there Young had to do a better job of sealing right there for that high low He had opportunity at the rim So Tay is back in the BC lineup initiates Aiden Shaw a Missouri transfer and a foul on the Cardinal Thats on Roi John I just I just think in the half court John too for BC theyre letting the ball stick too long If you dont have it let it go cut through and then and get some movement When you have good spacing when the ball moves youre going to be able to rotate that defense and move them and get better looks at the rim They go through stretches and its been pretty prevalent throughout the last couple years BC has gone through four five six We saw it moments ago They had a 7minute stretch without any fuel cheering That time different though to Aiden Shaw And thats what you do Play off of the close out Good job attacking the rim and then finding the open man And Aiden Shaw is one of the most athletic forwards in the ACC He can finish He is long and backed up Mark Mitchell at Missouri Gave Missouri some good minutes off their bench Just a great job of attacking right there and finding an open man and finishing at the rim Basketball can be a simple game You attack the closeouts you get into the paint now its about making the right decision That foul was on BCs Caleb Steager his first with Ibuka cheering Cororey at the line Great point about the ball sticking You see that all the time as Donald Han is back on the BC bench Hopefully hes okay Hes in civilian clothes but hopefully he will be back soon BC taking on Cal on Saturday Valentines Day A noon start on ACC Network cheering I already got my dinner res reservations for my wife so Im all good Im off the hook Let me guess Youre uh hitting uh theres a lot of spot hot spots where you live in Syracuse Well shes watching right now so I cant say Its Its a surprise Its a surprise laughter Who can three Youre such a romantic Look at Taves had 21 points earlier this year against FPVU Now he has 13 Hes made all six of his shots from the field And and when Taves is able to be aggressive and play like that he takes a lot of pressure off guys like Fred Payne Good drive by Cororey My goodness Excellent cheering pass out of the double team by D Smith And thats what makes him Okorei such a great offensive player because even when he doesnt have the ball in his hand hes cutting Hes getting to the basket and finding other ways to score off the ball Our tracks it down More nifty dribbling but hes hindered by Taves Den Smith deep three Is that the shot theyre looking for Well yeah Den Smith he he can make that Hes open Step into it I think Kyle Smith doesnt have a problem with that shot at all Steiger prolific high school scorer 18 points per game last year at Dallas Jesuit High And he drives and is fouled That brings us to a timeout but Luca Tav show comes to Chestnut Hill Be aggressive Luca Taves knocking it down And then how about a Cororey cutting off the ball finishing with the inside Fuego playing with pace balance and control getting to his spots taking what the defense gives him and knocking it down And for hockey fans and there are many BC hockey fans theyre coming off a bean pot win on Monday night DD Garden when they beat PU scoring six goals But hes the cousin of Jonathan Taz former Chicago Blackhawks star I know youre a Red Wings fan Im a Red Wings fan through and through with your Detroit Hockey Town City Thats hockey town right there groaning and screaming Well certainly a heck of a ride with with the Red Wings as a watches And here comes BC Both teams shooting 45 Stanfords made four more threes than the Eagles in Shaw Boden Kafky is tough in the post and he shows you why And he has the size advantage right there over Young Good job of getting low in that post position and then putting that shoulder in his chest finishing with that left hand Oh Cory Screen by Geler They play a twoman game Rare misfire of Betty Giler If youre BC thats what you want You You want Stanford out on the perimeter taking those shots rather than getting into the paint getting to the free throw line Caleb Steager you see with a three guard attack headlined by Taz at the point Eagles playing without the injured Donald H 4 seconds left on the shot clock and Taz had a pretty good look Great job maneuvering right there through the defense getting back to the middle of the floor and hes been hitting that shot all night That was a good shot by Taz but Stanford to their credit stemming the tide with standing the flurry of counter punches O Cory down the lane and the athletic roll MY GOODNESS OH Cororey hits the deck and its an end one Penetration is superb I mean he hes one music of the best of the country of just getting by getting to the lane and then so creative with both hands finishing at the rim This guys 62 about a buck 80 maybe a buck 85 but just controlling through the contact and man hes just having an unbelievable freshman year and I think hell be back again next year you know for Stanford and somebodys going to have to get that NIL bag going thats seven straight points for Ibuka Cory and Almost a steal on Taz instead of foul much to the chagrin of Stanford coach Kyle Smith Six college basketball games highlight Saturdays ESPN schedule that startorf lounging in the shadows of his palatial estate as Hastings throws a pass in the post Its5° out in Syracuse John this is springtime weather right here in Boston for me Yeah you got up to 40 in Chestnut Hill I had tshirts and I thought about bringing the shorts out but I didnt A heat wave Taves to Hastings DC hanging around but a giveaway and a foul Bad pass by Luca Taves Thats on Bowden Kapki And yeah that guy looks familiar Eric Dondorf Its a good looking guy right there Eight threepoint field goals Seventh in Syracuse history This is one of the most memorable games in college basketball history Six overtimes I dont know how you played 61 minutes I have no idea And all I can tell you is you must have had a nice massage after the game You know what Well we actually went OT the next day against West Virginia and got a win and then we lost in the championship versus Louisville But oh man I had so much fun playing at Syracuse and under coach Beahheim and we had such talented teams throughout my years there and as you see came knocked down the top of the three or top of the key three but we just had guys who really competed at a high level and really love to play the game That was the famous game at Madison Square Garden when you got up on the scorers table and it didnt count but I tell everyone that was the start of the magic right there It made for the rest of the game It was kind of the setup Tapky for three and he counters the came three So the big man getting into the threepoint parade Capki can extend the floor for BC with his threepoint shot Hes become a more versatile offensive player And that also ended an 8 to1 Cardinal run Laosi was hot earlier in the half Cory looks at the shot clock is down to under four And hes got a threepointer You know what I I was going to say something about how Stanford looks stagnant in the half court but when you have a guy like a Cory you just say Hey look go ahead get the ball and make something happen And 95 of the time thats what he does Hes also two points away from Todd Lickys freshman scoring record of 516 And the rebound put back by Jay Hastings applause And look John BC is not going to go away We saw how they continued to fight in the in that first half Theyre going to do the same thing these last 2 minutes and 45 seconds Eagles have been a team of close games in the four in the second half as the hook shot by Roi and Payne grabs the rebound and hes got a quiet second half but he hits that one and applause the Eagles cut it to five and that will bring us to a timeout but IO Cory starting to take over Candidate for freshman of the year And this is pretty And if youre a Cory just tell him to give me the ball and get out the way Im going to make it happen and knock it down For 29 of his teams points anytime youre compared to Hall of Famer I think hell take that Absolutely and he hes going to uh have his pick of the litter next year with this NIL era and hes going to be a 2 to3 million guy Well thats the last thing that Kyle Smith wants to hear He wants it on the far Well you know what We love Kyle Smith but you might have to get that bag up for him A three by Aiden Cam beating the shot clock applause cheering And that brings us to a foul against Stanford and also a timeout But check out Oh what might have been Eric Crunch time has been an issue Well theyve been doing a good job of being there throughout Now its just about finishing taking care of the basketball executing in the half court making good decisions And I think a big thing for this Boston College team when you get in these crunch time situation whos the goto guy Who are you giving the ball Is it Fred Payne Was it Donald Han So they have to be able to figure that out and then be able to go with it And an adjustment by the Eagles going fullcourt pressure applause And you questioned the foul before the break on Jeremy D Smith It was a poor foul and Kyle Smith was quite upset with the choice to foul Well it was a silly foul and then they make two free throws and not only did they make two free throws but it allows BC to set up in their fullcourt pressure Thats whats the key for Stanford here at Breakers Well they got to be able to get good spacing and then right now cheering travel that thats not going to do it Turnover Stafford and the last two possessions D Smith a bad foul right there and then a turnover right here on this out of bounds play and right on Q Coach Smith taking him out applause And you just got to know that can I move or not And obviously he didnt talk to the ref And thats a tough one right there Thats the 10th Cardinal turnover PC rebounding to Hastings This is coming down to the same way we did the last game last year John three by Payne Good look but it did not go Keer the rebound That was a a great opportunity right there to tie it up Great drive by Forte cheering Kane just couldnt knock it down Kane is nine at three Hes 0 for six Eagles as a team four for 15 Has remained Stanford ball Take another look Yeah it looks like its off Cam right there Jaden Hastings got his hand in there applause And two John if Im if Im Ger not giving it to Camman on the sideline right there in this situation You know who Im going to give it to Aorei Aorei go grab the ball Stanford Boston College to challenge that ruling So BC challenges BC comes back Game of runs Eagles on a six to nothing run over the last minute 40 seconds Pay to Taves Hes been good Fade away Way off Stanford did a good job of just cutting off his driving lane John you didnt have to settle right there on that possession If youre BC you want to still try to attack and get to the rim Capy to the BC bench Shaw back in Benny Giller inbounds Finds a Cory under a minute to play in regulation Gilered BC with six They check that Five fouls A wall And theres a foul on the Eagles Thats on Jaden Hastings He is fouled out to Capki out of the lineup for about 20 seconds Back in for Hastings Yeah Stanford just has to quit messing around and and give the ball to a Cororey And you want to live and die with that with with the ball in the hands of your best player Giler to inbound looking for a Cory to Berity becomes the Stanford alltime freshman scoring leader for one season trying to kill some clock Shot clock down to six Our doubled to Giler deep three He got it WHAT A SHOT BY BETTY Giller on a night of huge shots And down the lane goes Fred B You just see all the attention that a Cororey draws And then who else but Benny Geler hitting tough shots Hes been hitting tough shots all year long Incredible The old Devon Dorf ice in the veins Well you know what Unbelievable story for Benny Geler And you see right here all the attention is on A Cororey and Benny Giler says Ill take that Step into it and knock it down The confidence you have to have the ice in your veins Benny Geler a former walkon earns a scholarship and the impact that he is having on this team is unbelievable Unbelievable player Thats your storyline the fact that Geler has lit them up for six threes and 13 attempts and Geler and Okori have combined for 43 of their 69 points And we all know what A Cororey is going to do But Benny Giler 7 for 14 not only making shots but making big shots in clutch situations Once again Eagles in crunch time Looks like another struggle They only had two leads in this game though You got to credit them Theyve been fighting the whole game Just not enough Shot off the mark by Taves And Stanford knew coming into this game they needed this game They go to Wake Forest on Saturday Theyll head to Winston tomorrow This is a game they need to stay alive on the cusp of you know theres some conversation NIT theyre under consideration says our Joe Lonardi Theyre 83 overall right now in his rankings but its probably a stab in the dark right now but the fact that they have to play more consistent basketball this is a game they needed Well yeah and its always going to be tough on the road I dont care who youre playing on the road in the ACC its going to be a tough game and cheering they have a favorable schedule going going ahead and I think those four quad one victories are uh still keeping them in the run for the NCAA tournament hope So Stanford comes away with a 7064
