Well he hopes the show will be the right show for the folks in white and red as NC State wins the tip and scores 4 seconds into the game with Darien Williams off the tip won by Van Allen Luben And you see Copa picking up 94 ft going to continue to put pressure on both ends of the floor against the Orange who have JJ Stling initiating the offense A Syracuse team that has JJ Starling missile Rebound to Darian Williams The starting five for the Wolfpack led by Copeland who scoops to Paul McNeel Jr One of the great threepoint shooters in America Those two the guards with Trey Hollerman Williams and Luben That three is good for Williams Darien Williams the struggling senior as the first five Darian Williams the preseason ACC cheering player of the year hasnt quite lived up to the billing when it comes to his scoring However he has shown a clutch gene for the Wolfpack And off to a great start here this evening Starting five for Syracuse a team that struggled of late with that turnovers William Kyle gives it up and Copeland gives it right back to Nate Kings along with Nate George whos the Syracuse point guard JJ Starling and this is the guy Donnie Freeman who bangs in the first two A 19 and7 player in his 11 games for the Art Donnie Freeman is elite in the midrange Great shooting touch at 610 Injuries are the only thing that have held cheering him back from being a tremendous NBA prospect Barrett Williams will go at the sophomore Williams trying to use his physicality Got in a little too deep Knocked away by Kyle tipped out to Copeland attacking the lane and Copelan draws the games first foul and will shoot the games first free throws Roger Copeland came over from MC with Will Wade whos looking to lead NC State back to the NCAA tournament Theyve only made three of the last nine but after a bit of an up and down start a little more consistency late for NC State Well theyre extremely consistent on the road The Wolfpack 4 and 0 in ACC play away from home cheering but only one and two in this building So Willway looking to establish some consistency here at home Copeland goes two for two The 75 free throw shooter Once again picking up 94 ft just making sure that the Orange dont feel comfortable bringing cheering the basketball off the floor You mentioned earlier Syracuse has been prone to turn the basketball over has been one of the things thats plagued them throughout this season And Nate George has really had turnover issues Transfer from Georgia Tech who runs the team A lot of turnovers a lot of assists Starling deep shot clock Not a great shooter Off the rim from deep Trey Hollowman has the rebound Williams McNeel cant leave him open And Syracuse got away with an innout three And one thing Red Archer made very clear to his team you give McNeel no space anytime hes there You run him off the threepoint line Freeman breaks a three Syracuse one for four to start And here is Copelan Eyes up He had Williams in his sight for a moment Instead gives back to Haliban Copeland McNeel SAME SPOT FOULED AND A CHANCE FOR FOUR ALSO what Adrien Audrey made very clear to his team you cannot foul the jump shooters He understands that with McNeel hes going to raise up Hes also going to kick out the leg He kicks out the right leg but the contact was up top which means it was the right call for Paul McNeel Jr who is an elite shooter one of the best in the league McNeel at 42 from three cant complete the fourpoint play but a 102 jolt for NC State to start George with a difficult layup grabbed by Freeman who goes up and scores plus a foul Donnie Freeman the first four chance for the first five And similar to what the Orange have seen as of late Donnie Freeman has been pretty much the offense for Syracuse as of late Nate George attacking the basket unable to get it to go Donnie Freeman not looking for the basketball but going to get it Comes up with the offensive rebound and the put back cheering Freeman missed some time with a right foot injury that knocked him out for the final 19 last year averaging just a shade under 19 points more than seven rebounds a game He completes the threepoint play The foul by the way on Darien Williams Thats been a big issue for him this year Copeland on the attack Long steps through Copeland forces up the shot and knocks it out of bounds Well theres Adrien Audrey your three at Syracuse His Orange team started three and one Had a sevenpoint lead about two and a half to go at BC a couple of weeks ago but lost to the Eagles in overtime the start of a threegame losing streak And now the schedule gets really heated in the next couple of months for SU And when you think about Syracuse and their season theyre a few points away from this being a really great season thus far They had Houston when they were number one on the ropes end up losing that game in overtime as Daren Williams lines up another three and knocks it down right in front of the Syracuse bench Williams had seven on Saturday against Pit Hes got eight in about three and a half minutes cheering A driving Starling misses it off the back of the rim All down by Williams with a good seal of Kyle Williams again This is where Williams has the advantage against Freeman on the perimeter McNeel All three of his threes have come from that same spot And itll be Syracuse ball Another slow start for the Orange Another red hot beginning for NC State Williams with eight and the lead is eight You know among those things Wigs talked about it He said earlier in the week I basically kicked Quadir off the team last year McNees for 10 days before the season We had to work on some things get him a line in terms of academics get him aligned off the court But he said Pier has grown incredibly in terms of his maturity over the last couple of years really proud of the player the person he is now as Freeman sticks a three It just seemed like one of those moves Cory that the transfer portal can benefit Clad Copeland found a new home with Will Wade and now hes back in the ACC It really did And also Red Autry said the same thing He said hes matured so much over the last two seasons You can see it not only in his actions on the court but when you consider what hes doing off the court becoming more of a leader for this team he can see the maturity that Claudia Copeland has experienced over the last two seasons A reset off the Williams offensive rebound Freeman just hit a three Hes got all eight for Syracuse And Copelands now turned it over twice to go with three assists Back to defend Stling who has the first two for anybody other than Freeman from Syracuse and Copeland already with one foul couldnt afford to pick up a second with JJ Stling attacking the basket But when you think about Cardia Copeland as you get a chance to see JJ Stling who both these guys were in the same class both seniors JJ Stling and McDonalds allAmerican coming to Syracuse as Claudia Copelan was still there This is JD Stlings third year So these two guys were teammates three seasons ago Now a little barking at each other on the break JJ Stling not going to back down from anyone He understands how personal it is for Cuadrick Copeland And when youre playing against a guy as such it has to become personal for you too As part of Adrien Audreys first year as head coach remember came here under Jim Ban came to Syracuse Jerry McNamera whos now the Sienna head coach was a big part of his recruitment there And that plays a huge part Jerry McNamera was the lead recruiter of Guadir Cop and of course Jerry McNamera from Scranton Pennsylvania Guadier from Philly So thats kind of in his area but when you consider the fact that Jerry McNamera also left to go to Sienna as a head coach the same time So your guy who really was the influence behind you coming to a school was now leaving Thats often an opportunity for many guys to take off George out of a double team Freeman is in trouble George shot fake George three off the back of the rim and Kyle gets the rebound Copeland had fallen down the corner three for Stling is good and Syracuse draws within one And thats been a struggle for JJ Stalling in ACC play Hasnt shot the basketball very well from three Only 20 but knocks out a big one there to get Syracuse right back in the striking Freeman of the first eight starling the next five for SU Mus Matt Ael first substitutes for NC State Contested three by Williams is short and George flies down the floor with Kyle Williams knocks the ball away and its on the floor George cant get there Hollowin emerges But you see part of what the struggle has been for Syracuse Nate George Uhoh Copelan with a finish Nate George an elite point guard after two years at Georgia Tech coming to Syracuse He struggled with turnovers And you see what turnovers lead to on the other end When you cant balance the floor defensively it normally ends up in a highlight for the opposing team George on the step back leans into the freshman Ael and finishes whole mass of substitutes cheering at the table for the next whistle Able Copelan Strong drive by Ael who can finish well with his off hand and hell shoot a couple of free throws But that is the ability by Able to knock down the three You have to run him off of the threepoint line allowing him to use his size to go off the bounce Abel is a freshman that many people music are excited about his progress NBA scouts have interest in him believe he needs more time in college but this is a young man that could have a stellar career here at NC State especially as he becomes more involved in the rotation Early thought trouble meanwhile for JJ Stling who will sit with two 717 into the half Hell take a seat along with Kings and Kyle See a couple of freshman for Syracuse Sadique White Jr Kenneth Anthony and Tyler Betsy will check in as well The sophomore transfer So Donnie Freeman will play the five in this lineup Free throw is good for a 1815 NC State which has not trailed Theres a foul by Ael trying to get around Freeman his first and NC State second But a simple switch allows Ael to have to guard Donnie Freeman Freemans going to have an opportunity on the block against Ael Really anybody on the floor Donnie Freemans going to be able to have his way in the post area Freeman in traffic here Couldnt finish Terrence Arseno off the bench whos been playing much more and much better of late with the rebound Copeland NC States got McNeel back in the game Hes already put up three threes made one of them Slips it over to Abel In and out Arsenal on the offensive glass Heres Copeland Arsenal Throw it right into the hands of Ken Anthony NC States third turnover cheering George had to shake his way into the paint cheering Thats just an out of bounds Last touch by Sier was down by the Stansion NC States back up big will be lifted up Little back and forth action here NC State as Daren Williams has you know coming in as the preseason ACC player of the year There are great expectations when you have that honor and Williams shooting 326 from the field in ACC action Theres been a lot of conversation regarding his performance as applause NC State does a tremendous job Syracuse not recognizing the shot clock going down and the third turnover for the Orange in this game But Darien Williams is stepping up and picking taking on more of a leadership role with this group We talked with Will Wade about it earlier today And again Williams has made a number of comments throughout his tenure here that have had people raise their eyebrows but you cant fault his effort and his ability to go get a bucket when his team needs it most And a good find here as he sets up Musa Sag for the assist Barry Williams only seven points in 26 minutes at Pit He had foul trouble early So eight points Hes ahead of that number Hes got three rebounds and that assist A great start this evening And hes becoming the de facto backup point guard Now Guardia Copen on the sideline Williams takes over the ball handling ability So its not just about his scoring making plays for his teammates as well cheering Freeman all kinds of white jerseys in traffic McNeel was the interceptor And heres Williams out top to orchestrate Williams off a screen drives it into the freshman Anthony again Hands off to Sier who got fouled on the reach in by Tyler Betsy music The Wolfpack pressuring the basketball will get up Great look at the way that theyre getting after the basketball pressing the ball handler and then being able to get into passing lanes turning their defense into offense putting two bodies on the ball handler and covering all the passing lanes with three plays One of the things that Brandon Chambers NC State assistant said at shootound as Sier finishes was when Donnie Freeman gets it he said I want 10 eyes guarding the ball And they got Freeman to throw it right to McNeel Great team defense which leads to two But it starts with that ball pressure And you see the ball pressure out front against Kai Anthony cheering Arsenal And now the trap and this is one of the areas where the Wolfpack have been great at turning their opponents over They lead the ACC and turnover margin cheering Anthony three to shoot it ABLE STUFF OH BUT A FOUL IS called with 11 to go Matt Potter and a whistle that was hard to hear in there Will Wade loves the effort loves the intensity even though Able hits it with a foul Will Wade not concerned at all about the call he loves the effort from Ael As you look at it thats clearly a foul The the left arm hits Wade That was a different angle It may have been more ball than originally saw on that one It is the second foul on Abel Whos chatting about it now with Pat Driscoll Matt Potters talking to Will Wayne Theres a really nice jumbotron in here Fans got to make their voice heard and they are as Anthony breaks the first Our star studied ESPN NBAA Wednesday double header Donovan Mitchell Luca Donuch Victor Wimalam the stars of the Lakers Cavs Spurs and music Rockets go at it in a double header Plus the inside crew for NBA tip off Ernie Kenny Charles and Shaq start coverage at six And theyll be back after the games which is where it gets really fun Anthony one for two Its a sixpoint state lead Will Wade has to be pleased with the defensive effort by his team for the first 10 minutes of this game and they have been taking away any air space for the Orange to be able to be comfortable on the offensive end Williams lucky to get it back and then got fouled The freshman Sadique White the sixth Syracuse foul freshman class they really liked at Syracuse some ups and downs Anthony 93 per game White little under seven points four rebounds off the bench Great athlete Six true freshman on the Syracuse roster which is rare in todays game And this is a young Syracuse team Even considered Donnie Freeman missing 19 games last season missed nine games this season He could really be a freshman What a tough finish that is by Darien Williams into double digits and Williams playing with so much confidence on the offensive end And it starts with getting the layup off of the tip off the jump ball He gets a layup early And now offensively hes already found the rhythm Theres Freeman into Sier A finish and a foul Donnie Freeman with some strong basketball by the bucket trying to keep Syracuse in this game Hes got 10 already And the Orange are a music different team with Donnie Freeman on the floor They have an elite scorer they think can go to Donnie Freeman a 2024 McDonalds AllAmerican attacking the basket This was a top 10 recruit Youre talking about one of the better players in the country A season to go As you mentioned missing 19 games the final 19 games of the season Last year missing nine games this year Injuries have really been the only thing thats hampered Donnie Freeman but its also hampered the Orange as they get back into the zone which is so famous from your alma mater Inside to Luben and that zone didnt work out so well Copelan with a famous flourish as he fired a one hand pass through it Thats four assists for Copeland Well we watched Will Way work on the their zone offense in their shoot earlier today They were absolutely prepared Adrien Archie doesnt use the zone a lot but of course he played it in cheering his Syracuse uniform So he throws out every now and then enough for Will Wade to prepare for Anthony on the drive Nice finish by the freshman Ken Anthony Of course the son of Hall of Famer Carmelo Anthony First two buckets for the 66 kid out of Brooklyn And this is where Kai has gotten so much better Hes a much better finisher than he was even two seasons ago Melon would actually go to his school at Luhigh and work out with Kai to get his legs stronger and allow him to be able to finish when he was attacking the basket They had a nice game Saturday against Miami Scoring an ACC high 13 cheering gets rid of the ball here to Freeman Freeman around McNeel Theres a foul in there Neil got a lot of the body and well go to break at the end turnovers in ACC action and for someone that youre going to play through and have the basketball in his hands so much hes got to be better with the ball faced up Copeland brricked it there Betsy has an offensive rebound out top Anthony all alone cant convert from three and the rebound down to Arsenals not a great threepoint shooting team two for five to start though Kings Kings and Betsy their two best threepoint shooters havent attempted any Low pass there by Williams Luben fumbles Fourth NC State turnover The Kings and Betsy also havent got a tremendous amount of time in this game A lot of it having to do with the physicality in which this game is being played Adrien Ar going with some guys right now that he knows are going to fight Luben over the top Its the fifth assist of the half for Copelan And Van Lubens second bucket cheering Its a guy who shoots 67 Luben gets those kind of looks often Heres Betsy First three is deep NC State led two nothing and has led ever since then No lead changes no ties in this game Pack shooting 59 Copeland Its Williams with five to shoot A step back Threw a piece of the rim And Freeman has the sixth of Syracuses 10 rebounds cheering Hes got more than half the points more than half the rebounds for the Orange cheering Anthony nearly turned it over and its off of Luben Stays with Syracuse 15 to shoot Guardia Copeland continues to show his elite passing ability Really looking off Syracuses zone with his eyes Throws right over the top to Vin Allen Luben for the easy bucket Part of the reason why Vin Allen Lubin is the ACC leader in field goal percentage and one of the best in the country because hes getting easy looks based off of a number of great passes from Cuadia Coleman The official stats gave that assist to Williams which they obviously should rectify It will be the fifth assist for Copeland Has he played pretty under control for you so far I I think he has And again you know that he has you know the emotions going playing against Syracuse but Will Wayne made sure he didnt want to be too aggressive early there Hes aggressive on the ball Comes away with the strip and getting out in transition Freeman spiked it down to George Syracuse a chance to run and they dont take it Offensive rebound to Kyle and Copeland picks his pocket applause McNeel for three And Kyle is out of bounds with possession And the ball will stay with Satan Thats what you get when you buy the first row seats Make sure theres a lid on your drink You have Make sure you got a a lid on your drink And often times you could get a basketball player in your lap You got to have your head on the swivel sitting in those high price seats Maybe wear that giant puffy coat for protection if youre not sure Or a helmet A lot of fans travel to games with helmets Hollowan Oh dear Somewhere Karejabar is laughing Promo time 39th annual WWE Royal Rumble set for Saturday in Saudi

he to bring up FDO Jabar Scott Hook throw it to the sky Sometimes it goes over the backboard Thats the sky portion of skyhook Was a little slanted there Foul on the drive Ken Anthony off the bounce continuing to show his improvement Anthony scored 15 music or more in his first three games this season got off to a great start and then started the second two games as JJ Stling was out of action and really got off to a promising start scoring the basketball Got back into double figures in this last contest against Miami with 13 points and playing with tremendous confidence on the offensive end of the floor cheering Hes had an odd year at the free throw line for a guy who has such a good looking shot when you see him a shoot around You see him in war only 59 and cheering hes just one for three tonight Well if youre going to single out my nephew then talk about your alma moater in general as a team Theyre shooting 63 of course laughter Theyre shooting 60 you know 64 from the free throw line Dead last in the ACC One of the worst teams in NCAA basketball Those free throws have cost them wins Williams cant convert Luben is fouled from behind by White his second Is its easy to play this game but you can look at the Houston game which Syracuse lost in overtime The music Hopster game they lost by one at home If they hit 65 of their free throws in those games those are wins This is a 14 and 16 with a quad one win without a quad three loss and theyd be right in the NCAA tournament mix Instead right now theyre pretty far out of it Well right now a net ranking of 79 But if you just take those two games especially with the home win over Tennessee in the ACC SEC challenge you take that if you get the Houston win who was ranked number one at the time and you get the Hofster win at home now youre probably having Net in the 40 with just the swing from those two games alone And youre in the conversation regarding that at large bid cheering as an NCAA team Talking to Adrien Autry hes ru those opportunities They lost it at home to Clemson by three They lose in overtime to BC Those games have really not swung the Oranges way and free throw shooting has often been the culprit But he says they continue to fight Thats what he loves about his team They show up each and every night continuing to fight as Kings is able to knock down his first three of the evening Red shirt senior Oregon State transfer 35 from deep So in action again Williams finds the soft spot and thats too easy Youve got to have someone and one of the things that Red Al team about the scouting report their communication had to be next level especially if theyre playing the zone They their talk has to be cheering great You didnt hear much conversation from the Orange defensively on that possession Kyle kicks it Three men missed it out of bounds stays with the Orange Darian Williams once again continues to be effective in this first half finding that sweet spot Bring in Will Wade You have a different style of play which right now you consider the Wolfpack lead the ACC in threepoint shooting percentage This is a very good shooting team working on what they do defensively but theyve had a strong defensive showing here to start this game Kings out of it Timeout Brilliantly drawn up and executed for Syracuse And Kings has hit threes on a couple of recent possessions to draw the Orange within four And now the Orange going back to manto man defensively Played a number of possessions in the zone Copeland was able to be successful distributing the basketball Adrien Ory switching back man Williams leads the way with a dozen Starting five out there for State Hollerman along two is good applause Trey Hollerman back from injury starting to shake off some of the rust And again he was brought in really to be the point guard for the Wolfpack But Guardia Copeland has been so good handling the basketball and distributing that Will Wade has made the move to put the basketball in the hands of Cuadia Copeland primarily as the two share the back court William Kyles got his first bucket for the Orange Purchasing all the Windex in the greater Raleigh area with four offensive rebounds tonight Fourpoint game Copeland off the window Makes it six And hes got six And great body control by Copeland as he continues to have conversations cheering Freeman answers with a three 14 for Freeman in the first Sonny Freeman keeping the Orange in the game knocking down the three ball We talked about his midrange jumper is elite showing off his three ball here tonight as well Williams slaps it out to Hollerman Trey for three And thats where the Wolfpack really have had the advantage over the Orange in this game attacking the offensive glass coming up with offensive rebounds And its normally the best time to shoot the three ball as Hollands able to knock one down A deep one from Kings is off the mark on the backboard Betsy had it stripped off his knee Its NC State ball applause music Betsy getting in the mix comes up with the offensive rebound but give Darion Williams Claudia Copeland credit for sticking with it Copeland getting the hand in on the basketball knocking it off of Bexie in the direction of the Wolfpack Two steals for Copeland and he forces a turnover there as Williams turns it right back The fifth turnover for NC State Syracuse with seven in this first half cheering Heres George Ruben helped alter that shot Copeland with a minute 10 Good allaround first half for Copeland who senses an opportunity He gets fouled as Freeman swats the ball out of the air No goalending music on the play It will be a twoshot foul and a smart play by Donnie Freeman because that most likely would have been a threepoint play opportunity Guardia Copa got a great look attacking the basket The defensive breakdown by the Orange music You see no one going with the ball handler applause and Copeland getting to the free throw line knocks down the first I think a good no call for goender Yes Yes Good I mean again smart play by Donnie Freeman to come over and block that shot That was King second eight points a rebound six assists two turnovers two steals for Copelands first half but he has not looked to be caught up in the emotions of the game NC States play very controlled as Copeland nearly takes it away but Freeman flushes Donnie on the spot with a sweet 16 in the first half How long you been thinking of that one 00 seconds laughter every NC State starter has hit from the field tonight able has turned it right into the hands of Kings A shot clock terminated for Syracuse which will take a timeout to lose a timeout Adrien Archie wants to make sure his team holds on to the possession and gets the last shot of the half have led wire towire It was 10 to2 NC State threatening to blow this game open early Syracuse has hung in there the rest of the way They get a great look early in the shot clock Kings missed it So did Freeman Kyle rips away the offensive rebound and Kyle pushes it home The final seconds of the half Heres Hollowan in the lane and Hollowan couldnt get a putback attempt off his own miss So N Copeland the former orange guard first two years at Syracuse a year at McNiss and now back against his old program Though a lot of new faces since he left NC State starts the half on defense as Nate Kings misses a three and nobody went for the rebound except Hate George George just one for eight in the game His shot comes down to Ben Allen Luga Just a fourpoint game though NC State took a two nothing lead and never trailed Syracuse never tied it Wolfpack trying to win their fifth game in their last six tries But Syracuse weathered the storm after the Wolfpack got off to a fast start The Orange were able to fight back into this game And thats one of the things that Adrien Ary talked to us about He appreciates the way that his guys have continued to fight We talked about the near losses theyve had the onepoint gains the overtime losses etc But they have continued to fight regardless of the scenario and theyve done so here tonight as well Stling just stumbled into the Oranges music eighth turnover NC State with six rebounds so far Syracuse is plus three Both these teams were outrebounded dramatically in their last game Syracuse by 16 against Miami NC State by 21 at pit Wow Pit 26 offensive rebounds Its absurd that you actually won a game where you gave up 26 offensive rebounds William Pow with the another block there One of the best in the country And cheering Freeman gets the feed from George and finishes reversing his way to 18 points And Syracuse is within two Thats the gift of Nate George his ability to push the basketball play fast Often times hes found the wrong person finding those turnovers but when hes on hes one of the best in the game Sharing the rock Williams breaks a three and Syracuse can tie or take the lead for the first time Freeman wanted it on a switch against Holland Yeah hes got a mismatch in the bone Now they try to force it from Kyle and its a terrible pass into a double team There was also some tremendous physicality by Hollowman and Cuadia Copen over there really knocking Donnie Freeman off of his spot to make sure that he couldnt catch that basketball Copeland into Williams A dozen for Darien Spins around Starling hands it off for a cutting Copeland But thats one of the things that will way loves about Daren Williams He is unselfish He wants him to take more shots But Williams a cheering legitimate playmaker as well dropping off the nice D to C for cutting down the lane cheering NC State has assisted 10 of its 15 field goals George Kyle against Hollowman Immediate kick for Starland And a brick is out of the hands of Hollerman Last touch by Syracuse More often than not weve seen Cardier Copeland finding Darion Williams Well this time its the reverse order The nice cut by Copeland and Williams with great vision to find his teammate for the easy bucket Copelands into double figures Joining Williams there Now Williams little screen little twoman game AND A THREE FOR Darien set up by Q This is the Darien Williams that we were expecting to see this season who averaged 15 and a cheering half points per game at Texas Tech last season alongside JT Toppen cheering and applause and part of the reason why he was voted as ACCs preseason player of the year expecting to see similar numbers on his move to Ron cheering Stling skips it to George trying to get around Hollowman George cheering Stling again missed a three Hollerman got a little tug there with George And George is hit with his second foul Darren Williams doing it all in this game And it started off of the opening tip He got a layup and that just opened things up for him offensively knocking down his third threepoint field goal of the game after dropping off the nice Don to Copeland on the previous possession How do you deal with that twoman game defensively You Its very difficult to do and when theyre at their best is these two guys getting the job done Great job by JJ Stling The nice hands there turning his defense trying to turn it into offense Unable to get it to go at the rim Round two the other way Colin triple Not quite George in a frenzied sequence does not have numbers and will score anyway Who needs numbers It was oneonone He had full head of steam against Daren Williams Nice play by Nate George attacking the rim and able to go up the glass for a much needed orange bucket Copeland Williams again dial in from long range and his connection is good But its a defensive miscommunication You got to decide whether youre going to switch or youre going to hedge that and get back But the orange in between allowing Williams to come up with another three Darling has missed three threes in a half Now NC State has matched its largest lead Darien guarded by Betsy off the bench and a 92 mph fast ball to Will Wade for a state turnover Darien Williams taking advantage of his in front of the outsiders and the media of course are the outsiders He fought for his guy and he gained a lot of trust from Darion Williams by that press conference alone Williams has had one of his best nights at NC State tonight Folks heard that but certainly still worth playing That was from the end of last month early in the conference cheering against Wake Forest Starling drives and scores with a chance for three NC State it turned out was more than just Darien Williams putting up big bucket numbers and scoring They music have one even as his scoring numbers and shooting numbers have dropped off in conference play But what Will Wayade was doing in that press conference is educating the public Hes letting them know that you dont have to be a 20 point per game scorer to win plus 13 against Miss without making a bucket and youre a guy that affects winning Thats the most important thing If I can tell you right now if Darion Williams does not score a point but the Wolfpack win I believe the fan base is happy And again thats what matters most Its about what you do to help your team win games And Darion Williams is absolutely getting that done here this evening Play couldnt convert the finger roll Fivepoint lead for NC State Betsy with some good defense there Back in the game off the bench as George misses a three Luben secures the rebound Syracuse had a number of great opportunities Wide open looks from three and crucial spots where they unable to get him to go as Williams makes another nice find to Ben Alvin Luben for the dunk His third assist on the game He and Claia Copeland have shared the basketball extremely well Betsy no 13 assists 18 makes for NC State now Highest scoring Wolfpack team since 9091 And another stump for Luben Another assist for Williams And a timeout Adrien Autry as NC State takes its largest lead Both players moving forward Frogs are 19 and2 big contenders in the Big 12 Ninepoint lead for Syracuse for NC State here Syracuse 0 for six from three in the half cheering and an offensive foul Turns it back over applause Petris knew he invades Freeman So so Freeman has the ability to make a basketball play which he does at that point And the officials done a great job of reversing that call And again thats not a challenge Thats just an official review because of the elbow up high But as you see the replay Pat Driscoll is shielded as it becomes a huge possession JJ Stling knocking down the three Pat Driscoll cheering was shielded from that action He was behind Donnie Freeman which did not allow him to see it But it was a great job by the subiating crew getting together and going over to look if it was a cylinder foul Stling has had a tough shooting night Gets the first three and a half for the Orange This will be a Syracuse foul Sadique White Sadique White back playing in the home state out of Charlotte North Carolina Foul against the freshman White and trying to get into the gap As his coach talked about earlier getting tangled up But one thing youre never going to have to question about Sadi White is the effort He enjoys doing the job defensively We saw a huge block from him in the first half of this game and one of the reasons why Adrien Autry trusts him as he slides his feet doing a great job there but picks up the foul which will be his fourth So thats two fouls in 5 seconds against White Sadique White trying to beat Guardier Copeland to the spot But you see that left arm hooking Copeland picking up that fourth foul on the evening And hell stay in the game Well Syracuse going to his own zone defensively So keep him out of foul trouble with this but he is a reserve Who is a reserve who has played big minutes for the Orange this year Threepointer Arsenal Luben with a put back He is five for five The biggest problem when you play zone is finding box out responsibilities and the Orange who have struggled to rebound throughout this season have a hard time keeping Ben Alen off the offensive glass Starling trying to do it all Hes got 13 lead is back down to six and just been hovering these orange Copeland has it taken away A Freeman fast break and Freeman lays it in But give Cardier Copeland a lot of credit for the job done defensively on forgive me Sadique White the credit for the job done on Cuadia Copeland on that possession Its his aggressiveness and his effort that helps force that turnover Oakland trying to make up for it and he will with a threepoint opportunity applause He lakes the front of this jersey at Syracuse But these are the ups and downs that freshman go through for Red Archery Hes got a roster full of young players who dont have the experience right now Still trying to find a way to get a win on the road White 10 minutes tonight No points no shots no rebounds one assist and fouls out for the second time in three games Syracuse down seven Its been all Freeman and Starling offensively And Freeman misses badly Rebound to Arsenal Williams Luben and Copeland have all 17 state points in the second half And Cuadier has a chance for a couple more Copeland has now drawn five fouls in the game and Syracuse now committed five fouls in the half Well we know that this game meant more to Cuadia Copeland The opportunity to be able to play not in front of his only his not only his fan base but also his dad Andron Copelan here to check out his son against his former team Dad super proud had an opportunity to talk to him before the game and dad was feeling the same juice as his son was as he went over to hug and daff up the family And again continues applause and cheering to get the crowd here at the Lobo Center involved Ninepoint lead as Copeland hits the free throws and Starling gets the bounce on the other end Another and one in this game This one goes the way of Syracuses JJ Stling And JJ Stling doing what Donnie Freeman did in the first half for the Orange Really putting the offense on his own shoulders attacking the basket Stling missed the majority of the first half with two fouls But he has been aggressive since hes come back in in the second half of this game cheering and continues to be effective attacking the rim 15 for Stling cant complete it Syracuse 5 for8 at the line Heres the freshman Matt Abel Copeland out of the game Williams will facilitate into the freshman Anthony Williams pass off the hands of Sier And Williams turns it over for the fourth time And that p play was not built for Sier That was actually to Arsenal in the corner He had a shooter Sier getting a hand on it Really deflected it Most likely could have been another assist for Darion Williams His teammate forced the turnover Starling hard drive batted out to Abel NC State has now turned it around a little Theyre plus three on the glass This is a team that has struggled to rebound the basketball throughout this season but Syracuse has struggled even more Able on A SLIP FOR SIER cheering and applause ITS CONTAGIOUS for the Wolfpack Theyre all sharing the basketball And this is what Will Wade preaches The ball moves faster on the pass than it does on the bounce And hes got a number of guys that can make plays The freshman able with a nice assist on the last possession Anthony going oneonone Anthony cheering cant convert NC State looking for its first double digit lead and theyve got it with Arsenal set up by Williams again applause and cheering A Syracuse timeout this season Fourth in the ACC nearly 80 a game in conference play Maybe a little early to go into the nickname stage Well let me give you a little history on that Do you know who was the ACC player of the year that season cheering Cory Alexander No I was in high school I have no other guesses Anthony misses a three Offensive rebound Kings Freeman is there for the tip Nice job on Donnie Freeman going up and above It would have been one You just said fire and ice It would be the ice Rodney Monroe was the ACCs player of the year Uhoh Williams turned it over He is down as Anthony scores it Williams comes up grimacing and thats a heavy grimace as Darien Williams stays in the play but NC State may take a timeout here or not but with all the momentum NC States lead is only seven after the turnover Kai Anthony going down laying it up This game is far from over as the Orange continue to fight Arsenal forced it and Sier was there to clean up the spill Sier has given the Wolfpack great minutes off the bench in this game Eight points for him and continues to be a force on the offensive glass Its a new season high for the true freshman averaging just 28 Freeman able mist timed his jump Williams trying to rush the ball away from Kings and the call will be a tie up arrow to NC State It looks like Darien Williams is okay No hes moving a little slowly actually He is going to now check out of this game Daren Williams once again trying to attack but you see that right ankle stepping on the foot of Donnie Freeman music which leads to the turnover Kai Anthony able to go down and get the layup Guardier Copeland checks back in for Darion Williams as the Orange go back to that zone defensively Copeland in the middle Copeland able Offensive rebound Arsenal McNeel Mcno Sons got it Copeland passes up a three Finds Ael after running into a brick wall Able to a cutting Sier Hes into double figures for the first time as a collegiate But three opportunities on that offensive possession cheering The Wolfpack dont have much choice other than to score as Arsenal and Sier continue to attack the offensive glass Startling the seiz for JJ whos got 17 Thats three off of a season high Adrien Arrey trying to encourage his guys to come up with a stop defensively finished the play by getting a defensive rebound Williams ready to check right back in Sier denied by Kyle one of the nations leading shot blockers And then Sier is deemed to have touched it I believe this will be challenged by Will Wade having great hands and attacking the offensive glass which has truly helped his team here as hes into double figures now and comes up with his third offensive rebound You were saying hes had so much of impact in this second half I thought he had way more than two offensive rebounds but he picks up another on the first possession of this break Copelan off the window wouldnt go and this one squeezed by Freeman Musa freshman from the Gambia with a season and careerhigh 10 points NC State cheering with 14 bench points Syracuse only six Wolfpacks depth has been stronger tonight with a ninepoint lead closing in on six to play Syracuse has never led The last tie was 0 Starling Very tough shot for Starling And Ael is out of the cray with Copeland leading the pack Able in the corner will drive it and score it MATT A Matt Ael showing that hes more than a shooter Ael trying to do the job defensively Guardia Copeland wanted him to celebrate with him He wanted to see Matt Ael flex a little bit He held the flex for about 7 seconds Freeman on an attack Freeman is fouled Largest lead again at 11 for NC State Adrien Archery warned his team about leaving that corner when Cuadrick Copeland has the basketball this time Although Matt Ael doesnt shoot it it gives him room to attack off the bounce and finish with the left hand You mentioned his pro potential Our latest ESPN box trap a couple of weeks ago has Matt Able as an early second rounder Well see if he wants to declare true freshman cheering And again this is a scenario where you would love to see Matt Ael stick around another year stay in Raleigh come back be a guy thats an all ACC performer playing 30 minutes a game in comparison to going and being a second round pick and having to fight his way to have a job cheering Second free throw for cheering Freeman is good NC States got four starting seniors so theyre going to have a wealth of opportunity available next year And remember Paul McMill Jr a sophomore as well so you could possibly have those two guys back in your back court Williams strong drive for Darien and a 20point game for the Sacramento board senior I think Dariens ankle is okay After a brief rest comes back looking healthy attacking the basket Thats turned over by George His second turnover in the tenth against the Orange Adrien Audrey having to watch the turnovers We talked to him in shoot around earlier today and I asked him is it difficult for you as a point guard who took great care of the basketball for your four years at Syracuse to watch the turnover And its its excruciating for a guy that was such a great point guard able Woo That was if not on the way down at the absolute apex by Kyle That is a great block That was not on the way down That was an elite effort by William Powell one of the nations top shot blockers going to get it Copeland gets back to the line at the other side after William Kyle evviscerated this basketball Catches it at the apex as youre talking about goes to get that That is way above the square William Kyle flexing his shot blocking ability Tied for second The Orange are in blocks per game William Kyle leads the ACC at close to 28 a game And Kyle going to get his third block And that is legit That is taking the elevator to the top floor my friend Those are some freaky hops Kyle got the block but a couple of possessions later Copeland hit the free throws Copelands nine for nine from the line Now hes knocking on the door at 20 points And this is the largest lead for NC State Kyle slippery and theres a foul in there Theyre going to get Sier Joe Lindsay called it Syracuse not quite in the bonus Sons third Thats the fifth foul against NC State Pal trying to attack off the b off the bounce Sier reaching in the contact draws the foul But how about the rest that Ben Allen Luben is getting because of the production of Musa Sier in this second half Hes just got another foul on the inbound Luben whos perfect from the field hasnt played since the 1135 mark music Ben Alan Luben played more minutes than anyone at the Maui Invitational Will Wade made it very clear he did not want him having to play that many minutes Sier giving them great minutes I tell you what William Kyle this is the first time Ive seen him live He is truly showing off his athleticism here attacking the basket This would be another highlight if not for grabbing his right arm Why Copen doesnt want to be on the wrong side of that finish and he even was excited about that attempt by William Cobb cheering Two quick fouls Kyle to the line where his shot puts it in 49 free throw shooter Copeland even Copeland even excited about the cheering attack by William Kyle and I would say that that is a very different looking free throw approach I mentioned its the first time Ive seen William Kyle live which means its the first time Ive seen that free throw He and Carson Town of Notre Dame are in a high stakes death match for Strangest free throw IN THE LEAGUE COPELAND LOOK OUT BILLOW cheering Hes been waiting all evening for a moment of ferocity like that Hes been waiting cheering months for a game like this And not his performance but to play against the Orange And his performance has been spectacular Will Wayne Wade told us pregame its going to be spectacular one way or the other it could be a spect of wonderful championship coaches and of course between K and Jim Valvano know just as much for what theyve done off the court cancer research as on it NC State with a 14point lead at home right here but Copa 19 and N looking for a double double and that would have been his 10th assist but Williams missed a three season high for quite Copeland 10 assists whereas Boston College looking to go double double again cheering as he is the leader in total assist for ACC play Kings is foul to be a one and one for Syracuse and Williams 39 points 14 assists combined tonight Syracuse led by Freeman music and Starling The 41 of the 62 supporting cast has been better for NC State music Foul was on Copeland his second music One for Kings Not close Another tough shooting night at the line for Syracuse Eight for 14 NC State 14 of 16 from the strike pack trying to go to six and two here in the lead as Luben stuffs it cheering perfect Yeah Luben stays perfect and hes just been the beneficiary of a number of beautiful finds from his teammates Trey Hollowman getting involved in the action as its been primarily Cuadric Copeland Darion Williams who have found Ben Allen Luben throughout this game Luben Williams three YES cheering Starling missed it cheering Here comes Copelan for the double double Oh he was celebrating but he could celebrate cheering that Give Abless swirling shot and assist because it set up a luben stuff and NC State has completely broken this game open cheering Tyler Betsy hits a three at the other end and Adrien Autry will use his final timeout A second half show for NC State on the way to six into pit where he said we showed some real grit We didnt play well and still pulled it out and won by nine And in that pick game NC State scored on 14 of its final 15 possessions They have closed this game beautifully as well as Trey Hollowman draws a foul Well one thing for certain offense is not a problem for the Wolfpack Theyre the best threepoint shooting team by percentage in the ACC Youve got a 66 elite playmaker in Guardia Copeland Youve got Darien Williams and he continues to play this way Now youve got two guys are virtually unguardable off the bounce They both can make threes and Vin Allen Luben is maybe the best in the ACC of catching and finishing and playing off of his teammates Leads the league in field goal percentage A perfect compliment to these two extraordinary perimeter players Williams Copeland and Luben tonight 58 combined points We havent talked much about Paul Mcmanil Jr who is the second best threepoint shooter in the ACC And so he really hasnt had to do much in this game because theyve got so much production from his teammates Yeah we got a college debut right here Thats Calvin Russell with the ball and he turns it over Welcome to the bigs Hollerman Lupin cheering He stays perfect Russell the young man wearing six is one of the biggest football recruits Syracuse has had in years and years A fivestar wide receiver whos here on the basketball court for the first time Missed a layup and Akir Suarez is fouled going for the putback So Ill test your basketball knowledge Why do you think Russells wearing the number six Cory Alexander I think hes wearing number six because hes a fivestar football recruit Six is one up from five I think hes wearing six because his mom had 1482 career points cheering Yeah all those things are true However you are false laughter Is it something to do with the last name It would have something to do with the last name cheering applause The number six which is retired throughout the NBA Lets see What cheering is the prize for a missed free throw Is a ChickfilA sandwich if you miss two free throws in the second half Id like one too cuz I havent eaten any dinner cheering ChickfilA for everyone Russell with a put back and the bucket I I dont think anyone here at Lenovo Center cares anything about Russell getting his first basket Its more about ChickfilA at this point Well they care Well yes And we care for that Hopefully thats mom coming up to check out applause her baby boys first action Calvin Russell with a threepoint play The kid can hoop and hes going to be a special wide receiver they think up in
