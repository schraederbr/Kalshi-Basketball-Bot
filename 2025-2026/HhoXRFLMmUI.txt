Woo Jaden Hastings William Kyle III jumping center and we are underway Nathan George the junior from Toronto first year at Syracuse at the point with Nate Kings Theres William Kyle JJ Stling the senior leader on this team They open up against him manto man Stling lobs it Kyle had it broken up by Bowden Kepki That was a good idea but the pass wasnt high enough I dont think he can be too high for William K Hes going to go get it Heres Luca Taves who moved into the starting lineup for BC in early December unable to get his first assist misses the three Here comes Syracuse back the other way No coincidence that with this man Donnie Freeman back in the lineup everybody around him has been playing better Oh theres no question You got to pay attention to Freeman and that creates more room for everybody else Oh my heavens Thats what you call maintaining your pivot foot Doug You just talked about Kyle He is big and he is strong and he scores within 5 ft of the basket just about all the time Yeah he shoots at a very high percentage because hes among the national leaders in dunks That was a layup He rarely takes a shot thats not a layup or a dunk Taves on the switch into the paint finds a man in the corner Good close out by Freeman down the lane Campaign and it looked like Kyle got a piece indeed Thats his first block shot averaging nearly three per game And on the rim run he rewards himself for the layup Now that I mean hes really athletic but thats a heck of a play on the dead run catching a pass that Im not sure he expected and is able to get it to the goal without putting it on the floor William Kyle has had a marvelous college career started at South Dakota State last year at UCLA Just recently went for a thousand career points Bowden Capy the junior from Victoria Minnesota has BC on the board Well not I think BCs got to be able to score close to the basket Obviously it helped to make some threes but theyve got to get the ball inside effectively Unforced turnover as George steps down the sideline applause Well Kyle is a guy hes noted for his shot blocking but look at that big step that he takes from underneath the basket and he I think he did get a fingertip on the ball but he doesnt stand there you know just admiring what he did He gets down the court and gets a basket Well like you say BC could use more offense inside Theyve got big defensiveminded athletic players like Aiden Shaw and Jaden Hastings who dont give them much at this end of the floor Is there a way to tap into that Dan Well you got to drive the ball to the basket Thats a great play by hand You got to drive the ball to the basket but Syracuse is going to come and try to block it and then your inside guys have to get positioned for offensive rebounds Hey Kings working on hand to the baseline cut off keeps the dribble on second effort misses nearly tapped in by a mistake by Hastings Eagles back with it and a chance to take their first lead of the afternoon Mike Boston College needs to take advantage of every transition opportunity they get Taves takes the bump Contested shot left and well short Here comes Donnie Freeman draws the second defender That means Kings has a look And thats that what you want to do You want to force Syracuse to the outside Theyve shot the three very well in the last couple games but theyre not noted for that cheering offensive foul A hand got called for the offensive foul right there But the last time down the court he does a really nice job just getting right by Not afraid of the shot blockers He gets all the way in there But Kapki in that situation you saw him hanging out at the free throw and he cant do that When Hand drives to the basket Kapky and the other big guys have to go to the goal so they can get a tip opportunity Kings again This time he buries it Syracuse back in front 74 Well the numbers shooting for Nate Kings are not what was expected at 31 transferring in from Oregon State But in talking to Adrien Autry last night at their practice he has full confidence He says Nate King still is confident in that shot Just has to start making him off the turnover King sets up Kyle who lost it Bodies fly and Boston College has the ball Kay hangs in the air misses the shot The Eagles will keep and pull it back out That was great hustle by Hastings Payne gets it back draws two defenders Whats he going to do with it Back out to Taves Shot clock under 10 Running through the screen was Nate Kings Hastings hit the deck and the foul goes against the Orange Timeout Youre in Chestnut Hill William Kyle has hes got four for Syracuse Nate Kings hit a three Thats their seven points Capy scored the first points today for BC Hes got two more along with Donald Han had a driving bucket So thats where we are Nearly 5 minutes gone here at County Forum JJ Stling Heres Freemans first attempt from the floor He has been very good shooting the basketball from beyond the threepoint line That one short by the point guard Nathan George I think Syracuse really has to move the ball a little bit better than that Particularly I think theyve got to get it inside That was a long three by Freeman off the tave miss Stling will bring it up the 64 senior leader of this team Arent many people faster with the basketball than JJ Stling turns the corner off to Nate Kings has a step along the baseline draws the help defender now George again will try from the right side and one of the ACCs premier setup men able to finish from the corner Thats really a difficult shot when you fake you almost walk and you still have to collect yourself Heres Fred Payne averaging over 14 points per game Freeman pars the rebound William Kyle sets the screen Starling free from about 17 Good quickness by Kings to get that rebound from two BC rebounders Caleb Steager has come to the game Number 30 for the Eagles defending Kings and he is going to be called for the blocking foul All right just you just talking about George and what a great job hes done the last couple games in terms of his assist but hes got the open look very nearly travels dribbles the ball That is a really hard play to make and he made it look very easy Well the transition from Georgia Tech where he led the ACC in assists per game last year to Syracuse has not been as seamless as he would have liked but he certainly seems to have hit his stride last couple of games as you say Dan 11 assists and 13 assists to get his season average up over five and a half The last Syracuse player to have backtoback doubledigit assist games was nine years ago when John Gillan turned the trick Kayen Anthony and Sadique White the two prized freshmen to come into the game for the Orange Heres Freeman First two points for number one in Orange And you cant guard that Uh I mean they they made him put it down so he didnt take the three and but again hes so good with the ball that little spin that wasnt bad defense thats just a great offensive player Well in his four ACC games this year averaging 23 points 7 and a half rebounds per game Chase Forte at the point for Boston College He began the season as their starting one Gets the ball back and the welltraveled veteran missed the rim on his first shot attempt Terrific hustle by Hastings but its a shot clock violation because the Forte three did not catch the iron We talked before the game about Freeman and all the things he contributes And I you know I just dont know that Hastings can do much more than this against Freeman You know he forces him into a tough shot but thats just a really good play Hes every bit of 69 and with his high release what do you do you take the ball out of the basket and try to score down on your end Well he was the number six recruit coming out of high school last year Has battled injuries but now is healthy and going right back to work here this afternoon What a game changer he is for Syracuse Particularly when you have a situation like that where hes got the ball at the top of the key Hes guarded by Bowden Kapky whos not the quickest guy in the world but that little hesitation dribble drives the other the help defender away And then theres nobody to help Kapky And thats hes not Captain cant guard that one And so Johnny free uh Donnie Freeman out of St Johns in Washington DC at the line This has been another area where he has helped this team improve Hes a terrific free throw shooter just a touch under 80 And he gets to the line an awful lot Well before conference play Syracuse was like 62 from the free throw line but in conference play theyre 76 And a large part of that is that Freeman has been going to the line Now thanks to the fact that BC has gone more than two and a half minutes without any points Syracuse on an 80 run They go to pay He cant end the drought Kappy will head to the free throw line But now Boston College is one for its last seven Dan Well Kayen Anthony the freshman out of Long Island Lutheran High School has his father and a Smith Hall of Famer as is been the case this year sitting courtside the catalyst on the 2003 National Championship Orangeman Now hes helping the referees Well he has a a constant dialogue when hes sitting courtside with his son and other players And why not Why wouldnt you listen to one of the alltime greats There were photographs before Syracuses last home game of Carmelo on the court putting his son through his paces for a workout He still is very much his sons primary coach Kappy after the free throws heads to the bench Jaden Hastings returns Hastings hand Payne Shaw and Forte Five on the floor for Boston College Forte tries to stay with Sterling Theres that speed with the dribble youre talking about Dan You got to you got to make him stop You got to make him pull up and shoot a jump shot And thats much easier said than done Thats a great drive Forte uses the screen pass to the corner Payne sets up fires and connects First three points for the red shirt sophomore from Bramling Louisiana If you can get it into the lane the Syracuse defense is going to collapse because theyre looking to block the shot So you get it into the lane you move it quickly out and Payne was ready to go that time Defense defense defense defense defense defense Tyen Anthony cheering swatted Terrific help defense by Aiden Shaw One of the best in the ACC Pain No Picked out of the sky by Akir Suare And the Orange back the other way Tyler Betsy coming off his career performance last time out Had 18 points on six made threes number five in Orange out for the first time Dont let him go all the way to the basket Make him take a tough shot And thats exactly what Boston College did to Starling on that occasion Last couple of games JJ Stling has averaged 17 points 14 of 21 from the floor again an offshoot of Donnie Freemans return to the lineup This is an interesting lineup that Syracuse has in the game right now The guy that Boston College really needs to be concerned about other than Stalling is Betsy You dont want to let him be a catch and shoot threepoint guy And here he is Betsy is 68 225 White shaping up on the block Hes got a height advantage Forte trying to stay with him Cant do it Good shot by White just off the front rim Boston College midway through this first half Back the other way where the Eagles have missed six of their last seven from the field Forte attacks and hes fouled by White Chase Forte will be shooting two free throws when we come back to Chestnut Hill Massachusetts But another one of the bright sides for the ACC at this point Duke Virginia Clemson North Carolina Louisville SMU Miami and NC State arent just in the field as its projected They are comfortably in the field So they have performed as a league very well in the nonconference to put themselves in position And thats what you have to do The first thing you got to play well in the nonconference portion of the schedule so you can put yourself in position to play your way into the NCA tournament Suare hands to Betsy his first attempt Rims off Forte dribbles up Young man from Raleigh North Carolina in his fourth division one stop UNCC Asheville Northwestern State South Dakota last year where he was first team all summit league But here Syracuse drops into his zone Oh well todays quadruple header rolls on next with Caleb Wilson in number 14 North Carolina squaring off against Cal and Ben Wooden Award front runner Cameron Boozer leads sixth ranked Duke against Stanford at Maples Pavilion And Dan Im looking forward to see the revelation that is Ibuka Aorei for Stanford Well he is a revelation Donald Han gets the defender in the air who then manages to maybe get a piece Sadique White hustling I think theyre going to call a foul on Donald Han Jr Well we talked off the top Dan about how does BC unlock the offensive skills of Donald Han Jr Well Donald Han just has to continue to work hard to get good shots and then make them In this particular case he missed the shot He tried to get after it And you really have to give a lot of credit to Sadi White out there who put himself in position Lots of times a guy misses a three like that And hes not blocked out but Sadi White got himself in good position and drew the foul Syracuse led by nine at one point They have gone on a three plus minute drought having missed their last four St George the point guard back into the game and a miss dunk by White A perfect setup by Nathan George but the freshman from Charlotte got blocked by the rim Well this this is really a great pass And watch watch the defense collapse and he gets Hastings off his feet And thats what you do when you drive into shot blockers You get the shot blocker off his feet Nobodys there to cover him And why dont I want to have that one back Earl Grant the fifth year head coach in Boston College getting the explanation And there is Adrien Autry year three at his alma mater Coach Red as he is known around Central New York cheering Well and Sadique White we talked about Syracuses problems in the nonconference part of the schedule shooting free throws White only a 51 free throw shooter And true to his percentage he makes one out of two Syracuse showed the zone on that one particular occasion and then they picked up a foul trying to get a rebound So they switch back to the manto man Forte is denied but a whistle comes Now Whites got to be careful here He has picked up a couple of untimely technical fouls including in Syracuses last game Tuesday against Florida State His teammates immediately say Sadique hold on now Well hes waiting down at the bottom there Hes in the middle of lane Hes waiting for the dribbler to come and up top He may have gotten the ball but he got that body Anytime you he jumps hes claiming he jumps straight up in the air but I think he actually jumped into the guy driving the basketball Thats a tough call though And so now he has picked up three personal fouls and will be replaced by his old IMG Academy buddy Donnie Freeman back into the lineup for Syracuse And Doug its at the free throw line that Boston College is climbing back into this game Theyve drawn some fouls and theyre knocking down some free throws This is Chase Forte Finally at the age of 24 has worked himself into a power conference position at Boston College The Eagles as you say Dan now a perfect six for six from the line Its back to a threepoint ball game And Freeman took his eye off the pass and had it trickle off his left hand and out of bounds Well this is a Bosma College team thats loaded with tough guys Theyre just not going to back down and theyve had great success driving the ball and they ought to continue to do that Pay puts it up to the rim and weve got a wedgie on the alleyoop attempt We also have a foul on the alleyoop attempt number 10 Akira Suare called for the personal number 10 in orange Hastings sets the screen just rolls to the basket Nobody comes over to help Suare is late getting there And Hastings Im telling you now he is energy athleticism Hes a run and dunk kind of guy Well upon arriving in Chestnut Hill he took a developmental red shirt couple of years ago added weight and learned each day practicing against all ACC big Quinton Post now starting for the Golden State Warriors And now in his second year of being a contributor for Earl Grant he misses the second Back into the game William Kyle for the Orange grabs the rebound Again Hastings is not a very good free throw shooter either Only 50 on the year Betsy feeds inside to George Creates space Didnt factor though for Jane Hastings coming down to block the shot Forte back to Payne Cut off by Kyle Lets go Eagles Lets go Eagles Forte willing his way into the paint Pay threw a double team and its blocked by Kyle His second rejection of the afternoon And weve got a call on the floor Weve reached the under eight media timeout Boston College is going to hang and beat Syracuse Its going to be on the defensive end and guys like Jaden Hastings among the best in the ACC at that end of the floor music Scan the QR code on the video board and play the game Just like that you could win some delicious prizes from Jersey Mike Fast fun impacted flavor just like your favorite sub Dont wait Play now Jersey box a ladies and gentlemen we ask for your attention to center court today we are proud to recognize multiple generations of Boston College basketball alumni individuals who helped build the tradition culture and legacy of DC basketball from different eras teams and different roles These Eagles represent the past but between those two they could play Well they could play And heres this is a sample of what they used to do in the Big East A lot of banging going on in laughter there And theres no basket of foul results here But in the last 4 minutes and 17 seconds no team neither of these teams music has a field goal but Boston College has been chipping into this lead cutting into this lead by scoring from the free throw line So a ninepoint lead is down to three with Aiden Shaw back at the line The former Missouri Tiger spent the last three years in Colombia playing for Dennis Gates able to get the first Hes another one of these 5050 free throw shooters at 54 on the year He was a key reserve on last years Missouri NCAA team but looking for a bigger role has come to Boston College starting for the Eagles And part of the Boston College problem in their four losses in conference play is coming in they were shooting only 57 from the free throw line While they havent been perfect here today theyre better than 57 and its the free throw line thats brought it back in the game Syracuse has four starters plus Ken Anthony on the floor JJ Stling another starter will come in at the next stoppage and its a Syracuse turnover The Eagles with a chance to tie take the lead Well if youre Syracuse thats one thing you cannot afford to do A team that struggles to shoot you want to make them play against your set defense And to the Orange credit they did get back and have set their defense Forte And that is the first basket in the game cheering in over five minutes And it leads to the first lead of the afternoon for Boston College And that is Fortes first threepoint basket in ACC play He picks up the blocking foul trying to stop Freeman at the other end Now we talked about Boston College struggles shooting the ball and particularly shooting from three And this is not an easy shot Its pull up off the dribble coming in He was only shooting 20 overall for three 0 for six in conference play And so that is a big big boost for the Eagles And just like that their defense has held firm Theyre now ahead in the game Freeman gets it in Kings is fouled before the shot Well we have Miami covered before during and player interviews Well its like theyve decided to abandon the field goal Theyre just going with free throws Neither team as weve talked about shoots it particularly well So I would think theyd want to get back to making buckets Syracuse in particular well over 50 in their last two outings from the field Luca Tay starting point guard back into the game out there in the back court with Fred Payne Purus Payne averaging over 14 per game The long two rattles out Syracuse has gone six minutes between buckets The drought ended on the Nathan George three I expect George to pass the ball and hes not a great threepoint shooter adequate Syracuse need adap Taves has his pass blocked Able to get it back BC keeps possession with 10 on the shot clock Pay lost it Gets it back Taves fills in on the backside Misses the three George puts up a tough shot Kyle had his hands on it but its Boston College basketball And behind the back is Aiden Shaw to get a couple of oos and as from the student section right behind us Stan Bonner Well Adrian may Audrey might be ooing and a George because that was really a forced shot Taves from the elbow No Freeman wide open from three and the struggles at this end for the Orange continue They lead by four 2319 final five minutes of the first half That ball had a really weird spin coming off his hand cheering BC just one for its last nine Hastings picks it back out Payne uses the screen to get away from Stling for three Second triple of the afternoon for him And its back to a onepoint game Now thats thats the way Boston College wants to play You get the clock down you make the defense move and then you hit an open shot And thats something they had struggled to do during the course of the season cheering Bad pass taken away by Boston College Eagles trying to run Tavage leaves the three by Kane No missed opportunity for Boston College George has it taken away Kane says Give me that He throws it up Shaw on the receiving end of the alley cheering Freeman time and again since he has returned from injury hes been the answer for Syracuse But Boston College on its home floor the aggressor the last few minutes giving Syracuse a ball game here today screaming music with seven points But the Boston College defense has allowed the Eagles to claw back to a 9point deficit And the interesting thing is neither team shooting the ball well but still that Boston College defense has been critical in keeping the Eagles in the game Well Freeman has gone for 20 or more points in each of the last three Syracuse games Hes got a team high eight points right now giving Syracuse the twopoint lead Its hard to describe what an important play that was by Freeman You could just feel the momentum turning and he cut it off immediately Heres Syracuse back to the zone Hand back in after a long time on the bench And he puts it right up No Skying for the rebound is Freeman Why has Adrien Autry gone more zone than we have seen the last couple of games Well one of the reasons hes going zone today is theyre having a hard time guarding Boston College driving the ball to the basket Freeman coughs it up Pay by himself has no teammates with him and they pull it back out Kappys return to the lineup for Boston College Theyre starting big Number 33 with the white headband Here is hand the red shirt junior from Virginia Beach Captain defended oneonone by William Kyle Freeman again up above the iron Hes doing about everything he can do Kayen Anthony looking for his first points Hes only a 23 threepoint shooter on the season And some of that to me would be shot selection Yes but that wasnt a bad shot Tavage has it poked away by JJ Stling End to end with the finish Once Starling gets that ball and starts the other way if he has a lead youre not going to catch him He just out tough Caves for that ball points off turnovers pretty even even though Syracuse has coughed it up seven times to just three for BC Another rebound for Donnie Freeman And Freeman and the Orange in general are doing a pretty good job rebounding Not many offensive rebound opportunities for Boston College Freeman going to try to take advantage of his size Spins away from Payne Extra pass finds Kings in the corner Got it Foul on the rebounding action underneath the basket and its on Kavki So the Orange are going to get a chance here for that threepoint play and then a oneonone opportunity from the free throw line Spins away and does the ball is the since its a foul on the defense was he in any shooting motion before the foul And the answer is yes Chase weve been talking about the Boston College defense but Syracuse right here does a really great job just out musling Boston College Taves stops and he has the ball stripped And once Starling gets in front of you youre not going to catch up He is an orange blur There arent many people in the ACC or even in the country who are faster with their dribble than JJ Starman Now you talk about an adventure at the free throw line Here we go And you know the young man standing at the line is conscious of it He can hear as we can the fans murmuring when you go to the line and when you shoot under 50 and have the unusual motion that he does But I tell you what he works his tail off that It is not unusual at all to see him out before and after practices just shooting free throws It doesnt matter what it looks like as long as it goes in And his problem is its going to go in Final minute of the first half here at County Forum Syracuse has moved the lead back to seven Boy Freeman had another mismatch inside and they missed it Another Syracuse turnover Nice job by Anthony to get a hand on it But here comes Payne for the flush Boy Boston College really needed that And its no surprise it comes from their defense Yeah You know this first half hasnt been pretty but its been a very pretty kind of affair Well you mentioned it earlier Its a little Big East like with these two old rivals Adrien Autry remembers those Big East days He and his team up five over BC music The Orange up by five And its the Boston College music defense that has kept kept the Eagles in the game The pass is tipped by Payne and then off they go Its very interesting Hastings picks it up Nobody from Syracuse Theres three BC guys before any Orange get back Well I so enjoy watching Fred Payne play basketball music I love watching him play defense Hes always in the right stance and as you said he has been 100 and gritty as anybody from the moment he showed up at Boston College The first thing that Earl Grant told me about him is hes an allout eeffort guy You certainly see that And so no surprise hes the one who leads the break and throws it down to make it a fivepoint game And after the timeout Syracuse has it on the sideline Up by five Stling glances back over to his head coach to reaffirm the call I think hes asking What time on the clock coach do you want me to go Anthony uses the Kyle screen Seven on the shot clock On the switch Anthony gets some separation misses the shot Boston College with time and a foul by Freeman 90 ft from the basket And Freeman certainly does not want to pick up that particular foul because as you say they had to go the length of the court and they can do that in 9 seconds But this is an extremely difficult shot And I dont know what play Adrien Autry drew up over there but I guarantee you that wasnt it You know I could draw up a play to get a shot that was that bad You sure Positive At the line is Aiden Shaw the senior from Overland Park Kansas Heres our Thursday night ACC Network womens basketball double header Anna Hidalgo and number 23 Notre Dame host Miami at 6 Eastern And then North Carolina versus Georgia Tech Should be another great night of hoops Just when you think Syracuse might run away Boston College climbs back in Freeman right down the lane Puts it up and in 10 points for the sophomore from Washington DC And as has been the case this month since number one returned from injury he is the man for has three assists Boston College only four So both defenses forcing a lot of oneonone play Donald Han who had a quiet first half just a couple of points JJ Stling William Kyle Donnie Freeman Nate Kings and Nathan George Foul will send William Pile to the line to shoot two Well we had a bunch of games in the ACC at noon that have gone final The one on top your alma mater Virginia with a huge win at SMU Well they have now beaten NC State SMU and Louisville on the road So Virginia getting things done early How about that Georgia Tech NC State score Surprised Yeah very surprised That was at North Carolina State There you get a look at it Georgia Tech just got blown out by Pit Miami and Clemson Thats going to be a good one all the way down to the end Look at those games later on Thats a violation because he never hit the never hit the rim Yeah those two games out in the Bay Area coming up following us on ACC Network We get a chance to see both North Carolina and Duke here on ACC Network And itll be interesting to see if Carolina can bounce back I mean thats a tough trip You certainly dont want to go 0 and2 but just about everybody did last year Taves spotting up And thats what Taves can do Hes not going to drive to the basket Hes not going to out physical anybody But if you can get him an open three hes pretty good threepoint shooter 44 on the year Stling has a step hangs in the air and puts it in An acrobatic move for the senior guard And that he drives into a sea of shot blockers Boston College very good knocking it away Kapki gets to hand Taves the starting point guard Get the ball to Hastings at the high post Fred Payne the other starter here in the second half for Boston Collins and had it knocked out of bounds BC will keep with six on the shot clock Weve been talking about Stling and his quickness This is a guy who loves to attack the basket He just got by and nothing Capski can do about that because Starling hangs in the air Capsky expected him to be in one place and he was in a different one Hastings got to put it up Clears out and cheering is called for the offensive foul Kyle stood his ground and drew the foul And when that elbow comes up thats thats automatic for the official Theyre okay right here But he turns that shoulder and the arm comes out as well And you know I would say in a lot of cases you know its hard to knock Kyle that far But I think Hastings can do it Well its always got to be in your mind if you are going against such a proficient shot blocker One of the best this season in Syracuse program history averaging about three blocks per game Freeman had it poked away cheering his fourth turnover Pay ts it down and its two more points off of turnovers for BC Heres Syracuse has a chance to extend the lead but again they turn it over and Boston College converts it into points BC has led by one point on a couple of occasions back in the first half 1918 and 2423 They are hanging around A chance to tie it here with the basketball Bad pass JJ Stling playing defensive back Theres Payne in perfect stance defensively Stling to George and on the double team Hes wide open but misfires Thatll be Syracuse basketball as they say Hand was the last to touch Well Boston College has shown you their defense can carry him And this is just a really nice play You pitch it ahead and pay That was not an easy shot Going to have a coachs challenge it appears So the ball was ruled off Boston College So Syracuse ball and Earl Grant has elected to challenge Now of course everybody knows the rule You have to have a timeout and they obviously do Now if this is the previous play is under review So well resume this conversation when we come back Weve got immediate timeout so well take a break while the officials check this thing out here at County Forum Heat Heat Hello Heat Heat Heat Heat N My Everything After review the call on the floor has been overturned It will be Boston College basketball Boston College will keep their time out as well as their challenge Well as you see there graphically the call was overturned And so that means Dan well that mean obviously it means that they felt like uh Kyle was the last guy to hit the ball But what that means is Earl Grant keeps his timeout because to challenge you have to take a timeout And if you lose the challenge you lose your challenge You lose your timeout But he gets to keep his time out and keep his challenge But he only has one more challenge left whether hes successful or not on the net Kapi wide open Donnie Freeman soarses for another rebound His ninth of the afternoon Thats always a tricky thing when youre doing that challenge particularly this early in the game High low big to big pays off for the Orange Freeman with a chance for three Well that time Syracuse got a little better movement by players off the ball and the result was Freeman mismatched inside against Taz and you know the ball hung in the air for a while but the only other guy down there is Payne and he cant get it either Nope I mean Paynes only 61 Taves also 61 Freeman is every bit of 69 I just wondered if that ball hung up on the air too long and one of the big guys could get to it but the big guys were out at the top of the key 13 to lead all scorers and the lead is back to six Fullourt pressure for Syracuse and thats an issue for Boston College defensively because they dont have anybody big enough to guard Freeman once theres a switch Yeah positional size can be an issue for BC Payne no Kyle fights for the rebound but then throws it out of bounds Back to Boston College Another turnover And Kyle I think tried to get rid of that quickly cuz he felt like he was losing his balance But that the turnovers have really plagued Syracuse today You say well unforced turnovers but that wasnt really unforced He was falling down and he tried to get rid of it 10th turnover for the Orange Nate George got his hand on that knocked it out of bounds Taves and the Eagles though will keep So thats a perfect example of why referees never believe players because theres no question that George knocked that ball out of bounds But he turns around and says the referee No its our ball It went off t But they can be influenced cant they A kneejerk reaction Youve got someone definitively in your face saying Well its going the other way That doesnt influence the the call at all No Theres an easy answer to that question No Okay Pay little floater You know hes a lefty on the perimeter but get him in the lane and hes going to finish with his right hand And hes really good with that floater He leads Boston College with a dozen Nate Kings buries the three Hes into double figures Better than his season average of 94 points per game Boston College you got to move the ball Tapy goes to the floor Starling dives for it And hes going to be called for that foul at midc court as Payne went flying Nate Kings is a potent threepoint shooter The southpaw buries the triple early in the second half music edition I couldnt see nothing music to the car Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo music Lets hear it for your BC Palm team Fans its time to celebrate Todays birthday messages are brought to you by Lash Family Entertainment your destination for nonstop fun Keep an eye on the video board to see todays winner of a free birthday party at launch Congratulations Youre the winner of a free birthday party at launch Redemption instructions will be sent to the email provided upon submission Happy birthday from all of us and our friends at Launch Family Entertainment All right BC I hope youre still hungry cuz its time for KM hot dog If you want to hop out you got to get a big hand here You want to hop out of that Let me hear you Okay the Orange with a sevenpoint lead And you can question is how did they get that open for a three Well heres the key player right here Everybodys worried about him And so Cowki in the middle of the lane hes not going to come over to help Hands got to come all the way over to help out And that leaves Kings wide open in the corner KKY stays stays Hes worried about Freeman who cuts into the lane And so Han probably overcommits on that but that leaves Kings all alone in the corner That was excellent execution And thats what can happen when you draw all those defenders with the draw And Dan thats a perfect example of what weve been talking about that since Donnie Freeman returned to the lineup December 30th from injury everybody else around him has seen a bump in their numbers Pay nice job coming out of a timeout to get that look And particularly against the zone Syracuse switched up to the zone but Payne continues to be the guy I mean hes scored over 20 in his last three games and hes closing in on that mark today He is got 15 points to lead everybody Theres the lob and the finish George Teao And again you draw the defense and the shot blockers come and that leaves the guy their guard open And it doesnt help if you get one of those little guys down in there because they cant do anything when they throw it up to Kh to Kyle Well that is now 38 dunks this season for William Kyle sixth most in the country Carolina freshman phenom Caleb Wilson leads everybody in that category Tacky against Freeman Everything but the finish And Syracuse has the ball George tough shot swatted cheering out of the air by Hastings you get the ball and you get down the court which is fine but youre surrounded You know theres two guys there and what you do is you take the ball back out So I dont think Adrien Aut is particularly happy with that play but here laughter there nothing anybody can do You throw it up to that guy Well as a 10yearold William Kyle was a world class high jumper Hes got a 73 wingspan He can also run the 400 and 800 He is a speedster athlete Freeman couldnt reach that pass as George threw it out of bounds Theyre going to say nobody touched it and so the inbound will come back over on this side of the floor You know George has been spectacular in the last two games and he is really struggling today You know that that play I couldnt be more wide open Theres nobody there and he just throws it over his head And its not like he was intimidated by the guy guarding him taking the ball out of bounds because it was tased As you said 11 assists and 13 assists his last two games but his turnovers have been a problem so far this afternoon Soaring in for the rebound and the put back is Hastings and hell have a chance for three Boston College hanging with Syracuse applause Every time Boston College needs a play they get a steal or in this case they convert the offensive rebound And thats thats you just got to stay away from Hastings in that particular situation And Dan thats the second personal foul on Freeman Yeah Freemans done a lot of real good things but that wasnt one one of them Well todays quadruple header rolls on next with Caleb Wilson and number 14 North Carolina squaring off against Cal and then Wooden Award front runner Cam Boozer and number six Duke will take on Stanford out by the bay Hastings out of Orlando Christian Academy at the line Tyler Betsy stepped into the lane early for Syracuse but with the make theres no violation Kayen Anthony has also come back in for Syracuse We have not seen much of the other freshman Sadique White who picked up three early fouls in the first half and he has not played since Stling no look pass to Freeman Here comes Payne Boston College down by three Payne off the hesitation Nobody stopped him He couldnt lay it in Freeman Bad pass Tried to thread the needle No chance for that one to find its target Well he threw it down at Kyles ankles and behind him That just was not a good decision Eagles Boy Boston College desperately needs hand to get going Only two points today after a scoreless game last time out at Clemson Another block shot by Kyle Mismatch inside Taz is begging for help against Kyle And that is very inefficient by Syracuse There was there was that tremendous mitch mismatch inside Kyle Taz was screaming for help and Syracuse never even gave it a look Taz all the way to the bucket and its to onepoint ball game Thats the element of surprise right there He very rarely drives it Stling down the lane He gets it blocked Foul Well Taves is a guy youre playing him for his jump shot You dont really expect that hes going to drive the ball to the basket And I think Kings just thought the whole time that Taz was going to pull up but Taz never did Nice play And so the foul on Aiden Shaw sends JJ Stling to the line I said Kings was guarding him but it wasnt this guy cheering Theres James coming back in along with a suare Freeman and Kyle go to the Syracuse bench So this is going to be an interesting stretch of the game right here because cheering Syracuses big offensive weapon has been Freeman and hes now out of the game cheering Well with the under 12 media timeout looming perhaps just a quick extra break for Freeman to come back in Heres Taves Pay feeling it screaming Boston College retakes the lead And thats their biggest lead of the game They went by one a couple of times but now theyre up by two cheering cheering This is what happens when you let somebody hang around on the switch Suare has tames on him but Suare is not an offensive threat away from the basket at all Starling cheering Jason Aamod has come into the game for the first time for BC He grabbed that rebound Number 55 in maroon Tavage gives it back and the foul called applause against Kings will send Boston College back to the free throw line and Jake Hastings Monday January 19th music 350 courtesy of Delta Airlines Lets give it up for Julia one more time Courtesy of our friends at Delta Airlines Thank All right How about we do this one We love a good flex chair If you see yourself up on that video board its time to show your muscles presented by catch group Lets see whos been pumping that iron face at the end of the new year Oh lets see him Come on Oh there we go Were doing okay Yeah Yeah As theyve done all afternoon long Boston College after trailing by seven has come back to lead by two And one of the reasons is Fred Pay He does a great job moving without the basketball and then knocks down the threepoint shot You know I said before that Syracuse has let Boston College hang around Well thats not really accurate as we get a look music at Paynes numbers Boston College has hung around They have doggedly stayed in this game Well they forced 12 Syracuse turnovers and leap in the category of points off of turnovers 18 to8 In bench scoring its BC 121 And theyve managed to get a little bit of offense out of both Jaden Hastings and Aiden Shaw who we talked about in the first half are more defenders This is Hastings at the line And all that with only two points from Donald H You know youre talking about Fred Payne He had three stated offseason goals coming into the year One he wanted to be more consistent Two he wanted to rebound better And three Dan he wants to be the 2026 ACC most improved player Hes very much in that mix Absolutely Hes in the hunt for that award Boston College on a nine nothing run Well where does Syracuse go for offense here Well Kings on this trip Okay thats a good place to go Worked out this time 14 points now for the red shirt senior from Salem Oregon And were tied at 47 He has made four of five from beyond the arc Well again thats the trust Adrien Autry was talking about to us last night in Nate Kings The numbers have not necessarily been where they have wanted but he said hes confident Just keep shooting Theyre going to go down Tyler Betsy after scoring 18 last time out has yet to score today Ken Anthony still looking for his first points and being fouled by Oamoto The freshman from Brooklyn will head to the line to shoot two Mark Kings is wide open here A little bit slow as Hastings coming out to guard that threepoint shot Really good screen But a guy like that again hes got his career Hes got pretty good shooting numbers and you give him those kind of open opportunities hes going to make a lot of them Well hes only 31 this year but he shot 45 last year for Oregon State when he was honorable mention all mountain West Conference Boy Syracuse is what thats four free throws in a row theyve missed Ken Anthony with his Nmith Hall of Fame father just a few feet away Carmelo Anthony watching his son is still looking for his first point Melo one of four former Syracuse basketball players in Springfield Melo was inducted last year Dave Bing and Jim Beahheim your partner and Vic Hansen way back in the day Vic was a threetime hoops allAmerican at Syracuse back in the 1920s Anthony going to be called for the foul Now this is a tough matchup for Anthony Tay has gone out of the game and now Anthony has to guard Forte And Forte is a guy who is bigger and stronger than Tay This can be hard for Anthony to stay in front of him And heres that matchup a 24 year old point guard for BC against a freshman in Cayenne Anthony and gives it back to Forte Asamod a 36 threepoint shooter Misfires on his first attempt Kings gets it back Nobody near him and he makes BC pay once again That is a great decision by Betsy Hes a guy whos a catch and shoot threepoint guy but he made that one extra pass to allow Kings to get into some rhythm Payne under control floats it up and in He had to float that up pretty high Fred Payne has been the answer to every question today so far for Boston College Boston second time out and Syracuse Every time Boston College comes back they respond They now lead by two And heres Kings coming down the court He throws it to Betsy Betsy immediately gets back Hand reacts to Betsy because Betsy is a good threepoint shooter Betsy sees it gets it back to Kings And again all alone hes now hes five of six from out there today And if your hand you got to pick your poison there Absolutely No question But I think the poison that I would have picked is Betsy because Betsy I dont think Betsies made a basket today And Kings has been lighting it up But you know in the scouting report before the game they heard an awful lot about Tyler Betsy No kidding And its very difficult Its easy for me to sit over here and say it Its much harder to do it out there Stling to Kings Gives it back to Stling with a step on the defender Its another running floater for JJ Stling That was very good offensive execution Nine minutes left in regulation And gives it back to Payne No screen Here it comes gets the ball out of Paynes hands with eight on the shot clock and calls for it Working on Anthony Tough shot applause Tough shot Anthony is criticized sometimes for his defense and he does have a hard time staying in front of people but that time I thought he did a pretty good job That was just a great shot Just the second made basket for Donald Han Jr with the four points Hes got BC back to within two Heres Betsys three applause You know Betsy he hes open Theres no question about that But that balls got to move a little bit more to give you a chance for an offensive rebound if you miss Jaden Hastings spins to the baseline lays it in and reties the game Now Betsy is 68 but hes not an inside player And Hastings isnt much taller but he is a pure post guy Just wore him out Just wore Hasting Betsy out inside Stling into the lane again Unable to get the rope but gets it back and lays it in JJ Stling pumped up after making our score 5553 That was a tough shot but he stayed with it and works on Kings cheering Forte kept his dribble but he stepped out of bounds Costly turnover committed by BC as we head to break Boston College trying to protect its home floor against his old Big East rival music Dan Bonner Im Doug Sherman here at County Forum in Chestnut Hill Massachusetts Boston College giving Syracuse a ball game 5553 the Orange with the lead And once again for Boston music College Dan its Fred Payne in the fourth straight game that he has scored 20 or more points Hes got exactly 20 so far today His careerhigh was 24 against NC State the last time they played here in this building Well Chase Forte is the only other guy whos really putting up any points at all Hes got nine points but the key has been Boston Colleges defense keeping him in the game Kyle hands to Kings whos had the hot hand in the second half in trouble underneath goes to that left hand and cant bank it home I think he thought he was going to get fouled When youre surrounded like that you find somebody to kick the ball out to Lob it up way too far from the rim for Shaw but there to clean it up Jaden Hastings tied at 55 When you take the ball inside against shot blockers all you got to do is get it over him and thats going to leave somebody wide open Kyle came for the ball and missed and Hastings nobody was anywhere around Tied for the fifth time today Lot of dribbling Kings in traffic cheering and he turns it over Kings drove into the lane and the defense collapsed on him and George needed to slide to the corner but Kings got in there and its surrounded by everybody and he doesnt have any place to throw the ball If theres somebody in the corner he can pass it but he cant pass it out to where George is standing Hes standing behind Forte So you cant be a spectator on offense Syracuse drops into the zone George and Stling defending out front with Kings Kyle and Freeman the big Forte drives and dishes just back into the game to miss that shot Caleb Stager but its an offensive rebound for BC The possession continues cheering Tough to rebound out of that zone sometimes but theyre in zone because they theyre trying to stop the dribble penetration Three to shoot Forte gets it up on the rim and draws the foul on Stling The gymnastics season is underway and this is our first ACC Network meet tomorrow afternoon Number 13 Stanford squares off against number 11 North Carolina at Carmichael Arena in Chapel Hill Coverage begins at 4 Eastern 1 Pacific And its also available on the ESPN app Carolina has a good one And Gwen Frink the reigning ACC gymnast of the week A chance to see them tomorrow afternoon here on ACC Network And again we said before the game neither one of these teams are great free throw shooters And in a tight game Thats a problem Forte missed them both And that is the 10th rebound of the day extending a season high for Donnie Freeman Have come on the defensive end but hes only got three points in the second half The Orange have gone scoreless again for more than two minutes Another near turnover on a dangerous pass by George Well I dont know what George is seeing but hes lost it a couple times throwing that ball all the way across the court Well he has four turnovers Freeman has five And Boston College continues to take advantage off of those turnovers Here is George King spins Tough shot Absorbs the contact and hes got a chance for three applause That spin was the key to the whole thing because I didnt think he had anywhere to go Boston College has done a really nice job pressuring the ball but Stagger gets tied up on that screen and because Steers tied up on the screen when King spins into the lane theres nobody there to help Well he has matched his season high with 19 points first time around It came in the big win over Tennessee at the dome cheering And that free throw does not count Pat Driscoll the official over by the scorers table Stop play Now the scorers table made a mistake there Kings have the ball Youre not supposed to blow the horn No harm no foul Kings completes the threepoint play Now he exits Betsy returns with under five minutes to go So Kings sits with a team high 20 points Shaw tripped Freeman applause commits the foul That is number three on Donnie Freeman And after a quick rest Earl Grant will bring Fred Payne back into the lineup Weve talked a couple of times about how Boston College particularly Payne and Forte have really been pushing the envelope driving the ball into the lane and Syracuse has really had a hard time staying in front of the dribbles Of course its neither one of those guys that time But that was a nonshooting foul And so its a baseline inbounds for Boston College This is Payne and gives it back to Payne Hes got 20 points The most for the Eagles so far Pan tries to create Nothing doing that time He just went against a bigger guy You know Betsy did a nice job moving his feet Thats a really tough shot Stling attacks from the left William Kyle got a hand on it to keep it alive for the Orange Well Starling has been really aggressive George into the lane absorbs the contact No whistle Hes looking for a call but Boston College comes back the other way with numbers Pain No Lob it inside William Kyle comes down with it kicks it back out and Stling says Lets hold on a second fellas Defense defense defense Freeman oneonone Hell head back to the line Donnie Freeman will be shooting a couple of free throws after this music timeout game one Well I think its going to be the execution particularly on the offensive end music Both of these teams have been very solid defensively and Syracuse you know it looks like theyre going to pull away and then Boston College comes music back But I think one of the things thats going to happen is Freemans going to handle the ball here Theyre going to try to create some isolation situations for him going down the stretch Well the largest lead so far today Syracuse was up nine in the first half as Freeman makes the free throw He is now four for four from the stripe today and 13 of his last 14 over the last three games And obviously in a game like this everything is important but you go to the free throw line and you miss him its almost like a turnover Perfect swish on the second 15 cheering for Freeman and the lead is once again five And Boston College has been able to respond in this situation every time But theyve not scored a basket in over three minutes Hand tries to change that Cant do it Freeman rips another rebound away Thats really a tough shot And again Stlings not 68 like Betsy was but hes hes taller than Hand or at least as tall as Hand and thats really tough to get that shot up And as a senior Stling has really committed himself this year to the defensive end Freeman lost it and hes going to be tied up The possession arrow stays with Syracuse Well Starling is 64 He weighs over 200 lb He just does a really nice job not letting hand get by and forcing that fall away jump shot and that fall away jump shot under pressure in the middle of the lane like that Thats a tough shot And we said theyre going to isolate Freeman and they did but he wasnt isolated He got double teamamed Hes got to recognize that Six fouls this half committed by Syracuse Seven by Boston College Free throws the rest of the way Heres Freeman aggressive to the left hand Wow applause And BC come out of another drought Dan Theyve missed their last four shot attempts Well theyve responded all afternoon long cheering Ky gets tile up in the air and makes him pay applause You know Kowki scored inside early and we havent heard much from him since Freeman isolated He steps through and he did travel Terrific job defensively by Aiden Shaw to stay in his feet and stay with him Yes absolutely That was This is a matchup that I think Syracuse clearly feels they can exploit But once he picks up his dribble and Shaw keeps his feet theres nothing really that he can do And Freeman music has to recognize that and get the ball out You know in that situation something you throw it to somebody they throw it right back You can start again Six turnovers now by Freeman Syracuse back in the zone and gives it back to Payne D3 Nothing but net for Donald Hans Jr That is a big shot for Ham cheering personally and for the Eagles Syracuse timeout applause Well hand is only making 22 of his threes this year but it seems like if hes in rhythm the shot just looks better But I think thats true of anybody but this is a situation where hes has a chance to step into it And again hes too good a player to stay in this kind of a slump But you can understand if youre Syracuse he wants to shoot it from out there Well go ahead So now if youre Syracuse do you go back to Freeman up three with a basketball Well this is an interesting situation I think you know if you have a mismatch that you can exploit but they what exploited it once out of three times And so I think now you got to get other guys involved You know go to him later in the shot clock Move the ball move the defense see if you can try to create a height mismatch rather than just a matchup that youre comfortable with Well we just saw Nate Kings He has been the big scoring option in the second half for the Orange He has scored a careerhigh 20 points that matches Fred Paynes 20 points Syracuse looking to win its fourth game in a row and improve to 4 one in conference play BC trying to avoid what would be a fifth consecutive loss Freeman Kyle Starling Kings and George on the floor for the Orange They put it in Kings hands and he delivers again What a great job inside by Pile just blocking the way You know he screened off Hastings prevented him from getting the block shot Pay went to the floor and Kings is called for the foul Got to be careful Well Kyle just does a great job screening off on the inside and Forte is reluctant to come all the way in Forte really needs to step in and stop that play force him to kick it to the corner And in spite of the fact that Hastings whos fourth in the ACC in blocks per game was the help defender Kings managed to put the ball in Well Kyle got Hastings on his back applause one of six upper classmen on this roster Fred Payne who Earl Grant says is kind of our de facto captain Its a onep possession game Orange with it up by three Now you dont want to get conservative if youre Syracuse but you also dont want to take a bad shot early Forte takes the basketball away George then returns cheering the favor cheering and I believe that George stepped out of bounds They may take another look but Mark Shur was the official closest to the end and I believe thats what he called Well you cant you cant take the officials cannot take a look at an out of bounds play on their own Well you saw the right foot did hit the baseline Well and they were just looking at the iPad over at the Syracuse bench and they said they wanted a they wanted a ch they wanted a challenge You know there all the all the blue sweatuits over there were looking down and finally they all jumped up at the same time and twirled their finger cheering He stepped out of bounds Theres no question about that Where theres a question in my mind is how much time do they have to put back on the clock because a few seconds ticked off before the whistle blew You know who else jumped up over near the Syracuse bench Carmelo Anthony Oh lets take a look here Hes out of bounds right there 549 it looks like is on the clock So whats on the clock right now is 527 So I think whats going to happen here Boston uh Syracuse is going to lose the challenge Its going to be BCs ball and theyre going to have to put a couple of seconds back on the clock That is true Thats how it is See thats a problem with wearing those fluorescent shoes Maybe if youre wearing white shoes they cant tell laughter Have to review The call is confirmed on the floor It will be gold basketball and loses their ability to challenge So you may have heard the official Adam Flor who came over and explained where we stand Dan thats the way the rule is You lose your you lose your challenge it costs you a timeout And now you dont have any more challenges left You can see on that steel frame Mark Schneer the official on the top of the screen was in perfect position to make that call So heres your game summary Kings with a careerhigh 22 points Red Payne goes over 20 for the fourth consecutive game Turnovers have been an issue for the Orange and the Eagles have taken advantage time and again Its not just turnovers Boston College has nine steals hand pain and Forte who has been playing heavy minutes off the bench today for BC and playing well working on George Khaki for three and Freeman pulls cheering it down 10sec difference between game and shot clock George double team gets rid of it Freeman cheering pass knocked out of bounds He had Stling alone in the corner and couldnt get it to him And he almost traveled Thats great pressure by Boston music College And obviously in that situation if you dont foul right away now you dont want to foul at all Timeout Syracuse their last of the ball game And its their its their last time out because they they had to use a timeout when they lost that challenge So Boston College with two timeouts remaining Syracuse without And Adrien Autry obviously understands they do not want to come up So Syracuse breaks the huddle with George Kings Freeman Kyle and Starling Now the other guy whos been really good for you whether youre shooting threes or driving to the basket is Kings So Syracuse has some options But Steager is matched up against Freeman So theres that size advantage we were talking about Stling gets it into Freeman and they give up the foul and well send Freeman to the line to shoot one and one But if youre going to send somebody to the line I dont think you choose Freeman No Hes a perfect five for five so far today The shooting percentage on the year over 80 But its a oneonone Its only a one and one cheering and he missed it Long rebound out of bounds Whos got it Boston College The applause gamble to foul pays off It really does And I Well they decided in that timeout that if Syracuse scored they didnt really have enough time so they would foul Put the Orange on the free throw line No probably Now keep in mind it doesnt matter I mean the officials called it Boston College Ball and Syracuse doesnt have a chap out of Legacy School of Sports Sciences in Houston Hes a Louisiana native He attended Lincoln Prep in Grahamling Louisiana Then Sunrise Christian Academy He has shot it very well today Four of seven from beyond the arc if they go for three And he is by far I mean its not even close with the guys on the court by far the best threepoint shooter out there Would you go for three here or just take the best shot You take the best shot then you do it quickly cheering Shaw inbounds Forte into the front court 10 seconds left in regulation Han ties it cheering 5 seconds 4 seconds BC will get a chance on the Heath to win it and we are headed to overtime screaming at the end of the game If youre up three you foul But you dont want to do that with like 10 seconds left Well weve talked about the fact that with their threegame winning streak Syracuse has been snipping the bubble Joe Lonardi had it has them on his latest brackettology but a loss here at Boston College and that would go away for a while Huge stakes for Syracuse Boston College looking for its first league win Freeman Kyle has it Goes up strong Missed it Kings had it for a moment but Boston College comes away with it Payne dumps it off and the jammer by Shaw cheering applause Shaws defense against Freeman has been a key here down the stretch and now he gets the big dunk because he runs BC with its first lead in 11 minutes of game time Well Boston Collins is able to secure the rebound and and Shaw hes just he starts to run He knows hes got an opportunity and he just keeps running and hes all the way down the lane Theres nobody there to stop him cheering Now were still in oneonone with a bad free throw shooter at the line That was a thing of beauty cheering for Aiden Shaw Our seventh lead change and then the foul as William cheering came the third at the line applause Lets go Eagles Lets go Eagles Lets go Eagles Lets go Eagles Hand turns down the screen Lost it out of bounds but itll stay at this end with Boston College Well now after hitting those two big shots hand looked like he was trying to be more aggressive that time Take the ball to the basket Well this is the fourth time Dan Boston College has gone to overtime this year Theyre 0 and3 in OT and have been outscored in the extra sessions A combined 4427 Up by two here looking to build on it Forte out the window cheering Its a fourpoint Boston College lead cheering cheering Kings inside to Freeman Faked right went left The finger roll makes it a twopoint game Thats what theyre trying to do is get him operational and inside A little bit more success when they had him out on the perimeter Hand off of two feet under control No DC on the offensive glass keeps possession applause Now that was a tough shot but he threw about everybody on the Syracuse defense so theres nobody available to block out Jaden Hastings now with 12 rebounds today How about the finish Hastings on the receiving end of the long pass How about the pass Fred Payne just very patient coming off that screen Wow cheering cheering George to the post for Freeman screaming Blocked Boston cheering Colleges defense continues to be the difference and they immediately turn it into two points at the other end cheering Heat Heat Well the defense continues for Boston College The block shot and that hand with his dad enjoying it courtside BCs got its largest lead of the night here in overtime at 7266 Boston College able their ability to come back time music and time again has been very impressive Well BC just seems to be a step quicker They have wanted the basketball Well just a great screen by Hastings We said hes got 12 point He got 10 points 12 rebounds but he also set a great screen Now heres Shaw Shaw ran the court got the dunk Heres Forte Hes been very very good all music game long driving the ball to the basket and pain both with both with his passing and his shooting and Hastings just continues around the basket to play very hard and be effective And those two guys music Hastings and Shaw have combined to get 17 points Theyre not accustomed to that out of those two guys Hastings also has a careerhigh 12 rebounds three of them coming in OT and Hastings excuse me Shaw also has eight rebounds So theyve got 17 points and 20 rebounds between them cheering Kings down the lane He draws the foul Nate Kings has been the answer offensively in the second half and now overtime for Coach Autry And one of the dangers that you have when you concentrate completely on going to one guy is the other guys arent involved anymore And so Kings was playing very very well but thats been his first basket in a while Its hard for BC Theyre shot blockers Theyre going after it But last thing you want to do is put somebody on the line Now BC has Hastings and Shaw cheering both among the conference leaders in block shots Kings with three big points cheering extending his careerhigh to 25 points But now if youre Syracuse you dont have to take any crazy chances but you have to dig in defensively get a stop and rebound the ball which is theyve had theyve had a problem doing here recently Forte in pain in the back court for Boston College Forte attacks and gets the whistle And so the 59 foul shooter will head to the line Hes 46 today But hes hes been really good Hes sure driving the ball into the lane He he lost his starting job back in early December but he has played starters minutes in place of Luca Taves here today and he has delivered applause Well Taves gives them the threepoint shooting element He gives him strength and the ability to drive the ball to the basket And thats where Boston College has really done a great job particularly in this overtime The Eagles have four players in double figures today applause 90 seconds left in OT You got to score for Syracuse Doesnt matter two or three but you got to score King flashes to the ball Despite being defended that way he still gets to his left hand and Payne is called for the foul Just the second on Fred Payne And so Kings will go back to the line Hes made all four of his free throws today Well were in the double bonus now obviously He say hes got cheering two Hes one of the Syracuse shooters who have struggled from the line who you expect to be better He has a nice stroke He shoots very well from beyond the threepoint line The number on the right there today five for five makes more sense music to me when I see him shoot the ball than 54 Hes got 27 including the last five for Syracuse here in overtime Pass applause Chance of lets go orange cheering here in Chestnut Hill Lots of Syracuse fans and alumni all around New England making an annual trip here to Chestnut Hill when the Orange come to town Nice Kings is trying to play good defense but you know keeps the ball away from Payne But he was just all over cheering Kane wasnt sure that one was going in applause The shooter is the first to know if the shot is off and he started to try and go where he thought the rebound might go Clearly they dont know all the time cheering He stood his ground after the second knowing that one was pure So Kyle gets out of the game and Betsy comes in because Syracuse is looking for some offense here Boston College is going to pressure in the back court Betsy has not scored today but last game he scored 18 his careerhigh Inside they go to Freeman and he throws it away Hes got a foul cheering And so Payne will head back to the line The 11th Boston College steel of the day And Freeman had the ball inside and he was trying to throw it to Betsy but it was just a bad pass Freemans seventh turnover today Well thats been the story Boston College Payne misses that but they have 21 points off of Syracuse turnovers and the margin is 218 So theres very little doubt about why this game turned the way it did Bane gets the second applause Hes got to go very quickly now And down by six Starling lays it up and in That was quick to get those two points back Now Boston College trying to play keep away You got to foul immediately And there it comes Freeman applause and Kings bottled up hand in a situation where its four points You go for the steal you try to get the trap but once they start the ball up the court I just dont think you can wait Well Syracuse fouls hand at 70 this year In spite of that hitch he gets the first Well but that hitch drew Nathan George into the lane and it doesnt matter But I mean the last thing you want to do for Syracuse now is have a lane violation and take away a missed free throw One of the officials Pat Driscoll immediately came in and talked to Nate George about that in between foul shots Perfect switch Boston College again up six Starling No Long rebound to the corner Its Syracuse ball Boston College looks like theyre going to challenge No they decided not to Boston College has been dominated in this rivalry winning only once against Syracuse in the last seven years They played from behind for the most part here today cheering and they are on the verge of taking down their old Big East rival applause They hung around and they hung around and finally they got some offense going cheering and applause This is the largest lead today for Boston College Syracuse have gone on the road and won at Georgia Tech one at Pittsburgh but their third conference road trip is going to have them heading back to Central New York with a loss Starling No cheering And now Boston College will dribble it out applause The biggest shot made by Donald Han to force overtime And the
