officials tonight and this one is underway Itll be Duke Ball Caleb Foster coming back for another year running the point for Duke And at times Kaden Boozer Cam Boozers younger brother Theres Boozer right away off a backpack Just too easy Patrick Gumbbo with the assist So many times Dukes going to look to screen Boozer down into the low post Put Kansas in a position to switch The dunga defended by Gumba Cameron Boozer finds himself on Trey White at the moment although they are switching a lot Cole Rosario into Bedonga Nice little shovel pass to Bryson Tiller but he misses the short jumper Bada is a lefthander He looks to get back to that left hand as often as possible Does it here and finishes If he can score inside where that gives Kansas a post presence that can be really good for the JayHawks But a three at the other end for the Blue Devils to put them on top Isaiah Evans had 23 in his first game against Texas Only 29 points in the game since but thats a good start for a guy that can get hot in a hurry Bunga tried the handoff Almost broken up there by Dom Sar And Bonga knows what to do with it as Sar went for the steal couldnt come up with it But Fedunga is explosive Played behind Hunter Dickinson last year for the JayHawks and looks like a much improved player and obviously getting bigger minutes as a starter this year Duma not going to go out and guard Gunga And Gunga is a good passer Foster and its taken away by Rosario Not sure anybody plays harder than T Rosario Bill Sels a big fan He likes Tiller too Bryson Tiller the freshman from Atlanta who can really shoot the ball from the perimeter as well Tough to get organized after you turn the ball over and Kansas gets out in transition Evans thought about it Little bounce pass into Gumba Boozer turns it over Twoonone Kansas Rosario to White and a good start for the JayHawks Boy thats beautiful transition after the turnover That ball never hit the floor Just went between White and Rosario for the easy bucket after doing something hard on defense Trey White the senior from Dallas playing for his fourth team USC Louisville Illinois And now in his senior year a Kansas JHawk Little upscreen screen for the screener Double team and Boozer passes right out of it to the diving dumbba That was really well handled off the double team Boy he didnt hesitate at all Did he got rid of it in a heartbeat He doesnt project as a a teenager the way he plays The three from the wing wont go for Tiller What a rebound by White is coming in from the weak side wing Even though youre on the perimeter you have to lay a body on somebody You got to be a hit first defender Good energy in the early going in this one Melvin Council Jr rises up for the jumper Cant hit the transfer from St Bonaventure And back come the Blue Devils looking for the lead Cam Boozer is such an outstanding rebounder Foster to Gumba Evans in the corner Gun by a Boozer who can shoot the three Shot clock inside 10 Wide open in the corner is Foster and hell knock it down Cam Boozer just cut to the basket It wasnt that hard of a cut but that helped draw the defense and left Caleb Foster wide open in the corner Gunga trying to drive on Gungba Thea lays it in to tie it up Boy with that pass out I thought Isaiah Evans was going to take that the other way but that just opened up the lane for that drive You help up youre giving up a bucket Tied at 10 415 into this one Evans off a screen Hesitates left it short and down with it White Kansas running again White forcing the issue and lays it in Nobody stopped the ball And after Trey White got it he just took it himself There are a number of players that can just rip and run for this Kansas team and thats the way they need to play They got to get easy things in transition They dont want to have to grind it out in the half court for 40 minutes Dumbbush steps out again to help out on the offense Boozer defended by Badunga Strong into the paint but too strong off the glass Good job by Bunga to challenge that without fouling council whos lightning quick misses wide left on the runner and back come the Blue Devils Boozer for three Thats just not the shot that you want in transition Get that anytime Council using the bedonga screen Thatll go and a foul What a beautiful job to use that ball screen get the defender throughout the course of the year He wants to be 100 when he comes back The Naymith High School player of the year a season ago the top ranked recruit coming into college basketball this year and potentially the number one pick in the NBA draft Although Cameron Deoozer AJ Debonsson and maybe a couple of others will have something to say about that Darren Peterson is smooth Good pass Posture in the corner misses the three Strong rebound by Tiller Bryson Tiller has really had some good minutes early on in this season for Kansas He can really shoot it Remember against North Carolina in the Dean Dome he had four threes in that game before fouling out He can really stretch the floor and play pick and pop with him Thats Jaden Dawson number one with the ball A transfer from Lyola Chicago cheering Council gets out of trouble finds Dawson Theyve still got some time White lobs it inside Donga with Malik Brown on him Throws it through the hands of Tiller Thats the first turnover for Kansas in this game And one of the things that made that play for Duke was that hard hedge on the left side of the floor by Malik Brown who leads this Duke team in limited minutes in deflection Got great hands defensively John Shier feels he has at least two elite defenders Malik Brown and the freshman Dame Sar Brown whips it crosscourt to Nicholas Jmena The pass another member of the freshman class And a good cut there by Brown to lay it in As soon as he catches the ball he looks middle and hes got vision of the other side of the floor When the double comes hes able to pass out of it White doubled and finds Dawson Duke doing a better job with helpside defense Kansas unable to turn the corner get into the lane Shot clock starting to run down White gets a three off around and out Tipped into the hands of Kaden Boozer Hell go all the way but bothered from behind Its out of bounds and still Duke ball Cam Boozer can operate off the lane When he catches the ball three steps off the lane he immediately looks middle and sees Malik Brown just cutting right to the front of the rim Thats just an excellent pass and thats why he leads Duke in assists as a big guy Hes got two already tonight Hes only got two points one for three from the floor very early in this one though as he gets good position underneath Cant lay it in cheering Boy reminiscent of that opening half of his season against Texas where Cam Boozer couldnt get anything going but had a great second half A great look from the corner for Dawson to extend the Kansas lead Foster coming off a tough year a season ago but almost looks rejuvenated a bigger role John Sh says hes come in this year great and he looks to have a big impact on this Duke team this year Well especially with Kaden Boozer in the lineup and those two playing together Duke just not doing a good job in transition to get out to shooters and Dawson able to really step into that in rhythm But when Caleb Fosters on the floor with Kaden Boozer that allows Foster to be more aggressive as a scorer and thats really his nature Cam Boozer at the line Some guys are very skilled but maybe dont have that relentless drive about them Some guys have the drive maybe dont have the skill He appears to have a whole lot of both Well hes hes smart and hes competitive but hes really powerful as well Reminds you a little bit of Paulo Banker maybe even a little more skilled at this point in his development if you compare them both in their first five games But John Sh has talked about him like you dont need to show all your different skills out there Just focus on dominating and hes got the type of game where he can dominate basketball games How much fun is Carlos Boozer having watching his two sons play for Duke Boozer had three great years in Durham won a national championship and a 13year NBA career Well whats great is is Cam especially is going to make so much money in the future Hes going to be off the family cell phone plan earlier El Marco Jackson misses the midrange jumper Jackson the red shirt sophomore who missed all of last year due to injury Amena gets loose and lays in the reverse But what a terrific move Got stopped along the baseline but was able to get his shoulders past the defender get all the way to the other side of the rim A 68 freshman from Los Angeles a McDonalds AllAmerican Trey White is off to a nice start tonight And thats the kind of freedom that I think Trey White and Melvin Council Jr need to play with in this game Kansas needs their scoring without Darren Peterson in the lineup Little bump there but they play on Evans trying to drive on White and the shooter gets all the way to the rim to lay it in And thats been a big difference in Isaiah Evans this season versus last Last year he focused mostly on shooting This year hes driving it more getting to the free throw line A much stronger drive on that last possession got the advantage was able to score through the contact and hell be able to complete have a chance to complete the end one when we come back Threepoint play Isaiah Evans made 62 threes last season for Duke Shot over 40 And remember that amazing first half he had against Auburn Hes just a flamethrower but hes really added to his game Hes thin but hes gotten much stronger from last year to this year Rosario off to Bedonga Kansas trying to get some back cuts Great cut there by Rosario Really good ball reversal And going against the pressure those back cuts can open up And Cole Rosario man he is a really good offensive rebounder with 16 points against Texas AM Corpus Christi A guy who reclassified as well right Yeah I mean hes a strong kid Brown has it poked away by Rosario Council doing the lion share of the ball handling with Peterson out tonight Now a touch for Badonga Crosscourt in the corner The three wont go for Dawson Hit one from that very same spot just a couple of minutes ago That was a good crosscourt pass by Vonga but fouled Did not get the call and he got hit on the arm Rosario pulls up for a transition three and Jimea the rebound for Duke Aiden Boozer off to Malik Brown And Mena from the corner a little bit short on the three Look at the speed on councel Funga over the back on Gumba But here comes Duke in transition Brown for three Boy and up and down they go but nobody can make a shot right now Rosario crossing over on Brown Almost lost it Now he did And its out of bounds to Kansas Evans thought he had a breakaway but couldnt corral it As we now check in and listen into the last title for John Sher and the Blue Devils Big part of this is is trans is transition All right You dont have a man in transition Camboozer gets it out top and as soon as he loses his balance Isaiah Evans is the only one back in a twoonone break Ball never hit the floor Kansas lays it in Those are some of the pain points that Kansas has had because of their transition game Keyed off some Duke mistakes Pass break points 93 as you can see in favor of the JayHawks Cameron Boozer back into the game Off to Gunga Boy Dawson really wrapping up Dame Sar not letting him get free And now another turnover Its Dawson The love and the finish for Bunga And Kansas has taken advantage of Duke turnovers for easy buckets And without Darren Peterson in the lineup Kansas is generating offense off of its defense music JayHawk faithful here in New York City loving what theyre seeing without their best player The JayHawks have a sixpoint lead on the Blue Devils Knicks to so much great college basketball that has taken place here over the decades Always a great place a special place to watch a game They had WWE here last night Thats right Cameron Boozer not giving up any ground and scores over a couple of JayHawks in traffic But right now Kansas has been scoring off of Dukes miscues Its 113 in fast break points for the JayHawks Thats been the difference Darren Harris has checked into the game now for Duke Number eight a sophomore from Hearnden Virginia who looks to have a bigger role this year than he did a year ago Councel pulling the trigger after Caleb Foster went under that screen Boy look at Domar Had it knocked away at the end and its out of bounds to Kansas A freshman from Italy What does he bring to this Blue Devils team Well hes an excellent defender Great length Hes got a 7ft wingspan Made a good move here but just cradled it And Dawson was able to knock that ball away But Dames Sar hes got a really good basketball IQ and a really good defender He can switch multiple positions Got great hands Gets deflections and he can make an open three Council at the point for Kansas Dawson good minutes off the bench What can they get out of El Marco Jackson Again missed all of last year with injury A former McDonalds AllAmerican They love some offensive contributions from him Right now Trey White has been very aggressive and it is paying off for him Yeah Putting his head down and driving went into the contact to draw that foul Trey White played at Louisville played at Illinois Hes averaged 10 points and five rebounds for his career and can really stretch the floor as a perimeter shooter and a really good cutter as well applause cheering The Charleston Classic is back this Friday on the ESPN networks and also on the allnew ESPN app Kansas by six nearly 13 minutes into the game They got to get the ball to Boozer and let him let him touch it Immediate double He finds Star who finds Harris who gets fouled Got tripped up Itll go on El Marco Jackson Boy that pass crosscourt and then the pass out really allowed Darren Harris to attack that close out with a little shot fake and drive John Shy is asking for that to be a shooting foul but the foul was called on the floor You can see Sh motioning He was in the act of shooting He does not win the argument Wide open Harris cheering Namba runs it down and throws it off the leg of White out of bounds Well that was a beautiful screen for the screener action to get Harris wide open Hes so worried about Cam Boozer That little pin in screen got Harris a wide open look Right now Trey White is defending Boozer Hes given up a lot of size but he is certainly matching up with him in terms of tenacity Inside Gumba the follow but no foul before Theres Boozer with that passing again Once that double team because hes off the post when he catches it it takes that double a little while to get to him and you just have to make yourself available And Gumba gets to the front of the rim just too difficult for OMarco Jackson to get Primary center physical athletic guy good defender Theyre going to be out be without Bunga for a while And thats always an issue for Florunga is avoiding fouls and and trying to avoid the cheap ones Youre you know playing the playing the post youre going to get some fouls but you want to avoid the cheap fouls Sometimes giving up a B you can get a bucket back you cant get a foul back and especially with the bedonga out Although Tillers a big guy Duke is a big team The shortest player on the Duke roster is Kaden Boozer at 64 They might not be quite as big as they were last year but theyre close Yeah they do have really good positional size and really good length Council looking inside Tilly Can he back down Brown Kicks it back out to Council Floats up a prayer Not close Foster still going and lays it in Boy did a really nice job of using Malik Brown especially applause just putting his head down and barreling music right into the lane Watch how Caleb Foster uses Malik Brown gets that screen just goes right around him and kisses it off the glass music Beautiful Chicago and Indianapolis Itll be in Chicago next year Same four teams You just play a different school each time So Kansas matching up with Duke in this one And again Kansas 3 and one against Duke in the classic Tough shot A good offensive rebound by Tiller White has played at four high major programs been a starter at all four in his four years in college And now we got a Duke foul away from the ball Duke got caught on a switch there Caleb Foster on Tiller And Kansas has to keep mixing in some back cuts to open things up and go against Dukes pressure because Dukes been able to pressure the ball Theyre not letting Kansas turn the corner Duke switching everything on the perimeter White into the paint takes a bump and will head back to the free throw line Uber aggressive all night long Yeah Trey White created that contact and Darren Harris saying Hey it was straight up and down He just went right into his body under his arm to draw that contact Looked offense initiated John Gaffne the official who made the call gave the signal that the arms of the defender came down enough to warrant a foul call So its right at the line for two number two John Shider did not play in the Champions Classic His last year was 2009 2010 and the first year of the classic was November of 2011 A co an assistant coach and now a head coach for many years But is that the first time in his life hes been too old to have played something It sure doesnt look like coaching his age No he looks as youthful as he did when he got the job Thats cuz he is youthful had an outstanding career national championship one of Yeah hes one of the underrated stars in Duke history Cam Boozer passing out of that double team Hes able to get it crosscourt cuz he can see over the defense and hes got such a good such good passing instincts You know the double comes then you got to close out and then Sar drives that second close out You saw Darren Harris do that a little bit earlier in this first half but its all it all results from Cameron Boozer drawing an additional defender and then they play threeon two on the backside Sar from Italy played for FC Barcelona going to get an outstanding defender Misses the free throw but Duke comes up with the offensive rebound and now Cole Rosario commits a foul by Malik Brown just not giving up in that second slot Such a tough block out when Kansas is playing a small lineup Tiller is usually in there playing the four Now hes got to play the five with Bunga with those two fouls They do have another big guy Paul Embia a 7 foot center 245 lbs but he has not gotten a ton of it so far early in the season Another transition opportunity but they cannot convert Duke again mishandling the ball I wouldnt necessarily call that a forced turnover Its just a question of being stronger with the ball against physical defense Six turnovers now committed by the Blue Devils to just two by the JayHawks And you can see Council just kind of regretting that whole sequence He knows they should have had a basket there Boozer initiating the contact Blocked from behind by White It stays with Duke It looked like it went off Whites leg but a terrific block from behind Boozer went immediately away from the double team baseline And thats just a really welltimed block by Trey White to save a basket Shot fake Boozer Now the drive and a foul Yeah you have to stay down on that shot fake When youre guarding Boozer and he rises up for that just be second to leave the floor to get pressure on him If youre first off the floor hes going to be gone Tiller his first Boozer to the line A place he figures to get to a lot this season and so far on the young season coming into the game tonight 79 cheering Hes coming off a 35point game against Indiana State where he also had 12 rebounds five assists three blocks and three steals applause Pretty historic night for a freshman for anybody really cheering and applause They have tied it up Lets see how Kansas responds Roll replace action That balls got to go into the post quicker Tiller over Brown cheering wont go Boozer the rebound Sar now Harris and another foul And the Blue Devils getting back to the free throw line again Boy Dukes done a nice job when theyre shot faking against this Kansas defense and then driving it You know the shot fake is getting the defense off balance and once you get past it now youre in help and in scramble Its quite a pair of shoes Darren Harris is wearing there Sparkly Yep Well folks tomorrows ESPN NBA double header features the Rockets against the Cavs at 7 Eastern and then the Knicks and the Mavericks in the late game The NBA Countdown crew will tip off the coverage at 630 Eastern The Knicks playing without Jaylen Brunson last night lost to Miami Hes out with an ankle injury Miles McBride hit 25 but not enough as you look at the five starters for the Blue Devils a season ago all of whom were taken in the NBA draft And how about the kind of start that Coniple was off to in the NBA They had 32 the other night when they played against Milwaukee cheering and applause And the Canipple family had the whole Charlotte Hornets team over for dinner Rosario no Offensive rebound for Embia seeing his first action tonight Keeping it alive White thought about the three decides against it Boy Browns a good defender His hands are just magnificent White sizing him up and again takes a bump and count the basket And thats a play that would not have counted that basket last year But because it was continuous motion just another way of saying continuation its an end one Another strong move from Trey White just creating something for himself getting the angle and going right off the glass Boozer thats a pretty good starting lineup Played a lot of years in the NBA Trey White misses the free throw Hes still the high score in the game with a dozen Duke going into a horn set right away Kayen Boozer back into the game Corner three is short for Sar Got White just grabbing Bunga trying to block him out More of a face guard block out with an arm wrapped around him number two on white So itll be Gunga going to the line now for the Blue Devils for one and one Gungba looks like he has taken a big step forward this year Yeah he hes played really well He was in really good condition and hes just a skilled big guy thats got obviously size but really good feel His footwork is good and hes been very physical to start this season Hes also a capable passer that can step out and hit an open three Bill Self will take White out of the game Jamari McDow a red shirt sophomore from Houston He sat out last year back with the program this year He comes in for the first time tonight Just dont want to risk White picking up that third foul But the issue is going to be wheres wheres the scoring going to come from with this group No bedonga No white And Guna makes one of two Really need to move the ball from side to side here before attacking And if Emma is going to get anything its going to have to be wedging somebody in so he can throw over the top McDow called for the travel This may be a group of five that Bill Self has never contemplated having on the court at the same time And as you said where will the offense come from It might have to be a guy like Rosario Council Well theyre going to have to do it with their defense Yeah And the fouls have been piling up So every common foul Dukes going to be shooting two free throws going into halftime Gungba Yes He had Jamari McDow on him Thats a mismatch down in the low post and he was smart enough just take it and shoot right over him Its really Embia and four guards in there right now for the JayHawks as McDow almost traveled again He was fortunate he was bobbling it Rosario for three and Evans might have gotten a piece of that and gets the slam at the other end How about that pass from Cam Boozer all the way down the floor to a sprinting Isaiah Evans Its an 112 run right now for Duke Isaiah Evans after getting maybe a piece of that shot just takes off and Camboozer just threw a bullet to him That was just about a chess pass and right on the button for an easy bucket going the other way back onto the floor for the JayHawk and hope he can avoid committing a foul in the last 2 and 12 minutes He misses the three Evans had a good look in transition at a three Back comes Council Council uses the screen pulls up hit Evans the rebound It was a good look Gun dropped coverage and Council just pulled right up Just couldnt knock it down And you can see Council struggling to get the ball to the basket One for eight tonight Its such a mismatch on Gumba Rosarios got to guard him Sar for three Gumba hits the deck Here comes Council Rosarios down as well But Rosario really fought Gumba on the glass Good shot fake and a foul on Kaden Boozer Kansas has really got some mismatch problems on the defensive end Theyre so much smaller when they go into gun But what but Rosarios got to try to block out you know 610 611 Given up a lot of size not just height but pounds because Bungas got two Hillers got two as well So theyve got Ambia in there but guys like Rosario and White defending bigger players into Nick White too strong off the glass and a weak side rebound by Brown Embia fouls him and Malik Brown will go to the line But Duke has been living at the foul line for the second part of this first half I wish we could say second quarter We need to be able to say second quarter sometime soon Rules committee I I think the day will come where where where that happens Will we live to see it Uh I cant confirm it But I think its coming A lot of people in favor of that right Well the reason you have to have it is you have to be able to reset the team fouls at the end of the first and third quarter Reduces the number of free throws the game closed Exactly You know mens college basketball is literally the only game of basketball played in the world that doesnt have quarters And we ought to alert the rest of the world on what we know that they dont sixpoint lead Duke has now attempted 14 free throws to just six for Kansas Kansas trying to lift up this Duke defense but Duke doing a better job of guarding the ball Switching one through five with this lineup Dawson misses the three Boozer the rebound As we move into the final minute here in the first half dominated early by Kansas but late by Duke Evans no follow Yes Way too easy for Nicholas Amenya Amen Just came in from the right wing Got a block out of Malik Brown but that wasnt good enough because he could just ball right all the way to the basket to put that in All Duke since Kansas got in foul trouble Shot clock at 10 White for three They needed it Needed that in a big way cheering Where would Kansas be without Trey White He has been outstanding in this first half And thats why Bill Self had to bring him in take that risk of those two fouls Shot clock turned off here at the end of the first half Cameron Boozer up top Evans launches HITS WHAT A SHOT by Isaiah Evans Just ghosted out of that pick and roll applause and faded right to the threepoint line Boy what a what an ending to the first half for Duke a 175 run to pull that off keep the important guys out of foul trouble and get right back in this game as the second half is underway over the State Farm CHAMPIONS CLASSIC White looking inside Badonga Good defense by Gunga but Badonga solves it with a reverse slam Well he pivoted out Looked like he was going to pass the ball back out and Gunga changed his positioning But instead of protecting the basket hes trying to take away the pass And that just opened up the lane Well Vungas got to be careful He had two hands wrapped around Gumba for a moment The last thing Bill Self will live with right now is a bad third foul on one of his key players Whenever youre guarding a guy like Badunga and hes got the ball there you got to protect the basket You try to take away that pass who cares if he passes it out But that opened up the lane for him to pivot to the other side of the bucket and dunk it on him Boozer again passes out of the double team Good hustle by Badonga but it winds up in the hands of Sar cheering gunned by the flush Kansas just being put in rotation and then ultimately in scramble when they didnt get that loose ball and very unselfish basketball at the offensive end for the Blue Devils They could really use Tiller on the floor and his shooting ability as well as Gongos called for a foul Boozer put good pressure on Tiller with the ball because otherwise he could have just fed it right into Bedonga who had an angle All he had to do was throw it up to the square and he could go get it Vonga hands it back to Council White the high score in the game Councel again Dawson gets his man in the air and hits the Jay Boy that shot fake made the entire play You got a ball reversal and then you shot fake the close out and it opens it up Really nice play by Dawson and by Kansas Booer open for three Count it But Duke has proven throughout this early season to be a second half team And Cam Boozer remember he had a goose egg in that first game against Texas Came out at 15 in the second half A guy who can beat you inside and out Over the top Chiller Falls down The ball was underneath him and he couldnt get to it and Duke comes out with it Sar and White a rebound in traffic Boy good ball movement But Boozer should have taken that himself Look at the speed and the finish by Melvin Council Jr applause and cheering Bill Self was talking about Melvin Council Jr and his speed today at practice And the other thing he said is you cant wipe the smile off his face From Rochester New York again a transfer from St Bonaventure as Evans was fouled on the turnaround Just made a really good cut And that that is something I think that can take Duke to the next level is if they become a better cut Theyre a good cutting team but they can become a better cutting team And Camboozer if you give him that open shot he can make it But that speed of Melvin Council Jr reminds you of Taon Taylor a little bit when he played at Kansas Just jets So becoming a better cutting team is that knowing when to cut or cutting with more intent Whats the next level Well its both But but its you know some people call it a sacrificial cut but its an unselfish cut cuz sometimes you cut without getting the ball and that opens up opens up other opportunities for teammates But especially when you got a passer and and hes not the only good passer on this team but you got a passer like Cameron Boozer you know if youre really good cutting hes going to find you Duke able to switch so many positions on the floor Boy its physical inside between Bunga and Gumba Councel finds a little room finds Badonga who lays it in Just the threat of Bunga when he rolls to the basket and then you drive and he moves to the front of the rim and he can dunk it with power over you Evans turns the corner No look pass into the corner and Dom Sar buries a three Boy Duke does such a good job of spacing the floor And Sar over in that left corner was ready to shoot when the ball arrived Sar is now eight for 18 shooting threes on the season A wild one there from Bedonga Foster Oh great hustle by Sar coming in from the weak side and hes fouled It looked like it was Dawson With the floor spaced its awfully difficult to get a block out of a wing shooter when they get a run up and you have to turn and go find somebody and lay a body on them And it cant be just you know youre going to turn your back and try to do it You just got to go hit them Jaden Dawson becomes the first player with three fouls on either side tonight Boozer into the lane Left it short with the left Battling with the rebound Cant come up with it cheering But Kansas turns it back over Youre an NBA player and then your kids start beating you Thats when you know theyre pretty good And of course Carlos a great part of our uh crew at the ACC network Does great work Really good work Evans on the drive out of bounds to Kansas What does Kansas have to do to get going offensively Theyve got to move the ball from one side of the floor to the other When Kansas is at its best its getting downhill drawing help and then playing out of it But Dukes done a really good job of pressuring the ball Theyre switching most screens and exchanges And with this lineup they can switch at all five positions White keeping them in it Whites been the majority of this Kansas offense especially from threes Knocked down a couple threes in this game The one thing Kansas has to do is they got to keep Duke off the free throw line Camboozer over Tiller and Tiller down with the rebound Did a good job defensively Yeah Made him fade away and thats not what Camboozer wants to do He wants to get into your body where he can draw a foul Boozer with 10 But as you can see just three of nine from the floor The Dunga saying it was off a Duke player and Bill Self is saying the same thing but I dont think theyre going to win the argument unless they challenge Yeah Well Bill Self pleading with the officials Both he and Bedonga made the same motion as if it hit the back of Camboozer but dont know that it did Yeah it didnt look like it there Amena back door cut the kick eventually out to Kaden Boozer for three and again Cam Boozer with the assist Councel with a burst of speed and fouled by Kaden Boozer That cut by Jimea was really a good one Set the screen slipped out of it and was able to get it to Boozer That extra pass Boozer to Boozer Thats happened more than a few times over the years Cole Rosario back into the game for Kansas as Dawson sits Been a pretty quiet night for Rosario One for four two points Gunga to a cutting tiller whos fouled You when Darren Peterson is in the Kansas lineup hes out with that hamstring injury You can really put him and Badunga in a twoman game And because Badunka gets out of ball screens so well he can drag the defense And Peterson is just a magnificent scorer The Blue Devils highlight Sundays ACC Network schedule when they host Howard at Cameron Indoor at 4 Eastern And then Monday night itll be Louisville and Eastern Michigan Both are also available on the allnew ESPN app Howard is coached by Kenny Blakey Played on Dukes national championship teams in 91 and 92 And you corrected me on my pronunciation a year ago of Bison versus Bison right There are those who agree with me but unfortunately for me youre not among them laughter Depends where youre from Anybody listening in Buffalo right now would say Bison because the tripaa baseball team there is the Buffalo Bison But Ill let you win this one Three on bed I think youll let me win that one because nobody cares Literally nobody Eightpoint lead for Duke Brown whips a pass to Cameron Boozer Misses the three and the rebound to Padunga and he needs some help Got to find a guard and he finds White Tiller Boy Bodonga was way up there So was White but they couldnt come down with it Couldnt convert it And its Duke in transition What a pass Jamena short on the three Just grazed the rim Boozer blocked by Badonga cheering What a reaction by Fy Bunga to block that shot White driving on Evans Stumbles Balls still alive That is about the lowest rebound that Trey White will ever get I think he was fully seated when he grabbed that rebound Five to shoot Council and one But what an aggressive drive by Melvin Council Jr got right into the body of the defender and was still able to finish that play with the continuous motion just got the angle went right into his body and returns and Kansas is as close as they have been in a while They are back within six The Blue Devils have missed seven of their eight last eight field goal attempts Multiple subs for both coaches right now Bill Self making sure everybody is matched up The Dooma is going to have a seat at least for a little while That gives him some rest going into the next immediate timeout Fivepoint game applause cheering cheering applause Aen Booer into the front court So whos the goto guy offensively on this unit for Duke The open man cheering Kansas fans making the noise right now Kayen Boozer just goes and gets a bucket when they needed one applause and a kick ball Kaden Boozer obviously doesnt get the height that Cameron does What do you like most about Kaden Boozers game Well he can penetrate and pitch and hes a good passer thats got a really good feel and I really like the way he can change pace change direction And thus far in his early career he makes really good reads out of screen roll situations Council the drive Floater goes And again its a fivepoint game Boy council really doing a good job of cheering using that speed and creating an angle Council wanted a foul The Kansas bench wanted a foul on the screen by Malik Brown but they dont get it And its Kadan Boozer again Theres that change of pace that we were just talking about Instead of blasting off you know really uses pace and just took off at the end to get to the other side of the rim Tiller whips it into the corner The three is short for Rosario Not sure you need to double Tiller down there That just opened up that crosscourt pass cheering Harris Now Brown Good job by Council to take away that handoff Harris with a quick release Misses the three and its Kansas ball Here comes White Kansas is hanging in there right now Councel another burst of speed cheering Talk about a first step cheering This is Fy Bunga getting some extra rest right now cheering applause Momentum cheering swinging in the direction of the Jay Hawks by door cut to Brown What a find He just slipped out of that screen It looked like it was going to be a wide pin and he just slipped right out of it And a beautiful pass by Gumba His second assist of the night Baseline Rosario Tiller for three Amena fouled by Paul Rosario And finally after a long stretch without a whistle well have a timeout on the floor Kansas pushing and pushing but again great execution and ball movement by the Blue Devils when they really needed a basket Ball in the middle of the floor eliminates help Slipping out of the screen for the easy basket game Hes 0 of three from three but he can stretch it Kansas just three for 15 from threepoint range Theres that fade screen action Offensive foul cheering and back over to Kansas Lets listen in to Bill Self in the last Kansas huddle The next four minutes You guys all have the next game Win the next four minutes Its anybodys game Coaches often talk about these fourminute stretches Bob McKillip former coach at Davidson used to talk about it being a 10 you know 10 fourminute rounds Executing what Im asking you to do You know Chris thats thats how a lot of analysts feel with playbyplay people Sorry what you say laughter I heard Chris the follow by Rosario and again it is down to five Well weve talked about what a good offensive rebounder Cole Rosario is and a vertical athlete as well Bill Self is a big fan of his The effort the defense the toughness Saw wide open in the corner What a rebound And Boozer gets it to go and one right over the top with two hands to grab that rebound It was a great screen off that skip pass by Malik Brown for the wideopen three but thats a big time offensive rebound by Cameron Boozer Watch this screen by Malik Brown Picked off Melvin Council Jr Missed it but just a little bump in the back of Bryson Tiller that opened it up for Boozer Now when youre a former Duke player you can name your son after Cameron Indoor Stadium It sounds pretty good Like a Kansas player cant really name his son Allen Field I guess you can call him Allen Sevenpoint lead On a couple of occasions Kansas has gotten it down to five Thats the closest theyve been this half Gunga with three fakes and eventually is fouled by Camboser Just that inside position so tough to block a shot from behind without getting a piece of them But thats the value of Bunga when he is down in that low post and rolls down in the low post He drags a lot of defenders with him and he does a really good job of getting an angle and he can move you up the lane You can throw over the top The Dunggas first trip to the line tonight He is 10 for 12 on the season cheering returning Bill Cell Hall of Famer two national championships coming off by Kansass standards which are obviously incredibly high A couple of down years for the JayHawks A four seed one year a seven the other fifth in the Big 12 one year sixth the other season Obviously the Big 12 loaded again Remains to be seen how the top part of the league sorts itself out this year Yeah for most other teams last two years would be good but for Kansas 44 and 24 the last two years Thats the most losses back to back in season since 1983 As you can see picked sixth in the Big 12 preseason Houston up at the top Just so many good teams Iowa State is going to be really good again and is really good again BYU obviously Yeah Baylor looked really good in their game the other night Council cant turn the corner Tiller will try and reverses it up and in And again theyre within five Yeah just too easy getting to the bucket and then going to the other side without much resistance Hes got a lot of skill No hes a good player Boy Dukes getting some good action off these slips to the basket cheering Sar is fouled and will be at the free throw line when we come back 728 to go here in the second half of the night cap at the State Farm Champions Classic and its a good one Two heavyweights going at it Number four on him Yeah just opening up an angle Hes got to come over from the weak side late just made contact with Dames Sar music and just one of those cheap ones you dont want to pick up and its so difficult you know you want to be aggressive music but at the same time youre better off just letting him go held now by three coaches himself Brad Stevens at Butler and Brad Underwood who did it at Stephen F Austin his first stop pretty good company cheering cheering One of two for Sar and the lead is six applause Kansas needs to get a ball reversal here If they move it from one side to the other theyve gotten some good things Heres Dawson had Vonga for a moment Instead Tiller Council cant get into the paint And Tiller is fouled by Sar Just a strong drive by Tiller Even though Sar was there he just ran him over and put him in a position to foul And both teams are in the bonus with better than seven minutes to go in this game But a lot of that has to do with Kansas moving the ball from side to side And thats one thing that Phil Self preaches is ball reversal ball reversal ball reversal You got to move the defense before you attack it cheering Re down the stretch You got three misses in a row now for Kansas Eight for 12 on the night And yes three misses in a row Boozer step back three Not sure that was a shot right there Theyve held White in check a little bit more here in the second half A good hard hedge by Malik Brown Tough pass into Trafel and Bedonga finishes Talk about playing above the rim cheering It is down to four and the rebound for White Two really quick shots by Duke Woo All kinds of contact and it is going against Tiller Tiller just lowered that shoulder Number four on him applause Boy thats taken some contact to to get a foul And Evans is feeling it Evans has given up a lot of weight in that collision Six minutes to go Evans on top and Gumba with a slam A beautiful cut by Isaiah Evans Councel and what a reverse there by White Boy a great cut and a great finish by Trey White Badunga stepped out there to set that screen Thought Council might have taken off too early to put him in position to foul And a goalending call on Bedonga It hit the backboard first Bill Self is not in this business for moral victories but without Darren Peterson as you get another look at an easy call clearly off the glass They are hanging around without points Hes got six assists and only one turnover and has played almost the entire game Hes only been off for two minutes Duke in a little 32 zone Kansas may have some opportunities in the middle but you got to get into the gaps Looking for Chiller inside Cant get it there Councel knocks down a three And for Melvin Council Jr that is his first made three of the season in 11 attempts And could that have come at a better time going up against the zone and knocking that down after getting the ball back But now Boozer sneaks underneath Triple teamed and finishes applause Melvin Council Jr was able to get a piece of that first attempt But Tiller didnt want a foul Just tried to wall up inside and make Boozer finish over the top Tiller playing with four Bedonga playing with four Tiller Tough catch in traffic But Donga cannot finish it Boy you like the unselfishness of Tiller but it looked like he had a wide open jumper from about 12 ft away He could have taken it Fivepoint game Four minutes to go Kayton Boozer had a couple of big baskets earlier this half Driving on Dawson cant get it to go and its out of bounds Itll be Duke Ball When we come back after the media timeout with 351 to go ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by State Farm Like a good neighbor State Farm is there And Kinders handcrafted flavor since 1946 music Wow Evans had to get it off because of the shot clock and he buries it Thats a huge bucket for Duke off the out of bounds underneath Isaiah Evans his range is unlimited His third three tonight Hes got 16 points Council know Evans the tip Gung by the gather and its Duke ball Good pass and good patience that they didnt force it Gungma now looks for help and back into the hands eventually of Kaden Boozer Spain action buster a battle for the rebound and the fouls on Tiller and he is out of the game but he just couldnt moveman that he has ever coached and maybe the best freshman and hes had some pretty good freshman Heck yeah Joel Embiid Andrew Wiggins theres been a bunch of them coach some pretty good ones at Illinois too Darren Williams finally able to get it to council short on the three Foster the rebound Its too tough a shot with Isaiah Evans right in him with that length to bother that shot You know you hope for Kansass sake that Peterson and for his sake that Peterson isnt out too long Theyre going to the Players era Festival in in Vegas Theyve got Notre Dame and Syracuse and then a TBD opponent Then early December theyve got Yukon and then theyve got Missouri I mean that was a really good drive to the rim by Caleb Foster When he and Kaden Boozer are in the game together he can operate as a scoring guard rather than having the responsibility just of running the team applause and cheering One of two and the lead is nine Dawson cant get the shot off Good defense Good close out there by Kaden Boozer And now just two minutes remain Rosario for three And Foster the rebound Now Duke can take its time Not taking the air out of the ball but you dont have to be in a hurry The clocks your friend with this ninepoint lead applause Right now with the overplay a slip to the basket can get you an easy one An easy one for Cameron Booer Just a little ball screen roll right out of the middle and nobody there to pick him up Just well executed White lost it cheering applause Foster gets it over And again they are not in a rush They got a push from the Underman JayHawks without Darren Peterson but executed well enough when it mattered the most here in the second half to take a doubledigit lead into the last minute Fosters fouled cheering and applause Duke operating out of the middle of the floor A little ball screen set by Boozer He just rolls out of it They hit him in the middle of the lane on the short roll and he just takes it all the way down and theres nobody coming from the weak side that can bother that You can really move Camboozer all over the floor screen him down into the post He can catch it off the post and his passing ability is next level How about that First ACC player since 2006 putting up uh totals of points rebounds and assists I think it was 150 and 20 over a fiveame span since Craig Smith of Boston College 19 years ago running that tight flex for Al Skinner And and by the way these are the first five games Cameron Boozers ever played at this level so we shouldnt lose SIGHT OF THAT AND another foul tonight for Camboozer 18 and N And Papas got to be proud Both of his sons played well tonight Really well Kaden had some big moments when they needed some big moments in the second half Kansas leads one and one cheering Dukes going to go home Theyll play Niagara and Howard in their next two games but theyve got some big ones coming Arkansas Florida at East Lancing against Michigan State Texas Tech among their games between now and the holidays Arkansass got some outstanding freshman guards Darius Akoff Jr Malik Thomas just super talented Ill tell you given what we saw from Michigan State tonight of the first game that Duke Michigan State game will be fun especially at Brelin And Floridas big guys are such a challenge Alex Condan and Thomas Hal is playing great basketball Well number three Trey White his third Kansas Young B will head to the line now for John Sherss Blue Devils A Final Four team a year ago A lot of turnover obviously as all teams have these days in college basketball but kind of a nice blend of returning players and very talented freshman Just super talented freshman The number one recruiting class in the country and theyre playing like it applause cheering Dawson misses the three Boozer with the rebound The shot clock is turned off They can walk it up and finish it off applause Got to push Kansas got it all the way down to three here in the second half but just couldnt find enough ways to score Duke executed well in key spots of the offensive end and Jay the Blue Devils go to 50 on the young season Well this Blue Devil team has a lot of weapons and as they mature as a defensive team continue to rebound at a high level this teams going to have
