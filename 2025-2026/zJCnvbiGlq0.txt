for joining us The final byame of the season as it is called and it begins with a Trayvon Spiller slam Well Trayvon Spillers didnt score until late in the ball game on Sunday He was very unselfish and Coven got out Maybe tonight its going to be a Spillers ball game Longwood unlike Queens does not shoot the three ball that well but they get to the free throw line a lot and theyre pretty good inside especially when they can get it to Tucker cheering They do a nice job of spacing Theyll take their time but well take some threes but they try to go inside out screaming This is Johan and applause and cheering Zami Johan Zami misses his first shot Coming off a double double in Longwoods last game against Delaware State They lost to the Hornets 8176 on Saturday Delaware State was like Lake Forest on Sunday against Queens The Hornets 56 from the field 67 cheering from three in that game A steal and Zimmy put the Lancers applause on the board You can see hes got a nice powerful body at 66 Played a couple of places Not that midrange jumper but Ill do some damage to the defense Cant be chills with the passes if you wait for it Picks up where he left off Match the season high with 15 points on Sunday against the Royals Thats a not a good play Weak pass You saw the bad And then a few seconds later heres Chelse Good Move the ball Penetrate catch it Boom Knocks down the three Phillips hit Chipped in by Cover What a block cheering Miles looking to step into something and he finds the body of Emanuel applause Richards cheering who picked up his first foul Thats a rarity We talked about the power of Tucker He was going to try to take that Yoki back with two hands But watch Miles Kovven Not afraid of contact Goes up strong Got some pretty block with the left hand Kept it in play Eventually a foul called all ball All ball all day long All ball Coven This is his first shot tonight Rebounded by Alfonso Fats Phillips Another one of those guys that does his best work in the open court And already an inside foul Banging Thats what Tucker likes to do He can step out but he doesnt mind pushing and shoving and banging Blue caught with the hand in the middle Omaha coming off Omaha coming off his careerhigh 16 points five of seven from the floor Omaha eight for 12 from three his last three ball games Really shooting the ball with a lot of confidence Found his spot on the left wing midrange left baseline shot See if we can keep it rolling tonight Richards couldnt turn the corner Ziami gets it inside Tucker cheering and applause has his first bucket Nice touch right there Thinking about dunk Remember what happened to possession ago So he said cheering Okay Ill just throw a little floater up here This is I think when Wake Forest is at that benchmillers cheering has made a three Last made one in the Bahamas against Memphis Richard pulls it back out Tucker almost lost it Gets it to Phillips on the drive and its a foul against the DeS applause Theyre going to call it on Omaha Thats his second Here comes Marcus Marian off to the Demon Deacons bench You kind of had a feeling that they would be challenged inside If you take a look at what theyve done especially in the D1 ranking fifth best team in the life this Longwood team is really interesting because yeah they dont knock down threes but they like they they like the contact and theyve had u if Im not mistaken I did my cheering math right theyve had six ball games already this year that weve worked to keep up with what made 25 free throws or more in a game They leave it behind According to Ken Pals metrics theyre number one in the country in terms of the percentage of points they get at the free throw line Yeah cheering Calm to Harris And the battle for the board goes out of bounds Itll be Longwood Ball A team we saw early in the year in America They attempted 42 Theyve done that twice this year So we we well see Theyre going to the free throw line a lot That means its not good for Wake Forest That means theyre picking up fouls Otherwise already got two Hutchinsons pass to the lane Deflected finds Z to the corner Richards knocks cheering down the three and Longwood has his first lead Another one of those spot shooters for this Longwood team has struggled shooting One of 17 in his last eight ball games Thats big for him Harris on the attack going glass True Harris just continues to get better and better Playing through contact and elevating at the basket just off the glass Its a nice play Hes just so much stronger than he was a year ago Bad pass from Hutchinson Longwood turns it over for the first time Decent start though for Ronnie Thomass team He was on the team didnt didnt think he was old enough to be the coach of the team Steve Forbes coming off his 100th win at the helm of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons cheering trying to build his next 100 Steve did get a basketball to celebrate the achievement presented before the game tonight A nice ceremony Stan what do you thought about the first four plus minutes of this ball game Marcus Mary missed the put back rebound Zeni cheering Tucker in transition applause Fouled by Spillers Nice bounce pass to the run Uh what what you would expect what you expect I mean you didnt think Wake Forest you would hope to if youre Wake Forest fan they would continue to shoot hot Theyre working at it and Longwoods trying to probe and make some plays and theyre doing what they like Theyre going back to the free throw line you know but you talking about coach Thomas getting the job and looking so young Let him get through this basketball season see how he looks back in this summer See be still They say the same thing Look hell look young right now Getting through the wars of the year the Big South and maybe some postseason He had some basketball gear on and some of the visitors who didnt know him said What what year are you Yeah He said No Im not on the team Im the coach of the team Coach of the team cheering Learned that story from Ronnie in Johnson City this past October Big South media day And you did a great job with that by the way Not trying to blow smoke Im just telling you You did a nice job with that Talking to all those coaches knowing all the things you did trying to tell him what to do I was an impression Youre very kind Calm knocks down the three Hes gotten in a rhythm over the last couple weeks Made that adjustment with the the brace on his nose and doesnt let that affect him Two missed free throws You go down and get a basket on the other end Those are the things that Longwood can afford They cannot have empty possessions either way Jaylen Bernard and Elijah Jones cheering first two Lancers off the bench And this is Bernard burying the three Yeah Bernard is a real steady jump shot Artist a veteran player that can that can make some shots He had contest that time Uhoh Marian comes back down with a Lancers trading punches with a Deique so far tonight Who touched it last Coven long ball Well Steve Forbes was Ronnie Thomass age 27 years ago Steve turned 60 this past March Heres something interesting Stan You know Steve Forbes was born in March of 1965 Later that year the guy that this building is named after Lawrence Joel earned the Medal of Honor Little historical perspective for you You amaze me sometimes with how you come up with some things like thats a wonderful thing 196 applause and cheering fouls going against Longwood Jones tugging down Marian Heres something you forgotten and it hit me as I was driving home Sunday after the game You and I were together were did Steve Forbs first win which is against Dale State and we were there for 100 Thats right I know Thats why I said it Harris How about that Weve been all the milestones of coach Forbes Congratulations once again Nobody was at the game but the two of us Yeah that was a weird weird game It was cheering November of 2020 I never will forget where Longwood was the second opponent for 10 Yes thats exactly right I never will forget uh our guy Everett says to us we were going to do the game on Thanksgiving day It was Longwood at Dale State and were sitting there and looking you want to see anybody warming up See one team dont see anybody Ever says all right fellas happy Thanksgiving We said we said happy Thanksgiving already to you He said no really happy Thanksgiving Youre done Theres no game here today So wow So thats a long time ago Weve come a long way since co thank goodness for that Well congratulations again to Coach Forbes for that Its amazing things you remembered Youre part of history I like being Dont you like being a part of history I do I dont like being reminded of games getting cancelled after youd already prepared That was not fun Just kept the information for another day applause Thomas wanted a foul but itll be for his ball Richards couldnt get it away from the Thanksgiving meal Im sorry laughter So hey Cooper on the floor for the first time but not his brother Battled against his brother crossing here on Sunday Think youll have a better shooting game today I do Im Im waiting for the Cooper Swagger breakout game Its coming Could be tonight Marcus Marian looking for his as well Rebound there Yeah Bernard got drilled by his teammate but able to get the pass off to Jones And now heres Duke Harris with a steal cheering Juke drilled from behind Are they going to give him continuation No Says no And I think I cheering think that hes tripped He stumbled I dont think that was intentional I think his feet got crossed or he hit a spot Now they may call that an intentional foul but to be very honest with you I think he kind of stumbled Watch this Watch Watch his feet I think he stumbles Shes really trying to watch Watch this I mean regardless of the intent in the NBA thats two shots Yeah I know But uh knocks down It doesnt matter It dont even matter but Mason answer Good Good bit of officiating there Not to overreact They could see it Big basket for Mason Hes been struggling a little bit lately Sure has Marians been active on the rebounding side of things since coming off the bench for Belaloo Love his activity Steve Ford very kind words about Marcus Marian on his coaches show Monday night of which Marian was a gap Here we cheering one dribble Theyre going to call a charge No its a block I dont know Stan I thought Emanuel Richards was set from Brower City And you have to make a decision immediately I think hes leaning just a little bit I dont know if hes there See how See how hes kind of just failed backwards trying to easy stand by It looked like a charge but yeah some of those calls could go either way Cooper Schwagger begins the night 100 17 points shy of a thousand points in his career His careerhigh is 33 He could get there Of course his careerhigh with Wake is eight But he he was big time scorer obviously the last couple of years for Valpo Freshman of the year one year all team the next 945 games That was 15 shy of a thousand I didnt realize I saw it played two years ago when he when he Valpo came down and played Elon I did one cheering of his games at Virginia Tech a couple years ago Thats right It was right after that game Yeah cheering Little trap And I remember talking to Roger Mason the Valpo coach asked him if he thought Sweeter when he recruited him would be as impactful as he was as a freshman He said Yeah like he was going to be a good player for us And he also said hes a typical freshman Hes still figuring some things out But when he can figure things out and still be the freshman of the year in the league and all conference and when youre 610 Im patient with you learning the learning curve So okay And again another foul by Wake Forest inside Call it on Mason Eight minutes in Wake has taken 12 field goal attempts Eight have been threes How you feel about that The moving screen on Tucker applause Well we got ourselves a timeout so you can ruminate on that question Stan you can share your thoughts when we come back Im sure folks are on the edge of their seats at home Fourpoint music game here at the Joel Coliseum Longwood enters at six and six Their preseason number three in the Big South behind High Point and Winthre Winthre of course coached by Mark music Crosser son of Skip Ronnie Thomas leading this Longwood team after being an assistant We talked about it the other day Stan about becoming a head coach for the first time after being an assistant Well after he was able to get in the game and they identified he was old enough to be the head coach I mean things are going great Theres a change Its like anything else I mean and so hell learn and under fire Sweetener missed the short rebounded by Tucker The most the most important thing is to make sure youre youre taking care of your kids and youre continuing to always try to teach Count that And one opportunity for Johan Z The way you want to play today may not be the way you want to play next week The players and everything you establish a foundation The foundation for this basketball team is inside outside Try to get to the free throw line They have not disappointed in that respect tonight Now I mentioned the uh the Longwood game in November of 2020 which was Forbess second game of his career The only other time that these schools played was when Chris Paul was here February 2005 about a month before the Deets got pit snoggled in the tournament laughter But uh it was a really weird schedule game In and out for Mason I remember I was here for that game and everyones like Whos Longwood Where are they from Theres three for Sebastian Akens Straight away triple Hes been playing well You were talking about the threepoint shots The shots have been within the offense just not falling So youre cheering okay with that Its a good second chance opportunity there for Atkins to knock them down Good to see him get a basket It was a top 15 Wake Forest team and everyones like Why are we playing Longwood in late February in the cheering midst of ACC play Hutchinson around and out rebound Marian Well about 15 18 years ago you used to have some holes in the schedule right At that time of the year in February some teams would play a big noncon against somebody or you get a game So yeah that was the first year of the 1210 ACC 0405 year of Boston College Virginia Tech and Miami Of course it feels like those teams have been in the league forever compared to some of our more recent conference comrades I used to be really proud to say Ive done a game in every single ACC mens basketball arena but I havent been to Stanford and Cal Did go to SMU last month Moody Coliseum in Dallas Nice place Saw Boopy Heres Mark Mai Mason rather unable to finish And another rebound finds Elijah Tucker One quarter of the way into this Wednesday night basketball battle Third ever meeting Wade Longwood Beautiful pass and Tucker throws it down You can really see that they concentrate and work a lot on trying to make those passes within 10 ft in the post area And thats a very difficult postto post pass cheering Getting very well with a finish Theyre hanging around This is not a bad basketball team from logo land Akens too strong Rebound Tucker Just settle for a shot You did that Move the team around Get a good shot Be patient Jump shots shouldnt come on the block Ziami throws it out for Hutchinson Jakoy Hutchinson ties the game with a tough turnaround Hutchinson the leading scoreer on this Lancer basketball team Gets most of his points within 15 ft Only six threepoint baskets going in tonight Marian finds himself open but he settled for it Yeah see thats thats that what you were leading to earlier about taking threes Thats not quite the 12 out of 18 field goal attempts beyond the arc and virtual wholesale substitutions like a hockey line change ready to check in four deeps at the table Coven Belaloo Spillers and Harris over there Thats not good defense Unable to make him pay though Kelly missed cheering and applause the three Two open Watch this inter post to post pass about 5 ft away Nice spin move to score Theres a weak side guy coming a defensive breakdown for nobody helping Watch this again Spin applause taken We told you Tucker so much power 235 240 lbs Caught in with two hands This would not be blocked Defensive breakdown just before the the line change right there Took not happy about that Starting five minus Cal Nice and Akens is out there instead Coven missed the three Rebound Longwood Jones Lancers looking to retake the lead Hutchinson off the mark but right there for the rebound and stick back Jaylen Payne and Steve Forbes does not look happy about that sequence Timeout Demon Deakons heading into conference play on New Years Eve Not looking past this ball game but they need they need to try to get a W on Sunday Also will really help February and March I I I said something about Wake Forest last night They tried to run the Valpo place which I know called the demon dig play at a basketball game and uh didnt quite go as well Fumbled the pass but got the shot off Harris fumbled the catch there and Hutchinson missed it and dodge a bullet Surprised Hutcherson didnt go take the layup as opposed to the midrange shot from there cheering Who from Wake Forest is going to change the vibes Juke Spillers You just going to name them all No Oh you were right Juke to Spillers You know youre going to learn one day if you ask me a question Im going to give you an answer It might not be the answer you want but Im I answer for a reason And most of the time Ill be right Dont forget Stenus I I Im just trying laughter Im just trying to tell you Im just Im just saving you some time I chronicle every one of your predictions and one day Ill show you the list of what you got right and what you got wrong Well you expect me to be perfect Theres only one perfect person out here It aint me Spillers the rebound Deacons looking to retake the lead under seven minutes in the half Colden misfires from the corner Spillers on the glass Airballs the putback Oh by the way I dont know if he knew this or not but Bills won Thanks Thanks cheering Been holding out laughter Appreciate the reminder Jones hands it off and puts it in Another pass Its the most recent timeout They had 10 points in the paint of the 20 at that time Now 22 12 Not the shot you want See theyre not moving smooth Remember the other night they were passing and cutting and getting themselves open Then are passing cutting catching and shooting Well shots things can look pretty pretty easy Yeah but they were making shots because they were moving They were moving and catching the ball in motion Thats not good Its a brick from Jones One of the three guys named Elijah in Longwoods rotation Harris in and out Deakons now four of 16 from three and even 25 You dont want to shoot the percentage of the temperatures outside the way its been lately cheering and screaming Bernard Wow air mills that one You know Wake is playing and this isnt ugly but Im I you know I tell the truth Wakes playing like this This is how they should have played Sunday Okay First game Yeah After exams after a break If they played like this Sunday I would have said too much because I kind of expected it They were hot Today is is let down day Thats the thing thats probably most concerning is that you cant be up and down right now You got to come out with some passion Play this f and you got to give him a lot of credit Also Tucker and Spillers banging inside Lancers have a twopoint lead Theyre just two of 10 from three Harris bumped by Richards Its the 17 foul So Juke will shoot one and one Nice sharp cut that time by Juke Harris with just his 14 points on Sunday Dropped from third in ACC scoring to fifth still averaging over 20 a game Five 517 Lets say they tie the game because thatd be a great thing to do Thats a good watermark Now lets see if they turn the juice just a little bit Turn it up and and and begin to make the run right now Lets see what kind of team you are We got in cheering Interesting fiveminute stretch coming up Starts at this end of the floor for Wake Spillers trying to tie up Hutchinson Cant do it Luke deflects the pass Spillers on the floor gets it over to Kovven You ask whos going to make a play Spillers is playing with energy Dive after a loose ball Love to see it Get some floor burns Get a cheering heel Blakes not settling this possession Harris strong take to the hoop Nice take Matchup problem Thompson was inside banging a moment ago with Spillers and then as you drive he had to come over and contest Didnt have the size to be able to finish with Juke Different purpose to that possession offensively Thompson straight away three round and out Harris the rebound looking to push Harris again creates contact to earn free throws applause And watch this Theyre banging inside Goes in the drive The up the defender comes a little too late to close off the baseline but it wouldnt have mattered because you elevated so well They wouldnt have been able to stop that But thats what I like to see out of him being aggressive And then then what that does is makes that pull up jump shot even more effective as the game goes on Trying to stop him from the baseline trying to stop him screaming from dunking up Jaden Amir Harris but ever since he was born hes been called juke Hes made a three in every game so far this year Currently 0 for three in that department tonight Do you realize he made more threes in the West Virginia game than he had in any month last season cheering Dude I think he what he looking all night last year right So she got the old numbers cheering still up there in some cases Right De Swarming defensively Kick out three goes for Red Thompson Jr It was a nice job of stopping the basketball But what do you see Three guys stopped the ball It goes inside back to outside and youre able to knock down the shot LONGWOOD HANGING AROUND 26 25 Ho ho ho Yeah Exams Put your head Michael Jackson singing I saw MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS FOLLOWED BY WHOOP DAD THERE IS ALL IN THE same segment Well I tell you what boy I love basketball season holidays He may may have been Michael Jackson laughter but it sounded to me like Stan Lutter cuz you were belting it out That was one of my first Christmas albums I ever had What a rebound by Tucker I remember that song Thats some really nice songs on that Michael Jackson a Jackson 5 Christmas album Uh someday at Christmas I saw Mama Christmas Santa Claus A nice version of Silent Night Man you get it If you can YouTube it over the holidays If we go to triple overtime you can sing the whole album Well I dont remember all the all the songs If

Thompson splashes in another three Why settle for a layup but I can knock down a three Hustle plays 14 points in the paint for Longwood Wake Forest Christmas break hasnt started yet Pick it up Culvin has not scored yet until now Nice job there Under control contested didnt force it in rhythm scores But you got to give Longwood a lot of credit Theyve pretty much done what they like to do offensively Miles does have two rebounds and three assists but that bucket his first points of the night Longer controlling the tempo of this basketball game and theyre able to score inside They average about 77 points a ball game That was a good look Ground and out for Thompson Would have been his third make pushing the tempo Two minutes to go Youre tied off Schwaggers hands and out of bounds Here comes Spillers and Mason back into the game I like the idea Its just got to be better executed The official stats are given the turnover to Well it did go through his hands I was a bad pass He touched it got his hands on it He was the last one to have a touch Turnover And usually its on the passer to make sure the ball is caught right screaming No you just said it was a bad pass It was a bad pass but you still got to catch it Were laughter talking about who deserve I agree He should have caught it but Im surprised the turnover turnover goes to Swagger He going to try to change the rules I guess he going to use his feet Tucker No turnover Theres no turnovers I like Tucker just catches it finishes Remember he had a shot block Goes not again Grabs it inside Spillers cheering goes to work stays with it and scores Such quick elevation and the fact that hes lefthanded on the left side Got that little jump Look when he missed it he was the first one to elevate and get the rebound Follow shot Had seven ties and seven lead changes cheering in this first half stand You were looking for separation these last five minutes here We had a good ball game cheering Shot clock winding down Nowhere to go He flips it up Hutchinson finds Thompson inside Thats goending on Harris How did that happen Very fortunate for Longwood to get out of that double team And it been a jump ball Possession there was theres too So watch this Gets up hits the hits the glass Juke gets it just a little late Pressure right there Wait for it You dont want to do that at halftime Marcus Marian in Omaha Belaloo out Long did a nice job of playing without fouling fouling jumps Showing a little bit of his own Recognize it Take your time if you wait You get a shot 84 is the difference between the game and shot clock Oh boy Paris throws it right to Phillips Fat screaming Bips somehow did not get fouled I think he did get fouled but there was no whistle Thats an cheering offensive foul Jukes living dangerously Yep Only his first foul called against him All right now watch it Now watch watch as he lower Show See Yep There you go There we go Defender was moving with him Was he was he there completely I would not think he was Thats four first half turnovers for Duke Harris Yeah More turnovers and field goals cheering Its also weights leading score with eight points Final seconds of the half Onward looking to double its lead cheering Theyll have a chance to do so at the free throw line with 5 seconds to go You could just feel that not going the way of the defense The whole possession A good job by Longwood Work the clock Put yourself in the position Theyll get the ball to begin the second half Think Steve Forbes might have some aggressive counseling to do with his team at halftime cheering and applause Well counseling is not the thing I would be thinking about but I could see Yes Sometimes you have to have them moments You have to talk to him Let me explain some things to you gentlemen Hes hes a very friendly guy but hes also got a temple to him screaming Should as most basketball coaches do Thats what coaching is about Sammy puts the Lancers up by four Thats the difference also between being in that one seat when you move over All that stuff comes on you Assistant coaches can be yellers and screamers and sometimes theres a good cop bad cop assistant but no sir Weightsman very good in end of half situations Cal with momentum Double dribble Cal me fires and misses And Longwood will take a fourpoint lead into the locker room Steve Forb looking to his team pointed to the locker room and said Lets go Well thats not happen Well there are a couple guys on Vanderbilt I was looking at them a little bit today Their leading scoreer was at High Point last year Yeah Their number three score was at North Carolina a couple years ago Tyler Nickel I was talking about him today to uh to some of the guys early the junior crew Yeah Longwood looking to extend its lead Tucker cannot connect and Paris cheering wins the battle for the board Okay lets see here Spillers going cheering downhill Already better by Hutchinson Already better Stomp on defense An aggressive move by Spillers You got to get Longwood on their heels You got to get them start doubting themselves sooner rather than later this basketball game See if Wake can play with a little more consistent force at this end of the floor Wake scores I wouldnt be surprised if they come out with some pressure You have to speed up the tempo Count with a left hand That was pretty Nice off the glass Very much under control This is a game he could he could very easily take control of this ball game Scoring the ball defending making some positive passes Wade creates turnover there Knocking it away from Tucker applause Backto back turnovers Miss shot Drives inside off the left Pinches it Chases the glass Scores Thats nice Under control Remember the first two possessions that Wake Force went against uh in the beginning this game was a foul and another foul already bad Calmise kicks it to the corner Coven with some force comes up short with a layup 11 of 11 he is not Hes one for five Going away from the baskets got to get that ball up Get it on that little square Goes in Hutchinson rebound stick back Elijah Tucker No one around the box side Hutchinson such a good athlete and a bad foul Billings doesnt get the bounce Shares a moment with Matt Potter with the bucket Runs a couple of free throws guards just under the Trayvon So Trayvon at the line for the Dicks Six points five rebounds so far tonight applause Watch this long rebound Evan And the white shirts they just turn Nobody gets a body And this is easy right inside by Tucker whos had a really nice ball game so far Just catches

Blue just take off Gets in the outside lane Nice pass One trip Take it to the glass Score Foul on Cal Little spice percolating between Cal Mse and Bilips over there Good Good You like percolating spice I like percolating spice especially if it makes a play Tucker kicks it out to a wild open Hutchinson and its rebounded by Richards Richards with a great effort there cheering Zi cant make pay Harris after the long rebound coast to coast a miss Long wood board the other way Theyve done off balance No foul Watch Watch it See how high they are Oh nice pass And he missed the dunk My goodness applause Spillers does not cheering miss that dunk Remember that play The two that you could have had the two that you gave away gives weights the lead cheering living in the Pizarro world for a moment Thats why I just say just lay it in You dont have to be the best cheering You have to make highlights every game Just lay it in Cory Hutchinson comes up cheering short Harris who the rebound is run Cal explodes to the rim Lays it in Timeout Lancers cheering You can see that happen Hey Cal meets the first deep in double figures tonight And what a strange sequence Like a Stranger Things moment cheering and applause Miss Dunk at one end Spillers buries it at the other there That finishing strong plays motivated this team offensively as well as defensively being well tuned Whats going on Remember the name Trayvon Spillers and the second half explosion Funny thing is a year ago at this time he thought he was playing his last year of college basketball but he realized he had another year of eligibility with the way things sorted out with junior college uh rules and here hes back Important player for this Deacon team Coming out of this timeout Wake and Longwood had virtually held the lead the exact same amount of time in this game Bernard with a shot clock winding down missed it Harris now has eight points and eight boards Longwood could have got a better shot of that Didnt really probe that two3 zone that Wake was in that possession Aloo much better ball movement Mason puts it on the deck goes to the bucket and earns a trip to the free cheering throw line applause Oh we just came back from a break We know but were heading back to another one Digs by three times people will guard you a little bit better and you feel like youve got to match what you did Other guys have picked him up today Thank goodness Wake would really be in a lot more trouble than they are But its a very special evening and one that should be honored remembered but now we got to move on Move on Play better Damn Only two points so far tonight for Miles Coven Couple rebounds three assists Hes on the bench right now But its also a great teaching point for everybody Oh Deloos in for the rebound Good rebound Mason missed the free throw then missed the layup Three hits Its another chance Juke Harris for three No good rebound Jones Two good opportunities in the end of the third What I was going to say real quickly though is that given the opportunity you got to make the best of it Thats what Kovs been able to do last couple ball games Shot failed So far tonight they havent But you got to keep playing Theres good spacing right now Watch this Theyre going to look for a cutter First 77 Thought that ball somewhere near him Bernard cant score Richards has his hands on the rebounds for the out of bounds Last touch by Thompson applause Reese did a really nice job of battling and kind of nudging at the end of the play Guy steps out of bounds Longwood has two points in the first five minutes of the second half Wow Wow Had some good looks but theyre over for their last six Wakes on an eight nothing run Well see first half they didnt know any better They were comfortable now They see okay we got a chance to win this game Whatever you start thinking finish your plays screaming Omaha comes up empty Spillers cheering battling but its out of bounds to the Lancers Spillers was fighting through two blue shirts to try to get his hand on it I love his effort Whether he got it or not boy he was working at it The harder you work the lucky you get Richards down the alley Last touch by W got to grab the basketball and be strong with it like its the last biscuit on the on the Christmas turkey You know the last biscuit they have the plate You got to grab Thompson Jun applause within one Took that shot in rhythm the number two threepoint shooter on this team with 12 only behind Bernards 13 That was a really nice look and a big basket for long Duke Harris will get back to the line Hey if the last biscuit is on the table are you the guy that takes that biscuit or do you let you know your family first No it depends on how strong you are Thats what I was saying Thats my point right there You got to be strong with that last biscuit cuz you might want it I may want it You got to grab it and its nice and buttery and hot cheering You know after you had all the great

Happy fourth night of Hanukkah Happy fourth night of Hanukkah Yes indeed Thank you sir Drew Harris pulls up and what a tough angle banker that was Drew Harris makes a lot of difficult shots I mean offbalance just off the glass cheering Great angle Picking up the defensive intensity A little more pressure Got to be strong with the ball Nine to shoot Can Wade cheering finish this possession Thats been really good for 25 seconds They dont get the rebound Shot clock didnt reset and Spillers finishes the possession with a block Best defensive effort weve seen out of Digs completely Harrison and rhythm short Deaks have missed their last 11 threepoint tries And its a threepoint opportunity at the other end for Longwood Jaylen Bernard Watch the body control of Bernard Goes up just just got him with the body and the awkward angle Nice finish that time for Bernard I see you Big swing Miss three at one end Threepoint play potentially here Foul on Juke Its his second Hes on the bench cheering

just fouled him 13 foul against Wier in the second half Well hes a veteran player grad student and averages about 12 13 points a ball game And youve got to find some ways to get some score They dont have to be threepoint baskets for Longwood but those midrange shots which you do very good about Oh thats go wakes up and a late cheering whistle applause as he was undercut by Spillers Lancers arent going away No theyre not That was very nice execution You start high Tuckman we told you got a nice touch and thats a nice wraparound bounce pass Comes late and thats just a smart play and thats the kind of game that you get out of Longwood some nights when theyre not worrying about taking threes Todays that night where they say Hey were going to beat you 18 feet in the end and weve got a great opportunity applause Spillers just picked up his third foul Hes back to the bench Ronnie Thomas knocking the bow tie looking for cheering the biggest win of his tenure so far by far Like that bow tie look by Ryan Thomas Looks like looks like the second or third grade school picture cheering He pulls it off Remember how you had your weighted bow tie and everything look that much older than seven gra Thats a compliment to you Ronnie when I tell you boy I like that Thats a nice little look Good guy Swaggers back in there for Wake Mason finds himself open with missed the baseline Jay rebound Phillips Longwood looking to retake the lead Under 12 minutes to play Sometimes you can execute and the shot just doesnt fall Hard hedge there from Marion Couldnt be cheering a turnover Schwagger with a hedge as it goes to Kelly And nows the steal Mason takes it away cheering from Hutchinson Okay take your time There you go Look Marcus Marion going to the line Clever pass there from Mai music and the Danish red shirt sophomore will shoot two when we return music Knock it down Jump shots Thats a great look right there off the penetration The versatility of Cal to score May need him to score the basketball a little more today His weight struggles He drives he scores he takes the midrange jumper kissed one music off the glass A very solid basketball game for Nate Cal Well its a night when most of his teammates are struggling I mean his teammates are a combined 11 for 37 from the field Nates five for six Marcus Barrying at the line Doesnt shoot many free 57 free throws Didnt look comfortable This will be a little bit better I think cheering little bit Yeah Oh yeah Hit the front of the rim That back screen filling I like that Longwoods got to be starting to believe that they can get a win Yeah they got to execute better That pass a moment ago they said the free throw those weak passes cant happen anymore Good contest from Schwagger disrupting Phillips cheering Swagger Marian Coven Cal Me and Mason cheering and Miles Kovven trying to get his mojo back after a slow start tonight I like what Kovven did that time as he took the ball pushed it but was under control got off two feet goes up hesitation just a little bit gets a defender off his feet and then creates contact for a foul And maybe seeing the ball go through the basket gets him some rhythm Thats a nice looking free throw applause before Sunday Miles careerhigh was 20 Game with Purdue against all miss Of course he had 20 by halftime on Sunday Exceeding cheering a little pressure Try to speed long trying to kick them out of their offensive rhythm and mindset Thats good Open look Richards Lancers are one of eight from three here in the second half The shot was ugly but the execution was well crosscourt off that little trap ledge and careless there Another chance for the Lancers to slice on the deficit Well defended by Marion Hes asking cheering and applause C4s to challenge Dont 1033 to go Good defensive play but the momentum carries the ball out of bounds applause and cheering Now a foul called on Marian on the restart battling position inside with Johans Number two on Marcus Love to see the benching into this game right now All stated there greeting Cal Me as he goes off the floor Sometimes you need to see that friendly face as a teammate because you may not get it from the coach with Aken Steve Forbes got carrying for another foul The sixth team cheering foul So not no shots yet Sorry Steve Forbes said a while ago it was an interesting comment that Cal Niss and Akens are like having a fast ball and a curveball as two point guards different things Yeah I see that Yeah Give you a little different speed give you some change of direction What I was going to say too is kind of a followup is that we talked about it in the very beginning of the game You talking especially about hey they go inside and create contact to get fouls was a perfect example there just got enough of the the offensive play against Wilson line Both teams are at 16 fouls Well be shooting free throws the rest of the way They could have caught a bump there on Harry Instead theyll give a shooting foul and going against Miles Coven You love players coming out but you got to come out under control Aaron was very fortunate they didnt get it for a touch foul the first time applause instead of one and one which it would have been if they called the touch foul Two shots here for Richards junior from Irmo South Carolina screaming Oh big time football cheering applause laughter Not going to believe this but I went to summer camp in Maine with a kid from Irma Really And he was all about Irma Ive known Ernos for a long time Shout out Ricky Taylor Yes I thought right in camp Summer camp Yeah in Maine

cant make long air crosscourt passes cheering Coven turn around two Oh what a pretty touch right there by Coleman Front of the rim Back spin Back spin goes in Maybe a little hard to believe Stan but this is Wakes largest lead of the night Sixpoint advantage ticking cheering toward 9 minutes to play How do you handle it if youre the Lancers right now Dont force anything Get your big involved Theres your trap Go opposite cheering Too much dribbling Ball fakes and shot fakes Clock winding down Hutchinson trying to create late Doesnt get it to go Rebound Cold and he throws it away Errant outlet pass High was the intended target Seemed like catch change direction over right shoulder b Nice touch make that great defensive play and he knew Florida Its hard out here cheering Did he teach

what Im talking about I played for the 1500 basketball team Then I coached the 1500 basketball team Some big wins proudest moments of my life You you hold off on some stuff sometime you know trying to ask about all these crazy questions You come out and get some stuff like that Im Im Im just more and more impressed with you every day Your your boy wants some game back I I heard I heard that screaming I mean look at that Im impressed Give a shout out to the camp Look what you developed I once I once told Skip Proer Skip Proer it was the uh the first football game of the year and we did a game cheering day show and and I I played hours and hours of basketball and I was stroking it and uh I cheering told Skip I Ive been shooting a lot over the summer If you go I need someone that can make so I dont need I got a lot of guys that can shoot someone that can make a lot of people at ball games they can coach a team but we need somebody making decisions I like that you need somebody to make shots Harris in the lane gets the cheering bounce to go his way Oh those friendly rims hit the to Joel Sevenpoint cheering demon Deacon lead Oh not friendly rims at the other end for Tucker Backto back basket for the DS Duke lost it on his way Last touch by Longwood Well music take a timeout and refocus for the finish 7 with 756 to go All right Now now put that put that in the camp main camp talk Translate that what they said at Maine The jarring just position Thats how they was in Maine Thats how they talk Okay About just position eighty old in and out for Harris got a good look and could not connect A smart kid can All right lets go Four for 10 from three and now theyre four for 22 They missed their last dozen Little high horn set right there To take a defender down Lets see if they move the ball Abigail Get the big fell a touch and then let him dive to the post Bernard fakes the three gives it to Thompson Cant do that He should have gone to Fundamental Station camp first day applause in in Maine he he learned that you cant jump up and down without ripping the basketball What was the name of that camp again West End House Thats a travel just like its a travel in the Joel Colise Thats what Im saying He learned that he did cheering and applause Oh by the way it feels more than Im just trying to secret member of the mafia No YOU JUST ACTED LIKE NO YOU PULLING FOR BUT YOU ACT LIKE YOU DIDNT NO Im just Akens right wing three around and out What a difference a day makes There you go Weve been looking for that applause Youve been waiting for it THERE IT IS And thats Cooper too Thats not his brother Ninepoint lead Turning up the heat a little bit as Wake Forest cheering Youve got to score this possession You have to Shot clock at six Nice Good defense from Cvin Good offensive rebound from Bernard Its the cutting Richards over Schwinger No good Rebound Tucker Back up and in for the Longwood L Thats a big time rebound by Tucker Went up like that last biscuit on the table Grabbed it with two hands and powered inside Youre not going to take it away from you Watch Elijah Tucker Time out Longwood No Swagger Thats nice Sevenpoint game with 620 to go Interesting that that coach took the time out there after a positive play from Longwood You know you talk about when to use timeouts He knows his team obviously better than we do I dont know that I would want to use that timeout with 620 left to play Only down seven You may need that timeout later in this basketball game for strategy for for a challenge or whatnot You know thats thats an iffy situation when you use one He felt like he needed to tell his team something on the defensive end So well see how it works out for you But theyve got one timeout left Stan this is not always the case but I wholeheartedly agree with you Yeah Well thats what we didnt have the time to talk about that the late game situation in Georgetown and also in the weight game uh against uh Georgia Tech but situations Yeah In womens game we were sitting there talking about timeouts and I think theres art to using a timeouts and you know your team better than we do So well see But I dont I dont know You dont like that time I I I Im not certain about it because you just want you kind of tell your team something on the defensive end and sometimes you got to play through it You dont want to risk it If you had if you had three timeouts and want to do that Id say okay with six minutes but with one remaining you know I like to have a timeout if I can I I very generally despise when coaches call timeouts after their own teams made baskets And it look this is something that Steve Forbes does too No I dont mind you call a timeout because its for strategic reasons or the fourth possession Everything is different You cant just say as a coach timeout or player oh this time you cant do it you just cant do it You have to change So whats the game situation Time and score now So that that Yeah but they got one one left Thats thats what concerns me Zmys pass deflected by Coven He gets it back Johan cheering creates contact with Schwagger applause and free throws for Z And again you know your team better than we do But that thats the thing from sending them here having been in that seat That would be the concern at that point in the game Get back to start transition cheering So we well move on But applause this something theres a lot that go theres a lot goes into coaching the basketball cheering team You know this is not easy work Cums done it 400 times in one year But its not easy You are a tactician You are a psychologist Thank you very much You are a teacher Yes cheering sir Discipline area You are a chaperon Yes sir applause A lot of things I mean its its a lot cheering kind of like what you have to do when you have to work with you got discipline You got to keep you off from you know emotional times late games Nobody stopped him and he scored Great job there just driving No one stops you Like you said you score You begin to see that doubt the seed of doubt and lack of execution going on long Guys that pass again cheering Tuckers better when he catches it closer to the basket No question about it And Tucker sets a screen to the corner Hutchinson with four Hutchinson Nice little up fake cheering Doesnt get the bounce Strong rebound Coven And he gets decked by Bernard This will be one and one at the other end for Miles Coven Drives right down University Parkway Boom Lays it on Akins makes the last shot Now Coleman back on the line Miles two for two at the line here tonight after he was four for four in his 33 point outburst on Sunday Smooth cheering and applause stroke Ill take the word for Adam weight goes on to win this basketball game You know you know you sit back and were about to score and blow a team out Well along with you know they give scholarships to so they they play hard But the thing of it is is cheering again youve got to find a way to win Youve got to grind it out Every game is a different chapter in the book cheering Largest lead first double digit lead of the night Thats Phillips Ryan called his name very often tonight Harwood cheering really needed that He did Akens rebound Phillips You got time CM right at Schwer No good Coven had the rebound lost cheering it and finds Tucker Hutchinson in the lane Tucker scores inside cheering Man hes got great hands now Did applause you see the guy bought it there The riparound pass and Tucker gets it and finishes 13 points for Tucker leading Longwood to Paris was just fouled Hell have a one and one when we come back 351 to go Wood is still just an eightpoint game from three This is three days after they made 17 One of the top five shooting displays in school history And Ill show you something that even show you why theyre struggling Have struggled offense 21 made field goals for the Dinks Only eight assists Only eight assists So you know theyve had more assist than turnovers Theyve done that eight times this year cheering Well theyve got 10 turnovers eight assists 21 made field goals Juke sinks a pair Like seven for seven eight for eight They have a trip to run By the way it is possible Vanderbilt coming here on Sunday after a loss They are trailing Memphis right now by three with 631 to play And theres a three for Red Thompson Jr Ronnie Thomas uses his final timeout with his team down seven and 340 to go Well take it two Conclusion next uh coaching staff bring a very very good and improved Hurricanes team to the Joel on January 7th Alas Taylor Wilson in the car heals after that All right this games far from over Sevenpoint lead for Wake Three and a half to play Bring that guard up high that time Elijah Kelly got the lift Kind of stopped that early pass Mason missed the layup How many layups has been missed tonight A lot Too many Remember they took a timeout on that prior possession Get that long Theyve got no timeout for cheering M They applause got two free throws here to make it a fivepoint game Fred Thompson Jr has been a spark off the bench So the timeout so further one more time So the timeout in essence was positive because you used it and you got a defensive stop Okay And then youre going down and forward Thats the good news But the bad cheering news is you got three minutes and 10 seconds remaining in the first basketball game And suppose you get a side out of bounds Youre about out of bounds underneath or something Youre getting trapped whatever You got to use your handle or what if you want this is stuff you have to think about Not not being critical Just kind of just let you see the whole picture of whats goes on I mean Im Im cheering being I would be critical but I applause also might be wrong Yeah but you being critical Youre youre being critical maybe for because youre looking at from a fan standpoint not from a game standpoint Trying to win trying to win a basketball game Fan is short for Fanatic Yeah A fan Yeah You sit there and listen to the fans youd be sitting up there with them Tom too So thats why you know pay the fans any attention Throws that in but its after the whistle And Dicks are in the double bonus So Harris whos eight for eight at the line head back there Now stuck with eight rebounds for a while Thought he was headed toward his third double double of the season but he still needed a couple of boards in the last 253 Hell get cheering him Hell get him Cuz hes going to be around the basketball 253 is going to be active Miss first miss from the line Hes nine for 10 Sixpoint game 245 to go Zi gives it to Tucker Chose not to go right out Spillers Instead back outside Thompson for Tucker Zi backing down Coven kicks cheering it out Thompson three cuts the deficit in half Money Money Took your time Go inside outside touch the paint Shooters take shots Coach says I got a timeout Im going to use mine applause Forget about covering the spread or worrying about Yeah All my days run the same right now Basketball game game Football basketball Dont expect JMU to win that game but I think itd be great if they did Wake cheering by three The ball ticking toward two minutes left Mason playing crunch time Missed it short Longwood had it Mason fighting for it Out of bounds Its out of bounds off Mai He was on the end line When you shooting you have your eye on rim level and notice a lot of times when guys fade away just a little bit and that changes the the angle That changes your eye level so youre not up there So Mason had an easy layup but when he started kind of going away from the basket then hes got to put more cheering on the ball to get it there cuz the distance is greater Missed the layup Mai hit a shot early but hes just one cheering for seven now Hes back on the bench replaced by Belaloo This is cheering for the tie Thompson ties it Are you kidding me Red Thompson Jr having himself a career night cheering All right where do we go If you wait for us look for Spillers cheering Look for Juke on a drive Spillers is posting He wants the ball Coven kicks it cheering Whos going to take charge screaming Got to be Juke And hes fouled applause on the floor but its two shots in the double bonus Juke looked up to his name Juke him Watch this How deep is it Took the time Hit the W Bam Am 11 run for Longwood over the last 216 And the Wake fans who came out to a ball game on a Wednesday night in Winston are stunned Harris mentioned it a minute ago Hes nine of 10 from the line And Im not sure why they havent given Juke the ball yet Ronnie Thomas is stealing a timeout cheering Thats good The fans are getting restless too cheering He can talk to his players I dont know Again what their hold up was and then Juke backed away from the free throw line So whatever the confusion cheering was didnt affect him with the free throw there Harris drains them both Hes got 18 Wake leads by two with a buck 20 left applause and cheering This is for the lead but cheering hes blocked it Loose ball to Tucker Eight to shoot Hutchinson down the alley Free throws coming for Longwood applause and cheering cheering Good job of contesting by Cal Mis Everybody holding the ball went up after the basketball Theres the block and it goes into Tuckers hands and cheering he bounds and bounds in some way or another A shot goes up and we got somebody up to the free throw line So you got a chance to do something with it Its a Hutchinson isnt it Yes Jakoy Hutchinson spent the last two years playing for GW Hes 10 for 10 from the line against hes about to attempt his first free throw of the night Number four free throw shooter in the Big South Shade under 88 Am I right on that Indeed you are my friend Had 11 straight double

result the rhythm the release the wrist Now cheering at the line score applause a threepoint game Evan real quick lets take a look to see if he comes comes up He looked like he got fouled Well he does

Cammy at the line cheering Nope cheering Not only does the game hang in the balance as the Emmy tries to make it a one possession game but everybody in the building gets free ChickfilA and he misses both these free throws Yeah I found out that goes for us too cheering applause Yeah it goes there Have three chickens tonight It goes there I like the lemonade myself Like the waffle fries Regular chicken or spicy chicken Spicy Okay 118 to go Threepoint game Cal me Get out of the corner Get it out of the corner Time out Steve Forbes That was a threeperson trap Two Lancers and Coach Thomas was right there on the bench And the sideline And the sideline Wake does need to get the ball across Pat or does it reset on the timeout Ive always been confused by this There was 11 I think theres 118 timeout time out Its a 30se second timeout Theyve got to get the ball over in what was it 11 seconds They got 118 seconds They got 7 seconds Get it over Wakes got the one time out left The possession arrow does belong to the Lancers So a tie up could create a game time chance for the boys from Farmville The post zero If theres a turnover if you if youre low you got to quickly look for that three supposed to go with his basket Mason uses Wakes final timeout You see what Im talking about Wakes going to have its hands fill hands full on Sunday Trying to escape and get to nine and three here today We havent even got to January yet conference play Nerves already bad 88 seconds left Mason throws it in Harris trapped and hes fouled I dont know Was he out of bounds I dont think so Justin Porterfield called the foul Richards where he was standing applause Juke is fine Theres the foul Okay See Richard came from out of bounds back in Yeah but the foul was called somewhere else So shoot the line Harris is 11 for 12 applause Still a threepoint game cheering So they went off into defense that a moment ago Five new bodies into the game for Longwoods And all those guys can either rebound in or shoot Ziami Kelly Hutchinson Thompson Tucker Harris needs him He missed it Threepoint game cheering Longwood with no timeouts 4 seconds Can the Lancers tie the game at THE BUZZER NO THEY CANNOT
