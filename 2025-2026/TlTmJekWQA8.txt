celebration at Cameron Indoor Stadium this evening Cooper flag and Khan Caniple also in the house So a lot of stars shining as we get underway and Syracuse wins the opening tip They committed 15 and 11 six and seven in the ACC and looking for a major upset on the road tonight in the conference Duke looking for win number 24 over the top and the tap is up and in by Kyle who can really sky the 6ix9ine senior to get the orange one what you love about JJ Sterling right out of the gate taking his time coming off that ball screen recognizing the help from the weak side and thats how you want to start the game if youre Syracuse to give yourself a chance got back in the lineup on Saturday despite an injury to the wrist and a foul as Evans went airborne Isaiah Evans could be a huge key tonight fouled by Kyle who picks up number one in the opening seconds Duke has defeated Syracuse 10 consecutive times They are 332 in their last 35 ACC games As mentioned they rose one spot in todays AP top 25 from 4 to three Michigan taking over the number one spot from Arizona When you think about this team 23 and2 overall 121 in the ACC Theyre on the one seed line They lead the country in top 25 quad one quad two wins And now ranked number two overall in Ken Palm And they are finetuning towards a national championship run Look at the Syracuse starting lineup That includes Starling the 64 senior They need his leadership in this building cuz a lot of the Orange players have never played in here before And this is a different animal for anybody when it come to Cameron Indor Stling on the attack trying to use the window Cant hit it Dame Sar out of the pack intelligent freshman He slams on the brakes cheering Taylor Foster and Camboozer who is really having an amazing season The only year hes going to play college basketball Hes going to flick that one out near midcourt Shot clock out seven He did Foster will drive cheering it And on the other side of the iron Boozer will finish that Hes just so active around the rim You can utilize him as a driver but also if you lose him he gets on the offensive glass Good kick George with the kick Fire that one up there and drain it Hes only 33 from three but that was all net So Nate George right there on that kick from the side His vision and just overall him settling into the game has been a difference for Syracuse the last two ball games Foster looking in looking for the cutter Cruiser will bounce for Gunbo and the blue Cant drop it down but he grabs his own miss Very active there playing with a bad wrist S will grab it and score He just seems to get better and better Boy his offense comes from his defense just being active on a defensive end Thats what youd love to see from Dame Sar attacking off the dribble instead of settling for a three early starting to pull a pop but too strong Gungbo with the rebound to number 10 in the country in offensive efficiency in the top three defensively Evans too strong Foster hustles for the rebound in the corner Boozer averaging 23 and 10 He has already won the rookie of the week in the ACC eight times Gunway trying to use that baseline to spin Nicely done Just showing you the size and the physicality of Gumball Just moving Freeman wherever he wants to on the lower block We talk about the Orange not a good threepoint shooting team They did hit 11 against Florida State So they have guys who can hit that shot They just have not hit enough of them And heres Donnie Freeman who is their number one score at 18 points a game Shot clock down to four Kings will let it fly Cant drain it We love the patience by Syracuse Those are the open looks So you got to knock down Kings a guy whos been shooting around 48 from the threepoint line in the last six games Evans slashing inside cant convert it Talk about Nate Kings the senior out of Salem Oregon He was the star on Saturday In the last couple of seconds hit a huge shot against SMU that won it in the dome for Syracuse Yeah just giving him an extra scoring punch Heavy traffic George denied Here come the Blue Devils Evans back for Foster Syracuse gets back defensively Foster kicking himself there We missed Ber for a lot of James Shot clock inside 10 Foster between the legs Tough sledding Rejected on the play Syracuses Kyle whos among the best in the country at rejecting shots Theyll swing it for Freeman Gets a great open look but he cant drag it But theyll get a second chance cheering Freeman the leading scorer on this team A lot of his shots come from continuity within the offense and he needs to get going in this game as hes one of the best scorers in the ACC Kind of gave it up late in the shot clock Hes down to one and the shot will go anyway Freeman a guy his size 69 can do a lot of things offensively Well thats the thing If Duke is going to switch on him he have a smaller Foster at 64 He could turn and face and just shoot the shot over the smaller defender Gunba on Freeman Oh lost him But the rejection again by Kyle His second in about 30 seconds on the run The slam by Kings Syracuse turning defense into offense They ran second in the conference in fast break points around 124 per game One of the things Duke talked a lot about today is off loose balls or turnovers getting back with transition defense cheering And what a physical game we got here Well Syracuse determining thats how they have to play no matter the opponent And Duke players telling each other all week we need to play with March Madness energy in these last six games Jay Obi he is no doubt the bonafide leader of this team And when you think about him hes a perfect marriage of production and efficiency Even though he missed that shot down there it will be the strength the power the force and ultimately the feel of the game is what makes him a spectacular college basketball player Is there a template to beat Duke and to tie him up the way North Carolina did I I think you got to give him multiple reads defensively and you got to determine his vision overall The more he turns the ball over the better position youre in to win that game They commend his 68 freshman now to the prey for John Sh This team holding opponents to 63 points a game This is a tremendous defensive team Duke always has a good defensive unit This is one of their best Thatll spin out for Boozer Grabs his own miss and right back up People are so good at inverting their high pick and rolls for a smaller guard to come set the screen for Cameron who can either be an elite passer or a big time shot maker off the dribble Another good look for Freeman cant knock it down Kaden Boozer kind of tumbling through the lane off to Saw Rebound tapped around right to midcourt and right back at it with a reset of the shot clock at 20 now 30 Syracuse is going to have to keep off the offensive glass And cheering the drive by Boozer Kayen Boozer all the way through Coming off a good game on Saturday against Clemson you know but ultimately for Syracuse you have to be met with force if Duke is going to be able to get in the gaps And this is about the fourth or fifth possession in which nobodys met a Duke player at the rim with any kind of physical contact Started with a tough pass in the paint and a whistle a foul against Duke 1224 to go in the first half guarding Camboozer Yeah just meeting him early trying to front the post Donnie Freeman doing a really good job of fighting for position just trying to ultimately deter Duke from giving the ball over the top And you have to meet him early He does such a good job of establishing post position because he sprints down the floor and its going to take consistent effort by Syracuses bigs to meet him early and contest Brown with a foul And a front rim by Kyle III senior from Nebraska Cam getting a little bit of a breather here in the opening minutes at Cameron Indoor with a lot of NBA talent watching him That includes scouts but also guys who are getting it done in the league or New Jersey last year like these guys Cooper flag in the building Tom Alawatch Khan Canipple as well in the building When you think about a team last year I mean what talent they have with those players in that starting five Tyresese Proctor here the other day as well Thatll go the other way at 1205 And the way those guys have flourished in the league makes you think you know of teams that havent won it and this was one and done for a bunch of these guys but didnt win the national championship It came oh so close They got a chance to watch that game Oie where Dallas played the Charlotte Hornets and Cooper Flag went for 40 plus Coniple went for 37 38 points And youre sitting there watching these two in a battle for rookie of the year in the NBA and both played on the same team last year for John Sher cheering They were rookies George looking to penetrate Cant get inside Tosses it over the top The pass was there Suare could not finish 69 Akir Suare transfer from Georgia Tech passing fancy and Gunbas going to flare out to the weak side here and youre going to see Isaiah Evans pop up to the space and its going to leave open a driving side for Cameron Boozer Everybody talks about his scoring What they dont talk enough music about is his elite passm ability his vision as he sees and feels the pressure music on that left shoulder He turns over it and hits Isaiah Evans averaging around four assists per game will be his pass making ability and his ability to make plays off the dribble is what makes him one of the most unique players we have in the game of college basketball Syracuse off the quick inbounds and cant get the hit from White By the way Duke without an assist to this point by basket So a little unusual It just gives John Sher such a utility because he can do it in a variety of the ways Brown going in strong and hell draw the foul 119 Duke on his very court Coach K WJO sitting next to him A reminder man he had a lot of great guards So many great guards from Steve Wahowski to Kyrie Irving to John Sh to Nolan Smith to JJ Reick The names just go on and on and on And uh you know that those faces are faces Im very familiar with Obviously you know will be playing for both of those guys And Ill tell you what their stairs could be uh pretty intimidating Yeah yours yours could be too with that banner up there One of the great guards in college basketball history I had a lot of fun man It was uh it was great to play here but more importantly I think we get a chance to watch some great guards on this court tonight And some great freshman in the game Well talk about that not only in this game but all over the country this year as Ken Anthony with his dad in the stands gets to work down the lane and left the pass right in the hands of Kaden Boozer finding Brown the kick out trying to get closer as we approach the 11 minute mark and a take one early Bruiser hooks up with his brother passing so often and so well Further out of the game right now in heavy traffic and Evans takes a knock and hell head to the line Isaiah Evans the 66 sophomore coming in averaging 14 a game closer to 17 a game in ACC play It was such a great defensive possession by Syracuse and just Evans got Betsy to bite on the ball fake and Duke works on that a ton They used to call it for coach passing where they would pass the ball down the floor and they would have pads and you had to crack into your defender with that outside shoulder forcing you to kind of maintain your balance and finish at the rim Isaiah Evans one of the best on this team at doing so Well right now Duke on a nine nothing run So they open up a 169 advantage Anthony off for George and the point guard seen a real key in this one fly and nothing but net from threepoint land You know hes one of the best playmakers in the conference and really found his rhythm the last couple of games averaging 16 points per game for this month And him finding his rhythm gives an addition to Donnie Freeman and JJ Stage from a scoring perspective he has to have a game in order for them to win Suarezs second foul trying to contain Gungba Red Autry his third season at Syracuse just 210 against AP ranked opponents and facing the number three team in the country here tonight He said its all about opportunity Thats what Im preaching to my guys You got a chance in games like this and with North Carolina coming up Louisville coming up You got a chance to get back on that bubble All Texas has won They have four quad one games coming up at Duke Obviously tonight at Wake at War on the road but still the ACC affords you opportunity to play yourself into the tournament Well right now its looking like at least eight teams are headed for the NCAA tournament Nice cut there and Emanuel finished that and hung on the rim for a moment but Duke on top 182 Anthony just got caught staring at the ball Kameha recognized it and gave a sharp cut Syracuse a program with 41 trips to the NCAA tournament six trips to the Final Four So much of that under the great hall of famer Jim Beheim of course decade after decade of excellence Try to get back to those days Shot clock a factor down to three Betsy let it fly Second chance and the swing here for Anthony Got an open look and misfired Anonys one of those players when he sees the ball go in he just continues to let it fly Scored all 13 of his points in the second half in that game the other night Really helped them down the stretch get a win Duke playing a lengthy stretch here without Cam Boozer But they got that man Theyve got the slim reaper Isaiah Evans filling it up And this is their biggest lead tonight Houston and you think about how Houston plays with the physicality and they typically play older guards They defer to the young freshman whos leading them in points per game One of the best freshman we have I I swear this is from a productivity perspective the best freshman class I think weve had in the history of college basketball Im not saying all these names OB are going to pan out to be perennial allstars but weve had 30 30 point games Weve had 12 games where players have scored over 40 points as freshman in college basketball An incredibly deep class I mean Cam Boozer twice has scored 35 That hasnt been done by a Duke freshman of all the great freshman theyve had Hes back in the game here Five to get a shot off now for the Blue Devils Backing into the paint faking Stumbled a bit He traveled with it Now Molly you were checking in on the huddles moments ago What you learn Yeah in the team huddles Duke head coach John Sh was reminding his team that we have in the game of college basketball today I think the great Dick Vital would agree with you with all the diaper dandies he has seen over the years that this class is something really special Syracuse only one for their last nine shooting They need a bucket Theyre not going to get it here on the runout Start trying to beat the field Slams it down Syracuse making their last one of 10 shot attempts from the field and theyre in a dangerous position right here Duke starting to find their rhythm They have to value the ball and take high efficient shots Greenland cheering another good look Another misfire So hes chilly Not a good sign for the Orange at all And a foul off the ball at the 710 mark 2312 the Blue Devils defense is triggering it Isaiah Evans doing a really good job of contesting You talk about the vision of Cameron Boozer What an outlet pass to Sar whos able to give a big time finish Duke one of the top defensive teams in the nation They get so many deflections and they contest every shot at the rim I thought the game that Cory and I had with Dicky V on Saturday they played their best defense in the last couple of years And they held Clemson to 54 points I dont think Clint has been held to 54 points in the last four years Foul here as Kyle went strong and finally the Orange get a make They were in dire need of that One of the great leapers in college basketball Sar with the foul The foul line has been a real issue for Syracuse Theyve cost themselves a couple of games and Kyle is only 50 because of that form Not just free throws but Donnie Freeman needs to get going If youre going to beat a top five program on the road in their gym your best player needs to bring it And he needs to get quality touches in positions on the floor where he can score Man is he a difference maker or what He has nine first half points Hes making shots That changes everything when youre trying to guard the Blue Devils Him working on his game this offseason putting the ball on the ground and not being a onedimensional player has really been the difference He keeps the defense honest Now Kings along Yes And a nice answer there for Nate Kings the senior Five points for him Syracuse trying to stay connected here Cameron Indor long one Yes sir He can do that too One of the top five scorers in America Seven points for Camboozer Freeman just threw it away Bad pass in transition Foster Evans again to fight for the rebound Freeman will come away with it Hes getting seven a game Kyle at the line Wont shoot it And a kick cheering ball Five and a half to go before the break As you see youre going to see this screen The screens going to come right down this way in this area here And watch how he hits him on the screen Actually cracks into him and it just opens up that entire lane Kyle has been told to stay with Boozer cuz he can pick and pop But defense needs to come from the weak side to help on that gap Kyle looking for an opening to slam it but a miss Gunbo went down again Hes playing on a tender wrist Slapped away in a foul here against Syracuse Gungba slow to get to the other end Lets see if he hangs in there Took a hit and talking with John Sh Did he get hit in the face a little bit shaken up 522 to go and do Sar to the line Another guy who struggles shooting free throws only 55 Yeah theyre going to need Gungba to make a run in the ACC and for a national title Size in his frame he can deter so many shots at the rim but also him staying out of foul trouble He was in foul trouble against North Carolina in foul trouble against Clemson making smarter plays and decisions on the defensive end is going to be critical for his overall maturity He did get hit in the mouth so it was not a wrist issue Sar to shoot One of the many impressive things about Cam Boozer he just stays out of foul trouble generally Hes just so consistent Hey hes such a high basketball IQ player cheering and you can trust him when you have a player who runs your front line that way Also from a communications perspective George all over him Such a plus defender Shot clock to five Stlings got to make a move Got the shot up in and out Kyle grabbed the rebound and stuffed it Thats what you love about Kyle He may struggle from the free throw line but that does not mean that he does not need to be active in attacking the offensive glass Outstanding defender UCLA transfer He had six blocks against Tennessee this season Pass Brown Theyll swing it Foster the open shooter air mails it and they cant save it So its back over to the orange here with 429 to go in the half Yeah I thought that was one pass too many Cameron Boozer had a wide open shot in the corner You got to shoot that Syracuse has dropped six of their last nine despite winning the last two in ACC play They go to Chapel Hill next Saturday and they still have to go to Louisville as well Kings the hero on Saturday Gets the shot out Yes And a triple Tell you a guy 27 against Cal last Wednesday An elite shooter and also you know a southpaw lefty which can throw you off defensively and how you guard a guy like that You got to stay on that left shoulder Camboozer on a spin to his right and draws the whistle with 356 remaining in the half Nice bounce back here for the Orange They were right on the cusp of this one getting away in favor of Duke They made a couple of big way If you want some entertainment listen to what Seth Greenberg is going to say at halftime as it relates to Jerome Tang Him and I are lock step I am in agreement I think its an absolute shame what Kansas State and their athletic director is trying to do They owe him 1875 million He has not done anything egregious or anything to embarrass the university He should be paid If you want to fire a coach fire him You dont need to fire him with cost in order to not pay out the payout Well Duke had an 11point lead in this game Its now to seven under four minutes to go Syracuse with the basketball John Shorer table but Syracuse to check it in cheering SU a huge win over SMU at the dome on Saturday in the last two seconds Just look at the ball pressure SAR is putting on George Duke won a challenge in the timeout moments ago on a common foul The back shot wont go Boozer collecting the rebound but a foul on the deck Thats where Kyle wound up on his back Hes having a superb defensive first half Brown with a foul Hes just so active and you saw Brown and Foster trying to squeeze him there but his arms got tangled up Lets go to Molly McGrath Well OB William Kyle III one of the best shot blockers in the country and he said the art of blocking shots is all about timing which he perfected in track and field when he was a high jumper He always tells himself get in the right position to be the second jumper for a clean block Hes had a couple of those tonight He also competed in long distance running saying a lot of bigs my size dont move the way I do I see that foundation of track and field and my lateral quickness and the fluidity of my movement And hes been a factor here early guys Oh footwork is absolutely the key isnt it Molly and Jay I remember they talked about Bill Russell They say he had the footwork of a great boxer inside the rim And so often Bill Russell many would say the greatest shot blocker of all time kept the ball in bounds He wouldnt reject it 14 rows Yeah Just the ultimate touch right And thats what William Kyle does coming over from the weak side Its very springy in the way he could jump but also you know Obi to your point not only footwork conditioning You know each and every possession he is sprinting down the court Not only is he blocking shots but hes also meeting Gunga and Cameron Boozy Boozer early and forcing them to make it difficult to let them get paint position George will pull up from 13 and knock it down of the Orange continue to make shots here again Duke had an 11point lead down to five So theyve whittleled it away Joyce finally playing with the pace you saw him play at last year offensively at Georgia Tech And Boozer kicks it to his brother in the corner Pretty open look and a triple cheering Five points for Kaden Boozer Had a really strong game against Clemson on Saturday Starling gives it up Thats the very good shooter When he gets rolling theyd like him to shoot more to be a little more greedy offensively Kaden Boozer and a pass too strong But there is a whistle on the play Lee Cassell calling a foul on the entry with 203 to go And this Thursday nights ESPN womens basketball double header coming your way Number nine Duke and NC State at 7 followed by seventh ranked LSU taking on number 17 Old Miss Like everything else both available on the ESPN app Carol music Lawson the coach at Duke came out said hello during the mens workout earlier today Shes coming off a big win over North Carolina I tell you you could tell from the first day when she was on TV that she was going to be a star Watching her time with the Boston Celtics Now obviously being here over at Duke she was a tremendous basketball player a person who has a very very high basketball IQ Obie US Olympic coach Great selection Gungb at the line 68 Four points in the first half for Gungar his roommates with Camboozer on the road cheering Freeman Stling for the Notre Dame player Hands it off right along the sideline and a whistle I know Syracuse and their guards between George and Kings and Stling can take shots from the outside but Donnie Freeman who leads this team in scoring each and every night has only four shot attempts in the first half Now a lot of that is predicated upon Dukes defense and being physical with him but also I think sometimes he gets lost within the offense and Syracuse needs to make him a priority Aaron toss just thrown out a play by Kings A messy play for the Orange Only three turnovers for them Duke has won 29 consecutive home games Jane mentioned the quad one wins Theyre tops in America with 10 of those and they have eight wins over top 25 opponents Those are the major reason why off the double fake and finishes cheering that he had a foul too Hes so patient offensively Thats the inverted screen where a smaller comes instead of pick for him but he just carves his way to the basket Camboozer out in front Evans hangs on to it Left it short Camboozer cheering with another two So that gives him 12 points and 10 rebounds already A double double And were not done with the first half cheering And Duke with their biggest lead cheering Nathan George out by the logo 10 to get off a shot Heres Freeman trying to make a spin move cheering How about a great play by Gumbo Keep that alive Whos there to the slam And it happens cheering that quickly here That relentless defense for Duke An 11 nothing run right before halftime cheering Heres Freeman to pull up No And the heave at the buzzer wont go But Duke with an explosion waits How often have we seen that here And they lead it Donnie Freeman hes personally taking on that challenge And OB thats what I love to see when the best players on each team decide to draw a line in the sand and guard each other Duke with the ball as we open up the second 20 minutes and leading by 16 Whos bouncing for Gunbo Been really active offensively getting inside Got the shot he wanted to tip it in If you allow him to catch the ball that deep in the paint with his size his frame theres no stopping them You got to get help coming down to clamp down on that Try to dig in to get the ball Syracuse is not a team that can shoot their way back into it if they fall behind by a whole lot Theyre not a good threepoint shooting team and they were just four for 16 in the first half And theres Freeman in close You like what Red would do out of the opening play in the second half making it a priority to get their best player of the ball and he needs to get going offensively You do that by designing a play for him to start the second half Syracuse trying to put a lock on Gunbud Its once again I mean you talk about a physical game He gets the ball that low and he has such a quick second jump to get that offensive rebound off his own miss Foster jumping high the line and hell swish in a triple Those first five minutes here at Cameron Indor can be so deadly Duke over the last two years is 586 They have the best record in college basketball at home Theyve been unbeatable cheering And this team can find a third and fourth option that consistently steps up to score the ball Thats when theyll be the best determinant to win a championship Time out Syracuse with ball movement playing with more strain but he loved his teams ability to respond told them we have been here before but they need to punch back right now Obie now Marley played a lot of close games this one is not right now so they have shown the ability at times to come back this is a different animal here at Cameron Indoor the layin wont go fighting for the rebound surrounded by the white shirts He made it anyway and hell be headed to the line looking for a threepoint play You know when you think about Syracuse theyve shown the ability to beat some really good teams before and obviously it starts with effort and thats what you question sometimes with Syracuse Which Syracuse teams are you going to get And that is a great example of Kyle right there through five white jerseys powering the ball up strong for the finish formerly the Summit Leagues defensive player of the year Theres a lot of work to do at the foul line 4828 similar to SMU Now theyre going to now they go to Boozer for an easy dunk 14 points for the man vying for national player of the year ACC player of the year Startling on Foster turns the fire left it short Gunga yanking down the rebound You know Syracuse if theyre going to play that zone just have to communicate with screens Gunga set a heck of a screen and nobody talked to almost hit the shot too Hell be headed the line to shoot a couple Now heres the screen I was talking about here Youre going to see it coming as Watch Gung by here Hes going to come up for that screen Thats Thats the way you do it here Here comes the screen He pins off Boom Plays right behind the zone Thats how you have to do it You seal you take all the attention away You play behind the zone If youre Camera Boozer youre going to get a shot at the rim every time On his way to another major night And you realize that he scored at least 14 with five rebounds and two assists in all 25 games That was coming into play tonight the longest such streak of any mens or womens player at any point in the division one career in this century when you add in the assists as part of that equation Yeah it reminds me a lot of Shangon that plays for the Houston Rockets and a lot of people like to say well he lacks explosiveness You dont need explosiveness when you can car people out with angles of attack and thats how he plays Arrey called him a a college joic earlier today They did Asking for comparison A dunk there by Kyle Man can he elevate He can get in the air as fast as anybody in college basketball On the roll Boozer trying to go over the top And a great defensive play by Kyle Hes just so active He gets so many deflections Its fun to watch play defense The turner on top and thatll drop for Donnie Freeman Thats how Donnie likes to play He can drive He can spin off that right shoulder Reverse pivot and can shoot a little fade away Such an NBA move Six points Hes averaging 18 Foster to drive it Hands off and easy slam for the 611 gun Yeah thats where you like Caleb Foster to be Hes so good when hes able to attack downhill because he draws so much awareness from the defense He can great for other players Getting into the scoring comments 17point game against SMU He can do that too Heres Freeman again Kyle on the baseline Shot clock to seven Spinning right into Gumbbo and slams another one home Hes been excellent Has 12 points tonight Averaging just nine points a game So not a major scorer but hes scoring tonight They need three more just like it 5434 Cant lose it Why leave the ball Why leave the ball If youre If youre forced to switch you have to stay at home Force him to take a difficult shot You never leave the man with the ball Coming up on the 15minute mark at Cameron Nathan George the point guard Hes been pretty quiet They kind of needed a step up from him Shot clock at seven Freeman again on Sar pushed away Three to get off the shot Working out of a double is startling Yes just in time Great patience right there by Donna Freeman to force the double team do continue to impress with so many interchangeable parts They can switch positions one through five Even bigs can guard the perimeter Another touch for Boozer on Kyle has him on the hip Still working so strong with that lower half Also hes so patient Hell just utilize so many head fakes around the rim and hell just weigh you out and utilize that footwork to find a better angle In the game against Stanford in the first half he outscored Stanford by himself 20 to 19 His 20 tonight along with 10 rebounds Kyle into the paint and it is fired And think about this race for national player of the year I got a chance Arizona versus Texas Tech to see JT Very true Work comes first Obie But still got a chance to play with Reggie and I you know what hes been able to do now in business and obviously working alongside Barack Obama What an incredible story What a glue guy Double fake there by Boozer and hell draw another foul Hes just been relentless tonight Eric Cameron indoor Do you think the college product is superior to the NBA product right now Right now yes I think every single night when you turn on college basketball you have a top 15 top 20 matchup and you see the best players playing Now I I know theres a lot of tanking going on in the NBA I think one of the reasons there is tanking similar to every year in the NBA so you can get guys like a Cooper flag or thats how San Antonio was built So once again I think the depth of this freshman class you see a lot of teams that are trying to best position themselves to get top tier talent but whether thats AJ Deva Darren Peterson Kingston Williams Katon Waggler the names go on and on and on that are showcased each and every night We have great games Sar with a foul Of course nothing better than Ernie Kenny Charles and Shaq Got an ESPN NBA Friday doubleheaded Mavs Timberwolves 730 and then the Clippers and the Lakers Ernie and the guys getting it going with the tip off at 630 Get a chance to see Cooper Flag going against AntMan who put on quite the display during AllStar weekend He just loved his sense of urgency and the passion that he plays with cheering Kayen Anthony with his dad in the stands tonight with a turnaround and cant knock it down Big rebound there by and one coming that wont drop cheering Nothing doing from outside that threepoint line starting with a miss and Duke with a 6037 advantage You got a chance to call the Clemson game just the level physicality that Duke plays with consistently on both the offensive and defensive end I dont know if any other team in America plays that way You may very well be looking at the best team in America here tonight as Sley will draw the foul Were going to find out a lot better coming next Saturday when Duke takes on Michigan the new number one on ESPN So thatll be number one against number three 13 minutes to go and Stling at the line just 54 You know you talk about some great basketball We get a chance to watch Duke and Michigan cheering in the top five matchup in the nations capital and also the welcoming of a beautiful granddaughter Granddaughter number two Thats my Lucy Yes How do you feel to be a granddad again man How how incredible was that experience Are my feet even touching the ground I dont think theyve touched the ground since our granddaughter Mave was born 5 months ago And now Lucy Jensen How about this 8 lb 14 oz Just cheering shy of 9 lb and gorgeous to boot Its the best thing weve ever done man Its incredible I love that for you man We are just my wife and I and our entire family We are so blessed And that little baby went home today Well I love that And I love for you to go home tomorrow and give her a big hug man You deserve it A very kind of you Mike by a very kind partner And a drive there by Boozer to lay it in Kaden Boozer Theyre just adding on now 6538 I was going to reference when you said Are your feet touching the ground Well I never really see them touch the ground in these high chairs recently No were were up here a little bit and I kind of hang over a little bit Yours touch Hey look I I have a Kevin Hart simplex too So Im the same way man Same thing Its just incredible Charles Barkley was talking about this when we did a game earlier this season when he said you know everyone talks about being a grandfather or a grandmother and the greatest thing is you get to give them back at the end of the day He said What happens if youre like me and you dont want to give them back We just hold on to them Yeah Hold on to them Exactly Cuz they are so precious And little Lucy and her mom Samantha and my soninlaw Alex did such a great job And they are such proud parents Seriously the way youve talked about your grandkids the way you talk about your daughters uh its really a privilege to work with you man And and to see how how many years youve sacrificed to call games youre away from your family to see you enjoy that time is extremely enjoyable Oh youre a sweetheart Yeah 6540 And my man Dicky V who is a great dad and also a a great one as far as the fight a warrior as far as fighting cancer and he has done that throughout his incredible music career The drive to surpass 120 million The gala coming up can get on right now and bid for that Porsche Its incredible how successful he has been And coming off the bench has buried a couple of threes running away with this Yeah Kameha is going to be big for them He gives him depth off the bench He gives him physicality with his perimeter defense and also another player with a great IQ cheering on the baseline 1139 to go and a 28point lead for the Duke Blue Devils combined with that physicality makes him one of one I know JC Toppin AJ Deansa Braden Smith other players names are involved in that conversation but it is Cameron Boozers to lose Showing that again tonight here against Syracuse with a look and buries the three So he has nine for the Orange with a loss tonight They will drop to 15 and 12 and six and eight in the ACC And some tough schedule left for Red Autry in Syracuse Brown zipping the pass Evans wants to get closer on the run Lays it in It to watch the evolution in this game Last year he was just a catch and shoot player and this year he draws so much attention because theres such a sense of urgency to close out and bounce that he could put the ball down the ground and create at the rim It just adds such a different dimension to this team You know it still feels like Duke hasnt reached their ceiling yet offensively Theres still so much room for growth Thats a scary part about who this team is Dumbo with the dunk However on defense they are flat Theyre right at the very top of any run I would say them and Arizona are two of the best defensive teams And also Duke the second tallest team in the nation as well So that size and that length is what they use in the defensive end Look at that Right on Q right poked away by Brown who is incredible Earns himself a slam dunk Malik Brown who leads Duke in deflections Hes got about 140 of them Its a great steal by Malik Brown Just dont know why youre Donnie Freeman Why Why are you going for the steal Just take a hard foul White drawing a foul Made the shot Hes headed for the line 7445 And for more on tonight lets toss it down to Molly McGrath Well OB Duke head coach John Shy was reminding his team in the last timeout dont look at the score You need to continue to play together Theyve been talking about cohesiveness and energy And Cam Boozer told us the goal for these final six games of the regular season is that cohesion and that effort saying we have to keep improving This is a crucial time to improve cheering before March And these games are the difference between a one seed and a four seed So theyre focused just getting better here tonight Hopefully not looking at the score You know Marley youre exactly right Nobody says that the number three team in the nation cant continue to get better at the end of February As you finetune you get ready for the ACC tournament you still have some big games left on the schedule You take one game at a time I know people hate cliches but still the the room for improvement on how to continue to get better defensively add depth with a guy like Kameha who had some injuries early Youre looking at a team that could be 8 N deep and thats what makes them scary when they enter March We talked cheering about how they can really you know improve a little bit offensively Well theyve made 13 out of 15 shots in the second half Talking about Duke to have this huge lead 7449 and a foul with 915 to go And coming up next on ESPN and the ESPN app its the game of the night Number two Houston taking on number six Iowa State At least Bam Jami told me to say that is the game of the night Hes got it coming up with France Show in a moment What a display Iowa State put on the other day against Kansas Talk about this beating Kansas at Hton Coliseum Evans again applause No answer for him in as well Imagine the very very old days if those two had been able to play together here Well you think about it Cooper flag is actually in this class He reclassified for last year He would have been in the depth of this freshman class this season Foul is 848 to go I know that sounds like a get off my lawn guy but that was a million years ago But fun to think about Oh most definitely You know just the way he plays the level You you think about another player that played here as a freshman Kyrie Irving played 11 games The relationship that he has with Cougar cheering Flag how they train together each and every day for Jason Kidd and the Dallas Mavericks hes had a very special rookie year and it feels like hes just scratching the surface Diane Anthony lifting a nothing but net He can shoot it Yeah he got going in their last game against SMU in the second half Scored all 12 of his points but like I said hes a guy that once he sees the ball go in he has a green light to keep shooting top recruit And by the way like I I give him so much credit for how he responded after his dad made a tweet You know obviously a lot of people have opinions on how he should be played but he deleted social media and hes came back to work for the Syracuse Army Well Malik Brown so unselfish pride that one free made a nice pass Duke continues to play at a high level despite the huge lead Long distance shot by White wont go Syracuse one and done I got to tell you Obie how excited I am for Saturday Getting a chance to see Duke Cameron Boozer going against EXO Landenburg Two of the top bigs we have in the nation playing each other in the nations capital Well have game day there Elliot Cadell a guy that Duke has seen multiple times playing for North Carolina last year and obviously playing for Michigan this year Michigan just as well could win a national title And theyre both just absolutely rolling going into that playing at such a high level That should be a dandy coming down the stretch The way they shoot the ball the pace in which they play especially at home they could be anybody in the nation in that place And their crowd is incredible Out of the inbounds theres Kings with a miss Duke continuing to play sensational basketball They blew out Clemson here and what we all thought might be a nip and tuck affair down the last couple of possessions on Saturday Anything but the second half and Clemsons a really good basketball team especially on the defensive end but totally shut down by the Duke Blue Devils That one tossed out of play cheering and it was tipped 8152 You talk about some national player of the year candidates as I may mention before of Cameron Boozer averaging pretty much a double double Same with JT Toppin Saw him the other night against Texas Tech AJ Devonta and a player well get a chance to see Saturday Yexo Landenburg so skilled on the perimeter You know both him and Boozer are guys that you can invert the offense around because they can handle the Soul hits the deck as he draws a foul Six and a half to go And the reaction at the end get paid more But still if you believe in a coaching staff and you believe they have the right skill development around you you can stay at one location and continue to improve and be a transformation transformative player the following season And he could be that A lot of talent there Youre watching him shoot around today Had some nice games too He had 19 against Delaware State had 18 against Northwestern So when he gets rolling as you said sees it go down he can really shoot it Exactly I just had to say I just Everybody wants results Everybody wants to throw gasoline on the fire and he has a chance to be a special player Just some players it takes some time and thats okay His dad was one in a billion George doubled up around the coach K logo Look at that Thats cheering Harris Foster couldnt convert That would have been a cherry on top But another great defensive play Tremendous hustle by Duke despite the huge lead But a nice drive there for two Up and in by Nate Kings I mean is it a tie ball game or is Duke up 30 just with the sense of urgency theyre playing on the defensive end Now John Shs got to love it The end to end effort Harris open Yes So swish in a three Darren Harris a sophomore out of Virginia cheering getting involved applause Well thats what you get when you dive on the floor for a loose ball The basketball guys reward you with the open three Good Kings will kick it back out Jump shot wont drop for Betsy Return shot wont fall for Suare And with five minutes to go Foster will drive and kick Browns open And more good hustle by Amena but turned back over to Syracuse Little twoonone action Betsy will drive it and follow his own miss 87 56 So Duke about to win their 30th consecutive home game and about to beat Syracuse for the 11th consecutive time Red Autry and the Orange hoping to spring an upset They were in it the first half for most of it Up and in by Amena Theyll be headed for the line in a threepoint play Has 10 points But a good game off the bench This is a team thats up 30 points And once again getting a deflection and Anthony not even diving Harris diving on the floor up 30 to extend the possession Now Duke doesnt finish it there but then Harris gets rewarded the next possession for a three Name with the threepoint play Duke hits 90 You cant just play hard when you want to turn the light switch on You have to keep that light switch on 247 365 It becomes a habit It did for you Before you after you after coach K And now John Sh Heres a turnover Jimenea in the open floor off for Boozer And thats goending Count that basket And then just doing a really good job in those gaps active hands Once again deflection after deflection automatically looking up after the steel What a great end of the year stretch were going to have Whether its the Big 12 you got the Big 10 with Michigan and other teams playing in that league ACC the SEC Its going to be one hell of a finish And still some great outofconerence games like Duke and Michigan next Saturday switched in Duke with an impressive allound performance There was one stretch where they made 13 out of 14 shots to begin the second half Well weve been raving about their defense Kaden Boozer off of Foster The swing Ken Boozer and blocked by Kings with nine on the shot clock Three minutes to go Duke has been sensational again here tonight and had the ball Kaden Boozer with the pass They just continue to add on cheering applause She coming off the bench So even the guys who never play are getting an opportunity to push them to 100 Yeah he was Cooper Flags primary defender last year in practice And you think about Duke winning this game John Shire is going to go on to become 61 and3 here at Cameron Endor Stadium 61 and three Thats a 95 winning percentage Are you kidding me Look at what theyre shooting here in the second half 78 Just blew the orange away at the start of the second half really in the last couple of minutes before halftime when they went on an 11 nothing run and opened it up by 16 but then no sense of competitiveness after that when the second half started applause So Duke will roll to another impressive win Of course they had the last second loss to North Carolina Other than that I mean nobody is touching them Not close Amen Gets it back Scott to drive it on the spin move Cant bank it in I think about this Saturday I know we talk a lot about on the court but the XNO mastery of Dusty May versus John Shider Talk about two of the elite coaches in college basketball going headtohead in the nations capital 128 to go You think about one joyous father watching his son play and the other not so much Daddy Boozer and Daddy Melo saying What is going on cheering Syracuse hoping to return to the glory days but they are getting torn apart here tonight I tell you getting having a chance to watch both of those guys play in the NBA obviously watching Carlos when he got drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers and the career he had with the Utah Jazz and the Chicago Bulls And obviously Carmelo Anthony one of the most lethal scorers the game of basketball has ever seen ever seen Betsy will knock down a triple Just not enough of those when they really needed them as Duke ran away and hid tonight at Cameron as they have against so many Harris with the kick to Kaden Gizer and an open three as they get to 98 Hes had backtoback 12point games and hes going to be critical for them as they end the season and just a guy who continues to learn how to play A lot of it comes with repetition but is able to move Caleb Foster off the ball make life a lot easier Had a great game in their last game against Clemson Just made incredible reads They actually have a decision tracker with them so they can help him make the reads on both the defensive and offensive end Well Jmana can hit that cheering all day and he gets him over a hundred to 101 cheering So the Blue Devils in a blowout on a big Monday No contest here against Syracuse tonight So Duke improves to 131 in the ACC They continue to be kings of the hill in the Atlantic Coast Conference And that kind cheering of a fitting way to end it with a theft because their defense was suffocating They hold Syracuse to 64 Thats about the average for John Shs team His team is unbelievable on the defensive end Tonight they get 101
