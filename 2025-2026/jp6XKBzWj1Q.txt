Dort for Cal He is out tonight Mark Madson hoping its not a longterm thing He is here He is on the bench But Milo Elich makes his first start of the season Jumping center He wins the tip against Alex Steen And off we go from the Tucker Center in Tallahassee And Florida State starts in the manto man And you notice its Tomasong against Pippen Theyre trying to defend him with size Justin Pippen hands it off to the former Virginia standout Day Ames And this is Camden who misses his first shot Good pursuit of the rebound Leay Jones Hes had his best three rebounding games of the season Florida States last three ball games The song in the starting five with McCrae Jones Wiggins and Steen inside Chanty Wiggins for three And you never know when he gets off and can get going and then sometimes he can just disappear But thats a good sign for Florida State Ames Pippen Camden Bell cheering and Elich Only the fourth different starting lineup for Cal Its the first time theyve started a game all season without Lee Dort who left the Stanford game with 1038 remaining on Saturday Did not return But what a win for the Bears at Maples Pavilion They were down 16 early storming back and then hanging on late against Ibuko Cory and the Cardinal Florida State can switch cheering just about everything because McCrae is their shortest guy Hes 64 Oh what defense swarming seinals come up with a steal Wiggins other side Same result 6 nothing They like that one here He can be really good in the catch and shoot And Cal just cannot afford to give up those kinds of turnovers Theyve got to be able to get back and set the defense Hippen goes to work on Steen The rebound pinballs its way outside to the big man from Florida State And now Steen diving kicking Le Jones three offensive board Bong and Cal dodges the bullet Was very nearly eight or nine nothing right there Seminals coach Luke LZ is already going to his bench Hes got his first sub of the game at the scorers table less than two minutes in I think Cals got to challenge this defense by trying to penetrate into the lane cheering Another terrible pass Chris Bell throws it right to Jones cheering Wide open again Bong air ball on the offensive glass Florida State has come out with a ton of energy and yet its still just 6 nothing Fouls on Bon Excuse me I didnt mean to do that laughter What does it say to you that Cals 0 for two and Florida States two for seven laughter Roger Ays leads the officiating crew tonight An extraordinary ref trio with Ron Groover and Lee Cassell And Rogers talking trash to coach He did say he got one right which is unusual for him especially early It usually takes a while to get one right Great crew And thats just we were talking about Cal to be successful They had shot the three pretty well in their last couple games And this was a team that they recruited to be a very good shooting team And Mark Madston said they just havent shot the ball as well as anticipated but theyve got to get the ball into the lane and be able to kick it out for open threes Californias turned it over twice and given up three offensive rebounds And yet its a threepoint game as Day Ames buries the three Well you dont turn it over and you move the ball and get a wideopen three Thats the best offensive set that theyve had so far Day Ames 17 points of all game for Cal Jones with a little bit of a mismatch Shoots over Ames in and out Rebound Pippen Thats really tough shot Really good defense by Ames California came across the country yesterday Traveling just one day early for their ACC games this year We get another whistle Thats what they have to do They have to get the penetration that youre talking about Then they can get some open looks The switching defense hurts them a little bit They they they need to get penetration a little harder though Foul was on Somerville Chris Bell Thought he was going to hit his first shot for you coach but not quite When he hits his first one he really gets confidence Well we got ourselves a tie game Justin Pippen knocks in the three Well we talked about Camden before the game but Pippen has been fabulous the last two games as well And again they they move the ball and they get a wideopen shot cheering It looked like Mark Madson might need to take an early timeout but the Bears have stabilized Mark Madson on his 50th birthday by the way in cheering a defensive stance for a moment on the Cal bench Camden the rebound Outlet was looking for Bell Intercepted by his teammate Pippen Got to look out for Ames quickness Yeah but hes going against size and thats really a nice job by Joe moving his feet Ames travels Its Cals third turnover Good news for the Bears as Justin Pippen has now made a three in 14 games in a row Gets it out of the way early tonight 66 first half Tower has We talked earlier about the Cal Bears and John Camden has had two really good games and this is what he does so music well When he gets an open three hes dead Doesnt do too much of this but if you run out on him he can get past you And Justin music Pippen has also had two excellent games recently This is really well done here Well hes a good player It runs in the family I think I see Scotty over there And you know when you talk about Scotty Pippen youre talking about probably the best twoway player that ever played basketball And his sons are really good players Not quite like the D Well thats hard to live up to But here you can see what has gone on that good things really do happen for Cal when Camden and Pippen both can put up good offensive numbers Well as a team the Bears are shooting 47 from three in their last two games 24 of 51 Previous three games which they lost them all They were shooting 23 from three Well and and Florida State start out with two really good looks from Wiggins and then theyve taken five or six really not good shots and missed them all Off the bench its AJ Swinton announcing himself with a miss Good hustle to keep possession alive though by Somerville The song very athletic young player navigating through the contact inside and the foul goes against Californias Camden But Song is not really a great jump shooter He wants to put the ball on the floor and get to the basket And he did a really nice job coming off a screen putting pressure on that defense Good screen on this play and a little long Somerville 10 for 23 from deep his last four games That one wasnt close Bang though saves the possession with a tough lefty finish Now hes got some quickness and hes really tough for Camden to try to match up with Same five that started for Cal still out there The depth for the Bears takes a hit with Lee Dort unavailable tonight Justin Pippen to the corner for Dayday Ames with two to shoot Ames fade away Wiggins for two Really well defended Theyre trying to get some open space for Cristell He needs a little time and theyre trying to get him open but Florida States doing a great job defending him Day Ames is a good tough shot maker Round and out for Florida States Bang Camden secures the rebound and dishes it for a Pippen downhill Sets up Bell in the corner If he gets that look he makes it think when he gets time to get set hes one of the best threepoint shooters I ever coached He was young then but hes gotten better The song inside no good Looking at Roger Ays No whistle Cal gaining momentum And Chris Bell knocks down another three Hes a confident player When he makes it he thinks hes going to make the next one and the next one And thats what he does He shoots the basketball Six straight for Chris Bell Mark Madsons team has the sixpoint lead If not give him time music 20 games into their season California sits at 15 and five overall They only won one of their first five ACC games but theyve prevailed in the last two Joe Lunardi currently has them as a next four out I understand why we show that I also think its January 28th and they have a lot of opportunities to prove they belong But the key there is the three quad one wins and theyll have a couple of more quad one opportunities in conference play But not only do you have to pile up to quad one wins you have to avoid losses against cheering teams below you particularly far below you in the net Florida State 114 in the net Cal currently number 55 Florida State has gone cold and a long rebound rolls to Pippen and its four on three Ames to the corner DJ Campbell off the bench threw it away but its a foul against Florida State on the pass McGee picks up his first We got another full day of mens basketball this Saturday here on ACC Network in the ESPN app It starts at noon Eastern Number 22 Clemson hosting Pit And then 16th ranked North Carolina spurring off against Georgia Tech They just announced today its a sellout at McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta Do either of you know what the uh We have It was a delay of game Um Jones reached over the the baseline didnt touch the ball or it would have been a technical foul But when you reach over the baseline like that its it can be a delay of game warning And this going to be Florida State ball Montas coachinus is in the game Hes going to get more minutes tonight with Lee Dort unavailable and the entry pass could not be hauled in by the Lithuanian big man Well hes not going to get a lot more minutes if he cant catch an inbounds pass Thats fair Kobe McGee His first shot wont go Comes DJ Campbell And this is TT Carr the freshman from Redwood High School in Mil Valley California Howd that pass get through there Not sure Day Ames for three No good Steen had the rebound knocked away and now he leads the break Hes fouled from behind by Coachinus Save from a walk laughter Thats why you dont want your big guy dribbling the ball down the court on the fast break like no dribbles for him Hes catching you on it you throw it to him Luke LS an ACC champion 2012 year one with Florida State He has continued to believe that his team can win games and they have gotten mighty close Of course they knocked off Miami last week Really close games with Duke with Wake Forest and with SMU Theyre learning how to win And thats a nifty finish for Le Jones That is a very nine plus on the degree of difficulty right there cheering But hes against Carr whos only 61 and Jones is 67 So taking advantage of the mismatch Jones coming off 20point game on Saturday at SMU cheering Carr flips it Ames doubled Five to shoot Day no good Rebound Steen outlet for McGee This is an extremely small lineup in the game for Cal Swint to the corner They got the 611 sophomore coaching us and then basically four guards out there with him cheering Swinton for three Cal trying to trap that screen try to disrupt the Florida State offense but they did a nice job passing out of the double team and finding an open shooter Swinton had only scored in three of Florida States first seven ACC games Knocks down the triple His 20 or excuse me his uh 10th of the year See Ames is 62 Its hard for him to drive and create stuff against the 67 guy Campbell tried to create contact Official didnt bite McGee the rebound Thats a good defensive possession Florida State looking to retake the lead McGee is a very good threepoint shooter You got to get out and make him put the ball down Hes been quiet lately Dan But I agree Feels like one of these days hes going to explode for another 20point game Could be tonight Another tough shot This time it wont go for Jones Neither team has a lot of scoring out there right now The scores are on the bench or at the scorers table Hope that does help him out Under 10 minutes to play in the first half Campbell arounded out Steen with a little whiplash from his own teammate as he grabbed the rebound Well those are tough shots Theres a BETTER SHOT AJ SWINTON KNOCKS DOWN ANOTHER three and waves to the California bench Its amazing when you get good shots how much more often they go in the basket Coach you say that like its obvious and yet theres a level of sophistication in your tone that I appreciate The defense you have to work and move the ball and you get better shots Thats a tough shot and it makes it Seven points for Day Ames 16 all McGee No good Tough shot there Rebound for Dorsy Aim slithers past the defenders And theres the whistle Thatll take us to the under 12 timeout Free throws coming for TT Carr when we come back But AJ Swinton giving Luke Lou some good minutes off the bench Backto back threes for AJ Were tied 16 all Well the stats on the left side of the screen are not totally unexpected when it comes to Cal and Florida State Florida State of course started the year trying to shoot a lot of threes and they backed off on that a little and that has really helped them improve defensively And Cal in conference play 35 of their points come from beyond the arc And when you look at their shots if you really analyze it the open looks that they get when they move the ball and get the good shot theyre 50 or better Its its the shots late in the shot clock dribble step back Theyre hard to make and you dont make them Foul before the break was called on Florida States Alex Steen And heres TT Carr at the line averaging five points a game off the bench for the Bears Tonight Cal playing its first ever road game in the state of Florida They were in the Sunshine State for the Fort Myers tip off in 2021 but that was a neutral sight game Of course theyll play at Miami on Saturday The Hurricanes have the Cardinal the second game our double header at 900 tonight So Wiggins is back in the game Hit a couple early threes for Florida State Rediscovers his offense quickly Well he wanted that one but he he was out for a while and you know he started good You wanted him the ball Hes 610 and Pippen is 63 Some early minutes for Daoquay Manuel Dut red shirt sophomore from South Sudan whos only played in six games all year But with Lee Dor out D gets some minutes Camden some contact to beat the buzzer Its a shot clock violation cheering and applause Thats outstanding defense You have to play well enough to keep the offensive player from penetrating past you And if you do you can get out and cover the threes That was excellent by Florida State Really good Really good defense Well it was interesting what Luke Loud said today and this should sound obvious but after the NC State game hes like Im done getting beat by 30 Were going all in on defense and rebounding And it really has made a difference Turnovers though continue to be a problem Oh thats a heck of a BLOCK BY JONES on Carr from behind Thats a big big time block Swint missed the three to try to punctuate the sequence Pippen kicks to Bell who fakes it takes it makes it I never understand you know you you sub and you move people around but Chris Bell hits two in a row Hes out for an extended period of time Keep leaving him in the game try to give him the ball more He will score points in bunches after the Jones miss Here comes the Bears with seven minutes to go in the half cheering again Cals looking to penetrate that defense get into the lane and kick it out A moving screen cheering Chris Bell doesnt set a lot of screens so when he did set one it was almost by accident Well this looked like a breakaway until Le Jones came in the picture Cal by one Youre watching ACC Network basketball here from Tallahassee Florida The Cal Bears and the Florida State Seinals on a balmy Wednesday in the state capital Seminals 812 just 1 and6 in the ACC but theyre a scary one and six Theyre actually the betting favorite tonight if youre following that California without their starting center Lee Dhan You know we talked about Camden and Pippen but it has been Chris Bell and Day Ames carrying the load for the Bears so far They got to get Camden going Camden only one field goal attempt Robert McCrae has been quiet too He hadnt scored yet He heard you Now he has He heard you Well he heard you You were talking about it there at the break Yeah he needs to get going No question Well hes going to attack Hes not going to stand around Hes going to try to get to the basket Of course at this stage of the game against Stamford on Saturday Cal is down 16 and they close the half on a 255 run to change the game Corner three too strong for Cam Miles And the rebound pulled down by Elich Bell walked with it Seven California turnovers McCrae is a guy who is going to attack and hes going to keep attacking And that time DJ Campbell couldnt get couldnt get in front of him and it was a very tough lefthanded handle Well he makes though Yes Oh he stepped on the line Might have been bumped They double teamed him Thats not enough Theyre not going to call that I agree with you Careless We are looking ahead at February 5ths womens basketball play for K double header here on ACC Network in the ESPN app North Carolina hosting Clemson at 6 Eastern Look out for the Tigers They are the upset seekers And then Florida State is in Raleigh to take on NC State Of course to play for Kay paying tribute to Kay Yao and all the great work she did the basketball hall of famer Little little zone here Wide open Long two wont go Elach keeps it alive Camden gets a little closer Missed it again Bang the rebound Boy he had two really good shots Miles fouled by Pippen on the way up Florida State has had their best success offensively following Cal turnovers where Cal missed shots where they can get out and go And he just gets past Pippen and Pippen reaches in and hits him So be miles at the free throw line double figures five times this season but only once in his last 14 ball games Anything surprise you two about the first 15 minutes of this one Yeah I mean the surprise is Camdens just really struggling You cant get his shots and then when he finally gets a couple good really good looks you cant make them So I mean hes coming off two huge monster games against really really good teams But in those two games hes been a really streaky shooter So Florida State has done a great job you know getting close to him You know they got to keep that up Miles goes one of two at the line Florida State leads by two We tick toward five minutes left in the first half Pippen over Steen I just dont know about that shot The middle is wide open Nobody even tried to cut through Pong in transition draws contact and I think thats the second foul on Justin Pippen It is well the last time theres no movement and Pippen ends up kind of doing what he can do to get a shot but there was just not enough movement on offense So this freshman from Paris Tomas Vong back to the line free stroke Luke Gl said about Pong hes going to be an unbelievable player Hes all about the right things Hes coachable and hes just starting to get to the point where hes understanding the game a little bit They put him in there for his defense Hes 68 Hes long got long arms Hes guarding the point guard So that shows you how much the respect they have for his defensive ability Pippen stays in the game with the two fouls Cal 0 for three with three turnovers the last several possessions Make it four turnovers They get the mismatch down low and cant get him the ball Hes got a little guy on him down there and you cant get him the ball You have to get him the ball on that foot and you got to make a good pass That was not a good pass particularly to a guy like Camden Jim whos not a like a back to the basket post player Twothirds of his shots are threes Thats four turnovers since theyve last scored Eight turnovers total for the Bears Quick shot Chanty Wiggins Hes on fire A guy is four for four and theyve got him four shots Hes got to get some more shots Bell again steps closer knocks down the two Those are the two guys you got to try to get shots Chris Bell you got to get him shots Wiggins when he gets going you have to get him shots And Wiggins is such a good catch and shoot guy Well here hes working on the mismatch again in the lane gets the bounce Hes five for five He is really good with that shot He can backs down the smaller guy We said hes 610 Ames is 62 13 points for Chsy already surpassed his season average already Camden cant buy a bucket He He looked hesitant on that shot to me You got to pull the trigger Miles acrobatic move bounces it in Largest lead for Florida State count and then swore Too many possessions They havent even gotten a shot Heres his shot but its another miss But again Wiggins is out there Hes got his arms up That is a very very difficult contested shot early in the shot clock with no ball movement Theyre looking for Wiggins Couldnt find him So its Jones What theyre looking for is aims in the mismatch Its a tough call on Tomas Mong Ron Groover saw him over the back and its the second foul on the freshman Frenchman Try to say that 10 times fast Florida States open up an eightpoint lead thanks to Chanty Wiggins Well the Florida State Seinals are certainly glad they let Johnson Wiggins play tonight He had he is five for five He has made two baskets by using his 610 height to back the ball down and score He has knocked down three threepoint baskets Hes the primary reason the Seinals are ahead in this game As I said hes five for five The rest of the team Jim is 6 for 25 Well you never know with Chucky wins You know he comes out some nights and hes there for 25 minutes and takes three shots Tonight he came out hit his first couple and then now hes being aggressive and you know hes playing great and hes got to keep that going Hes the difference in the game right now To your point Jim a forgettable five points at SMU on Saturday if they could have used a few more in a really close game Yeah I mean he shows you signs of being like Oh this guys really really good Hes dominating And then he disappears Californias offense has disappeared as well Its disappeared because theyre playing against the set Florida State defense more often and the set seminal defense has been really good cheering Another block Again youre a small guy you take it in there with the big guys youre looking for trouble McCrae trying to get around Elite succeeds Boy as soon as he saw the big guy he knew exactly what he was doing Theyre dominating right now And you know Kells got to get offense going here 132 run for Florida State to open up the first double digit lead of the night Back in the zone cheering This is the the Beheim tribute right here Yeah we need to play some zone here But unless you move players and move the ball its hard to tell Elich no good cheering Even when Cal gets close they cant convert But thats what you want people to take against your zone Contested twos Theyre not that easy cheering AND ONE LE Jones and one I dont think its cheering really anything wrong to say that Dwart is a huge presence that theyre missing in there tonight Twotime World Series champion David Ross in the house tonight at the Tucker Center Sixtime NBA champion Scotty Pippen is here as well Got a lot of champions in the house tonight Former NCAA champion Jim Beahheim sitting two seats to my right as well We showed him in the open Hes here too Barely Dan did you win anything No I never won a thing When we were in uh the Pittsburgh folks rave about high school Dan Bonner They rave about high school Dan Bonner was a long time ago When you have to go back to high school to talk about somebody youre youre stretching Youre really stretching And the folks the poor folks in Pittsburgh thats thats what kind of a town that is They remember you Yeah Thats 100 years ago Yeah Wasnt that long Three quarters of a century Camden Camden hesitated to pull the trigger Gets closer and scores First points of the night Thats big Hes got to get himself going Wide open Jones comes up short Rebound for Carr Got to push Carr No good Swinton the rebound Florida State cant quite seek the final shot but they can run the clock down Zone versus zone Well theyve really been burned the last couple of possessions by McCrae driving it to the basket and Wiggins posting up Hes going to do it against his own too Beautiful creation by Rob McCrae Just his third assist of the night That gives Florida State a 13point lead Matson has a use it or lose it timeout Chooses not to take it And Cal comes up empty at the buzzer You got to kick that ball out to Chris Bell whos all alone wide open kind of play Well when youre on the road the first half is usually harder offensively and Id look for them to turn around Theyll score some points this half a different half offensive First few minutes of the second half are going to be interesting And Florida State go on a quick 92 run and stretch it to 20 or will Cal cut it down to single digits Looks like Florida State is off to a good start Rob McCrae the fifth Well you get a couple of switches and then McCrae can go to work Dayday Ames Another tough shot over McCrae Well defended by Florida State McCrae grabs the rebound Le Jones slow to get up behind the play but here he comes Still looks a little woozy out there Got hit a little bit in the face but not okay now Easy for you to say Yeah really laughter 10 to shoot for Florida State Vang to the basket Blocked by Camden They reset the shot clock Le Jones from the corner No good Elach warding off Florida States Bong with one hand secures the rebound Somehow they have to get Camden open for some shots Pippen draws the grazing contact of the defender McCrae Well that that McCrae really bailed him out that time because again you have Cals offense being one guy dribbling around and everybodys standing around watching it Thats it Dan you said something smart at halftime when we were not on the air You say a lot of smart things on the air too Surprise We cheering Cal just one for two from the line in the first half Mark Madsons team one of the best free throw shooters best free throw shooting teams in the country and theyre going to give him a 50th birthday present They need to create some contact and its its not going to be a happy birthday at this rate Thats what were looking at right now Well they shoot 80 from the line at conference play and they have to get there particularly when theyre struggling shooting the ball Theyre theyre behind in Florida State leads them 100 and points off turnovers Florida State has a 164 advantage on inside points Halfway down for Bong but popped out Justin Pippen to the corner for Day Ames Rebound Wiggins Now youre not going to make them all but thats the kind of shot they need Whoa Tough catch by Steen And then he throws it in the second row Threw it to the Cub I think Mr Rosste looked like a tight end going down the seam that play Well that was a really difficult pass and he did very well to keep it from going out of bounds at first Justin Pippen knocks down his second three of the night And what did Mark Madson tell us He wants to guys to take threes when theyre open And that was early in the shot clock but he was wide open Somerville lazy pass foul on Florida State Its a double whammy there for Martin Somerville Well Bong gets tied up on a screen and before Wiggins can get out and really contest the shot Pippens got a wide open look He has not had many of those tonight And now you really want to see if they can get Wiggins going again in this half again He can turn quiet all of a sudden Very quiet Steen sent to the bench Somerville who just made a couple bad plays in the row stays in there though Got to find a way to get Bell open too Well he was almost open but another very sketchy pass on the positive side for Cal At least theyre getting cuts through the lane They didnt do that in the first half That was a bad pass but its the right idea Wiggins five for five in the first half holds his pivot foot recovers and misses Thats the shot he wants when he gets a mismatch in there Yeah but with three guys around him he needs to pass it Uhoh cheering Hell thought he was fouled Instead its Florida State basketball Ive never quite understood why shooters look at their hands when they miss Does he think theres something wrong with his hands when he does that Im not sure I dont know You have to ask somebody who is a shooter I forgot Well he played for you for a year He can shoot the ball but he when he misses he does He Its a habit He just kind of looks like he cant believe it Florida State up 11 and now its 14 after Kobe McGee scores his first basket of the night Penetration good look They make those shots And we said McGee is a really good threepoint shooter Been playing through some injury issues but when he can get when he gets hot he can get very hot And he took a knee to the thigh in the Syracuse game and hes been playing through it Pippen gives it up Ames pretty good defense from the seminals and Bell misfires from the corner Thats the kind of shot they want to get He doesnt miss many of those Somerville step back rebound Elich Seol is outscoring the Bears 54 so far in the second half and El with a stick back to bring it back to 12 Thats one way you can get back in the game if youre struggling shooting the ball You go get it off the offensive boards First points of the night for Milo Elich Transfer from Lyola of Maryland Corner jumper around and out Here come the Bears Bell to Camden Quick release Theres three Thats what they have to do Push it down the court They get an easy look First three ball of the night for John Camden 12 for 21 from three in his last three games And Luke LZ takes a timeout What was a 15point lead just a few minutes ago Now back to nine Camden connects from the corner 4132 Seinals by nine ACC championship game in Charlotte 45 days away and then six weeks from Sunday selection Sunday Joey Brackets has eight ACC teams currently in his field that does not include Virginia Tech or Cal or Stanford who are on the bubble Well we got Virginia Tech actually is the first team out and Cal is at the top of that music next four out And of course we got a lot of basketball to play as you just said that this is a perfect indication of how important this game is for Cal And look at the difference between this year and last year when we had three or four teams in it right now Its a whole different ball game and a lot of teams are still contesting to get up in here But that youre in the situation right now all of those teams have put themselves in a position to possibly make it Now you just got to win games Layup and then a tip in Neither would fall for the Seinals And now California on a little bit of a run trying to carve further into the deficit Day Ames nice move and its a sevenpoint game That time he took advantage of a mismatch and just took steam right to the goal McCrae fouled and it goes Chance for a threepoint play for Robert McCrae Physical Well hes come a long way since he was a freshman who only played 14 games at Wake Forest music Mr Robert McCrae music the fifth just doesnt let you relax Even after a basket hes pushing the ball Hes pushing the ball Just when you think he has you have him stopped you dont I mean he just keeps going He does use his left arm pretty well Cal coaches were complaining about that but theyre not going to make that call There just wasnt enough there But hes physical He gets to the lane and gets to the basket and either gets it in or gets fouled He goes to the free throw line a lot Jim And Im telling you hes a guy you got to stop before he gets that close to the basket Once he gets in the lane hes going to score get foul Eight points three assists so far tonight for Robert McCrae who is the middle child of nine kids Hes got four older siblings and four younger siblings and hes got a threepoint play to stretch the lead back to 10 They had it cut to seven and theyre falling back on defense and you think theyre set on defense but this guy doesnt allow you to get set Now theyre going back into the half court trap Little bit zone trap touch foul We cant fault these guys Really good officiating crew Couple Final Four guys couple championship game referees Thats the third foul on Robert McCrae and he is headed to the bench But the officials simply cant allow guys to be really physical you know with those traps I mean thats a foul to end the games They kind of let it get a little physical but they should should be more consistent Florida State led by 13 at the half 10point game at the moment Justin Pippen rebounded by Kobe McGee Only Ames and Pippen touched the ball and nobody else moved Thats not a good offensive series Florida State without McCrae out there is a different offensive team to guard too Steen sets the screen Eight to shoot for the Seinals Jones with a double team defender coming Long rebound controlled by Pippen Justin Pippen Free throws coming He was going to go all the way that time He wasnt thinking about anything else They had a couple He had a couple guys spraying out but he never even looked No never looked Easy pass right there Third foul on Somerville No his father would have passed that because it would have Michael Jordan with it laughter He would have passed Michael the ball Well thats true But Michaels not out there No hes not cheering Well the Nothing But Net Crew has you covered Thursday after the womens basketball double header Theyll break down the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and look ahead to the best matchups coming up this weekend and early next week on the network and the ESPN app Justin Pippen the sixth of Scottys seven children And this is a critical point in the game for Cal because basically the only two real offensive threats they have out there are Pippen and Ames Theyre going to have to get it done here with some defense Florida States missing a couple of their bang guys too When McCrae comes out and when Wiggins is out it makes it hard for them to score as well Fouls on Dorsy Madson sends Carr and Coachinus back into the game Pippen and Elich depart But now now Cal really is very short out there with the exception of coaching LOOKING IT TO HIGH AND ITS STEEN THROWING IT DOWN He made the call but he never saw that Alex Steen who is playing division 2 basketball at Florida Southern the last three years and Steen meets Ames and then Day scores anyway Well hes the only guy in the game thats going to score for them right now He has to score Steen inside again Earns some free throws The foul going on Carr applause You know coaches is in there and he just gets caught up in the screen And I you know if I had to guess I would say that that might be the first time that theyve run that play for Steen in a game and it worked like that It worked Its a good screen by Kobe McGee Kind of screened three defenders with his angle Well you just cant allow yourself if youre a defender there to get screened like that Yeah I mean you know thats what theyre doing Theyre coming to screen you Thats why a lot of teams play zone the underneath out of bounds Hard to score against a zone out of bounds play There arent many of them A little burst from Alex Steen Theres Alexs parents Mary Beth and Tim with the Steen machine shirts on There you go Of course Alex is listed as being from Panama City Beach Florida but his parents from Minnesota So he spent some of his childhood with a pond in his backyard that they would brush the snow off of to be able to play on the frozen pond Bell again gets a defender off his feet throws up an offbalance look cheering Florida State ball and Mark Madson is over there telling him shoot the ball or if youre going to pump fake then get by You got to take your normal shot I think he was hoping there was contact but there wasnt He thinks there was Well last season Cals first in the ACC Their only road conference win came at NC State They went 1 and nine in ACC play on the road One in three on the road this year winning at Stamford on Saturday We dont like to make excuses but its hard to travel 3000 miles I dont care who you are Chanty Wiggins Not this time Dorsy the rebound Its the first time hes missed Missed a three Yeah missed a two earlier but he made all of his shots in the first half 0 for two in the second half Dorsys pass deflected McGee tipped it off Bell which went out of bounds and its Florida State ball When we come back the Seinals looking for their second ACC win of the here 1152 to play second half for the seminals leading by nine here inside the Tucker Center One of the storylines tonight California battling for NCAA tournament positioning Florida State battling for ACC tournament positioning Well were talking about are you in the tournament are you not Well one way you can get there is to win the ACC tournament But the first thing you have to do is make it to the ACC tournament Only the top 15 teams qualifying You see Florida music State is currently 18th out of 18 And so theyre desperate to get some wins so they can get themselves to Charlotte and then see what happens Theres a big crop of teams with two conference wins that Florida State could join if they could hang on over the next 1145 tonight Mismatch inside They try to get Wiggins going maybe And now theres the real mismatch The song kicks it out Nine to shoot for Miles Attacking Carr Step back three Rebound Dorsy Thats where they miss McCrae who can just get past anybody out there McCrae would have to be have a broken something in his body for me to not put him in the game I dont know You know he makes things happen for this team So with three fouls youd put him back in there now Yeah Three games Nope Thats just too tough Kong stopped him and hes trying He cant shoot over a guy that big Trailer three Somerville Rebounded by Jones Bumping with Ames Le Jones unable to convert Great hustle from Pong The arrow belongs to the Bears Pong goes after balls He fights Hes young Well he sure does He tries He goes after stuff And thats what Lukes told us that he put the song in the game not because he thought the song was going to help him offensively but because he was very athletic Hes very long Hes very enthusiastic and he thought he would really help him out defensively and he has Well now with Camden Bell and Pippen back into the game This is when Cal has to make a quick move right here at the 10minute mark All they need to do is have a couple good plays and you go from nine to five and six and now youre in the game Third foul on the song While were talking about the song and here comes Mr McCrae but in the nonconference portion of the schedule Florida State scored almost 40 of their points from beyond the arc In conference play its less than 30 of their points So theyve really made a dramatic shift in their offensive philosophy and theyre trying to emphasize defense and rebounding and the song is a big reason why And when theyre shooting 31 from the three its not a bad idea Yeah theyre 17th in the league out of 18 teams in threepoint percentage Only BC is worse Cal is fourth in the league in threepoint shooting and theyve struggled tonight but Pippen makes it a sixpoint game Well thats just a great oneonone move there You drive the song back with the dribble and then rise up and stick the three Thats not easy Third three of the night for Justin Pippen This guys going to the goal Well hes rested Hes been on the bench Pass was deflected but Wiggins makes the catch and throws it down and the foul When he gets the switch and the big guys on him hes going to go until somebody stops And because everybody knows this is what hes going to do Hes got the big guy on him And look at the defense come help Theres basically three guys there and nobodys guarding Wiggins And thats a situation where you know Dorsy is not going to block the shot of a 610 guy Just leave it go He didnt get his moneys worth for that foul Well everybody thinks theyre going to block a shot The man is 610 Dorsy 64 Hes not going to block the shot And And hes not He doesnt jump like David Thompson Hes got no chance He doesnt jump like He jumps like you So and Wiggins can jump Well you were not known for your dunking ability Well of course thank thankfully for me Jim when I played well when I was on the team we werent allowed to dunk It was a leave Well it was good for you because you probably couldnt Bang can block a shot Okay Pippen drove him back before and stuck a three over top of him but now Pippen decides hes going to go by We just said hes playing for defense Thats pretty good defense Thats what hes cheering doing We got to get Camden going and Bell going here in the next two or three minutes of this game Theres one for him Bell buries the corner three And again Camden sets a screen wide open I dont know why they theres not more screen away from the ball Thats four fouls on Pippen H just his third Dan Just his third Just his third Teams Dan teams are so accustomed to playing the pick and roll They figured that out but they dont Just a screen away from the ball with no no ball in bounds gets people open Well for all this talk about Cals troubles theyre only down by six No theyre theyre right in the game This is when they have to make their move Winning time Fourth quarter final nine and a half minutes McCrae vers Camden and they got a foul on Cal They cant guard McCrae when they make that switch Thats its switching is good unless you are getting big on a guy like McCrae He they cant guard him and hes going to get by Hes going to get fouled or hes going to get a layup for somebody Sean Camden picks up his second foul coming off 25 points 10 rebounds at Stanford Hes got five points three rebounds tonight Pals going to complete the comeback Theyre going to need more from him Bong creates some contact with Elich Well its not quite the same thing Jim But theres Bong whos pretty quick with the ball against Elich whos not really all that quick with his feet Thats the danger when youre switching bigs You have to play somebody that can put the ball on the floor So Tomas Bang the first high school commit of the Luke LS era at Florida State goes to the line Counts He got it all Weve got another full day of mens basketball Saturday here on ACCN and the ESPN app Starts at noon Easter room with these two matchups Clemson hosting Pit and then another ranked North Carolina team at sold out McCamish Pavilion to take on the Yellow Jackets of Georgia Tech It seems like Florida State has had the ball down on this end for a half an hour Check the time of possession graphic Well we dont need that necessarily but they would drive They would get fouled They got fouled like what four or five times to the point where hes going to the line Top of the hour in Coral Gables Stamford and Miami Bell from the other corner comes up short Steen may have gotten the finger on that one McCrae nifty crossover and then his pass off the songs hands Threeon two Tippen fakes it Takes it Wiggins cheering skies for the rebound His fourth Every time its felt like Cal might hit a shot to really put the pressure on Florida State that shot hasnt gone in One of the reason it hadnt gone in is Florida States done a nice job pressuring Swint was out of control Bells got the loose ball Numbers and an ugly turnover for the Golden Bears Chris Bell has not been able to develop his ball handling Thats a twoonone play You have to make that with the big guy You have to make that play Well and now the problem is Chris Bell is hanging his head and right in front of Mark Madson And Madson has no choice but to take him out of the game 100 You never want to hang your head You make a bad play you shake it off You go back and you try to make a good play And if youre going to do it you cant do it right in front of your coach Not a good idea McCrae over Elich Here come the Bears again DJ Campbell in transition He got drilled by McCrae who picks up his fourth Two free throws coming for DJ Campbell whos just one for seven at the line this season Well theres no way hes passing it to Elich And at least didnt really give him enough room to do it No cheering Number one Martin Summerville Number 10 Jones replacing the bench Gray to the bench with the four fouls And we still got a lot of time left Campbell was a starter for Cal last year So cheering and its true He was one for seven from the line before that trip Now hes three for nine He makes them both Under eight minutes two possession game McGee flips it for Martin Somerville He has not found the range tonight but Le Jones has been a beast on the boards 31 rebounds in his last three games coming into tonight Add seven more to the ledger this evening introducing Sports Center for you Personalized every single day Introducing Sports Center for you Personalized every single day Now available on the ESPN app Powered by your favorites Florida State only shooting 25 in the second half clinging to a sixpoint lead California plus seven since halftime Well both teams are having a lot of trouble scoring and some of its good defense but some of its just not enough movement not enough you know getting some screens getting some people open and its just a its just a slug fist Foul was on DJ Campbell before the break after Le Jones grabbed the rebound Asked Luke Lel earlier today about Lees rebounding numbers His three best rebounding games of the season have been his last three games Got seven more rebounds tonight Luke said you know Leger was struggling with his offense And I told him you shoot 10 times a game thats 10 of what you do on the basketball court If you just focus on rebounding youll get better shots Youre so athletic is so physical and he took it to heart Hes really been a different player these last couple weeks Yeah hes working He goes after balls Thats a big miss at the front end of the one and oneonone though Sure was Oh nice hesitation move Pippen fouled by Steen And Justin Pippen will shoot two And Justin Pippen this is the eighth time he has been fouled in the game So particularly here in the second half hes been attacking the basket Yeah when youre not making shots thats what you want to do Try to get to the rim get to the foul line Hes a very good free throw shooter and he can get back in this game And this is this is a big stretch here for Florida State I think because they were having all their success based upon what McCrae was doing getting to the free throw line getting people good shots and McCrae is sitting on the bench Since a fourpoint game Justin Pippen now 14 points five of six from the line tonight Steen goes at Elich kicks it McGee had it poked away but its a reachin foul on Cal That was close Yeah thats thats if youre a defensive player thats so tempting but you just cant reach in there I mean he they were really in trouble and Florida State was and Cal bailed him out and he had no place to go Just keep your hands to yourself Let him take some bad offbalance shot This is another one and one drains the front end Kale just cant quite get there They just cant quite get where they need to really be in the game Theyre on the edge Kobe McGee The transfer from Drexel goes one of two And heres another chance for Tal to get closer That would really help him if Camden can make a three Pippen on the drive This is Campbell on Q There it is Thats a good call and thats a good look They really worked to get him the ball He made a really good relocation in the corner and they found him Eight points in the game for Camden Cal five of 10 from three in the second half Its a little carry about three times Steam fouled and one number four on Neil Gil and LZ Jones was in the middle of that but this last play for Cal Pippen again gets it inside and the ball just moves You have two different areas of penetration and Jim youre right Camden goes right to where the open spot is and now Elich gets the foul against Steam and thats where you miss Dort Dors going to come over and make a play on that ball and change the game Its just one play right there He blocks that shot It goes down the other way and you got youre looking at a tie game instead of a fivepoint game Now what are we doing here Were trying to get Theres Lee Dor sitting on the bench Its good sign for Cal that he made the trip and he was wearing sneakers bouncing a ball shoot around today but he had a brace on his knee Another missed free throw for the Seminals Their sixth free throw miss of the night in 15 tries And theyve left some points there Fourpoint game 615 the play Justin Pippen buries the three Theyre now officially in the game McCrae being out is just hard for Florida State to overcome Somerville finally connects Hed been 0 for four previously and hes a pretty decent offensive player Thats a big basket Pippens had the hot hand Thats where the ball has to go Pippen step back Air ball cheering I dont have any problem with Pippen penetrating there but as he did the other KSC Cal teammates just stood there and watched him Nobody went to a spot where they could have an opening Got to be a little bit movement there away from the ball See if Florida State can capitalize Madson screaming travel from the cow bench Officials would not bite Jones on the drive Fouled by Ames cheering The Cal just is having a hard time staying in front of the dribble They get on the side and then they reach in Yeah you just you cant make it more obvious Well Elich Elich that time never moved his feet to try to stop him He just reached in as he went by Thats where they miss Dort the help situations coming over to help being a big presence out there They just dont have that They gave the foul to Campbell but I dont think Campbell was near the play I think Lee Cassell might have seen one but it was really seven See if they go back to it Anyway were looking ahead to the February 5th womens basketball play for Kouble header right here on ACC Network in the ESPN at North Carolina Clemson at 600 Eastern Florida State and NC State at 8 spend time around ACC womens basketball The play fork games mean something different to the players to the coaches to the fans to everybody Look forward to that double header on February 5th Its almost February gentlemen Yes it is Camden not this time rebounds team But thats a good shot for Camden Hes got to squeeze that off cheering Were under five minutes Florida State has led the entire second half but Cal has made plenty of pushes Wigan trying to overpower Day Elich pushes him to the corner looping pass to Steen who flings it up there And thats a 30se second violation That time Elich went over and really put some pressure on Wiggins who held on to that ball too long Yeah hes got a mismatch that Ames did really well Prevented him from getting to the basket He kicked that one out But Elich that time went over and did a really nice job helping out Well Wiggins to his credit thought he could get there and he just he couldnt do it He couldnt get there Thats what he did in the first half Ames tipping Camden Elich and Campbell Campbell going baseline POWERS IT UP AND IN PLUS THE FOUL Campbell is only 63 but hes 205 lbs He is a powerful guy and Somerville just gets too close to him Hes not a dangerous threepoint shooter Hes more dangerous driving And here we got to get McCrae back into the game I think this is the right play Hes just got to be smart and not get himself in a bad foul position Back to a onepoint game PJ Campbell the Western Carolina transfer converts a threepoint play Hes got five off the bench for the Bears McCrae playing with a four fouls out there with Jones Wiggins Swinton and Bong McCrae lost the handle Elach has the steal Cal looking for a lead Pip into the basket First Bears lead since it was 1918 Really great crossover Left switch to the left hand and here takes it right back You know you have the lead for only the blink of an eye And here comes McCrae right at you cheering That puts McCrae in double figures for the eighth straight game The 18th time this season AJ Swint physical with Camden on the perimeter Called for the foul 324 to go here in Tallahassee and weve got a fun finish of brewing Justin Pippen and the Bears trailed by as many as 15 Now onepoint game Come on boy cheering cheering The California Bears the Golden Bears have come all the way back and John Camden who had two points in the first half has knocked down two big threes here in the second half But the story of the second half for Cal has been Justin Pippen He has scored 16 of his 19 points in this half Hes hit three threes Hes four of eight from the field Hes five of six from the free throw line And oh just to keep uh just to keep all the stats going hes got three of six Well the eight rebounds is pretty impressive for a small guard Only thing Pippen hasnt done is come up with a steal and hes had one in all but one game hes played this year so maybe thats still coming Youre a really glass half empty kind of guy Just you know preparing you for the moment But look at those threepoint field goals Florida State has only made one in the second half one for 10 And this guy is an 80 free throw shooter on the year They got a lot of good free throw shooters Theyre first in the ACC cheering and fourth in NCAA in free throw percentage He misses and I apologize to cheering everybody out there in bare territory They just are stating the facts Thats true I appreciate that support And now this is where theyve had success The ball in the hands of McCrae Been McCrae or Wiggins tonight for Florida State Wiggins puts the seminals back in front Again when he puts his mind to it he can overpower you inside Well not overpower as much as just quick and do that spin He just made a play He can make plays He needs to make more plays Pippen verse Wiggins I saw Wiggins is pretty good defensively Pippen needs help Hits Campbell back door Elach on the glass cheering and its a foul inside on Florida State 19 Well Wiggins has made big plays for Florida State in this game And here hes got Camden And Camdens a couple of inches shorter but it doesnt matter Wiggins has good strength but hes also very quick And you cant defend that spin move because hes so quick with it You just would like to see him do cheering that more often Called the foul on Swinton his second Elachch with a season high 10 rebounds but a costly missed free throw there cheering Well he had been nine for nine in conference play before that miss cheering One of two onepoint game 225 to go Well if youre Florida State you need your players McCrae and Wiggins to make the plays Heres McCrae behind his back against Pippen Pivots to the hoop Camden ties him up in the rebound battle Its Florida State possession Missed the shot but he got the rebound That was a a really going after it kind of play He was upset missed it He went and got it Thats what good players do Something they dont finish something they go get it They go try to do something else Mark Manson takes the timeout Itll be a full timeout but well be back after this short 30se second break with 207 to play 6261 Seals lead Back at the Tucker Center along with Jim Beheim and Dan Bonner Evan Leler The onepoint game with 207 to go and Florida State has the ball after the tie up following the McCrae miss Well you know McCrae actually Cal came back in the game when McCrae was out And McCrae you can see his value to the team that Jim said he drives he misses he goes get goes and gets the ball Yeah its really going to be him down the stretch versus Pippen Thats whats going to happen here is that which guy can make the most plays down the stretch at this at this point Its been a while since weve seen Chris Bell out on the floor Can he be a factor in these final two minutes I dont think hes bringing him back I mean he he got his head down a little bit and I I dont think coach liked it He just he has not put him back in the game But Campbell has really helped him defensively and Campbell has driven the ball to the basket and hes scored and hes made some free throws So at this point in time youre not really missing Chris Bell They were down by 16 on Saturday on the farm and one going away They were down 15 tonight Well you cant get behind by that far every game smart Double team Thats what they should do again Double team him Make him pass the ball Make him pass it to Steam Somerville doesnt get the bounce Rebound Camden Thats what you want to do Its good play Good defensive play Double team him Then make somebody else shoot it Cal gets the stop out of the timeout What do they have at this end Day Ames gets his own rebound You got to get it out of there in the lane Florida State wanted a 3second call Are we going to get it now We got a Cal time out Well I mean he was in there for 10 or so but they But he didnt really have possession of the ball They dont call that anyway Theyre not calling that play But he had a chance to get it right out right away And they had a couple open looks Wow Well were talking about Pippen and how Pippen is going to be an important part of the game and his dads here watching Now theyre not all here but thats the Pippen family Well Scottys standing now Hes a little nervous Hes hes hes standing and watching Theres his brother brother Scotty Pippen Jr member music of the Memphis Grizzlies in the league Theres Scottys taking a seat It looks like hes still standing when hes sitting down Well he had to stand during the timeout But clearly clearly Cal came out of that last time out They were going to go with a Jim You know what its like to watch your music son play college basketball Its nervous Nervous When youre coaching him too it adds even more nervous Yes he is Five to shoot Day no rebound Swinton Thats clearly what they wanted to do is have Ames go to the basket He just didnt convert Well now if youre Cal you need a stop Ames just five for 15 from the floor tonight McCrae circus shot wont go Out of bounds off Cal and Madson looking to his review staff to decide whether he should challenge it He only has one timeout left though So if he challenges and hes wrong then hes out of timeouts Florida State inbounds Thats the rule they should have left They should have the officials take the clock and call out of bounds Swinton was fouled by Ames sitting on the seat of his pants Now it was the right call Thats not legal guarding position for Day Ames What Sitting on the floor and wrapping yourself around somebodys ankles Yeah I would agree with that So AJ Swint line only 13 free throw attempts all season coming into tonight for AJ Nine for 13 And its two shots every time now And Florida State has missed some free throws and they really have left the door open at the free throw line 10 of 18 56 cheering These are how you win close games Make your free throws If youre Cal do you try to get a shot in 10 15 seconds to go two for one here Got to get a good shot Thats what we missed them both Rebound Elich Bears cheering down one Doesnt matter when you get it You just get the best shot you can Camden off balance Missed it Off balance is the key there He needed to give that ball up I I think they try to go two for one and I just dont think you do that 10sec difference game shot clock Timeout Florida State You dont get a good shot its not a good play and Camden you know we have seen him be a remarkable threepoint shooter but only when hes set So if youre Cal here well you you could play to get the ball back with 10 seconds to go or you could foul and extend the game No no you play to get a stop You have 10 seconds If you can get a stop you push it as fast as you can with Pippen or Day Either one and go to the basket You dont want to foul I dont think thats thats not how I would play it European teams foul all the time They want they put you on the line cuz they think they can go down and make a three If you give up a three that probably loses you the game If you give up a two youre still in it Ron the other thing we Theres another way to get a three And Florida States had a lot a lot of opportunity for the oldfashioned threepoint plays but Seminals one of 11 from three in the second half just 6 for 27 22 on the night Into Rob McCrae guarded by Justin Pippen Well McCrae is going to go Its just a matter of hes going to use as much of the clock as he can and go and hes got to go now They should double again They didnt McCrae kicks it McGee for three NO GOOD REBOUND JONES HES FOULED WITH 98 REMAINING Far from over though Hes got two shots but Cal will have time Cal did everything right on this series defensively They force McCrae to give up the ball and even though McGee is a good threepoint shooter but then they cant get the rebound and you talked about it earlier Evan the value that LZ Jones has placed on his rebounding comes into to play again right there I mean he just went and got it And another moment where the absence of Lee Dort moves large for Cal Well with the way Jones has been rebounding the ball Borton clearly could have been a factor but Will Chamberlain might be in there And Jones might have still gotten it He goes after the ball Thats what he does Jones at the line tonight is two for four Whoa Seol fans getting restless Not easy down the stretch Now you got to block out and coaching us coaching was just substituted into the game because hes like 6 11 but you know Elich might be a more powerful rebounder in this spot Well this is interesting Now they take their time out now Yeah Surprised me a little bit Well theyre going to have to set it up right now But heres what were going to do You know were going to push it as far as hard as we can as far as we can and try to get to the basket get to the foul line or make something Hasnt been a great shooting night for Dayday Ames but when he was in high school he was nicknamed the closer and we saw him get seven points in 7 seconds against Notre Dame earlier this year Well we did but weve seen two coming out of timeouts Weve seen twice now that Cal has elected to have Ames go to the basket and he wasnt able to convert And as good a player as Day Ames is if its me I think Im winning or losing the game with Pippen Yeah me too Elich is out Coachinus is in along with Camden on the block to try to get a rebound if Jones misses the free throw One more shot First of all you got to get the rebound Thats number one Its a cheering twopoint game Cal is out of timeouts 98 remaining cheering and applause Pippen back to BACK TO PIPPEN FOR THE LEAD REBOUND MCCRAE OUT OF BOUNDS FLORIDA STATE FALL WITH JUST 210 LEFT They got a good shot Florida State inbounds to McCrae No ones near him And the Seinals have their second ACC win music 6361 Florida State prevails
