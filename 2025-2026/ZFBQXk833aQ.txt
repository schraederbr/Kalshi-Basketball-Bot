won three of their last four They escaped the weather and Boston College over the weekend with a sixpoint win at Chestnut Hill Away we go Uday and Basar get us started And here is Trey Donaldson who runs the offense for first year head coach Jay Lucas and the Kings And this is a talented freshman in his own right Number seven is Shelton Henderson Theres Uday and a foul on freshman Derek Dixon underneath off a switch will put Ernest Uday to the line First touch for Renew They bring the double He makes the right read Uday great cut on the backside And I thought this morning the point you brought out by Renew creating 17 different fouls I think Hubert David saw say you know what Lets double team early to keep our bigs out of foul trouble Last three games hes drawn 17 personal fouls He gets to the line quite often and Ernest Uday who was not great at the line in nonconference play and has had a just an unbelievable resurrection at the free throw line in ACC play missed both free throws but the ball got deflected out off Carolina I had to have a talk with U after making a half course shot to shoot around this point You got to make your free throws big fell I got the tape to prove it You want to work on that project or you want No you start first Youre the Hall of Famer Im still working Henderson for Uday Back to the rookie Shelton Henderson Foul line against Jiren Stevenson And the rebound cleared by Vessel Heres Derek Dixon now starting for the Tar Hills in his seventh straight ball game Sharon Stevenson back in the lineup for a second straight time tonight too to start the ball game Double team that time coming to Wilson on the wing Dennis Yeah earlier this morning they talked about when he did in the post This time he had a live dribble So they had to wait till cutter went through than the double team came And he is much more effective playing out of the double on the left side of the floor so he can throw that skip over the top with his right hand Zone by Miami here Little 32 action We saw that in shootound today Vesar with one to shoot Hell launch from near the midcourt line and its an air ball Shot clock violation on the Tarheelss What Jay Lucas this morning did talk about he has to mix up the defenses to keep the Tar Hills out of rhythm So that zone took him out of rhythm that possession The most zone that Miami has played was in the last game in the ACC 22 possessions against BC You see the Miami lineup Dante Allen has been in that lineup True Washington is available tonight for Jay Lucas First time he would be so in the last three games Short jumper by Donaldelsson No good Wilson the rebound Carolina trying to get a fast break chance Jay Lucas concerned about Miamis transition off misses too Heres Treble Kick out Stevenson lines up a three Back rim miss and Uday boxed out face off You got to stay on the glass with the heels They are an excellent rebounding team and thats one thing that Jay Lucas talked to us about was staying on the boards And inside there goes Renew Oh big time move with his right hand but comes back with the left You see why they want a double team Exactly Thats it right there Theres your solution Almost two minutes in Miamis got the first points Bessar at the foul line pushes it up and scores applause and cheering You know Miss Debbie anytime that zone you always want to attack the middle but Vasar being so tall just turned a little teardrop second best field goal shooter in the ACC at 63 Allen answers for Miami at the other end Comes right back snakes behind that step up gets to the middle of the floor Beautifully done Allen right to Seth Treble and Wilson and Renew Caleb lost the handle on it Off the turnover heres Allen Hes got Donaldson there and its 62 Miami Oh I love the perfect bounce pass Dudy for a perfect finish You had numbers Three on two threeon one You got to finish that Thats a nice play by Miami off their defense Dennis really likes the lost art of the bounce pass too Oh yes indeed Come on Make it so a guy can finish the play on the break Heres Bessar inside He got stripped of it Carolina thought he might have got fouled Heres Miami on the run Henderson crashed into Dixon bounces there and score Shelton Henderson come on LOOK AT THAT BODY YOURE NOT getting in the way of that That was great defense but Henderson said No better offense Early sixpoint lead for Miami Stevenson right down the paint scores with a right hand This pace is good for North Carolina too I mean they can score in their primary and theyre also traditionally excellent in their secondary options Heres the rookie Shelton Henderson 66 240 and then some from Houston on the drive Last touch by Miami and heres a look at the Wilson turnover Yeah hes got a little slip You get out and run Perfect bounce pass by Allen down for the layup Quick substitutions Luca Bogavots has checked in Oh and heres the Henderson move Debbie Good heavens Good gracious You beat him at the rim and you go vertical right there and he just plays right through your chest Send the send the message early Right Zaden High into the lineup He did not play Saturday night in the win against Duke for the Tarheelss And also we get our first look at Luca Boavots Skip to the corner Thats Dixon cheering Tai trying to help Seth Treble Five to shoot now Huber Davis needs a set This is Dixon Long two is good Tough shot Derek Dixon on the board You got to live with some of that right Thats a tough two right there Good D till the last late part of the shot clock Allen Renew left alone Lefthanded three is good I like how he took his time Hes not a threepoint shooter but how he got to his spot square up and shoot the ball with confidence Miami missed their first two Theyre five for their last five since see Caleb Wilson on this side of the floor Dangerous Heres Wilson Lost it Henderson helped on the double to force the turnover Hell take both of us and then Wilson pinned it on the glass My goodness Get that shot out of here Tremble Heres Dixon Galone for three and renew the backside rebound Miami a lot of momentum here early Donald trying to help and eventually a turnover and Bogots saved it after High somehow came up with it Goodness Its a little frenetic We like it I like it I was like this is starting to pick up another one Get that shot out of here Dont bring it back Lets go Time out We got blocks of the season Debbie I call it a trap game because youre so excited The perfect play was ran A freshman kicked it to a senior The coach understands the moment but you got to forget about it some You have to move on and you got to enjoy it and celebrate it for what it was And it was amazing But since Sunday night Hubert Davis told us theyve been concentrating on Miami and Miamis giving them a battle Another turnover Defense really CAUSING ISSUES THERES A LOVE AND A FLUSH Good job by Allen with the steal You keeping your head up and u running the floor big fella Y four live ball turnovers by the Heels And here is a dead ball turnover because itll give North Carolina a chance to set their defense This is what you want right here You want to tilt the floor and get going the other way U look at him run the court music Nice delivery too by Allen And Debbie thats your center with the deflection and still running the floor Get me out of here long active really does a good job communicating on the back side of their defense Renew with Allen Henderson Donaldson Uday Trey Donaldson out front Heres Allen working on treble with six to shoot Got a screen follow two is good for Dante Allen When I walked in the gym Dante Allen was getting a lot of shots up today He put some extra time in on game day 6 minutes old Miami by nine here at Coral Gables Bogavad sets for three and hits Luca Bogavads been on a tear here recently Thats nine of his last 14 from three Well I like when he takes that first look Sometimes he hesitates after he misses a couple shots in a couple games So tonight first look not the game Carolinas best perimeter defenders trouble This a matchup that they can win right here Yep Henderson drives it in Second field goal for Shelton Henderson Good recognition by Donaldelsson Well Wes you know Im getting ready to say thats a mouse in the house when you take who youre guarding Henderson Yep There goes Bogavots Boa pass Wilson up strong and one First bucket for Caleb Wilson According to Synergy he is a 67 finisher at the rim He catches it with two feet in the paint Hes going to put it down Every time I see him every time I see his dad Jerry I said Anyone that tells you guys yall need to shoot threepointers walk away from them The reason youre buzzing in college basketball because youre punishing people in the paint and you dont like that rim because you get so many dunks I think the Duke gave him the first game this year He didnt get a dunk right Wes That is correct Yeah And you want him to shoot more threes Hes got 66 on the year Come on 71 free throw shooter The freshman from Atlanta has his first three And thats the last part the free throw shooting Keep the free throw shooting consistent and keep getting better because you will live at the free throw line as you get close to the tournament and you want to go deep into the tournament Miami is getting into their bench here a little bit guys Si Altunas has checked in the freshman from Turkey and Tebo Malovitz from Western Slovakia has come in Malovitz is 88 Alunis 11 and they go with Donaldson and Henderson and Renew I mean its a good time for Jay Lucas to buy a few minutes for his guys right here Miamis made eight of their last nine from the floor and building what is now a fivepoint lead after the threepoint trip from Wilson a moment ago Heres Renew against Jonathan Powell and easily scores again Donaldson recognition on the scout right Sees the mismatch That is coming up the floor looking for that Oh Wilson tried for the dunk Renu got a hand in there off the lob from Besso Henderson and a double team Renew a shot fake on Bogot Strong drive and one Thats just filthy guys What took so long the possession before for the double team and now you have the ball in the corner Simple punt fake going right by Bovox and nobody steps up and got caught in the cookie jar Back to the free throw line Second foul on Messar When youre on the weak side and Malik Renu has the basketball you better be ready cuz he is putting it on the deck and hes looking to attack closeouts Second foul on Carolina Its the first on Henry Vessar and here is Renu at the line to try and complete the threepoint play 132nd free throw attempt Jay Lucas has done a terrific job in Miami in year one Dennis you know my favorite question I said Jay what are you telling the guys 3D put your papers away The guys have to believe And right now in these first seven eight minutes look like they believe Yeah back to 10 quickly and make shots and theyve done that Kick out front Heres Jaden Young A three off Hubert Daviss bench Young knocks down his 11th three of the year And its back to a sevenpoint Miami lead Malovitz away to Henderson Jaden Young had 27 in this building a year ago for Virginia Tech Heres Henderson on the drive and the bucket So Jay Lucas told us theres a package for him on the top of the floor We just saw it right there Beautifully done in the middle third Young Fed Stevenson who got the ball rad out on his way to the basket Thatll get us to a timeout Just better than 8 minutes old in Coral Gables Miami ferocious at both ends of the floor has built a 9point lead on number 11 So Jason why not put the ball back in his hand when the big guys on him Right now hes making great decisions Wes hes 66 music Hes a freshman Hes added 18 lb 10 lb of lean muscle since hes been here And his vertical is 37 in Zack Zmer gave us that information The strength coach for Miami Basar right hand jump hook Old school Debbie called it And with this lineup on the floor Vasars got to be the guy that they look for They got to establish some points in the paint Miamis got 18 of their 24 inside and theyre shooting a whopping 79 from the floor here at the start of the game 11 of 14 They try the back door for U Couldnt complete it Renu gets it right back with 10 to shoot though Donaldson against Ken Evans Step back three off the mark Young runs it down That was a step step back Yeah it was Jaden Young Evans waiting on Stevenson And that pass got deflected by Allen Back to the bench Miami is there on the catch High hands Theyre rotating on the backside Theyre closing the gap They really are moving well on the defensive end Jonathan Powell will put it in play J Lucas had a pretty broad catalog of what he wanted to do defensively tonight Besar long three again Oh boy And wants the ball 3D He wants it I like it Shot the ball with Connor Very similar late in the game against Duke the other night He make that he made that big three Heres Donaldson Another lean in on Powell Malovitz Heres Renew with Stevenson Allen into traffic and Evans had a crack at it Couldnt come up with it Stevenson battled Donaldson skips it for Allens three and OD gives him a third chance And now a turnover They throw it away Renu was trying to get it to Dante Allen And with that Henderson returns and he replaces Trey Donaldson Huber Davis is not happy right now with Miami getting three extra opportunities in that last possession Caleb Wilson is coming in and hell get Jiren Stevenson spot Huber Davis stealing some minutes around the official timeout for Caleb Wilson Zone again by the Canes Heres Evans launching and hitting Ken Evans What a good job by Hubert Davis coming off the timeout Theyve scored on their last three possessions They got Vasar going Evans one of his last 14 or 13 before he hit that one Well you know shooter shoot with confidence and made it right on time to your point partner Takes one to no one Yes sir Here is Henderson Bounds away and they crash the glass Bessar in there with two other MIAMI PLAYERS NOW ALIVE AND A DUNK BY NEW DAY And Hubert Davis wants a timeout immediately Yeah hes not happy The Hurricanes getting too many offensive rebounds too many opportunities Threepoint lead And then in this prior couple of possessions they gave up four Theyve given up six Thats why he called the timeout He wasnt even in the huddle with the guys Hes so upset with him right now Thats an effort thing Remember they got beat on coach an effort They got beat on the board the other night by 12 only got beat in Virginia on the board by 16 but live to tell about it with wins Good Good Thats a great stat right there because sometimes you get a win in those rebounds early in this game tonight in spite Besar and Carolina have been pretty good offensively here Its been the Heres five to shoot with Evans attacking Hes around Henderson in traffic Put it up and score Ken Evans I mean you guys throw it way above the box when Shelton Hendersons around Teard drop Soft tear drop off the glass Hes got Carolina within a point And Huber Davis has gotten bench points here in this first half Renew Malovitz a three Thats all Malovich does Wes Hes got 34 threes and five twos Great job of collapsing the D Well you got to do what you do and renew with under control and found the shooter Listen I dont have to tell you about having your feet under your shoulders man I mean just let it fly right Youre on balance Let it fly The pass was to the pocket Tend to shoot for Carolina having a hard time getting the offense going Heres Evans Even despite the makes Carolinas not having any seamless opportunities Theyre not over rotating defensively Miami They are staying in the gap and thats why theyve been able to get some of these live ball steals in turnovers by North Carolina Malovitz looking for U lost it Back out from Malovitz Another one And now Young the rebound in front of Allen and tried to get it to Pal Stolen by Henderson And hell dunk it home Yeah that was a smart business decision by not trying to block that dunk No Get out of the way Yes Live for another day Its a sixpoint lead now for Miami I think you got to go right back to base over here Renew pushing him away off the block Evans with 12 to shoot Heres the matchup Is Henderson going to help Thought about it Besar put it up Thats goending on Uday before Wilson shoved it back in the basket So nine for Vesar Carolinas got five straight field goals but cookies And then Henderson says not today And Var said this is decision Henderson at the rim This is a critical game kind of in his future I think well they need a signature win and they dont have one Miami And North Carolina has played so well in the last couple of weeks coming off the West Coast swing I think Hubert Davis has figured out a few things with his defense and with his rotations Henderson drove it right at Wilson Couldnt finish Carolina the rebound These two teams are 25 of 41 from the floor in this first half Must have heard yall were here Were all about offense Wes out of the corner Stevenson Theres another Tarheel three They have scored on six consecutive possessions North Carolina ever since Hubert Davis got upset with them for their lack of defensive rebounding Onepoint lead for Miami Six and a half to go in the opening frame Sometimes you got to refocus the guys Renew against Bessar Digging down at the block Back with a left hand and were going to get a foul called and its going to be on Si Alunis the 610 275lb freshman from Turkey Its his first just the second foul against Miami in this first half I thought Carolina dodged the bullet letting Renew work down there He just missed a little chippy zone again by Jay Lucass team Quick look Bessar shoots it for Dixon Side step That is a three and back rim miss Funus runs it down and midcourt foul on Seth Trimble Itll be the first on the senior who likely will never have to buy dinner in the presence of a Carolina home again after Saturday night I heard this uh ice cream place was sold out Everybody would bought ice cream after the game You Theres got to be a new flavor right You got to come up with a new name Im not familiar with Seths operation of the store on Franklin Street nor the flavors and how that creation works but I would I would agree with you Yeah there probably needs to be something there Something Oh the world were in Allen for Donaldson Heres Henderson whos been terrific in this first half by the way North Carolina switching on the top of the floor And Hendersons got to be able to win this Thats a long three for Doat and a foul on Wilson A rare fourpoint trip coming for Noam Dolra I know nowhere in Coral Gables but he shot that from South Beach Good gracious that was D Debon Im going to have to get my tape measure out and go out and check that Ive heard about your Ive heard about your tape measure You might need an extra one with that one And you never want to foul a jump that far from the basket right Dale No way I mean thats a mistake Noam Doat is from Israel averaging about seven minutes a game in conference play Caleb Wilson West he doesnt make very many mistakes but that time hes so late on that close out Yep And Dol is a perfect seven for seven at the free throw line this year Hes got four the hard way and Miami back to a fivepoint advantage and more zone here Bessar put it up I think he thought Wilson might be there Ball got deflected away Trimbles got it in the fresh 20 and Miami goes Theres Wilson Thats a three Bounds away 3D didnt like the shot I dont like it Thats not who you are The other night when we had the Georgia Tech game he started in the post Swing swing Then he popped out the corner for a three Thats in the flow of the offense AJ decide Nice piece of officiating by AJ Desai here He did not call a foul on the tie up here with Bessar and uh Henderson So I I like this piece of officiating cuz this is a veteran move right The guys are hung up No advantage here Just blow it and inbound the basketball I like it Yep Caleb Wilson who picked up the foul a moment ago takes a seat on Hubert Daviss bench with under five to play now Donaldson Gold left side hanging three and the rebound for Stevenson Yeah good defense by Tar Hills Hes not as good off the dribble versus catch and shoot Pogots on the drive tried to go back to Dixon and momentarily lost Shot clock did not reset 11 to shoot Luca three Got it Bogots has got a pair of triples in the first half Great hustle by Dixon Allen in Miami Right back at the Tarheelss Boy Donaldson can really turn a corner can he Look at that play You talk about playing the game low to high He gets his hips and shoulders below his defender and really turns it Remarkable drive and bucket for Donaldson Heres Dixon out front against Henderson Stevenson cuts to the basket and scoring Nice pass by Derek Dixon Great pass Good patience by Carolina going from one side of the for back to the other to get the layup Twopoint game and a timeout We asked Coach Davis about Dixon and he talked about his confidence and you saw it right there in the last two plays Miami has built a twopoint advantage Its been double figures twice in this first half for the laughter We havent talked about defense at all today We talking about bucket getters Coach and Slay and Kevin coming up at the break Boy what a busy night in college basketball and really good games right here This one followed by Duke and Pit from the Oakland Zoo tonight Kevin Brown Cory Alexander standing by there And were done here at the Watsco Center Donaldson off the high screen got it knocked away U tried to finish Satan High back on the floor for Carolina with the rebound red shirt sophomore from San Antonio gets it back goes to the basket scores What about the bench production from Carolina in this first half Well sometimes you have to go to your bench to get going cuz the starters didnt have any energy early in the game Thats 16 bench points for the Heels They trail 22 to 12 at one point in this first half Its tied at 37 under three to play Heres Renew against Stevenson again say thats too much Left hand turned Didnt go They dodged another one guys You cannot let Reneu get that deep in the paint He gets to the midline and that little half hook Thats a high percentage shot for him Bogots all the way to the bucket and couldnt finish it Miami wants to run Two on three with Donaldson One man and a kick out for Allen Hell try and scoop it in and does Miami back in front Third field goal for Dante Allen cheering triple Hell use the Zetan high screen Dixon tried to go Stevenson Donaldson the steal Defense really pushing the quality of the catch for North Carolina up the floor now renew and he traveled off the baseline against Satan High Dont forget Super Tuesday rolls on from Pittsburgh Number four Duke and the Pit Panthers coming up 900 Following our coverage here from Coral Gables on

Miami taking in the ball game tonight Boots every night for our guy booze Floater no good for Treble 90 seconds to go first half Quality possessions good decision making for Miami to close out this half Henderson Caleb Wilson on the floor Heres Donaldson Thought about it Now uses UDE into the lane Hanging two is good He does such a good job of taking Caleb Wilson under the level of the screen and then coming off getting to his right hand Fourpoint lead for Miami Tied at 37 They put four in a row on the board triple Every time Carolina gets the ball to the middle something good happens Evans will fire for three and hit again Ken Evans has got eight all in the first half Most since he had 15 against Florida State He had three points the last four games combined His minutes are down since he was a starter Yep Hes no points in three of his last four You mentioned the three in Atlanta Hes really taken advantage of his opportunity here in the first half and that depth for North Carolina is on display right now They have played well off the bench Heres Henderson to put it in play for Udears comeback on the floor to replace Hop And now Redu against Bovox Double team coming 10 to shoot Malovitz on the drive Left it short and he draws the foul That might be Vessar Nope Treble to second You play out of the double D You go swing swing You get an open look and a late close out And when you can attack that and get to the middle of the floor you can make something really positive happen So Carolinas best perimeter defender has two And here is Malovitz from Ivanka Pri Dunagi in Western Slovakia What an ABC double header we got for you on Sunday afternoon Starting the ACC number 21 North Carolina visits number 11 Duke at 1 And then number four Texas at number 22 Tennessee

rebound Donaldson with three Two From beyond half court Miami is going to take a threepoint lead to the locker room at 4340 A lot to take in Heres Kevin C So thats thats thats keeping but its interesting The ball game started and all of the ills that Hubert Davis has talked about with his team when theyve not won Reared their head in the first 12 minutes of the ball Great point The turnovers and not rebounding the ball Original starters for both schools as we go to half two Tremble kick out for Dixon and a three to start Back for a miss Cleared away by Shelton Henderson First time theyve penetrated the top of the zone off the bounce Theyve been throwing the pass to the logo Theres an adjustment right away by coach Davis Trey Donaldson runs the offense for first year head coach Jay Lucas Renewed down the lane with a strong move and hes got a dozen now on his fifth field goal Well guys when you get to your strong hand its hard to double team at the elbows and live dribble down Lead is five quickly for Miami Besar had nine points including a three in the first half Heres Treble against Henderson trying to match him now across the corner for Dixon Two to shoot Derek Dixon another three This one no good Henderson another rebound They are in zone under 10 seconds on the shot clock They match up in man and they do a really good job And Renew with force to the basket Blocked by Wilson He said not this time Nope First play you get to your left hand You get downhill and Kelly Wilson said not this time Get that out of here If theyre going to make a mistake Miami is going to make it at full speed tonight music There has been no backing off at either end of the floor by Jay Lucass team here so far Well Im looking at Caleb Wilson right now and just thinking that hes had a couple of blocks Hes made some plays defensively Hes got maybe his defense will stimulate his offense a little bit but he hasnt forced anything Heres Henderson Another hard drive into the chest of Vesar who gets the rebound of the miss Tremble Here goes Dixon And that got swatted away Derek knocked to the deck No whistle Carolina keeps the ball Got another block partys breaking out on one end of the floor Caleb Wilson does it and Henderson said Nah not down here You either get that up out of here I mean the closing speed of Henderson is impressive Hes increased his acceleration here by 8 Look at you And one for Caleb Wilson Its just a matter of time fellas I mean screen hard roll to the rim and look out Yeah I think Renew Watch the tape tomorrow Dont do a cheap reach Either get a good foul or just go ahead and take a business decision Let it go Five for Wilson And the FREE THROW BOUNCES AROUND AND BESSAR TIPPED IT IN GOODNESS hes got 11 Carolina to within one Hes 7 foot with long arms Great instinct on the timing too Yes sir Donaldson a spot three from the right Long rebound Heres Stevenson Carolina has not led tonight at all This is where hes dangerous right here Do they bring the double Fall away spins out Hes so good on that side of the floor Yeah Im not mad at that shot all day long Dante Allen and the Canes quickly into the front court Miami waste no time Patient yes deliberate not They have been aggressive since the jump Henderson against Stevenson Heres Renew against Treble Double team help right side Henderson Thats a three and nobody home underneath Wilson the easy rebound Looks like number eights going to take some initiative here in the second half No question about hes trying to put his imprint on his game SR one dribble Heres Stevenson tried to slash Dixon with eight Hell shoot for the lead Back room miss last touched and Tommy Moresy says its going to go to Miami It was AJ Desai off the inline who checked with Morrisy Basars coming over to check the high pad as well Lets see Yeah this is always one of my favorite parts of college basketball is checking the iPad Thats close right Even sometimes slowmo doesnt help Donaldson out front Miami still with a onepoint lead They just round in a circle here Look at that Renew jump hook Fell off the rim They scrap inside Wilson and pull away Hes missed a few of those at the midline That ball He was trying to crosscourt bounce pass It got kicked Itll stay with Carolina Here comes Boavots into the lineup But to your point Dev I think theyve dodged a couple bullets for reduced got to the paint got two feet deep in the paint just missed the two little bunnies I like Bo Bogots coming in right now because you throw the ball to Wilson on that left block and Bogotss on the weak side He gave him nine minutes in the first half six points on pair of threes He was part of the spark that got him from the 10point deficit at 22 to 12 back toward a 37 all tie late in the first half Bessar thought about it Now heres Dixon double team coming That ball got deflected away Malivets the take away High hands Allen trying to crash the glass Throws it up and scores

he can complete the threepoint trip and push the advantage to four for Jay Lucass team Allen is 65 at the free throw line which means you better be ready to rebound Right on Q Wow Well sometime you know the number go out Trimble threw it up draws the foul Carolina wasted no time in transition there Man Seth is tough Foul is going to be on Teemo Malavitz freshman from Slovakia And here is Treble to the line 69 Ready to rebound Seth is scoreless Two shot opportunities had three double figures in the last four cheering for Hubert Davis Free throws good Dont forget we got womens college basketball coming up for you on Saturday college game day covered by State Farm at 800 And then Saturday night South Carolina and LSU How about that from Baton Rouge Thats a big one That is a big one Theyll be all whipped up down there Kim Moys going to have them all fired up in Baton Rouge That is going to be musty Heres Donaldson in Miami Lead is cut to one after the triple free throws MALOVICH LOB THE DUNK Oh my goodness Huh Is the floor still shaking That was third version of four to the five for the line Yep cheering Bogots Ken Evans Huge boost for Carolina off the bench in the first half Balls in the middle Heres Wilson against Henderson Cant double that Kick out Bogots thought about it Needs to shoot Now he will do his job Wes He made him pass Yep Now Henderson The hard drive Kick out for Allen Another three by the rookie And the rebound Run down by Evans And he stepped out of bounds says AJ Desai Itll stay with Miami Lets go back to the lob for U Well the shooter puts the ball on the floor and Uday said Throw it up to the moon and I go get it Good hands by the big fella Their version of the fourman to the fiveman for the lob I love middle third action I mean when you go middle third ball screen that is really hard to guard And the fact that your bigs can pass the way they do theyve gone mostly middle third with their bigs I dont think Ive seen Donaldson in a middle third action Hes usually on in the slot or playing on the wing 5 minutes gone this second half Allen trying to drive against Evans and going to get the foul That was another point earlier today in the scout Dennis he turned the corner said put him in jail So people at home what that mean is keep the guy on your back and you let him get to the paint You either get fouled or get to the layup and then go and look for that Gort screen which is basically the post up screening his own guy Yes Miami is executing the game plan flawlessly At least is what we saw laid out today Malovitz out of the corner Ud went for the finish and I think a foul on Bessar I think theyre calling the push before he got to the rim Its on Henry Bessar Itll be his second Third on Carolina in the half Yeah So theyre calling the push before he got for the following I Im thinking right Yeah thats close Do who hit the fourpoint play in the first half checks back in Heres Donaldelsson Quick shot U the rebound Besar there Ernest scores on the jump Second double figure in the last five for U Kick for Evans Spins out on the three Miami lead is five here Renew against Stevenson Attacking shot No good The foul My question to you guys why are they waiting for Renew gets the ball as soon as he gets to his pocket hes either scoring or getting fouled Now Dave well when they go with quick hitter right there and they get him the ball in transition I mean absolutely he needs to look to score The last three games hes drawn 17 personal fouls and hes hes drawn four so far in this game Yeah And now hes at the line 21 in four games Thats a lot Yep Now hes at the line Hes got 12 tonight And leaves it on the front rim Malik transferred from Indiana Hes had 20 plus in each of the last four Debbie told you about that at the top The the other interesting part about him is hes only got two double doubles against the ACC Yet he is averaging in conference play better than six rebounds a game I thought it was interesting that Jay music said sometimes you have to remind him go get it I know in Indiana you werent that guy Well youre the guy here Go get it Yeah Right The role player versus the goto guy Its different mindset Its a different mindset So Carolina with Wilson on the bench over there Besar now has three by the way Out of the corner This is triple and the three bounds away So Carolina who was operating at a high rate on threes in the first half A little cold here in the second half Donaldson back out front Renew against Saden High who has returned to the lineup And thatll be a foul on High Itll be his first Five already on Carolina with 6 minutes and change gone at half two 22 now D 22 Another foul Were going to count it Were counting I mean we we know its a factor Its a big part of the game plan to get him to the line Jonathan Pal has checked in for the Tarheelss Malovich is back on the floor with Dove And heres Renu going to work on Satan High Well I heard that smack right over here And Miami didnt get a call Carolina going to operate trailing five Evans skips it in the corner for Powell Hell take it on the drive off the window and in First bucket for West Virginia transfer Jonathan Powell Really good push up the floor by Evans Good decision to get it to the other side in transition Lead cut to three Almost seven minutes gone in this second half at the Wasatch Center Donaldson the floater and they scramble Powell the rebound Heres cheering Evans racing it Hell skip for Powell Ken Evans Zayen High back for Evans in traffic and hes going to get the foul on Do Noam Doat Itll be the third on Miami Crowd not happy as youre going to look at points in the paint tonight Miami has gone to town I mean dunks Eight of 12 left in dunk at the rim Thats 12 of 16 total All in the middle third two with the exception of one in transition right Yeah Heres Stevenson against Henderson Powell Now hell step back Thats a three Its good Jonathan Powell five here in the second half Well sometimes when youre a streaky shooter but right now the streak came at the right time for the Tar Hills tied at 51 and Carolina has only got Treble on the floor as a and Stevenson is starter and that got knocked away A foul is going to be called and its on high again Big on big middle third ball screen action with Henderson making the decision and its a good one He gets to the line Shelton Henderson trying for his sixth straight double figure ball game He had 19 at Boston College 22 in the loss at Clemson So if they keep running that middle third stuff Dennis you know you got to make him go You hear the Carolina coaches in front of us going weak weak They want him to go to his left hand Dont let him go right Nine for Henderson Quick reminder to you we got womens lacrosse and mens lacrosse coming up both from Syracuse on Friday On the womens side number one North Carolina number 14 Syracuse at 230 Then at 600 top ranked Maryland meets the second ranked Ars Small on ACC Network

Evans And theyre buying some good minutes here without Kayla Wilson on the floor Yep Heres Tremble back for Evans That ball got kicked with 1205 to play Miami going back to the zone on that sideline out of bounds 20 second on the shot clock Can you get the ball to the middle of that zone West Every time they have they got a good shot Evans for Powell Heres Stevenson against Renew Fall away Too strong Noam Dovro who averages seven minutes a game Debbie in conference play has played a ton tonight Hes earned it He hit a big three with a foul Heres Henderson hanging two off the mark High the rebound Thats why you make him go left Make him make a more difficult play Powell and it got partially blocked I think Cleaned up inside by Stevenson Hell kick out now Trimble shoots off the mark Carolinas had good looks to lead or tie Not been able to cash out Well here Davis is weathering a storm No Var and no Ken Wilson on the floor right now Yep Heres Dockat Malovitz and then poked away by

of two feet Use the pump fake to create so much space Big time finish Jaden Young back on the floor Powell now to Evans Carolina trailing forward Never led tonight Theres a foul Its going to be on Stevenson for the offensive foul moving on the screen to try and free Evans on the drive For all young point guards at home you make a strong drive off two feet The head fake Nice finish Finishing score Yes 10th turnover by Carolina is also their seventh foul in this second half by my count Heres Donaldelsson open for three Left it on the rim Powell runs it down Lead for Young got deflected Renew cant make the save Itll stay with the Tarheelss So during the last sequence of live action Caleb Wilson went back with Tarhill trainer Doug Halverson to the Carolina locker room and he has not returned to the bench area as of yet Doug has but Caleb has not returned Well keep an eye on that for you cheering Evans inside Stevenson to work on Renew and a jump hook with a right hand Well done to the midline Nine for Jiren Stevenson Caleb Wilson has returned now to the Carolina bench Tar Hills trailing two Were halfway home in the second frame Henderson and Miami Foul line jumper rattled out Stevenson the rebound Quick outlet for Evans Hubert Davis wants his team to move it Young back for Vesar Traffic is there Couldnt finish the jump hook Rebounded Ud Yeah good job by the news Wall enough perfectly Little physicality Besar to miss that little baby hook Well these teams are both under 30 shooting here in the second half Allen trying to extend the lead Cannot pow the rebound Yeah Im like Jay on that one Deb thats not a good shot I dont like that shot at all I mean Im watching Uday how hard hes working off the ball on both ends of the floor Stevenson left it on the back rim Thats probably not a good shot either Lets be honest to our viewers Both possessions from both teams Those were bad possessions right there Wes Yeah Well the shooting has cooled off considerably from what we saw in the opening 20 minutes from both schools Under nine to go Donaldson off the screen stepped through fell off and last touched It will stay with Miami And here comes Caleb Wilson back with the left hand wrapped Looks like Tar Hill basketball trainer Doug Alverson went Angelo Dundee He wrapped it like he was going to slide the glove over it And at times tonight this has been as physical a ball game as youd ask for Uday for Donaldson Young chasing him Lob back for Uday in the dunk Earnest into double figures now Look how theyre getting number advantage at the rim Twoon one Wilson with the right hand turns and scores Wow that was quick Sure was Thats why you cant bring a double to that When he catches it that deep you got to put more pressure on the basketball You cant give them clear vision to Wilson on the block Hes too talented Well this morning they talked about doubling on the pass That time was too late Hes only got seven in the ball game Four here in the second half Tar Hills trail two Renew again and another dunk They bring a big to help right there And nobody on the back side Backto back throwdowns by U Carolinas having some lead flashbacks here Dennis good call partner miscommunication but once again perfect passes to the rim Justin Pippen and Cal went to work on those kind of sequences Besar too strong Miami by four on two dunks by Uday Wilson had tied the game Canes have come back with buckets Donaldson looking for a third straight trip Renu poked away by Wilson It will stay with Miami but Ernest Uday has been the beneficiary of

better known to the basketball world as CY Cy the guy thats always smile Yep Now in particular 3D and Debbie Charlton takes full credit for Udays free throws He is 0 for two tonight but Charlton says he should be at 86 against the conference based on some of his recent work And I said Coach I love you coach Coach but sometimes coach not tonight coach laughter I mean I well worry about his free throws but his 725 field goal percentage is only going up tonight cuz hes 6 for seven from the floor Do what you do pick and roll to the rim Yep Hes an excellent screener He runs the floor hard Hes a great rim runner and North Carolinas going to show some zone here Heres Henderson on the drive and a flush Really zone Whens the last time you drove from the wing all the way to the basket on a two3 zone without any resistance Tied at 55 Thats six in a row by Miami to push it back to the lead of six Two ud dunks and one from Henderson for good measure Right Well I like changing the rhythm of the game You have to do that sometimes And sometimes but dont leave the front door wide open Yeah Well and sometimes you change your D it might stimulate your offense Exactly Treble trying to find a path into traffic with a right hand Wilson tried to follow it The foul on Miami Foul is going to be on Renew Itll be his third But to your point Dev yeah but look at this They left the front door wide open They drove right in went in your refrigerator got some went right back out Look at that Theres no resistance at all Well and heres the other thing Like Basar hes got he has three fouls so he didnt want to get in the way of that right Caleb Wilson one of two at the free throw line And the first one is no good Dont forget Super Tuesday rolls on on ESPN off to Pittsburgh Well send you next Number

all the way down That got swatted away by Uday Uday said Not today This guys playing great at the post tonight He is playing his role perfectly Get that shot out of here Dixon Heres Wilson Caleb going to set the screen Try and help Dixon or Tremble rather And now Caleb Wilson with six to shoot cheering Four backing Henderson down Fall away foul by Henderson It was already going to be a tough shot Dennis Shelton stayed with him and made the contact Gay bailed him out Unfortunately a little pump fake hesitation got Henderson off his feet and he was talking He was talking the whole possession right here to Wilson Caleb Wilson does a great job showing the ball and then drawing the foul This is just a veteran player here Look show draw the foul Get to the line So heres Wilson at the line for two Hes got 10 in the game on four field goals Make it 11 All we know is there was a hand injury of some sort The left hand is wrapped up pretty good He is a righthanded shooter We have no idea the

basketball And here comes that fullourt press again Besar is on the floor with four fouls Well I like your point Deon You see the spacing now from earlier Now they can run to their open spots Wilson is not on the floor as Carolina tries to put the press on Henderson and a kick by Jaden Young Itll stay with Miami with 90 seconds to go You got three pretty good four pretty good ball handlers for

Heres Donaldelsson on the first of two You talk about a firstear head coach complete renovation of the roster Youve had some moments already and now youre getting ready to sign off on maybe your biggest win of the year No question about it At a time where youre going to turn around and go to Raleigh and see a pretty sore NC State team after last nights loss in Louisville And thats whats so impressive about our league Every big win you have guess what You have another big game coming up in a couple days Right now eight teams projected for the NCAA tournament four made it last year and Dante Allen the foul thatll send Treble to the line U has been limping the last few possessions Hes really fought through Yep And tremble to the line here for one and one on the seventh against the Kings cheering cheering Free throw good All three of Seth Trebles points in the ball game have been in the second half at the free throw line So he makes this Hendersons been the inbounder You run the

the trap Allen middle of the floor now ahead for Henderson Hes a 58 free throw shooter And there will foul Allen with 266 left What took so long Miami to figure that out Get somebody to the middle Cut to the ball Come to the ball with purpose Get the ball to the line Theyre going to battle Yeah But a good foul by North Carolina I dont think uh Jay Lucas wants Dante Allen on the free throw line Maybe a freshman in this situation Hes missed his only free throw so far This is the son of the former Villanova great longtime NBA player Malik Allen who conveniently enough is an assistant with the Heat Nine for Dante who started tonight for the fifth straight time Dennis I remember what Jay Lucas told us when we saw him in early January Were going to build this program Were going to do it a little bit with the high school guys but were really going to lean on the portal Hes got two good high school guys Yeah sure does doesnt he So that means hes evaluated the high school talent properly to fit his system Yep Backend miss Heres Young Carolina needs threes Treble tease one up Back rim miss Slept out Young floats it missed with 113 left to go and a foul on Stevenson And thatll put Renew back on the line And now Miami knows theyre going to get the win Ill say it again for Jay Lucas to come in have a plan have a message and Debbie the way college basketball is so volatile and the way guys have bought into everything hes sold so far its a huge win Well theyve scored more points in the paint Theyve done a better job at the free throw line Theyve won the battle on the glass Those are
