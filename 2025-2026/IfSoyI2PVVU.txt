Lucas era gets underway Jordan Mincy will begin his fifth season at the helm of the Jacksonville Dolphins The ball is up Malik Renu the transfer from Indiana comes down with it We are underway as a new season is underway here in Coral Gables They immediately go down low and its taken away by Donovan Rivers the junior out of Colombia Three on the way This is Jaylen Jones He misses a fight for down low Udays got it True Washington with a starting assignment for Miami They start four transfers in one of the most heralded fivestar prospects in all of America And Shelton Henderson Trey Donaldson hard to the rack Hell go to the foul line Yeah expect a lot of see a lot of bobbling of the ball coming around Expect to see people may not be in the right spot You can practice all summer and all year but when the game starts and those lights are bright things get a little discombobulated had an opportunity to chat and visit with Jay Lucas last week Had an open practice for some of us About a 2hour practice and about an hour and 45 minutes of it Was focused on the defensive side of the basketball It was fun to watch 100 You look at the stats Last year at Duke he was seventh in scoring defense at Duke He focuses on defense And one thing I like about this new group is they all communicate and talk Trey Donaldson has Miami on the board Makes a pair of free throws at Michigan last season and he helped him to the Big 10 tournament title One of four Wolverines to play starting all 37 games Two nothing Miami early Heres Sturk dribbling at top the key Pestered by Trey Donaldson We will see some hardnosed tenacity style defense for Miami Sturk finds Jones and now Jones loses it Uday comes down with it Heres Renu in transition Miami with numbers Little tie up down low and getting it to go is Malik Renu on the Carl Malone watch list this season If you watch Renu he has great touch around the basket and hes a lefty I call it lucky lefty Most lefthanded players can finish and shoot A 69 senior forward and a transfer from Indiana Lets take another look at it Jack Boy just fighting down low and got it to kiss off the glass Soft touch great angle good spin nothing but the bottom of the net 2025 honorable mention All Big 10 team 2025 Carl Malone power forward of the year award watch list Over a thousand career points in college basketball Drew Washington nearly had a takeaway Here is Sturk working on Henderson Three no good Off to the left The shot clock expires and a defensive stop and a turnover by Miami What we talked about at the beginning of the game were seeing right now you see how active these guys are on defense being in the right spot boxing out getting defensive rebounds and starting to break Ill tell you another thing to note This is one of the biggest teams in the history of Miami basketball They are huge And thats exactly what Jay Lucas wanted to do when he came here and said If were going to rebuild and reload and get back to the tournament and get to where we want to be in year one were going to be big and were going to play fabulous defense Heres Rayu down low with the body off the glass Six nothing You know we call that in Baltimore a body up That was one of the best basketball plays Put your body into the defender create the contact off the glass Every shot that Malik shoots is hitting the backboard and its not hitting no rim Thats a soft touch Three on the way from the wing Thats good Hayden Wood the guard the freshman out of Arkansas buried it First three points for the freshman and the Jacksonville Dolphin Washington in the corner Henderson the fivestar too strong Offensive rebound and that is off the fingertips of Jackson Third Kill Jr basketball If Henderson can make that three its going to change the whole trajectory of this program Enrico Boreio will check in for Jacksonville along with Jaylen Jordan A transfer from Flaggler College hometown of Hillyard Florida Couple substitutions for Jacksonville Nothing yet for Miami Heres Trey Donaldson Bombs away Deep three No good Too short Rebound down to Evan Sturk the freshman out of Missouri That is buried again by Hayden Wood A pair of threes Were tied at six You know one of the best shots in basketball is a transition three When youre getting back on defense you have to identify your men unless you give up open shots And thats what were seeing right now That was nearly taken away And it is Jones got his hands on it Wood gets his defender off his feet They whip the BALL AROUND THE PERIMETER A TRIO of threes for Jacksonville A 90 run Its 9 to6 Dolphins Look at this Jacksonville team They got a perimeter full of shooters And every time the Jacksonville Dolphins shoot a three all you hear from THE COACH IS BLUE Like he knows its going in Its not his first time seeing it Picked to finish six in the Ace preseason poll Shelton Henderson in trouble just outside the paint on the block Now Donaldson working with five PIER SANDERSON OH HELL TAKE FLIGHT The freshmans on the board Take flight Thats something that gets your confidence going Your first your first point is a dunk Expect him to get it going even more now Shelton Henderson went to the same high school as Jay Lucas Jays dad was coaching him He was committed to Duke Jay left Duke came to Miami and Shelton said Im coming with you partner Talk about keep the family close How about a deep three for Sturk Oh baby Evan Sturk with the fourth threepointer in the first four minutes of this contest for Jacksonville and they lead by four Does Sturk have something against Trey Donaldson Every time he hits a three hes talking to him And how about the freshman for Jacksonville with all the scoring early on a 122 run over the last two minutes Now Ray New down low Soft touch with a left hand No good Uday Juniors got it to transfer from TCU Back to Henderson working No whistle OH ITS A BLOCK COUNT THE BUCKET and a foul I just told you once you get your first bucket as a dunk you automatically four early points for the true freshman in the fivestar Jack McClinton Shelton Henderson from Bair Texas Depending on where you look top 20 top 30 player in the country and he had offers from the very best programs in the land Well you look at a guy like Shelton Henderson you know Miami is not known for getting five stars very frequently When you bring in a new coach that has deep connections you get guys like that Im excited to see how he brings it for the rest of their career Take a seat Second highest rated recruit in program history And Jay Lucas brings him on six months into the job So Jacksonville leading by one And theyve made their last four shots All of them have come from distance Three is worth more than two Orio Sturk Lockett Arius and Jordan on the floor for Jacksonville Its Donaldson Rayu Henderson Washington and Alunas on the floor for Miami First look at Sali Altunes a freshman out of Istanbul the European player Ray knew with the rebound Im glad to see Dante Allen very explosive freshman from Riviera and transferred to Milberg and Reu with the left hand gives Miami a onepoint advantage Dante Allen out there as well for Miami He was a Villanova commit Coach got fired last season His father an assistant coach for the Miami Heat And Dante getting his first bit of action here for Miami A little over 6 minutes into the game Heres a takeaway And here comes Drew Washington with a lefthand layup Washington with a steel and a bucket Thats a pair for Washington cheering A transfer from New Mexico Allen had his fingertips on that And Washington pestering Lockett Jr Three on the way trying to make their fifth No good Washington skies for the rebound Lambie wants to run Dante Allen pulls up for three Too short That is tipped out and over the timeline and Dante Allen pulls it back 152 Miami And there is a whistle on the floor A Jacksonville Dolphin is bluffed times in a lot of you know those mid major conferences will tell you lets start the season with a power four opponent Lets see where we stack up Win or lose were going to build on something 100 You know a family member of mine always said Be prepared to prepare to fail You want to prepare early Marcus Allen checks in for Miami Donaldson whips it around down low for Allen Back up top for Trey Donaldson Shot clock at five Down low Allen throws it off the glass Thats good Terrific defense for Jacksonville but Marcus Allen got it to go Im very excited to see what Marcus Allen brings to this team Hes almost like a Swiss Army knife Can play one through four can defend can finish his athletic Definitely excited to see him play this season Hes a transfer from Missouri One of six transfers from power four programs for Miami Now Jones all the way off his thigh and out of bounds That caught the attention of Sally Eluntas Again the freshman out of Istanbul whos got a lot of international experience There he is Speaking of him I was at the pro day and I was talking to Hedo Turku Okay Hedo Turk was the one that brought him over here Speaks very highly of this guy Hedo is a legend So if he speaks very highly of you he must be something we need to watch out for Oh was tipped up and out of bounds Its amazing Jack And you and I were chatting before whether its Jay Lucas assembling the roster or the assistant coaches that hes brought on board all of these guys have a little tie to somebody Theres a member of the staff that brought on Kevin Durant back in the day at Texas You know Dante Allens father is an assistant coach for the Miami Heat Theyve got the international experience the transfers the youth the veteran leaders Thats why Jay Lucas believes in year one he can get this team back to the NCAA tournament as Shelton Henderson will go back to the free throw line Well speaking on that that shows you how deeply rooted his connections are You know how they say in business your network is your net worth Its the same thing that translates in basketball If you know somebody that knows somebody youre going to get somebody And thats what Jay Lugas has done with this roster Heres an amazing note for the Miami Hurricanes the physical therapist and the director of basketball operations are the only members of the coaching staff and on this roster that return The physical therapist and the director of basketball operations the only returnees to the Miami Hurricanes mens basketball program He cleaned houses a clean slate Is Jeff Dyer in his ninth season as their director Miami leading by five Theyre on a 90 run over the last two minutes and 45 seconds And Jacksonville hasnt scored in over three minutes Shelton Henderson hits another Hes got six early points to lead the Canes You want to see something from your freshman day one and see how he comes in and plays at this level You know coming from high school and then coming to you know high level division one basketball its a big jump You want to see him come in extremely early with confidence And thats what were seeing right now Pass down low Now its whipped far side Shot no good Attempted three by Chris Aras Teimo Malovitz the freshman out of Slovakia on the floor now for Miami wearing number 88 A couple of players out there with European experience And Dante Allen turns it over He was looking for Marcus Allen You know one thing I like about what Jacksonville is doing right now theyre switching music their defenses up A couple possessions ago they went in the 131 131 is not a zone that you see often but youre long and athletic Its definitely something thats new Just seem that a team cant prepare for it Now they switch to a manto man and jump the ball screen Expect to see them change the defensive a lot to get Miami off balance All the way to the rack is Jones Jaylen Jones the junior in the transfer from Oakland with a bucket for Jacksonville to pull him back to within four Once again they change back to the 131 zone Put all the freshman on the floor right now for Miami Anderson nearly turned it over He was badgered by Donovan Rivers who I think theyre going to get for the foul 1150 left to play in the half this early Well have to see the first couple games and maybe bring in some some better thoughts but right now with this NL space its going to be tough to figure out whos going to be good and whos not Henderson couldnt handle the pass from Washington and the turnover Its the freshman Malovitz who takes it away trying to go coast to coast and he will Teemo Malovitz the freshman out of Slovakia Great move You want a guy with that height to be able to get a steal and go coast to coast in transition and finish with a little money dip Playing for the mega super bat in the ABA league first division the last few seasons A lot of international experience for Jay Lucas to go along with his transfers and the highly touted freshman There he is He got his fingertips on that One thing about guys that come from Europe they learn to play basketball the right way No wasted means Get right to it You saw that on that transition basket I think thats something else that excites Jay Lucas Youve got youve got the big dudes You think of a Trey Donaldson and Malik Renu who were in the Big 10 a conference that is known for 45 fouls a game and they beat you to a pulp But the international experience too a lot of people think thats more of a finesse game and youre right Its more fundamental So you got guys who can beat and bang Youve got the fundamentally sound experienced uh European guys I think thats what excites Miami as well as the deep inbounds pass lands in the hands of Aras Shot clock at three Area step back pulls up shot no good Offensive rebound is laid in by Allen Uratu Senior out of Missouri State Grew up in Nigeria Jacksonville within four 1045 left to play now Reu tied up down low and a foul on the floor Malik Renu will go to the free throw line for Miami The transfer from Indiana With Jacksonvilles 131 zone one thing that Ive learned in coming to playing basketball you got to be very patient You got to move without the basketball Theres only one man in the back of this zone So if you move the ball the Batman has to sprint to the opposite corner So you want to swing the ball get the back man moving to get a look on the opposite side So Malik Renu to the free throw line and the shooters touch I suppose rattles home where Im from We dont count that the if its the batboard and goes on you you got to shoot another one But in the game one point is one point Now Malovitz will take a seat for Miami Aras will do the same for Jacksonville And now Jaylen Jones will sub out as well in favor of Simon Wheeler Senior guard out of Detroit and a transfer from Ashlin University 2116 Miami Theyve made five of their last six attempts from the floor Rus got seven And you can give them eight Sixpoint advantage now for the Canes who are going to pick up fullcourt pressure here All inbound to Chris Lockett Jr and Wheeler brings it across half court See the pesky defense early by Miami Trey Donaldson locket and a foul Donaldsons going to get called for a hand check Didnt like the call You know when you play aggressive sometimes you play with your hands The officials tonight here in Miami Florida Mark Schneer Claire Aubrey and Ben Stern Great to have college basketball back Such an amazing feeling You what Jay Lucas had his players out in the community and around campus begging folks to show up and support them check us out see whats going on The students have certainly supported them here tonight Second chance opportunity down to the offensive rebound is locket 100 The student section is pretty packed Earlier this afternoon just a couple of hundred tickets for the students remained Al Wheeler dribble drive high off the glass Heck of a bucket there Jack When you get the switch on a big as a point guard you got to get a paint touch You got to make a shot for yourself or a shot for your teammate Well Renew in the paint Little body with the shoulder Jacksonville wanted to travel Donaldson now pulls up fades away on target but a bit too strong ODonald nothing for two from the floor early to start his Kanes career One thing I love about Trey Donaldson he doesnt need to score the basketball to change the game He wants to get his teammates involved He wants to talk on defense He want to make the right plays Thats the definition of a true point guard Third kill Junior couldnt make the wide open three Henderson nearly walked Did he Yes he did cheering and applause Think he walked once and they caught him on the second time Shelton Henderson the offender Malik Renu will sub out Marcus Allen comes in Another turnover by Miami They havent scored in two and a half minutes Five early turnovers for the Canes Jacksonville has converted those five turnovers into five points Miamis converted four Dolphins turnovers into eight points The key to the game and key the sport of basketball Take care of the rock 2218 Miami leading and a turnover Here comes Drew Washington Hes fouled Great hands by TR Great hands very very explosive Nice takeaway there by Washington Foul was on Allen Umadu and a pair of free throws kept up here for true Washington The transfer from New Mexico where he spent his first two seasons in college All Mountain West team honorable mention last season Started 33 of 34 games True Washington Shout out to the hometown favorites Dell Wright and team Why Not True Washington came up played for that program Shout out Dell right A former Miami He basketball player True Washington has 14 siblings The nephew of Tai Tai Washington Jr who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks One of 14 One of 14 Christmas was probably a little hectic back in the day Super hectic I bet the competition was great fourstar recruit One of the best players in Arizona coming out of high school in the lefties attempt too strong Made the first missed the second Miami by five 844 left to play in the half About 3 minutes since Miami last scored STRONG TO THE RACK AND A FLUSH FOR Jaylen Jordan He spent last season at Flaggler College where he averaged 13 points Back in transition come the Canes and Trey Donaldson whos on the board for the first time as a Hurricane I love to see that from Trey Hes been very very passive early on He found a gap finish Trey is very stinkingly athletic Dont Dont be surprised he comes and raise up and dunks on you Well if Mario Crystal Ball was in a pinch and needed a defensive back hed probably call Jay Lucas That shot was wild Here comes Shelton Henderson in transition He can fly An easy layup is good Come fly with me Such an athletic guard Only a freshman Theyre looking good in transition Theyre playing very good when Jacksonville cannot set their defense up Jordan Mincy takes a timeout So you had the flush for Jaylen Jordan Miami says So what Lets get down the floor in a hurry Shut his day here at Miami The Hall of Famer Good Good old times Good old times back there You know laughter making them 509 Good times changing Last time I saw you you werent a dad Now you are So congratulations Yeah 8 months old Shout out to Hampton and Germaine 754 left to play here in the half Miami leading by seven Fullourt pressure True Washington got his hands on that inbounds pass True Washington is very very active on defense I love to see it And the official is letting Jacksonville know youve got eight seconds to get the ball across the timeline Now theyve got about six It wont be a problem as Jaylen Jones brings it across for Jacksonville Junior hometown in Nashville down low Blocked No Trey Donaldson is going to be assessed His second personal foul Hes going to have to take a seat Shelton Henderson is quick off the bench Hell come back in Thats a great set off the timeout to get you a quick basket I love to see how coaches coach coming out of timeouts Yeah you want to you want to put a set in to get a shot at the basket or get somebody else a shot That was a great play ran by Jacksonville Shelton Henderson will check back in as Jaylen Jordan misses the free throw and Trey Donaldson will take a seat and presumably for the remaining 7 minutes and 42 seconds of the first half Jordan second no good Missed a pair I love the intensity that Jay Lucas coaches Hes very aggressing the point position Heres Washington Little 131 here by Jacksonville Little zone defense Henderson at the free throw line Pulls up and he nails it Great play Drain the jumper Miami leading by nine Their largest lead of the half A 6 run Also a discrepancy at the free throw line right now Heres a deep three on the way A rain makingaking three No good The attempt by Borio One thing youre seeing right now you can live by the three or you could die by the three Jacksonville came out smacking splashing jacking and hitting But now they just straight missing Theyve missed their last eight They were four of five They were 0 of one They made four in a row Now theyve missed their last eight Getting cold It happens Lets see if they can heat it back up Jones dribble drive on the baseline Take it away Here comes Al with the left hand Had it swatted away Another opportunity Shelton Henderson couldnt convert on the other side of the rim I thought we was going to see Showtime on that one I thought hes going to throw it up there And a little bit of trouble handling the outlet So now Jones will try to settle things down for Jacksonville High screen by Jordan Out to Borio Now Jones thought about a three Trying to work it down low now and he will Thats an easy bucket in the flesh for Jordan with a dunk To a sevenpoint game They got the switch they wanted Went to the mismatch and got a basket Allen had the pass kicked away by Borio And now Michael Harper Jr is going to check back in and Tito Deng the junior out of South Sudan will check in for the first time for the Dolphins I think hes related to Lo Deng What You think hes rel related to Lo Deng I dont know Maybe could be Hes got the height got the length The one thing about the run zone you have to hit those gaps Were not getting any paint touches Hit the gap Make the defense commit Dante Allen threw it away JACKSONVILLE WITH NUMBERS IN TRANSITION Henderson fouls the shooter The bucket is good That was Aras and hell go to the line looking to convert the threepoint play Boy a heck of a bucket there by Chris Aras the sophomore out of Jacksonville One of just two players on this Dolphins roster that hails from Jacksonville Six additional players within a couple of hours of campus Aras with an opportunity here to pull Jacksonville back to within four with 552 cheering left to play and he doesnt How about this Jay Lucas not messing around Trey Donaldson has two fouls and Jay Lucas is going to put him back in He needs his point guard back in the game You want to get your floor general back on the court especially hes a new team You want to kind of continue to boost his confidence and he makes plays You want to get a guy that can get a paint touch and make the defense move Well hes got to be careful with those two fouls Washington gets locked up now Henderson Washington wing three Looks good It is good And he blows a kiss to the Dolphins bench Great shot The ball move Got a paint touch Swing Swing Jumper Those are the best threepoint shots when its off a swing Quick swing to another swing Nothing but the bottom of the net Drew Washington made 33 starts last season at New Mexico Averaged a little over 10 points per game And theres a foul Shelton Henderson with another foul He picks up another one Be the fifth foul by Miami That is the second foul for Henderson So hes going to have to take a seat And it looks like Teemo Malovitz the freshman out of Slovakia will check back in as Enrico Boreio the sophomore out of Brazil will go back to the free throw line for Jacksonville You look at Sen Henderson on that defensive play He had the right angle He used his body to wall up but the first mistake he kind of put his hands back down on the def on the offensive player Would have kept his hands up That have been a clean defensive play but these are things that you can kind of clean up as a year goes on Thats a freak athlete right there as a true freshman Selton Henderson So here comes Teimo Malovitz Hes back in Another opportunity here for Enrico Boreio who appeared in 13 games last season before he suffered a noncont injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season and he missed that one So he made one of two Its a sixpoint game Donaldson Renew wide open three on the way to Strong and theres a foul on the floor Its going to be on Jacksonville Its going to send Teemo to the line To the average eye you wouldnt understand how how important it was that Trey Donaldson got that paint touch He allowed the defense to move and he got his teammate a threepoint shot Thats why you want to get your starting point guard back in the game because he understands if I get a paint touch that gets my teammate over Foul was called on Jaylen Jones A oneonone opportunity after the foul and Malovitz hits the first You know they really like Teimo Malovich because he can beat and bang down low and they also feel like he can step out from behind the threepoint line as well where he shot 36 and a half internationally Great height great shooting ability and hes got number 88 I I wonder what the what made him pick We might have to ask him after the game like what made you pick 88 Just looks clean Thats the infinity you know It could be infinity to infinity and beyond like they say Jay Lucas being careful with Trey Donaldson He just subbed him out Fullcourt pressure once again by Miami Sometimes you want to get your point guard in for one play to get the offense moving to get your teammates a shot and thats what he did right there Got two baskets two points Aras had it a long way from the basket Hands it off to Boreio Slips it to Jones working on Allen all the WAY TO THE RACK AND HE GOT IT My goodness Marcus Allen couldnt keep up I always say as a as a smaller guard the low man always wins He got under him He got under him Scooped it up See where the contact is See a foul Yeah A little bit with the body Little bit A little bit early A little bit of contact early I dont know if I would have called that an one Thats a great attack to the basket You got to make the ref make a decision And thats what number two on Jacksonville did So another unconventional threepoint play opportunity here for Jacksonville Theyre within six Jaylen Jones I never saw that cover to John Randy Brown with the pink swoosh cheering He was Mr Basketball growing up in Nashville Was Jaylen Jones and he pulls Jacksonville to within five Hes been at Tennessee State Hes been at Oakland Now hes a Dolphin Donaldson back in Allen down low Doesnt know what to do with it Now he does Spins a little Hook shot is good Once again Trey Donaldson getting the paint touch making the defense move and making the right read to his teammate This is an underestimated look at what a true point guard does for his basketball team You dont need to score you need to get a paint touch and get somebody else a shot And hes doing an amazing job with that to start his basketball And Malovich just got called for a foul And a oneonone chance coming up here for Jacksonville The referees very early on are keeping things under control Often times youll see a lot of officials let them play in the first half Things get tight in the second half but theyve got it under control here in the first half Yeah everybodys trying to figure it out from the players or the coaches the refs right Call it consistently over the course of 40 minutes Thats all you could ask for as Ernest Uday Jr the transfer from TCU pulls down the miss U back in Another foul be the ninth on Jacksonville And Miami just one more away from two freebies 416 left to play in the half Dante Allen will check in for Trey Donaldson So back and forth Donaldson goes from the court to the bench You go to offense defense You know that Donaldson can get a paint touch and make a play for his team And then you bring Dante Allen in for defense Ive never seen it happen like that so quickly but that shows you the the uniqueness of Jay Lewis and his coaching ability And theres a level of aggressiveness there too Hes not being passive and saying You can sit the final seven and a half Well see how it plays out He trusts his veteran whos been in a lot of college basketball games at Auburn and at Michigan to go in there as a veteran Dont commit a foul Run the point for me and on a dead ball well get you out Well Washington made the first free throw And now Hayden Wood checks back in for Jordan Mincy Head coach for Jacksonville Has the Dolphins with an eight Washington looking to make it a ninepoint game And he does with 416 left to play And no let up by this Miami defense Fullourt pressure Kind of that hybrid fullcourt pressure Make them bring it across the timeline with about 20 seconds left to play on the shot clock Miami desperately trying not to let Jacksonville get into the flow offensively Theyve done a pretty good job of it so far The length on this team right now on the court is is is theyre very very tall very long 355 left to play Miami leading by nine Opening night college basketball Play three of five from the floor with those eight points Yeah tied for the team lead along with Drew Washington whos got cheering eight himself Shot clock at four down to three Wheeler spinning in the paint dishes it off Thats a beautiful D feed to Jaylen Jordan Great paint touch to make the defense commit and drop off of the big no panic with the shot clock winding down Marcus Allen finds Dante Allen Whistle on the floor A turnover He stepped out of bounds So bucket for Jacksonville Theyre within seven now They forced the turnover Can they creep closer with three and a half minutes left to play You know they Miami hasnt been able to truly truly pull away Soon as we cut a pull away Jacksonville makes a play and cuts the lead back a little bit closer Wheeler at the command here for Jacksonville Jordan hands it off to Wheeler Dante Allen pestering Wheeler Heres the three Thats an air ball Offensive rebound by third Kill Clock winding down Wide open Look about 10 ft away No good Malovitz and Ud both had it Probably give a rebound and credit Malovitz with one Dante Allen wide open three from the wing is no good Marcus Allen flies in for the offensive rebound Another opportunity here Second chance opportunity points right now for the Canes Allen up top U got hit Hell go to the free throw line Great job to get the ball in the high post Make the defensive committing Philadelphia big fella We want to get Ernest Udo going on get going on offense We we havent seen much from on offense Hes doing a great job rebounding the ball Great job defending the pick and roll We want to get him some touches on offense to kind of reward him for his efforts right now On the Kareem Abdul Jabbar watch list to start the season Grew up in Orlando a senior at 611 transferred in from TCU spent the past two seasons at TCU after beginning his career at Kansas Last season honorable mention all Big 12 He was seventh in the conference with seven and a half rebounds per game 11th in the conference with a little over one block per game He does what hes supposed to do very very well Rebound the ball block shots be active on defense and offense Loose ball tie up and Jacksonvilles going to call a timeout Theyve only got two left It will be their basketball coming out of this timeout Theres 236 left Well step aside real quick on AC last year since 2017 Tonight Mikes the marks the 34th alltime meeting between Miami and Jacksonville And for Jacksonville their last victory came in 1971 These two playing for the first time since the co shortened 2020 season So Miami by eight 220 left to go Shot clock at nine cheering Wheeler looking survey Clock at three Clock at two Dribble drive high off the glass No good Uday pulls down the rebound Here comes Rayu and he got whacked Hell go to the free throw line What Im seeing with Miami right now theyre very very good in transition They have a lot of fast guys a lot of guys that can get the ball off the backboard and rebound and start the transition I really like what Im seeing in Miami training in basketball right now They want to go fast dont they They want to be fast You got to be fast 16th free throw kev up here for Miami in the first half Theyve made 12 and now theyve made 13 of 16 Uh thats one heck of a way to win right there You get yourself to the free throw line 16 times in a half An 81 clip That means theyre theyre attacking the basket and making the ref make a call Force somebodys hand Be aggressive Missed the second So the back end no good Back to a ninepoint lead Largest lead of the night Miami by nine Went on a 100 run Create a little separation here in the first half True freshman Shelton Henderson pacing the team with 10 points Jaylen Jordans got a team high six for Jacksonville Foul is going to be on True Washington Thats a move that you dont see a lot that you should see a lot more You know just pump faking get the defense in the air and draw in the foul Nice job Especially the first game of the season Everybodys adrenaline is rushing Youre going to jump for anything Great play by Lockett Jr to get you Washington in the air right now Chris Lockett Jr the transfer from Boise State in 25 games made five starts last season as a red shirt freshman at Boise State Played a little over 12 minutes per game for the Broncos Former Mr Basketball in Louisiana Gatorade player of the year Hes a heck of a prospect coming out of high school fourstar recruit in the ESPN rankings Lead is back to seven for Miami after he made a pair from the free throw line Marcus Allen three No good one and done chance Rebound down to Lockett Wants to push the pace and a little tempo here Now Wheelers got it out near half court looking back towards Jordan Mincy whos barking out what he wants here offensively This is a huge possession for Jacksonville going into the half Sure is Being down seven You get a basket here Boost that confidence cheering Wheeler working Boy is he quick with the basketball Spins Lock it Dribble Fadeaway jumper off the side of the glass One minute left to go Here comes Trey Donaldson and he had it stripped clean by Lockett A turnover by Miami Here comes Wheeler Lockett wide open three Started the whole thing Couldnt connect with flying and Sor in is the freshman Hayden Wood Fivepoint game 44 left to play That shot no good by Washington Hayden Wood cleaned it up Hes got eight points here in the first half Tough shot You want to try to go for a two for one but you want to get a better look than that But I see what he was trying to do Trying to get a two for one but you got to get a stop right here A fivepoint game 22 seconds left to play Lockett Jr trying to find something to do with the basketball He dribbles left hard to the rack Shot no good Trey Donaldson had it poked away Miami basketball with a little over eight seconds left to play in the half Jacksonvilles picked up the intensity the last couple minutes of this half Picked up the int A team like Jacksonville has nothing to lose You dont use it youll lose it Hell take a timeout Well be right back Its been a fun first half here at the Watsco Center and the Jacksonville Dolphins started four of four from distance They are since 0 for 10 Miami hasnt scored in 4 and 12 minutes Theyve attempted eight threes Theyve only made one of them It is their basketball coming out of the timeout with 81 seconds left to play Boy Miami had created a little separation They had a 100 run here in the first half but theyve gone ice cold from the field Jacksonville back to within five Shelton Henderson checks back in Hes going to inbound the ball to Trey Donaldson Well see what Miami can do with 8 seconds left I expect to see a high pick and roll right now for Donaldson going full speed to get a shot at the basket or a shot for somebody else Donaldson picks it up Clock down at six down to five Here goes Trey Donaldson He draws contact Boy its a veteran move There we go High pick and roll Attack the basket I believe they would be in the bonus anyway So you want to get a shot at the basket and he did what he had to do Pair of free throws kept it up here for Trey Donaldson Great rejection of the screen right there Drew the contact on Chris Lockett Jr Thats his second and both sides going to make a couple of substitutions here after the first free throw by Donaldson and the first is no good Put the front of the Thats one thing about this Hurricanes basketball team Its good to see where youre going to get your scoring from early because right now its wide open Whos going to be your goto guy Whos going to get your scoring Whos going to be your defender We get to see that with the first opening season game First possession belongs to Jacksonville here in the second half It was in the hands of Evan Sturk who played just a handful of minutes Started the point guard for Jacksonville The Dolphins Jones hands it off to Third Kill Jr Rivers working down low spinning on Uday STILL SPINNING AND THE bucket is good And a foul to boot as well I would love to see Uday just keep his hands up Such a long athletic defender Its no point to have that hand down right there Keep them both up He cant shoot over top of you He got Uday to work left a little bit Just enough And he found just enough daylight there to put that in So Donovan Rivers with a bucket but he cant convert the free throw Just a pair of points for the Dolphins but they are within four about 30 seconds into the second half It is Rayu Donaldson Henderson Uday in Washington Trey Donaldson bombs away too strong Ernest Uday Jr offensive rebound He hands it off to Malik Renu who puts it up and in Hes got 11 Great rebound Great offensive rebound Great pass to big man Layup Lefty filet Deep three and no good Uday down for the rebound Its the eighth rebound for Unis U Jr And heres Shelton Henderson Strong to the rack Hes got a team leading 12 now Miami is very strong in transition One thing Ive seen from this basketball team right now is they look better in transition than they do in the half court Jones with a lefthanded pass to Sturk Jones deep three from the logo No Puts it on the floor and it was blocked at the rim And the shot clock will expire Thats a turnover I really love the way Jay Lucas is coaching right now Hes literally the sixth man on the court Especially Jay coming from being an amazing point guard Hes almost the six man on the court talking to everybody Hey shooter get back You want to see that from your coach right And by the way thats exactly the kind of defense that Jay Lucas wants A hard dribble drive to the hoop but four hands were there It wasnt going anywhere Hook shot and an air ball by Rayu No go there on that offensive possession for Miami And Jones quick across half court Left side to Sturk Miami will man up defensively Jones wing three no good Trey Donaldson with a rebound Thats his fourth Hes got five points as well Slow moving to start the second half Going left And Rayu walked with it Ooh theyre going to get him for a foul If Im Jacksonville Im sending Malik to his right hand Hes super super strong with that left I want to send him going right Didnt see a whole lot of contact Didnt see a lot enough to get the foul called Yeah but the foul was on Donovan Rivers Thats his third so theyll have to take a seat I love Maliks game though I love the way he plays I love music He plays with such finesse Hes never like really worked up He plays at his own pace At times they just want to get him under control Time of the key Drew Washington down low for Ray Newu Uses his body Puts it up and in Thats the finesse Thats the body control Thats the experience It looks like a simple shot but he has such soft touch Its so funny Lefthanded basketball players always got soft touch They can shoot when they got soft touch Jones hard to the bucket off the glass right side 10point lead down to eight Stops the bleeding It was a six nothing run for the Canes back to the 131 or are they in manto man Jacksonville is being very very tricky Theyre theyre giving you a 131 look but switching the defense is something different Theyre also tempting Miami to pull the trigger on a three a little bit as well Mini just one of nine and one And are they going to give the bucket They will So the basket is good Look for Trey to keep it going Getting it going right now Get that paint touch play off two feet float game and one This is one player on this basketball team that Im very excited to see is Trey Donaldson He has a lot of experience playing at higher level playing in the tournament coming to Miami Hes from Florida Hes got a lot to prove to this Florida crowd Largest lead of the night now for Miami They lead by 11 and Donaldson has eight Renew with 13 Henderson with 12 Washington with eight as well Hayden Woods got a team high eight for Jacksonville cheering Sturk with the ball way out near half court Tight defense by Shelton Henderson Nearly fouled Hayden Wood Shot clock at five Sturk bombs away too strong They got to push in transition Here they come I love Miami in transition Donaldson misses down with the rebound is Wood and theres a foul on the floor Im not mad at that play I like the way that he attacked the basket Got a shot at the basket I love that Just another look And Jay Lucas was just hollering at Trey Donaldson He was summoning him over to the bench I think he said something to the along the lines of just do you And he told him to come to a stop Number seven Theres Jaylen Jones That was blocked And its going to be goending Ball hit the backboard and the block Woohoo That was clean That was very close Very nice job I feel like I was watching Sunday night football on that one The way he said that Its a nice wrinkle Nice touch isnt it Very nice So an 11point lead for Miami with B with the basketball 1549 LEFT THE PLAY UP TOP Ernest Ude Jr The death of a 131 You get the ball in the center of the field That back man cant choose to guard the right side or left side Hes got to stay in the center You can find your big man slammer jammer And alioop assisted by Renu And now immediate timeout So lets do a little education about the 13 center with 1528 left to play in the game Miami leading by 13 Its their largest lead of the night Just to do a little housekeeping for you Miami retained possession of their timeout on their successful challenge So they got their timeout back They also get another challenge That was considered the floating TV timeout And so the last television timeout we just took you to was the under 16 So no more floater And uh were good to go every four minutes the rest of the way There was a foul on the floor The foul was on Wood That is Hayden Wood his second And to the free throw line goes Shelton Henderson Kyle can you explain the floater to me Because every time I hear you say flo Im thinking about a shot in basketball offense What is the floater In the first half for the first half of the mens game you get your under 16 12 8 and four media timeout In the second half theres an additional television timeout So the first called timeout of the second half triggers a TV timeout If that comes 5 seconds in or 19 minutes and 55 seconds in you have to take that TV timeout and then everything else is status quo Thats a floater right So if its So sometimes you do see a timeout taken with 1635 left Got it Youve got to take the two and a half minute break Then you play 35 more seconds and then if theres another dead ball foul or you know just a dead ball and a whistle in general youve got to take your under 16 So its that was a weird one though Ben Stewart and this officiating crew did a terrific job He came over and explained it to us uh during that last timeout to make sure and and both teams by the way had questions too I think they were both trying to decipher whos got what timeouts what do we have left do I have a challenge left whos got the ball whats going on Marcus Allen returns to the game for Miami and Alan Uratu the senior out of Missouri State the transfer will check in for Jaylen Jordan Largest lead of the ball game for Miami They lead by 14 Theyre on a 122 run over the last four minutes of play And on a 60 run over the last minute and change Dante Allen was pestering Jones Aluna picked him up right there Keep his head straight up Got knocked off the ball Dead Alunus Wheeler working Oh he gives it up Deep three on the way Theyre going to get Rayu for a foul Oh one he didnt need to take with the shot clock winding down You see Rayu He points to the bench and says that ones on me Got him in the air He got a little step back a little pump You know the the great thing about that step back move when you step back youre creating so much space So as a defender you want to close the gap in that space So if you lean forward thats a foul cheering Got to finish your breakfast No Borio the Brazilian and the sophomore misses the first makes the second applause and Malovitz is going to check in for Rayu now whos got the three personal fouls and Jay Lucas will have a conversation with him and Jays telling him stay on your feet young man stay on your feets pleading his case saying my arms are in the air boy that was a terrific opportunity there for Borio but he only makes one of the three Now Jones with a takeaway and he lays it in Threepoint swing Could have been a lot more An 11point advantage for Miami Dante Allen still looking for his first collegiate bucket Heres a knuckle balling three No good by Malovitz Jacksonville will try to cut into this 11point advantage for Miami right here Three freshman on the floor for Miami a sophomore and the super senior And Trey Donaldson Jones will take it all the way and hes blocked by Altunis Theyre going to say its off of Jacksonville Its Miami basketball and I think Jacksonville wants to challenge the call So Jacksonville is going to take the timeout They will challenge if it is overturned And its Jacksonville basketball They will dont get a third Got it Max two challenges Got to be successful on the first Jacksonville loses the challenge in the timeout Back underway 14 minutes left to go 11point lead for the Canes Malovitz up top for Allen Donaldson between the legs just outside the paint on the wing He threw it away right at the elbow Trey Donaldson threw it away Thought he had a teammate Now hes going to bring Dante Allen in and he might want to have a conversation with Malovitz as well to see where he was going to be on the floor Now Jay Lucas says You know what Trey take a breather Come chat with me Still 5342 Another turnover by Miami Theyve got 11 turnovers Jacksonville only with eight but Miamis got more points off of turnovers than Jacksonville That three is good Straightaway three Aras with six points now First made three for Jacksonville since they started four for four Its an eightpoint game in the paint Little bunny hop laying it up and in True watching That is a tough move One thing Im seeing about True he can get a bucket Well he made it look easy too That was very easy Stay true to the game Gracefully left into the paint and a foul Thats an offensive foul Its on Udeadu So here was the three by Aras straight away Shot clock winding down and then Washington on the other end True The two feet stop I love the two feet stop when you can come off two feet You can pivot to your left You can pivot to your right and you still got a shot I think thats exactly what Jay Lucas was telling Trey Donaldson Remember earlier too off two applause You know one thing that I noticed early when I was checking out Miami in a couple practices into the shot clock Well Miami needs to get a basket Drew was the guy that they got the ball to when he made a play and its translating to the game Thats what you want to see You dont want to be a practice player You want to see it translate Donovan Rivers will check back in here for Jacksonville The Dolphins have already committed six fouls and about 7 minutes and 21 seconds into the second half Washington shot fake into the paint Missed off the back of the iron but U brings it down Allen straight away Got it to go Lead back to 13 Great shot He stepped into that with confidence Left right Didnt make his first three Stepped into that with confidence and shot the basketball You love how Jay is telling his guys step into it with confidence and shoot the basketball Marcus Allen the transfer from Missouri Hes got seven points And another offensive foul and backto back possessions by the Dolphins Claire Aubrey saw it She had the call Its now seven fouls committed by the Dolphins And there you go Theyre going to get Rivers He hooked him down low took that right arm and wrapped it right around Ernest Uday Jr Everything from here on out a oneonone opportunity for Miami They play hard Theyre drawing fouls drawing contact opening things up leading by 13 Its that zone look once again That 131 look by Jacksonville and Malovic down low Allen hands it off to Allen and that is off of Marcus Allen Its Jacksonville basketball off the turnover 1140 left to play Miami leads by 13 Timeout on the floor Well take it with him from the Watskco Center But 13 years 14 seasons took the program to its first ever final four back in 2023 And you want to know one more remarkable note about Jim Larenga It wasnt until he burst onto the scene in 2011 that he guided this program to its first ever conference winning record when he went nine and seven in 2000 Andy Lemon coming out of the timeout A bucket is good for Evan Sturk Big shout out to coach Laringa Did great things for this program Took us back to where we need to be Theres a turnover after the bucket Washington turned it over There is no doubt that the last couple of years for Coach L were tumultuous Its a new day and age and final four team turned into superb players leaving and chasing money But you know what Its the nature of the beast Thats thats where were at And it it ultimately led to coach saying You know what Ive done a lot of good things for decades in this game And hes going to hang him up And when youve done everything he did you can do whatever you want Hang up and be coach laughter Back to an 11point game Corner three Aras No good Theres a foul on the floor It is on Miami It is on Shelton Henderson Thats going to be his fourth personal foul And with 1050 left to go Miamis fivestar freshman will have to take another seat Dante Allen will check out as well Trey Donaldson back in Ernest Dudday Jr back in as well One thing were seeing from this Miami team is a lot of different lineups Yep Go big go small I like it I mean they got some depth We want to see what groups can play well together And right now were getting a good look at who fits well who meshes well with each other Jaylen Jones with the turnover 11th of the night by Jacksonville Donaldson thought about a three Kicked it over to Marcus Allen who misses but Udays got the offensive rebound He was fouled as he hits the deck I would like Trey to step into that and shoot the basketball Wide open left to right shot I was in here last night and I saw Trey getting up almost 500 jumpers and he was stepping into that shot shooting it Ill let him to catch this ball right here Left right shot Only thing about Trey hes going to make the right play right He made the right play to the corner Maybe at times be a little less unselfish right Take the shot Trust your shot So Ernest Ude Jr with a oneonone opportunity here for Miami Spent the past two seasons at TCU Opened his career at Kansas Coming out of the country or uh coming out of high school he was the number 23 player in the country former huge prospect and Bill Self brought him on board left after one year I mean he has the physical attributes of somebody thats could be a supreme talent who is a supreme talent You want a big man that can rebound and block shots be athletic and make free throws And hes showing right now he can do all the above 2022 McDonalds AllAmerican makes a pair of Miami He leads by 13 Little over 10 minutes left to play Sturk with a hand off to Wood The Dolphins will run the motion offense here High screen coming from Jordan Sturk will use it Dribble drive on Donaldson Lays it up with a left hand No good Way too short And its Miami basketball Lockett Jr along with Borro and Ud Madu will all check in for Jacksonville and Ernest Uday Jr will take a seat for Miami and Malik Reu is back in So Sturk with a badly missed jumper and Kanes leading by 13 looking for more Malik Reu with a team high 14 points pacing both sides tonight Washingtons got 10 Donaldson fires away That was too strong And now a defensive foul Lets see who the guilty party is It might be Chris Lockett Jr I like that pull by Trey Donaldson as a shooter I like to see him get into it faster Get to that left right quicker Step to the basket faster Great shot Great look Well should Miami go on to win this game they will probably take a good long look at where things went wrong from the threepoint line Just two of 13 from distance tonight But Malik Renu back to the line Game one under Jay Lucas in the University of Miami Certainly hoping that this is uh game one of shoot hundreds for Jay here at Miami There are many in the country that think hes just going to thrive in this role His ability to recruit relates well understands what needs to be done in todays game at the college level I always say Jay was the right pickup for University of Miami Yeah Six man on the court Thats a heck of a bucket there for Jaylen Jones Jacksonville back to within 13 Jones has 11 Its a team high for the Dolphins Kes swinging around OUTSIDE THE ARC DOWN LOW AN ALLEYOOP UP TOP FOR Ernest Dudday Jr 13 run That back man has to pick a side He throws to left He cant guard the guard on the right side Easy basket by the Hurricanes The lead grows back to 15 again Ties the largest lead of the night Jacksonville hasnt led since the 1559 mark of the first half Its been all Miami ever since And now Drew Washington is fouled Once again Miami looks great in transition They got guys big men that can run the floor They got point guards look up the floor And they got guys in the man that can make plays to the basket I love Miami in transition Foul on Jaylen Jones Evan Sturk will check back in and Drew Washington will shoot a pair Double bonus time rest of the way for Miami And Washington burries the first Hes got to get 11 Nice debut for True Washington Former fourstar recruit and portal pickup for Miami out of New Mexico 64 guard Grew up in Phoenix One of the best high school players in the Phoenix area cheering and he makes a second So hes got 12 6649 now in favor of the Canes And theres a takeaway by Trey Donaldson Yeah he he was a number one DB in the country at one time Yes he was right there We saw it Now Rayu in the paint Spins with the right hand No good Now a battle for the basketball and itll be Jacksonville ball That ball was poked around Boy Renu was working on Borio down low He was spinning He found a little real estate but uh just couldnt convert that righthanded layup off the glass 51 What Miami shooting from the field Jacksonville shooting 42 And Sturk with the left hand Good Boy nice touch by the freshman out of Missouri Sturk is very crafty with that left hand shot He made one before with his left Super confident as a freshman I like what Im saying about this kid Miami with 15 second chance points off of seven offensive rebounds tonight Donaldson floats it up with a right hand He gets it to go Great shot I love how he plays off two feet stays balanced can make a pass can make a shot or he can pivot to another position 36 points in the paint tonight for Miami Sturk swings it Wood cant connect on the three and the Dolphins go one and done Now Miami starting to smell a little blood in the water as Donaldson goes up No foul no whistle He wanted the call And now Wood in lays it in A little finger roll Timeout on the floor Looks like Jay Lucas wants to take a timeout 652 left to play Well go to break Miami leading 68 53 Last three seasons at Duke and the top recruiting class the last two seasons He was the defensive coordinator for the Duke Blue Devils He takes a lot of pride in defense And Jack and I were telling you earlier in chatting with Coach Lucas heres the deal You can rebuild and reload real quick in college basketball these days with the NIL era Think Louisville the last couple of years but coach Lucas says hes going to do it by stellar defense here in year one Anybody that knows basketball knows that defense wins basketball games And thats the type of thing that Jay Lucas is bringing to this program Lets really be big on defense Maybe bad timing on that play Yeah Well Sturk just went flying right around Malik Ray Newu and left him in the dust You know teams like Jacksonville and teams like you know we have a ACC team versus a team like Jacksonville You dont want to keep them in the game You want to kind of run away as the game gets later in the game you want to kind of run away You dont want to get it keep it close in the second half Another alleyoop up top for Ernest U Jr And now a really deep three no good Off the left side of the rim by Borio Dante Allen still hasnt scored in his college debut Former Villanova Kit Dad assistant for Eric Spolster in the Miami Heat Here is Malovitz And now he sends it up top for U Great play Paint touch High flyers come from the right or the left side Great finish by Ernest U So an assist for Malovitz his first Ernest Ude Jr starting to fill it up now A perfect four of four from the field 11 points Rays got a team leading 16 Ernest Uday Jr with the first double double of the season for Miami Deep three by Sturk And airball Nice college Miami debut here for Ernest U Jr Malovitz sent it right up top for him Once again you get a paint touch Borio lost his man Easy bucket for the Kings Jay Lucas going to take a look at the box store And with five minutes left to play his transfer from TCU has 13 rebounds and 11 points No Dolphin has more than 11 No Dolphin has more than three rebounds Miami beating up Jacksonville on the glass Now a knuckle balling three is good by Malovitz the Slovakian freshman It might be a knuckle but its in the net Think thatll be very reminiscent to some Kanes fans a couple of years ago Remember Sam Wardenberg Samber shoot very in similar fashion Very similar Long as it goes in that international experience score inside and out Foul on the floor Dante Allen going to be called for that foul Its going to be his first team foul by Miami So now the Dolphins are into the bonus and Shelton Henderson is back in Hell replace True Washington Shelton has had a fabulous night He has also had a very difficult time staying out of trouble foul trouble Hes got four personal fouls And that three is good That threepoint jumper good by Aras whos got nine points Hes two of six from threepoint territory Malik Reu no foul Now they get one Foul on Rivers Miami will go to the free throw line when we come back Leading by 17 So Malik Renu to the free throw line for Miami coming out of the television timeout Our final one He makes it Its an 18point advantage now And Malik Renu with 17 points Hes been good from the field and from the free throw line Thats his eighth free throw man of the night How critical are those free throws Miami shooting 80 from the charity stripe 24 of 30 Jacksonville just six of 13 Switch that high ball screen Aras fires No good And a foul on Jacksonville Being technical on that switch right there You know in a basketball game you have a big to big playing defense You switch but you got to remember to get your hands up You cant switch Keep your hands down Jaylen Jordan with a foul Wrapped them up His fourth Maligi is living off the free throw line today These are the toughest points of any basketball player life If they got 18 you need two more to get 20 These are the hardest free throws to make Everybody want that dub And Im not talking about a win Im talking about 20 Hes got 19 He had double digits in terms of the scoring department 19 times last season for Indiana And theres 20 Nice start to his hurricane Thats one of the greatest feelings ever when you get 20 on that board Yeah I dont know that what it is about having 20 You could have 19 but it dont feel the same if you dont got an extra point to get 20 Cool customer walks over the bench You dont think he knows He just got his 20th point do you Oh no He knows laughter His careerhigh was 34 against Kennesaw State December 29th of 2023 Oh theres a three in the corner And that is good for Chris Aras Got to get a hand up Arias now with 12 points team high for Jacksonville Three of eight from distance four of 10 from the field Little over three minutes left to play on opening night Now Allen with his back to the basket Back up top for Trey Donaldson cheering Donaldson the veteran with 10 points tonight Looking for 122 short Collects his own miss and he gets fouled cheering Well nobody was there to rebound for Jacksonville And Donaldson collected his own miss and then he got fouled Look at this A nice little right to left cross right here Ah come here Little hesitation little flap but you know at first game a lot of things happen that youre not used to happen right And so now Lockett and Wood will check out for the Dolphins And Trey Donaldson misses the first Not happy with himself This is going to be one of those games I think hes probably going to beat himself up over Three of 10 from the floor or hasnt made a three Hes four of six from the free throw line I think Trey Donaldson would even tell you this is this is a game this is not up to my standards for sure You know you want these type of things that happen early right Hes a gym rat Like I said he was in the gym last night getting shots up Hes also a total team player 100 Makes the right play every time Thats what you want to see in your starting point Yeah As Miami starts to create an identity Itll probably revolve around Trey Donaldson their point guard very tenacious defender and hell certainly lead by example Still not a bad night 11 points cheering Jones out to Boreio for three No good Ernest Ud Jr reels in his 14th rebound of the night And did Miami turn it over They did Im not mad at that look It was a tough call I like how they keep the keep to keep keep the transition going even though the game is you know pretty farfetched but keep pushing the ball keep practicing what youre doing to see if it translates in the game And like I said earlier I love the way Miami looks in transition right now A little over two minutes left to go Kanes leading by 19 on opening night Three Thats good Jaylen Jones Hes got 14 Team high 14 for Jaylen Jones Shooting 50 from the field Jacksonville with eight threes made Miami three of 14 Uday with another bucket 13 points and 14 rebounds for the senior out of Orlando who was so emotional at ACC media days He was asked what it means to be back in the Sunshine State to be close to family to play for the Miami Hurricanes He could talk He welled right up started crying up top foul and now U gets into it a little bit with Jaylen Jordan Right on time You know one thing I love about that kid u like you just said man hes been in the attitude of gratitude Grateful to be in a situation You want to build a team around guys that grateful the game Ernest New Day Jr to the free throw line where hes three of four tonight The transfer from Indiana in Reneu with 20 the transfer from TCU Uday with 13 points and 14 rebounds Ray Donaldson another highly touted portal player transfers Chipped in with 11 Oh we see young D Brown coming in You know D Brown of the Boston Celtics the guy that had the infamous dunk covering his eyes Yep Jersey was retired at Jacksonville Sun comes in to end the game That is Anakin Brown the red shirt freshman out of Jacksonville And yes the son of former Jacksonville stand out Hes wearing his fathers formerly retired number four He appeared in the season opener last season That was it Hes a dug trend Hes got to cover his face Little over a minute left to go Lockett Jr off the glass with the right hand on Dante Allen who quickly gets it out and thats a bucket for Shelton Henderson in a foul Once again when they play fast theyre at their best That shot went in big man got the ball out point guard came in got the ball ended up half court full court Little step through finish Great basketball play Henderson with 14 in his debut one of the best players in the country coming out of high school in Texas Bair Texas where Jay Lucass father coached him He was committed to Duke Jay Lucas got the Miami job and Jay called Shelton and Shelton Henderson said Ill come with you Couple of substitutions here If I do John Le boy freshman out of Houston and Jordan Key a transfer from Georgia both check in from Miami and Lockett Jr working on Dante Allen in the crowd and another turnover You know one thing you want to see when the guys like Jordan Key and JJ Leo come in keep the intensity going because all that intensity is very contagious You want to get in the game cuz you never know when your number is called 35 seconds left to play Alunas down low Allen out to Allen John Le Boy the second had it poked away And a timeout is called by Miami They have 26 seconds left to go Quick timeout 30 second timeout 9 seconds left on the shot clock Miami not giving away any possessions although they give that ball away And here comes Lockett He gets fouled and the bucket is good Foul was on Jordan Kei the transfer from Georgia who red shirted last season to preserve his freshman season of eligibility with the Bulldogs He was a fourstar prospect according to ESPN coming out of high school and was ranked as high as the number 15 combo guard in the class of 2024 by on three One thing I will say about Jordan Key he stays in the gym Always I will say shout outs to coach Sew Hes always in the gym working out with Jordan Key Key is back home A Broward Hes back home Its great to see and theres a lot of them 13 new players no returnees six out of the portal but a lot of Sunshine State talent See if Miami just holds on to it Well the Hurricanes ushering in a new era of basketball here at the Watskco Center tonight And in game one of the Jaylucas era Miami comes
