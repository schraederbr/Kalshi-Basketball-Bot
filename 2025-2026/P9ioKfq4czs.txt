basketball here tonight We are set to tip off the Seinals and the Hurricanes And its Miami with the basketball first And Im going to keep my eye on number three in white Trey Donaldson Hes a senior from Tallahassee who grew up loving the Seinals And now I asked him today when you see Garnet and Gold what do you see He didnt blink He said I see red They underrecruited him and now he wants to beat his hometown school in the worst sort of way Yeah I love the fact on that first possession they tried to go right inside and tack but theres your guy McCrae like a blur the other way for an easy bucket inside The senior from Columbia South Carolina has the seminals on the board first And for Miami coach Lucas has Donaldson Washington Renew who is averaging about 20 points per game Henderson and one of the better rebounders in the league Ernest Uday Jr coming off a 17 rebound performance Strong down the lane Drew Washington the junior from Phoenix Arizona has the Canes on the board Little mighty Mouse right there Put a shoulder into the defender and just knocked him out of the picture Went right on trucking to the basket Couple buckets inside for both sides Alex Steens pass underneath and its converted on the layup by Tomas Bong who has come on in conference play and earned the trust in more minutes from coach Loun Yeah starting now uh in that starting lineup and hes making a most of it Theres my guy Malik Renu is a force to be reckoned with Great hands great footwork excellent around the basket Well of course everybody on this campus today still buzzing about last nights national championship game just up the road in Miami Gardens where the Indiana Hooers defeated the hometown Hurricanes And Malik Renu has a unique perspective on that game as the shot clock winds down to five McCrae steps back for three And you asked Renu who played three years at Indiana and now at Miami who were you rooting for last night What did he tell you Hey he he stayed firmly on that fence and he said I was pulling from both teams Well here is Renu kick to the corner is the freshman Henderson back outside Plenty of time on the shot clock with a full head of steam Donaldson attacks back to Henderson for three Splash Did I mention that this young man who shoots nearly 70 from the field can step outside behind the ark and stroke the three He had two threepointers in their in their game on Saturday afternoon Henderson averaging 14 per game at about 35 from beyond the arc Kanes nearly turned it over McCrae gets it back Ste lays it in Thats an assist for Robert McCrae the fifth who is second in the conference in assists per game along with Miamis point guard Trey Donaldson Yeah both kned up at 117 assists on the season Thats flat out getting it done And I love Steve making his uh fingerprints all over this game from an offensive rebound and now a bucket inside the paint Out of bounds itll stay with Miami with eight on the shot clock Both coaches making their first substitutions of the night AJ Swinton gets in early for Florida State And for Miami Si Altunas comes in Uday will take a seat Alunas not as athletic as U but plays really physical inside Renew kick it back out Washington Shot clock to three Going to have to put it up Donaldson rebound Le Jones the senior from Neptune Beach Florida Here is Jones Natural lefty Goes right around Altunas and draws the foul He will shoot a pair I asked coach LS about Leger Jones because I think his intensity and athleticism and how hard he draw uh drives the ball to the bucket is so impressive And you can see he had the mismatch with Alonsus on him Wasted no time being a lefty going hard to the rack And my goodness look at that head of hair Ill tell you what I wish I could grow some locks like that Douggee Well you retired his father from college basketball His father played at Oklahoma back in the day and in the NCAA tournament in 1990 the Big Eight Conference newcomer of the year He and the Sooners lost to you and the Tarheelss and you sent his father off to pro basketball Well listen I I had a horrible game that one for eight Whats wrong with that One for eight two points five fouls fouled out but Rick Fox hits a runner along the baseline and bailed me out Got me one more game of my college career And young Leger knows that history He knew immediately when that game was brought up to him oh yeah Rick Fox beat my dads team Thats right He didnt mention Scott Williams Williams didnt do a thing Thats 20 the next game against Arkansas 10 to shoot Henderson kicks to Renew off the head fake trying to work the baseline Cut off by Jones Renu natural left He continues to go to the southpaw side Knocked out of bounds by Florida State So with 31 on the timer itll be Miami basketball underneath But Jones strong defender not afraid of the larger stronger players This is an impressive young man This kid right here excuse me number 35 Dante Allen You watch him You talk about energy of Jones Watch the energy of Allen Great job defensively by Florida State to force another end of the shot clock jump shot McCrae goes behind the back working on Allen to the right hand though Coach LZ wanted a foul instead Its the Canes Swinton takes it away and now weve got a whistle and a foul at Mid Yes I got to have one for the Graham coach and he honored me Let me take a a picture I said I had one with Digger when we were in South Pin I had to get one of another Hall of Famer and Coach L And you saw the graphic there that the baton clearly has been handed off and coach Lucas has done a terrific job to rebuild things very quickly on the fly here in Coral Gables They come in having won 10 of 11 15 and three overall 41 in the ACC Kobe McGee has come into the game for Florida State He misfires And this Florida State team they are built on pace and shooting And we asked Coach L today if the threes arent falling whats plan B And he said rebound and play defense Yeah thats about all they got Theyve only shot two threepointers The rest of their buckets have been twopoint field goals and theyve scored six points in the paint Count the basket at one Chanty Wiggins going to pick up the personal foul No chance to stop that steam engine That is Shelton Henderson Thats a good word for it Steam engine locomotive Mac truck whatever you want to call it He takes all of that contact uh like it is absolutely nothing His concentration after the finish is uh tremendous for a young player Shelton Henderson four of six from the free throw line on Saturday And calmly knocks that in that threepoint play to give the Canes a threepoint lead Hes got six points to lead all scores 5 minutes in Martin Somerville into the game at the point for Florida State Something occurred to coach Loun He didnt like what he saw on the set Somerville gives to Jones working on Renu Spins into the lane Renu stays with him Florida State on Q with a three ball This time its AJ Swinton with his first points The fourth tie already tonight Yeah they shoot nearly 35 threes a game They make nearly 11 of those and thats their first one tonight Theyre going to need 13 14 or 15 threes to stay with this Miami squad Wiggins traveled off the turnover Well here it is one more time Two lefties going on each other there And Renew was not full but I love the nonpanic there in Jones and find a shooter out there on the perimeter Well theres the identity of this Seinals team here in the first year under Luke LS They are going to shoot threes and just keep shooting threes regardless of whether theyre going in or not Meanwhile Miami the last four games opponents have shot 43 from three So that gives you more hope that the seminals equation could work tonight Yeah theyre theyre going to like I said theyre going to have to make you they make 11 on the season per game Theyre going to have to make 13 or 14 against the muscle and size against this Kane squad inside Donaldson still scoreless Somerville takes a screen takes the bump Count at one Foul on Allen Coach Louds right applauding that effort by Somerville Not settling for an outside shot and driving it hard to the rack Theres Allen He just gets him on his hip and then right at the point of attack just delivers that little shoulder into the defender thats moving Knows hes going to get the call And I love when these young guys can go to that basket absorb that contact and still finish Young man from a family of cheering educated folks His parents Artha and Martin senior graduates of Hampton University and Notre Dame respectively Their son rattles in the free throw And hes got siblings who attended Morehouse NYU and Ohio State where sister Zoe currently studies neuroscience Wow thats an impressive family right there for Thanksgiving about that dinner conversation is like right are they talking sports or is they talking neuroscience You know Shelton Henderson came away from that drive with a little bit of a limp Seems to be okay Guy thats got to get going for Miami who has struggled last game and its off to a slow start tonight is Trey Donaldson Coach Louds was wor most most concerned about Donald as he hoisted a three And the senior from Tallahassee out of Florida State University High School has his first three points against his hometown school Maybe thats it Maybe you get over amped the first seven eight minutes and you got to settle down a little bit and then measures the distance perfectly on that last shot Look at U trying to sky for that board off the Swinton miss Back into the game steamed with the offensive rebound The Canes playing hard as well was early in the ball game to go for a video review Henderson Donaldson Allen Malovich and Uday The five on the floor for the Hurricanes in their home whites I like that the Seinals came out and did a little backcourt press there Try to take some time off of that shot clock See if they couldnt disrupt this Kanes attack And you know since they got torched by Texas AM Coach L has used less fullcourt pressure but get a taste of it here in the first half tonight Yeah And they fall back into the zone defense as Donaldson tries to penetrate that zone Trey Donaldson now with five points Miami back in front 1513 Yeah Donaldson with the last five points for the Cane So the guy that were saying that needs to kind of heat up Hes that uh draw that stirs the drink for the Canes is starting to come alive The song dribble hand off Wiggins Hes had a quiet start offensively tonight Leaves his feet Was in no mans land Fortunate that ball passed out of bounds off of Miami So with 15 seconds on the shot clock lets see if the Noles can get off a shot Can I just give a little love to Dante Allen on his defense The way he switched and slid his feet and funneled his guy right into U That was kind of a a roadblock down there And to answer your question you can do anything you want Youre a lot bigger than me Shot clock violation McGee could not get the shot off Yeah And I Coach L was not happy It seemed like all four of the five guys knew that they had a short shot clock to work with except for McGee And again a sub in for McGee Let him think about his mental error there So McGee and Somerville go out and back in Jones and McCrae We talked about the good of Robert McCra You referenced the fact that in the loss Saturday to Wake Forest Florida State point guard turned it over 11 times And thats his big bugaboo this year He played as much off the ball at Jacksonville the last couple of years as he did at the point and so he is learning on the fly Allen drives in Malovich puts it up Strong rebound Uday his coach challenged him after shooter round today Said 10 rebounds against this Florida State team is not good enough I want 124 16 from you Maline Allen Here comes Donaldson and he hammers it through Wow letting your defense create offense for you And Trey Donaldelsson now seven of the last nine points for the Canes Theyre starting to really attack inside that painted error Even the zone defense cant stop Canes as Ste goes inside for a pluck Another assist for McCrae Ste bucket I think this Florida State team is best when they first try to attack offensively inside and then play a little inside out to the threepoint shooters on the perimeter That basket by Steam snapped a 90 Miami run Jones swats the shot by Allen Great move by Allen and he thought he was going to get away with changing sides of the uh floor with the basketball but Jones who I love just said You shall not pass Jones calls for a screen It comes from Steam Good hedge by U Five on the shot clock McCrae a step back shot Uday grabs another rebound trying to live up to what his coaches want from him tonight Allen end to end has it blocked and then he throws it away to Bong The young Frenchman turns down the three and he is in some sort of trouble and throws it away And this is my fourth time now doing a Hurricanes basketball squad And I really love the way uh Coach Lucas has built this program where these guys have a lot of love for one another when theyre out there on the floor They turn it over now Here comes Le Jones Le Jones like a blur down that left sideline just elevated and detonated all over the Canes for the basketball tree Donaldson he has seven of Miamis last nine points Canes have made four of their last six but as we were talking during the break Scott Florida State has come with fight so far tonight I love the way theyve come to compete Malik Renu no U with the finish Oh well you said hes coming off a 17 rebound performance on Saturday and he is chewing glass on both sides of the floor here early on U with the big cleanup of the Malik Renu miss Jones McCrae back to Jones putting it up Uday with yet another rebound Theyve only got him for three so far I think theyre missing one or two Yeah that should have been his fourth right there for definitely Good ball movement for Miami The double team comes on Renew who wraps it around for the dunk by Ernest Duday Jr How did Renu do that He had he had two simolles draped all over him and that lefty slung the ball from out of bounds to his 7ft partner on that right block And if U catches it there he knows how to finish Uday picks up the foul You know in our open we showed repeatedly in the game at Notre Dame Terrific interior passing for Miami Big to big off of this turnover Yeah Leg Jones just saw a smaller Trey Washington a true Washington on him and just decided theres no reason to get cute with this Let me use my athletic ability and jump right over the smaller defender Cam Miles is going to come in for the first time for Florida State here at the stoppage Freshman guard from Chicago He and McGee at the scores table along with Henderson for Miami for the game number seven Coming up at 9 Eastern over on ESPN Super Tuesday rolls on with Dukes Miles and number 15 Vandy taking on Darius AOP and number 20 Arkansas The night finishes up in the Big 12 with Darren Peterson in Kansas squaring off against Colorado and Boulder Both are also available on the ESPN app After a 160 start to the year Vandy looking to avoid a third straight loss And any chance you get to see the possible number one overall pick in this years draft Mr Peterson hes only played nine games for Kansas but when he has played he has Scott been very very good Yeah I I like that young man I thought the Bansa out of BYU was going to be the number one pick but youre right This young man at Kansas is truly the real deal Henderson into a crease hug in the air but he was blocked by Bong Bong knocks down a couple free throws at one end and then gets a big block on defense But other than the last couple of years that was not the case at all He had this program in the Final Four just three years ago So its been rather onesided But this is a new day You never know Yeah and and theyve won five straight or five even their last uh five for beating these games Theyve come to compete like you said you pointed out much better energy out of this Simols team Wild shot by true Washington and here comes the second leading assist man in the league McCrae Miami gets back nicely defensively and the seminals pull it out Yeah they have been taught to close out on those threepoint shooters and not let them crack up the three Theyre just one of five behind the arc Terrific pass to find McGee open for three Bring it to his six Like you said precision passing leads to high percentage shots And thats exactly what he did He found the shooter on the perimeter right where he can get it and go up with it And here is another look at this zone defense by the Nolles Do has his first three points and gets that triple right back for Miami Well nice job being patient working that ball from one side of the floor to the other And if you can reverse the basketball once or twice your percentage goes way up Well you know the twopoint percentage for Florida States been really good so far tonight When you get that sort of dribble penetration from Cam Miles for the dunk from McCrae your numbers are going to be good Yeah theyre seven of 11 on their twopoint field goals Tough shot by Dovra Terrific closeout by FSU Chance for FSU to take the lead in this game What a triple Yeah their largest lead was 1310 Renew with the block shot Miami comes up with it Tell you what Trey Donaldson when he puts the ball on the floor and goes into the lane you can tell he was a fourstar recruit not just in basketball but in football as well He started his college journey at Auburn with the intention of playing both sports Yeah Drew Washington exactly same type of mold When they can struggle from the outside they have been well coached to take that ball hard to the racket And true Washington number 10 64204 Trey Donaldson number three is 63 198 And this is Washington being replaced by Allen I like the way coach Lucas grabbed him right there coming out of the game giving him some instructions Pu bottled up finds Donaldson Fancy dribbling A spin move Still working at it Gets by Bong Extra pass to Allen Well I like that swing swing for the high percentage shot Oh no Z Wiggins lost the ball out of bounds along that baseline Yeah it was a a break for Miami as two Seinals kind of banged into each other on the rebound Yeah this is a nice little find over here Little swing swing by Henderson to Allen Allen just a little short with it And then youre right its the two Siminals both going hard for that basketball and Wiggins ended up losing his balance Purdue took the baseline out of bounds and laid it in Teams that execute BOVs the baseline out of bounds plays are always well coached basketball uh clubs and you find one of the top scorers in the ACC right in the paint is great execution Somerville Bad pass Good hustle Here comes Donaldson Come on Like a bolt to lightning Hes got nine Thats twice now Donaldsons been able to take those live ball steals better about 30 ft uh away from the basket and get to the other end quickly It almost had Dante Allen running some interference for him on the left side Well I dont know whos going to catch Trey Donaldson off a turnover with his speed and power Yeah he just snatches that thing And you can see that hair is going back up towards the back of his shoulders Hes going so fast like a blur to the other end Even the headband could barely hold that hair down And again he played five years of varsity hoops at Florida State University High School Also a fourstar recruit in football His mom starred in softball at Florida State Trey grew up in Tallahassee loving the NLES but he was not heavily recruited by either the football or basketball programs Tonight this is the first time he has faced Florida State He still loves his high school not so much his favorite university growing up He still has his high school uniforms that look just like the Florida State University uniforms but he has zero zero Florida State gear in terms of the university Look like a goalend and indeed it is Yeah the little little late whistle of coach Lousy He sprinted all the way from the bench out here to the the midcourt stripe to let these officials know that that ball had hit the glass prior to Henderson getting a paw on it Coach L is only 35 Our two coaches 35 and 37 They should be able to get up and down the sideline The alley and on the receiving end is Uday You cannot lose Ernest U on Longad baseline He will make you pay shoot 70 nearly 70 from the field on high percentage shots just like that The twotime transerformer Kansas JHawk rips away another rebound This kid was fabulous at TCU last year Lucas has landed himself a blue chipper here in Uday All he does is make the squad better Another sloppy pass Somerville jumped the passing lane able to get the shot up on the rim and then tapped in by Chanty Wiggins First two points for the senior from Atlanta Well just two triples for the NLES And you had to ask Coach Locks LS what what do you got to do uh to stay in this game if you dont hit your triples He said rebound especially on that offensive glass They have found some success here in this first half Well Miami has three times stretched the lead to six And every time so far Florida State with its fight with its defense has responded These live ball turnovers are killing the Canes McCrae to his off hand and a chance for three Well just way the Canes have against their rival I love that about rivalry basketball We talked coach Lucas this morning about rivalry basketball and he mentioned Kentucky and Louisville and his days at at Duke North Carolina but he says this is a big one as well And he had really had his team prepared to realize that these canes were excuse me these nullles were going to come out and give these Canes all that they could handle Yeah Coach Lucas acknowledged that it isnt like it used to be that you dont have guys as we all know staying in one place for 2 three four years and playing their rival But still when the crowd is into it when the alumni are into it you get more attention from the media These players understand Florida State Miami needs something Yeah And that Nulls zone defense has got some holes in it And that time Allen took advantage of one of those gaps and just drove it hard to the rack And I love that lefty finish McCrae boy he has been proactive taking the ball to the basket Just couldnt finish that time Here comes Donaldson Dump it off Allen Henderson and theyll pull it back out Great job by the NLES getting back on defense making the Kane circle back out to the perimeter Dante Allen had three early assists for Miami Tries to set up Henderson And weve got a whistle They say called traveling traveling violations Yeah Shelton Henderson was getting defense that time Um really well by Steam Eighth turnover Scott for Miami The good news this time is that it was not a live ball turnover because Florida State has really made Miami pay off of those live ball turnovers tonight Yeah both teams have taken advantage of some live ball turnover situations And most recently it has been the null snatching some of this momentum back in this half Just down to one possession here with just under two to play McCrae and Somerville in the game together in the back court Wiggins sets the screen McCrae protects the basketball Missed layup but were going to have basket interference Count it because Uday inadvertently hit the rim with his hand made it shake and so count the basket on basket interference Yeah when that ball is up either on the glass or the rim you cannot bang into that rim and Uday coming from that blocked shot Got his hand caught up in the net and the rim Look at this little half court trap So its two points for Alfred James Swinton AJ Swinton named for his greatgrandfather Alfred James Makes it a onepoint game Donaldson back to Washington Somehow found Renew Its a tie up with 27 on the shot clock The possession arrow goes the other way That looked a little bit like a football scrum underneath That ball just kind of loose and everybody diving for it down there Uh I was watching that football game at one of the local sports bars I couldnt believe it They got that punt blocked for that touchdown That was the difference in the ball game Its what everybodys talking about around here And you know Fernando Mendoza the Heisman Trophy winning quarterback for Indiana grew up right down the road in Coral Gables Theres another run out for Trey Donaldson He had no points early in the ball game Hes now got 11 to lead all scores Yeah he he has taken three of those live ball turnovers now and raced them to the other end for six of his 11 points and a big old smile on his face Realize hes taken it to his former favorite basketball team McCrae boy he has been under control but explosive so far tonight He really does have good live legs when he gets in that paint to be able to finish above some of those shot blockers of the Kes Just a three second differential between game clock and shot clock Double team gets the ball out of the hands momentarily of Donaldson and now sets up Donaldson to Washington driving on Jones whos going to be called for the foul Well give Miami a lot of credit on that possession Florida State was trying to speed them up and they took their time uh used a good portion of that shot and game clock and then Drew Washington who really needs to get himself going attack the basket So now an opportunity to get some work on his stroke from the free throw line and visualize that basketball going through hope to give him some uh confidence here in this second half and he can get back on track Well that was just the second free throw attempt of the ball game for Miami Renew goes out Yeah we have not had a lot of whistles in this game These officials theyre really letting them play They are controlling the action but theyre letting these two teams really bang one another 11 total fouls have been called as you can see Five for Florida State 64 Miami Florida State with plenty of time 6 seconds 5 seconds McCrae calls timeout So theyve got 42 on the clock to work with Scott great call by the young coach right there Realize that I got that you2 seconds of the first half in this rivalry game Itll be Florida State basketball Down by two Watch for the pick and roll here McGee gets it in Gets it back Working on Allen rising up Florida State will take the lead into the locker room What an impressive finish to the half by the null rebounding total Nowhere near what his head coach Jay Lucas told him in front of the team What they expect against this Florida State team here tonight Yeah Renews really got to pick it up I was impressed with Henderson and Udo though 14 points nine boards Well you say it Scott Williams Malik Renu does it slam dunk to get things started here in the second half to put the Canes back in front But coach Lucas aint no dummy He realizes hes got 20 points and yeah hes going to get out of this young man one way or another Its going to be mostly in the second half Hes going to feed him and ride with him all evening long Heres McCrae being cut off by Donaldson Florida State with it Great job defensively by Donaldson Jones off the hesitation The health defender Washington got a piece of it Jones misses from the short corner and pinballs out of bounds to Miami That was Steam wrestling underneath there but it with Uday Hes got 55 offensive rebounds on the season Almost got another one there And uh hes a handful Think you got 95 rebounds and 55 of those come on the offensive end Thats a a a thirst and putting your nose out there in harms way trying to get that offensive glass You know Uday is every good at 611 266 four double doubles this year Second in the conference behind only Carolinas Caleb Wilson at 104 rebounds a game Going to have a push off on Steen sending Renew flying on that rebound Yeah Renew snuck inside He did exactly what Steen likes to do Get on that offensive glass and Steen pushed up These officials really let these teams play in the first half Neither team got into the bonus situation I hope we see that here in the second half and they dont change it up One thing this Miami team does is share the basketball well They get a good look inside Renew couldnt finish But whether its transition scouted in the half court they really do pass it quite well Catch and shoot three rattled in for the Seolles and Martin Somerville who had a terrific first half picks up here in the second half to give Florida State the lead once again Yeah Somerville came off of that uh bench in the first half He finds himself starting this second half as a result of his good play Hes got six points and four steals one off his careerhigh the game against Texas AM McCrae urged by his coach to get back down floor In the meantime though Renew takes advantage of the five on four Goes end to end for the layup How impressive for that 69 small ball forward power forward whatever you want to call him to be able to not find an outlet and realize hey I got the skills to put this rock on the floor Toes it all the way to the other end for the bucket Well he was a top 25 recruit coming out of high school as McCrae finishes Renu actually originally committed to his hometown school in Gainesville in Florida but then wound up switching to Indiana where he spent the last three years for Mike Woodson but now in his one year at Miami having a terrific season Here he is with the basketball averaging 20 points per game Yeah just a Big 10 honorable mention the last two years at Indiana Hes playing like a MVP of the ACC this year Henderson got it You talked about the big mans touch in the first half There it is again Yeah that is now his second triple in this game Hes two of two from behind the arc Look at this action in to end Here comes Henderson with a head of steam Blocked by the help defender Somerville but the first man there Robert McCrae commits the foul Well you saw Renew take it coast to coast this time Henderson gets it at about the 34 length and then he takes it all all the way But look at that one right there I think that might have been a twopointer Looked like his toe was on the line but nonetheless showing off his form from the outside Uh and I love that block inside but hes just like a roadblock right And then this young man look at that slamming that left shoulder right into the defender and earns a trip to the line Hes knocking down his free throws tonight too Yeah we got a good view of what its like to see Henderson coming downhill at you from our baseline handheld camera And Scott I would have gotten out of the way You made a business decision Let let him go to the bucket Yeah For a freshman he they list him at about 240 Jay said Hey he came in here got on the weight program the training program He actually got too big They had to back him back down to about 240 cuz he was up around 250 255 Thats his first free throw miss of the night I think I jinxed it Well thats one area he will improve at 56 on the year coming in Wiggins hands it off McCrae and weve got a whistle Its going to go against Miami and it goes against number eight Thats Ernest Uday Jr Now weve got these numbers the last few years for the uniforms between six and nine You got to decipher a little bit more when the officials throw up all sorts of twohanded cheering fingers and say Is that 88 44 Yeah And and and thats one of those bumps that they let go in the first half They call it here in the second half Theres Wiggins stroking a triple The former Clemson Tigers spent the last three years as a rotational piece for Brad Brownell Now one of the key pieces for Luke Louns at Florida State I am impressed with coach Lous teams effort here in this ball game tonight Everything but the finish inside for Henderson I thought Henderson was going to go up and use that first Slam that ball home He tried a little bit of a push shot Just couldnt get it to stay in the basket Tell you what McCrae is getting into the lane at will More of these threepoint shots Theres one thing to shoot 35 threes but make 11 of them Thats you know 290th uh in the country percentage You got to drive that thing hard for the rack and take the fight for state this year And we wanted to know are you more your dad Youre more your mom and who shot who was a better shooter and who have you learned more from And and he didnt really want to say one over the other but he finally did Yeah He he said his dad got upset because he in another interview said his mother was the better basketball player So he finally got him off that fence He admitted mom was a better basketball player Taught him how to shoot Dad taught him how to be tough Uh and used to beat him up on the court So laughter he showed a little more love for his mom than get taking some of those beatings on the basketball court that hed like Well Lamont and Michael have raised a wonderful son in Chanty who actually was offered by both of his parents alma moers but wound up going to Clemson for three years and now finishing out his really good college career up in Tallahassee Nearly 5 minutes into the second half and its another steal for Florida State Miami has been loose with the ball Donaldson somehow stopped that fast break Didnt get the foul Seminals will keep possession Yeah theyre just really good both squads at getting into those passing lanes Maybe its a little both teams being lacked a days ago with some of those passes across the perimeter But both teams have gotten these live ball turnovers and theyve been able to race it to the other end quickly Yeah that was the 12th Miami turnover Lets see if Florida State can cash in Kobe McGee with it Bong has come back into the game for FSU And this is Cam Miles who just had the steel The freshman from Chicago Puts it inside to Wiggins cheering Did he get that move from his dad or his mom Mom was a really good center Again a Hall of Famer at Missouri State Well I dont know where he got it from but it was real nice Goes outside for a triple then goes back inside for a spin move And just that little up fake gets uh the defender off of his feet and then he comes back with the shoulder gets the contact So nice job flashing the footwork in the paint cheering Well Chanty said he realized music as a sixth grader growing up in Atlanta that he was taller than his peers and thats when he began taking hoops seriously cheering along with his parents guidance Well heres our ESPN NBA Wednesday Rivals Week double header Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs are in Charlotte taking on LaMelo Ball and the Hornets at 7 Eastern And then SGA and the Thunder continue to have the associations best record They square off against Giannis and the Bucks NBA Countdown tips off coverage at 630 pm Eastern time Wednesday with former NBA power forward Scott Williams Yeah Im Doug Sherman Power forward right Yeah And I like the power game that the Kane excuse me the Simols have played here against the Kes They are up by five and they have been taking the fight right to Miami Well this is Florida States largest lead of the night Good looking three once again Henderson a perfect three for three from distance Yeah his second triple here in the second half and Miami really needed a bucket and the freshman delivered Miles uses the screen from Wiggins Long pass too long No chance for AJ Swinton all 66 of him to get up Thats the eighth turnover committed by the Seinals And kind of an unforced turnover right Like yeah there was a little pressure there but youre trying to make a pass 45 ft when an easy pass is 15 ft away from you You played baseball coming up in LA hit a single you dont have to hit a home run every time Thats exactly right and and then they had been doing that right just taking their time taking care of the ball working it around and getting good shots Renew against the double team draws the foul Well in that first half the Canes only got to that free throw line three times And you have seen here early part of this second half Coach Lucas is trying to make it a point to feed Renu inside one for get him going offensively but also to get getting uh more free throw opportunities Second foul on Kobe McGee Steen and McCrae will check in for Florida State after this free throw from Malik Renu Well the senior from Miami out of Mount Bird Academy is the son of Patrick and Melanie Renu And much like Chanty Wiggins his mom was a college basketball star at then division 2 Cheney University outside of Philadelphia and also an athletics hall of famer at her alma mater Her son putting up huge numbers here at Miami Yeah I know we can only fit so much on that graphic but I want to add this young man is 15 of 44 coming into this game from three for 34 He also shoots 80 from the free throw line fight for the rebound And thats what Florida States been doing all night long Up by two the Seinals looking for their first ACC win of the year They have dropped all five Meanwhile Miami has won 10 of 11 but its a rivalry game so you throw the records out the window McCrae had it poked away I know they lost that one but this is not even close to the team we saw play NC State uh a couple weeks ago when they were down by 45 at one point Had no fight had no confidence This is a completely different Florida State team were watching here tonight Youve got to give the head coach a lot of credit for that Trey Donaldson off the crossover short on the pull up long rebound comes to Florida State foul on the perimeter and its an illegal screen against Alex Ste Yeah you nailed it right there Steam tried to get out there Thats a combination of Steams fault trying to set a last second screen while his teammate is already in the process of moving to the left You got to give that big if thats the play to time to come out and set his feet and then drive your defender into that screen then come off of that screen Give yourself an advantage and let Steam roll to the buck Scott I dont know if you caught that graphic our crew just showed Florida State hasnt won on the road yet this year at 0 and seven Miami hasnt lost in this building this year 110 And of course Florida State is taking the fight to Miami here tonight Hurricanes keep possession Allen thought about the three Now uses the Uday screen and back outside 12 on the shot clock Yeah McCrae did not like that screen by Uday Hes got his teeth clattered on that one Donaldson knowing Jones picks clean the rebound Florida State with numbers McCrae the bounce pass The gather count the basket on the goend against Renew Yeah I think Mongs going to get credit for that bucket there underneath Hardfought bucket down there but nice little drop of the dish right there And then that thing off the glass as you can see Renu coming over and blocking it after it already hit the glass I love the way I cant say it enough The Siminals are competing with Jones on one end the song on the other cheering Allen off the mark McCrae from the elbow Soaring for the rebound is Allen Hell dribble up Good looking freshman from Miami out of Mont Academy as well Shelton Henderson lost it on the way up and theres a whistle and a foul that will take us to break In this rivalry game his Seinals with a fourpoint lead over the Hurricanes Florida State led for only a minute in that first half but did lead by a point at the break Wiggins is going to be caught with his hand in the cookie jar Thats going to be the sixth team foul now on the uh Simol So with 1123 for each foul the rest of this half is going to send the Canes to the free throw line So that effort by coach Lucas to punch it inside is going to pay some dividends here the rest of this half So a nonshooting foul Miami with the ball Donaldson gets rid of the ball Hes been held scoreless so far this half Manu blocked cheering Somerville gives it back to McCrae to Somerville for three Uday doing what his coaches told him before the game Dont go over or around Florida State Go through Florida State Thats rebound number seven And again the goal for him was get more than 12 tonight Renus pass deflected away by Miles Miami keeps Renu to the right hand Banks it in Well it was a nice job there by Allen to punch it back into Renu And with new life down there on that block he knew what to do with it 11 points now for Renew after a slow first half Jones skip pass McCrae into the corner thought about it Defender goes down now The open corner jumper from the other side by Jones Miami down by two with the basketball Donaldson Little teardrop No Bong hustling back for the rebound Yeah And Donaldson holding his hand after that shot attempt Something to watch Right hand to right wrist Wiggins turns Nobodys defending him so he puts it up and in Hey that was old school 90s basketball right there Back to the basket you turn around nobodys there You knock down the mini We saw Notre Dame go to zone defense against Miami on Tuesday last Tuesday and it looks like the Nolles have found some success with their zone defense Well they get the corner three from Renew Thats too strong Florida State with a ball of four McCrae goes oneonone Left it short Long rebound back to McCrae Somerville off the hesitation Miami gets the stop Uday with another rebound Miami though has missed seven of its last eight at this end Yeah And give the Canes a lot of credit That was great defense by Henderson Kanes turn it over for the moment but Bong was on the end line when he caught that pass So Miami will keep And with that stoppage several new players coming onto the floor Yeah it looks like a hockey change right there I think it was three on one side and three on the other These guys are working so hard Theres many players that needed a blow Wiggins Bong and McCrae out for Florida State Donaldsons no look pass right through the hands of Washington Put a little steam on it and a little high Washington with his hands kind of down in the shooting pocket closer to his waistband Could not snap his hands up over his head to catch up with the speed of that pass Another unforced error by the Canes to find themselves down by four Miami has gone for 100 points or more four times this season Among the highest scoring teams third in the conference so far this year but this Florida State defense has held Miami largely in check so far tonight They were doing so good simols of going inside and it seems like theyre settling for perimeter shots too often here in the second half Tough shot by Washington Steve fights for it Florida State has it Jones off the shot fake along the baseline Doesnt get the roll Gets his own miss for the moment Out of bounds Itll go the other way Jay Jones though I mean this guy hes like a wrecking ball Honestly want to believe it is because Florida State has not shot as many threes tonight Theyre averaging almost 35 threes uh on the season and tonight they have only shot 16 no make that 14 threes They have been banging it inside for the most part and thats why they have this lead Miami has got no scoring out of Trey Donaldson in the second half He had 11 in the first half Is that a problem for the Canes Do they need to get number three in white going here Scott Yeah and hes gone inside to try to get buckets but it has been the Simols defense that has challenged him in that paint he has not been able to produce Well nice feed right there from Donaldson to Renew Thats one guy that has been able to produce here in the second half Nine points here in the second half for Renew And now its look at its the games that fall back into a zone defense And the picket fence has been broken 134 Renew to lead all Miami scores Big threepoint bucket for Florida State Martin Somerville continues to play a big game for the new Well I like Somerville He has been a great bump off the bench Nine points The bench has really been what has been so impressive here for the nullles here in this basketball game Again high post Renew against that zone Draws a crowd Dumps it off and a foul will send Shelton Henderson back to the line Yeah theyre theyre just trying to pound it inside and get to that foul line Shelton Henderson we talked about his struggles uh from that free throw line 51 of 91 on the season coming in for 56 And he needs to step to that line tow that line with more confidence cuz hes got a nice stroke And deliver two makes right here Third foul on Steen sends Shelton Henderson to the line And Miami assistant Charlton Young said My alarm goes off for Henderson just like when I had Scotty Barnes Patrick Williams and Devin Bell at Florida State Yes C Wise is another one of the guys who has seen both sides of this rivalry and asked him this afternoon you got any more of your seminals gear Hes like No way I am a Miami South Florida guy through and through He did the right thing for Coach Hamilton certainly as a recruiter and as an assistant coach but uh the moment he walked out of Tallahassee I think he burned every single garnet and gold piece of equipment he might have had Well theres a shooters touch for you And I think youre right about CY He is all about the youth Miles and Somerville both playing big minutes in the back court tonight for Florida State The song lost his footing Florida State trying to get the timeout Doesnt get it Steen leaves his feet and Florida State is really fortunate to still have possession But yeah they reset that shot clock That shot clock should have expired I dont know why the ball went inside They put a new 30 seconds on that shot clock Officials are checking it out right now No doubt Good call AJ Desai Tim Clocky Matt Potter will get this squared away But its going to be under 10 seconds left when they figure it out Right Look at you see the shot clock down there in the corner Its down to about 10 right there And for whatever reason on this kick out right here they reset it to 30 So it was at nine uh and then they used another 10 seconds to get it from 30 to 20 So the shot clock should have it expired So Florida State catches a break I dont know I want a new accounting of that post game which like I say they cant they cant say that you you didnt you cant have an opportunity to score I just think they must put 4 seconds on there and give him a chance to inbound this call Florida State tries to get it in Malovitzs got a hand on it State will keep it now with two and a half seconds to work with So from the sideline itll be Chanty Wiggins to inbound Well what you dont want to do is foul an outside shot if youre the Canes here cuz theyre going to have to hustle to one up Somerville gets it off Long rebound renew So Miami gets another stop Here comes the Canes down by three Doorat number 14 in white in the ball game with under six minutes to go for the Can drive and dish threepointer on the way No Well they got the threepoint shooter the ball but was just not able to make that jumper Primo meaning Teemo Malovich Yeah Primo is what his teammates call The takeaway by Donaldson yet to score in the second half and still with a goose egg thanks to Robert McCrae the fifth Robert McCrae has blocked some shots down in that area tonight Thats his third block shot on the evening And that one here he just said You had some evil intentions behind swatting that one away You shall not pass Meaning for the cameras too By the way Florida State has 12 steals so far tonight Thats the most by any ACC team this year in conference play Donaldson its a Florida State stop And then Renew called for the reachin Yeah Renu with his now first personal foul but thats going to be the fourth team foul on the Tates his first year head coach Jay Lucas Had assistant stops at Texas Kentucky and Duke the last three years Of course the son of former NBA head coach John Lucas II Wiggins another 90s style 15T shot I love it Yeah and a great entry pass that time as well as Miles founds his partner right there at the free throw line A little turn around Survey the defense Nobody on me Let me knock it down Pushes that advantage back up to five Tell you what Scott Florida State is really showing us something that they have done other things than just shoot the three They have taken only 16 threepoint shots tonight and it has been working That man cant shoot enough from distance Shelton Henderson now four for four from beyond the threepoint line Well Shelton Henderson with his triples the main man knocking in triples for the Canes is really trying to pull the Canes back to an even ball game here But look at McCrae fighting cheering inside twisting and turning for a bucket Blocking shots battling in the interior McCrae has come to play See that triple outside by Henderson and then the footwork down there taking it to the smaller Donaldson And had some body language for that young man after that shot And again Florida State comes in averaging 35 threepoint attempts per game the most in the ACC cheering Theyve taken only 16 today I like the pivot that we have seen from coach Law Well well youre taking them and youre not making them And I know they make nearly 11 a game but the percentage is too low Youre almost 300 out of 361 of the teams and threepoint field goal percentage So maybe you put that in your back pocket for a little while use those for specialty moments cheering but the energy and the effort and the fight and the determination to go inside for baskets is whats got this some of those uh ball club lead Oh McCrae missed the front end and then the foul is given by Cam Miles I wonder is is that like the old hacker shack where you go after and foul the guy foul the guy that cant shoot 50 from the free throw line this early in the game I dont know I wouldnt think you would start that but youre right to foul U 90 ft from the basket It seemed intentional like why would you wildly go after that ball when Uday he clearly had coralled it and those big mits and you werent going to take it out of those strong arms So maybe they thought hey theyre still in the one and one If he misses this its similar to a turnover Um put him on the line Hes only shooting 48 And he is at the line for the first time tonight The big man from Orlando calmly hits the first You know as a poor free throw shooter in college myself and not everyone ever hacked me and put me on the line but I was happy to see that big guy step to the throw to line and make that free throw Couple of nice swishes with good rotation off the fingertips of Ernest Uday Jr Its a twopoint ball game That will give that young man some confidence Lets see if they try that tactic again here cheering on U Jr McCrae wrap around Steam has it Double team Ripped away by U They put some pressure on Steam with U and Allen and he could not find a teammate Chance to tie or take the lead on this trip Under four to play They go to their leading scoreer for the season Renew to get by Jones Spins into the double team by Steam pass the other side to the hot hand Instead its Allen for three No Florida State gets the stop Surprised Henderson didnt take that shot Youre four or four on the night Good close out Maybe made him think otherwise McCrae Uday is going to be called for the foul Uday played such good defense overall this music season Florida State has dropped five in a row and yet its the NLES whove taken the fight to the Canes Yeah And I love this energy in which they are competing in I was talking with our producer before this game at the shootound and I said the energy I saw in shootound was not the energy you normally see for a team thats 0 and5 in the conference They music had spirit they had pep and they have brought that same energy here this cheering evening 6158 Florida State One possession game here and it has been the Henderson in Renew show here in this second half I wouldnt be surprised if coach Lucas doesnt try to get the ball into either Henderson or or Renew on this possession Well the Florida State defense has held Miami to 28 shooting in the second half and has held Trey Donaldson scoreless since the break Shot clock down to four Allen puts it up No another stop for Florida State The possession closed out by Jones on the rebound Great defense Never let that ball get below the free throw line where the Canes could do some damage A hoist on the outside by Allen and they rebound their defensive glass McCra and Somerville in the back court McCrae willing his way toward the basket and the foul against Donaldson This has been a dynamite matchup tonight between the point guards who came in tied for second behind Boopy Miller for average assists per game in the ACC McCrae has been better than Donaldson here in the second half Well he realizes hes got a strength advantage on on Donaldson in this second half and all those Wolf tickets Donaldson was selling the first half flexing with those 11 first half points It has been McCrae the one here flexing his muscles and taking the fight right to Donaldson going right to his chest time and time again And now hes got his team up by two possessions grad transfer who earned his bachelors in social science last year at Jacksonville University where he was first team all Atlantic son Robert Milton McCrae V by the way hes got a brother named Milton Robert McCrae Hey you see that Sunshine State Helpers Thats exactly right 121 assists for Prey and 120 there for for Donaldson coming into this one I think they both have four tonight on the evening Now the matchup is Donaldson being defended by Somerville who gets screened on the switch Bong tries to stay with him Donaldson still scoreless in the second half Yeah And their last two field goal attempts been pretty much from the same spot with the same result mashing into the corner of the rim in the back court Here comes Miami Allen threeon two Henderson Jones wasnt set and hes called for the blocking foul Great job by Allen getting it to his big man that can run the floor like a deer down that last uh play But like you see there McCrae not able to come up with that lefty hook But look how quickly Allen gets the ball into Henderson who like I say that that 240 lb frame and that head of steam will not be stopped Foul number three on Le Jones the senior from Neptune Beach Florida Henderson was a tremendous get for Jay Lucas He had committed to Duke and then when Jay Lucas left John Shier staff to take over at Miami Shelton flipped his commitment and followed But Jay Lucas is hot on the recruiting trail again Hes got a fivestar and Caleb Gastons the number 13 recruit in next years SC Next 100 68 forward who will be here in Coral Gables next year Naturally Florida State Luke Lops has done great in recruiting Hes got a top 20 class coming in now Renew and Henderson have been the offense in the second half for the Canes Seven of 12 combined The rest of the team 0 for 15 Wiggins whos had a hot hand in the second half gets the inbound to Bong and they get it into the hands of their point guard McCrae Kanes got to watch Somervilles threepoint shooting ability Hes already knocked down two this evening Florida States led by as many as five Miami led by as many as six in the first half On the switch McCrae tries to penetrate Good wall up defense by Miami to force the shot clock violation Great job by U sliding his feet against the smaller McCrae would not let him get by him and then really force a last second dish off underneath and not enough time for Somerville to beat the shot clock Well get you to Oxford Mississippi for Miss and Auburn just as soon as we wrap up here in Coral Gables Final minute 10 in this ACC matchup They have not been able to get the ball to Renew where he wants to score Heres Renew Thats where he wants to be to score Right on Q The big lefthander puts it in Trey Donaldson says Im not scoring but I know who to get the ball to when I cant Spice Renew underneath Coach LZ needs a timeout He takes that time out To inbound and he does get it to McCrae in the back court They got a bigger body on McCrae They took Donaldson off McCrae to give him a little more size And now on the switch its U trying to close out McCrae shot over the top Miami gets the stop Well Coach Lucas challenged Henderson to get a board and that was number eight Trey Donaldson still looking for his first points of the second half Give it to Renew Miami doesnt use a timeout They go to Renew and weve got a foul Well when they needed buckets they needed points they got the ball into the hands of their offensive specialist and Leak Renew as his teammates call him came through But look at that rebound Thats a man Thats a freshman That is a mansized rebound and then they get the ball to Renew against the smaller Le Jones Gets just enough contact The 81enter is going to total strike to try to give the Canes the lead their first lead in a long time Fourth foul on Le Jones Miamiys last lead came at the 1649 mark of the second half Well I play for Jays dad in Philadelphia One of the things coach Lucas used to always say was pressure either burst pipes or creates diamonds Well lets see what happens here on this pressure free throw by Lenu He needs this one to tie the game He does just that 63 apiece Seven and Hurricanes with a timeout on the floor The line for a front end of a one and one But theyre putting a lot of pressure in the back court here Ball knocked out of bounds Itll stay with Florida State 202 seconds to play Got to get the ball in the hands of McCra here Hes your best ball handler cheering Got to get it in They do Somervilles had a good game McCrae comes and gets the ball and will look to operate with 10 seconds left in the second half guarded by Donaldson in this point guard matchup 4 seconds 3 seconds McCrae down the lane puts it up The whistle comes with 17 on the clock How about McCrae not settling for an outside jumper He was denied on Saturday He said This time Im going to make sure I get the contact and get to the free throw line Now this is a two shot opportunity because he was fouled in the act of shooting So hell get two free throw attempts to try to give the nose the lead Thats the fourth foul on U cheering 6463 19 points now for McCrae 68 shooter So you got to think if youre Miami this ball comes off you want to immediately call timeout cheering Florida State gets his best defensive unit on the floor cheering Florida State by two and the time is called by Coach Lucas Catch something and fire up a triple Hes Hes been hot tonight A two to tie a three to win it The pass is intercepted and the Seinals take down the Hurricanes for their first conference win of the season Give these Seinals a lot of credit
