from the fact that they have to play a music lot of guys So yes theres a deep rotation to keep the intensity and the pace up Youll see a lot of threes That makes me and a lot of other people who like puppies and scoring happy Henry Bucky McMillan the new era of Texas AM basketball It is here Hired back in April Theyre off to a 72 start They play the exciting brand that youre talking about I like Bucky better than Hank Lets go Nicknames better So theres one of the firstear Aggies There are many of them Marcus Hill slashes to the rim So this is the starting five that counters whatm throws out there You mentioned Miller averaging 21 points per game This five theyre all going to play a lot of minutes Andy Enfields team a little younger off the bench So this unit has been relied upon much of the season Giron Pierre responds with the baseline jumper So here is the starting five once again for Texas AM Now their leading scorer is number nine right in the middle Thats Ruben Dominguez whos a flamethrower from deep He averages about 16 per game So he embodies that premium that is placed on the threepointer This one off the offensive rebound is offline Rashawn Ag with the offensive board Another one and it leads to a foul So there is the very bright clever 42yearold took over for Buzz Williams when he left for Maryland back in April His team has gotten off to a seven and two start You know it was only 5 years ago he was a high school coach in Birmingham Gets the job at Samford right down the road Takes that program to unprecedented heights So a natural fit here to jump up and take them job Its funny you think of a young guy bright clever kind of groundbreaking in so many ways and what he does I think the reality is theres a lot of wisdom in it because hes sat in the chair as a head coach for a long time Theres a lot of conviction behind what hes doing and what he wants to do And I think for you to have that type of clarity and conviction theres got to be wisdom at you know at the forefront cheering Great roll to the basket That is AG the experienced seventh year senior So he has his team off to a 62 start He mentioned it before we dont waver They have their style of play that you outlined before and they stick to it regardless Well stay here with SMU Andy Enfield last year took over at SMU led this program to 24 wins They were right on the outskirts there the NCAA tournament field Wound up going to the NIT He certainly likes this rotation this roster Thats the goal this year for SMU to get back to the NCAA tournament And hes going to have to get guys healthy Theyre going to have to find some depth But you have a really good core group All five guys are going to play 30 plus minutes Once they figure out the right rotations get players healthy get to an 8 n guy rotation I think youll see them at full potential Both of these teams getting healthier in recent weeks Wow A the beneficiary once again and its Texas AM off to the hot 82 start and it forces a Mustangs timeout They really want to get downhill Its just all about attack You you get in the attack mode you draw two dump down make the game easy and once youre able to do that you can set up your fullcourt pressure This is an intense team in Texas AM Bucky ball will keep SoM has hit four of its first six shots Theyve had some high percentage looks 82 lead here inside College Park Center Were what three hours from College Station You got a lot of lot ofm in the building A lot of colleges in in Texas Yeah Right Like every other state has a UT something College Park Center Yeah its home that UT Arlington typically plays here Now SMU maybe the campus 40 45 minutes away Little closer drive You got the old Southwest Conference rival They have played a whole lot of games years prior Cementu has that one knocked away Theyre going to say shot clock violation before the takeaway Som has got the foot on the gas to start this one I think anybody understands how disruptive that defensive possession for Texas AM was Out of a timeout they pick up full Theyre in a pressuring man defense They drop back into a zone It just sucks the life out of the game Sucks the rhythm out of the game for an offense where the offense is going to finally break that pressure get up recognize what defense is being played By the time they actually make any sort of pass that that is initiating an offense theres 15 seconds left on the shot clock Last week was a really encouraging week form Two big wins against Florida State That was down in Tampa and then at Pittsburgh Yes they scored 81 against the Panthers 95 against Florida State So they are been in a groove There is automatic Ruben Dominguez with his first bucket It is its its almost robotic where if his feet are set if his shot preparation is done right he hes a good chance hes going to make that shot Jordan shooting almost 50 from three Just outrageous numbers especially considering the volume of threes that he takes He gets finds the cutter That was Washington Lost it AG on the floor Dominguez has it Flicks ahead to Lane Texas AM The transition opportunity stifled Ag got the big man in the air Now Lane down and out Stays here 220 That play by AG is almost something that you you just kind of it happened and you forget about it Dont forget about that little bit of a high close out He pumpakes puts the ball on the deck but he did not just put the ball on the deck to go to the basket He did it to draw two He draws one in He gets an open look for a teammate They play with great balance and they really trust one another Dominguez cant hit it SMU looking to run This is BJ Edwards program veteran finds the sevenfooter Yiglu with his first bucket You see how quicklym likes to run Yiglu smothers him at the rim that time That was a three in the air is down Thats Geron Pierre one of the first year Mustangs And a stop here would be really big for SMU They took the timeout to kind of slow things down Now now you get a three to go Stop would be big And Bako thats number 21 in the black Hes 69 He could stretch it Misfires that time To your point SMU with it Try to close the gap even further Pierre puts up another down and outm clears it This is Dominguez off the screen Little flare behind the back pass and AG cant knock it down Man like you say that was way off I I dont care The willingness to shoot it makes the defense shift Its going to open up driving lanes and its a team that wants to attack off the bounce just to create the advantage Miller misfires Washington Count it And the foul So he follows that one on the baseline The early rhythm and flow of the game but it was just what SMU needed and Andy Enfield took the timeout out of the timeout and they started to reestablish the game right Get comfortable with a little bit of the pace get comfortable with the pressure defense figure out how to initiate your offense play a little better confidence in the half court settled in tied it up and Washington does complete the threepoint play So its an eight nothing run These are two efficient offenses They have played in high possession highscoring games all year Theyre both averaging around 90 points per game So they have operated at prolific level early on This is Zach Clemens off the bench 611 fifth year senior throws it away Pierre bounc it to Miller The spin and so Kevin Boopy Miller going to the free throw line I really like what SMU did out of the timeout Putting a little zone defense on Everybody gets to identify the basketball Texas AM had to actually slow down figure out music how they were going to attack it It just took rhythm out of it Right If if SMU can be effective at slowing the their early surge down and force them into more of a half court game on the offensive side then play freely offensively I think SMU can play freely withm on the offensive end But they dont want this thing to become an up and down track for 40 minutes given the lack of depth They got into a game like that a couple of days or last week against Vanderbilt in their challenge game Ultimately ran out of steam late in that one Lost 8869 Now its still the only blemish on the resume right now for the Mustangs See the productivity by the way this season for Boopy Miller Yeah those are pretty good Those are good stats Just in case you were wondering thatll work That should get it done Fifth year senior He was really effective last year Early on he has been even better Got Pop Isaacs on the floor for Texas AM Also Ryland Griffin has checked in So Bucky McMillan who legitimately plays what 11 12 guys on the bench here There is the veteran Ryland Griffin I think so much of it comes with their willingness and their desire to shoot threes even if theyre quick quick shot opportunities They look to take those threes and because of that they get hard closeouts and and the longer those closeouts become the harder those closeouts become the easier its going to be to create an advantage off the bounce drive kick get the defense chasing Thats ultimately howM wants to get their three to the free throw line as well Theres Washington flexes that one with the right arm Cory Washington the senior from Little Rock And its really astounding just considering how fresh its its a complete roster overhaul for Texas AM 13 firstear transfers just about everybody thats on the floor for that you will see today First year playing together first year wearing the Aggie uniform Theres Jamie Vincent I think what helps is is that all these guys are going to get minutes on the floor Uh we the pace with which they play demands that you play with intensity for however many minutes you get Oh wing up that time Were looking for Germaine ONeal Jr I actually shut up just in case it was really a good highlight Theres nothing worse than talking through a really good highlight as if I wasnt even watching it I trusted you But I do think that a lot of it comes down to the trust thatm plays with in terms of the how they trust one another is their trust in knowing that I might play 20 minutes but the whole idea is to maximize those 20 minutes the way we want to play which is the bucky ball We talked about the buy in You need buyin for that Its been impressive Theres a giveaway Yeah Miller was the one to deflect it And so Boopy Miller feeds it into Igolu This is the 7 foot Turk draws the foul I think pressure defense can be disruptive in its own way right The pressure itself the intensity you play with a trapping defense full court could be disruptive but so can a a zone zone is so disruptive in so many ways because it kind of shifts the whole feel and the intensity and pace of the game slows everything down trying to back down the sophomore that time here its Washington again who comes flying in so Washington is off for a off to a a fine start hes got seven already flew in from the opposite corner a short quarter area to get that tip in This extended run continues SMU fell behind 102 Its a 144 run and theyve got basketball I mean in the end youre an NCA tournament team How tested are you Whatever I mean youre ready But its good for the game to have such good matchups early in the season There really has been a surplus It seems like theres been a lot more than usual to this point Were one month into the season but we have seen not a segment Its not a segment Its not just Champions Classic and then lets wait till feast week where we have good games Its really been every week weve had great games Look I I dont think this is much of a step down These are two highquality teams high quality conferences Griffin misfires from distance Well both have gotten off to fine starts with some key wins early on Thats the key One of one of these teams wants to add another to the resume Paul will stay with or go back to SMU And both these teams are are figuring a lot out about themselves I mean hereM comes in with three new subs Theyre going to be deep SMUs got to find ways to manipulate the game at times Take control of it with with a zone at times Slow it down maybe get the ball inside to Higuto whos whos got the decided advantage down low and could also shrink the defense to the point where you can play a little more traditional inside out Yeah which I dont like that I said that but typically I like the the outside in game with bigs If they just lift defense open up the paint triple drives are there thats how youre going to seem play Corner three is up and its offline That was BJ Davis Ray one of the freshman coming off the bench for SMU Also Bucky McMillan hes played 10 already at this point He has legitimately played 11 or 12 every game Nice cut that time Marcus Hill But again its all about turning the corner and drawing a secondary defender You draw that secondary defender if the player off the ball relocates to the open spot where he can receive a pass it is advantage offense cuz the defense is chasing And I think youve got to be willing to take the first best shot you get to get the defense chasing for a full 30 seconds Everybody says Oh make it work for a full 30 Well youre not The first 10 seconds are fake offense If youre not willing to shoot the first shot the first 10 15 seconds are fake offense By the way there is another example of that backcourt heat You will see that often Dead balls made baskets Youre going to see him pick up and just put a tempo pace and an intensity on the game Davis Ray was open for a moment in the corner Back to Miller He feeds him and missed it Jakari Lane coming back the other way for Texas AM Aggies they have been one of the better threepoint shooting and free throw shooting teams in America to this point Yet today theyre 0 for nine from distance The game really hasnt found its rhythm yet And I think thats one of the things that really helpsm is when their defense can kind of put pace and and tempo in the game and then their offense can find the rhythm thats created by the defense Now youre playing with consistency Well this is going to go back tom Just a fumbled bounce pass that time And so the Aggies to take over Theyre also very willing to keep shooting the threes which I love I dont care Sometimes you got to look at it Clapable miss is kind of my term where you you work really well you get a good shot you miss it so what Its a clapable miss You got to be able to play through that play through misses and continue to shoot it Just dont throw it away Dominguez bounces it back to AG So its late shot clock again here for Texas AM Hill turns the corner AG gets blocked Three on the timer Has to hoist it Here comes SMU This is Pierre A little Euro step Thats a pretty move cheering I think the Euro steps have been one of the best additions to the college game Like its almost in a way slowed the game down in transition where you see players actually finishing and not just these you know highrisisk maneuvers where you throw the ball up and hope you get fouled So Pierre meanwhile cheering is seven and theres a foul onm Hes just good defense The the defense is all around the ball but you canu is such a presence if he doesnt get out of position early Last year at times he was a step behind the play and he picked up silly fouls If youre in position and maintain position hes got such size that he doesnt have to block everything Just alter shots Yeah you like his upside Coaching staff does as well Its just a sol Theres another foul there before the shot You know they talked a lot about how he didnt get to campus until August last year And if you think it only takes a month or two for these guys to figure it out there theres a big adjustment where you got to level up to the pace You got to level up to the length and the athleticism and the skill set of not only the players on your team but those youre going to be playing against Theres a bit of an adjustment I think it took him some time last year He is much better with the full summer this year Corrals that miss and just the throw down That was point blank that time has got four Also helps when youre 8 in taller than everybody else Their size advantage upper hand that time You got the four points and three boards Forces Lane to pick up the dribble Might have a mismatch This is AG instead Kick it back out to Hill He wants it Splashes the three Yeah thats tough If you get that matchup advantage you got to throw it inside because its going to command the double And what youre trying to do is look opposite for open threes So As got a couple of assists as well All right Advantaging AU again And theyre trading baskets now SMU by three after falling behind 10 to two in the early moments If SMU can just break through the initial defense and get some help up that throw over the tops going to be there all day Hill pulls it Oh Hill got fouled Thats Cory Washington and Marcus Hill is at music the line to shoot three SMUs done a really good job of taking control of the way this games going to be played and playing to their music advantage The obviously advantage for SMU you can loop Arlington old Southwest Conference rivals They played a couple of years ago Texas AM got the Mustangs So SMU by three Its been Washington and Pierre They have been productive cheering Two first year guards are a combined six out of nine from the floor I think you got to feel good that you havent gotten a ton out of Boopy Miller Almost as if he hasnt had to do everything Now the hope is that hes not losing sight of this game and hes hes able to feel out the game without having to do as much So when the time comes he can take over when he needs to take over because he has that ability And its not just with his scoring Hes a tough shot maker Hes a shot creator but has that creativity to make everybody else better around him Hill by the way gets two out of three at the line So its back to a onepoint game Miller fifth year player from Chicago This is his second year with SMU Enfield and the staff they theyve held him to a higher standard this year He really l his decision making as has taken a step forward this season 20 points and seven assists a game That that kind of tells you hes making pretty good decisions And like Dale the game is simplified You know you start to use your eyeballs differently You slow down You look guys off You use ball fakes head fakes chin fakes eyeball fakes whatever you need to do You just keep the defense on their toes and you start to dictate the game Hes been able to do that without having to play at the fastest pace Hes changing speeds better than he has his entire career Miller everybody around this program understands too Infield you know he has coached a lot of guards many that have gone on to play pro and have continued to play pro Digu had that one smacked out of bounds Just got to catch that Dont bring it below your chest I know it sounds like we say it all the time dont bring it down but the bigs that can catch turn and go right up They finish five more shots a game So thats a totally madeup number but I think its fair point Hes got the clear size and and height advantage inside So you got three black jerseys descended cheering on him and he still fights through I think the other thing is it it slows the game down when the ball goes inside cuz the entire defense shifts eyeballs on the ball inside Its in a vulnerable position particularly with the advantage So in a way it its not allowing Texas AM to play the game they want to play This is Griffin turning the corner Ryland Griffin draws the foul I This might not look pretty but this is the type of game that will favor music SMU Every defender staring at the post and theres really not much you can do other than foul See Yiglu legit 7 foot2 secondyear Mustang from Istanbul So he sits down Anytime theres whoms anytime theres swiggles on top of the letters you got to make sure you get pronunciation right Its key Good job Thats key Theres a foul on the drive in Im sure theres a more professional term than swiggles Someone look that up for us Can we clarify with Its like an enemy Well thats the Well n is a little Thats the Thats the tilda Im sure it is So Im Im just I want to learn the John Crispen vernacular here on this Its not always accurate Unofficial My vernacular is the kind where its like you know what Im trying to say I just didnt say it properly Go Interesting when you get told on the bench can you create space and can Boopy Miller be the creator Well just do that Well do that away So Germaine ONeal again the name should be familiar Germaine ONeal Jr Stad the longtime beloved Pacer This is Griffin wants three That one is that developed nicely SMU has been the beneficiary They have moved without the basketball Well Holloway got blocked kicked it back out Pop Isaacs a ball fade Wants three Thats strong and Miller secures it SMU now in a hurry with its largest advantage Theyre up six in this first half Miller left the pull up short Isaacs where they forgot about him He missed it Had an open three Griffin gets his team a new 20 So Texas AM today one out of 13 from distance Just a weirdly bad start to this one That is an athletic block from the freshman tunes SMU good job on the offensive end No you told So the defense just naturally limps Well youre not so worried about the pass over the top although you should have been Nobody identifies ONeal Jr cheering The second ball they threw his way SMU has been opportunistic Theyre sharing the basketball Seven of their 12 mates assisted Well I think theyre playing the game they want to play M has not really been able to enforce Bucky ball and put it on SMU They they really SMUs done a good job of managing different defenses and taking control of the game Boy DBA misses a layin So the struggles shooting woes continue form SMU trying to really bust it open Theres Pierre A step back triple early in the shot clock Comes up empty I like shots but if Boopy Miller doesnt touch the ball thats not the one you want Less than five to play first half in Arlington Dominguez has the lone triple that time A difficult shot contested Miller drew the foul Dominguez is the kind of guy he he got to get him shots He he is so good shooting the basketball that if he doesnt get shots hes going to end up forcing them And when you force shots as a shooter you end up hurting yourself cuz then you start to rethink whether you should seek it out the same way You got to make sure you get a good one Youve got to get him involved Drive and kick basketball is going to create a shot opportunity for Dominguez but you got to get him involved so he doesnt have to force on his own Oh Miller chucks it up and sticks the deep three Holloway was just getting ready to defend a ball screen and he just sagged off and Poopy Miller made the right decision All the time in the world to line that one up He is very good from distance as well Close to 45 from beyond the arc He is whistled for the foul though on the hollowway drive SMU is still playing with great confidence here You want to sag off get ready to defend that ball screen Well hes going to step right into a shot Like logo threes anymore just like its a three Its lost its like it really has I mean everybody shoots it from deep but in reality if its what you practice the strength of these guys its been normalized at a young age for the guys in the college game today where theyve been shooting threes for a long time Now the other part of that is do you have the mindset of a shooter I think guys can perfect an imperfection in terms of mechanics but very few have the real killer mindset of a knockdown shooter Some guys are rhythm shooters right They want to shoot off the bounce Why They create a little rhythm into the shot little wiggle into the shot Its a higher percentage three Other catch and shoot guys like they need that rhythm into the shot Miller looks like he is settling in patiently Yep To that point Hes got seven around the screen for three Down and out And thats Rashan AG with another rebound So SMU shooting better than 50 from the floor Theyre up eight Less than four minutes to play in this first important out of conference instate battle for both squads Has had a moving screen SMU has it when we return Theyre in a groove right now Up eight music Weve had a great weekend Theres been some big matchups all weekend Speaks to what we were saying before This has been a great first month to this college basketball season Yeah And good to see Darren Peterson back with Kansas So I think a lot of we all want to see their potential Uh I think and and Peterson together could really be something else That could be I mean it is a it is a lob combo and the more they do that the more the floor is going to open up So so getting Peterson back and healthy and allowing him to find it youll start to see the potential of that team Meanwhile today inside the College Card Center SMU fell behind early but they have been a much more efficient offensive team and just playing quite frankly better overall Theyre not giving up anything in transition Theyre getting their base defense set Thats the type of shot theyre forcing So theyre not chasing theyre not doing the overhel thing which is like an epidemic in college basketball where everybody chases the ball Theyre staying home and just making it tough Make tough shots And then you come down you you find an opportunity play freely on the offensive ends Ed SMUs been good You know we highlighted that starting five All they all average better than 10 a game and all have had their moments as we expected in this first half Dominguez can barely get I mean they had a hand in his face Said no space to let it rip Thats their prolific threepoint shooter So SMU by double digits trying to build on that lead This is Pierre from 16u got his hand on it on the baseline SMU comes away with it Edwards cheering gets his team a new 20 and Pierres wide open He passes it up instead Davis Ray No And is that a foul onm Thats going to stay here So another opportunity for SMU Its kind of like the growing pains right This is a group thats going to play 30 plus minutes per game each guy their ability to find the game within the game which is not like game to game it could be different right the more time you have on the floor the more time you play with the others its easier for you to find the gamem needs the game play in a certain style for all 10 or even 12 to be impactful and I think the impact of bucky ball they havent been able to put that on the game so far and its favoring the team thats going to a a shorter lineup yeah Lets go over there for now right That when when you think of depth when you think of pace and intensity it is not just about 20 minutes Its about the full 40 Now the problem is the intensity and the pace of this game hasnt been too high It It hasnt been an exhausting first half for SMU Theyve been able to switch up defenses Theyve only given up 23 points which means their defense has been able to get set Its a much different game after the Edwards free throws The lead is 12 Griffin nearly gave it away Back out to Lane for three We got a whistle and that is onm So that is the ninth team foul Its just really simple sometimes Whos chasing the game Whos chasing the play SMU has not been chasing the play Theyve gotten their defense set Theyve identified the threats Theyre not chasing after the basketball Theyre making you play bad driving angles And with bad driving angles you dont have to help up So really good defense is really setting the tone for SMU Could not have asked for a better start this first half Yeah Jaden Tombs was the man who draw the drew the foul there So the freshman goes to the free throw line Misses the front end Hill in transition Cut off Back to Embakco Oh thats a nice behind the back And the junior does draw the foul McKenzie Junior from New Jersey Hes really tough when when he can attract defense up Hes not explosive on the first step but hes just really shifty Has a nice wiggle Good ball handling skills He hes got to be able to finish that though and keep the defense honest He can shoot it from three More he does more it opens up those driving lanes Yeah he is really dynamic Yiglu comes back on the floor So while we have a moment lets remind you Iowa State in our 24th annual womens Jimmy V Classic Thatll be inside Hilton Coliseum How about Iowa State mens Yeah Iowa State mens putting it on Purdue at at Mackie One of the tougher places to play That was beat down I mean it doesnt take anything away from Iowa State but they played about as well as you could ask them to play Just tough shot making at all Just back to what we were saying Yeah the bevy of just highlevel battles in the out of conference point Illus impact has been profound in this first half and now he has 10 Theres a whistle with 112 to play I I think the other the other issue there is he makes that shot guards are already back because the nature of by throwing the ball inside outside in guards are already back So theres really nothing in transition He makes that basket Hes just kind of trailing the play as the defender there Theres no transition opportunity Theres really no secondary surge And SMU defense thats set has been able to dictate the entire first half why theres only 25 points on the board for Bucky Ball My gosh look at that bottom left Yeah Texas AM you know theyve thrown it away probably one too many times here in this first as well They havent scored a field goal in seven plus minutes Digu back out He was a little off balance Edwards who was at last touch by Vlad Tadal says Texas AM basketball with less than a minute to play Now is lets take a look Remember youve only if youre if youre a head coaches here at college basketball get the one challenge If you do win it you retain it but you only get youre one and done If you lose you lose were not reviewing everything Goodness gracious Here we go Edwards just taking it away Throws it up and in SMU is just smothering Texas AM right now And so the lead has grown to 14 So much of it this first half It is set defense music Getting the defense set seeing the basketball identifying threats SMU is playing with great confidence Theyre controlling the state music defense It has fueled their transition offense BJ Edwards John the latest basket But youve youve highlighted music it several times that set defense for these this veteran group of Mustangs that are out on the floor that has uh led to the success so far at this point And taking everything out of transition and in doing so theyre dictating the game Andm has has really not been able to play at the pace they want The intensity in no way has has stifled SMU Theyve been comfortable with the basketball They havent been able to establish their fullourt pressure nearly as much as theyd like Now a lot of that comes from not making shots You make shots you can pick up full and you can switch defenses up be really disruptive Butm has not been able to do that Even though theyre really going deep into the bench Pierre was the one who buffed Griffin so hes at the line Edwards comes back out of the floor But you mentioned that early on this teams and when were they going to settle into a rhythm SMU certainly has to your point AM theyve been playing from behind now for the majority of this first and Griffin hits the front end Well a team that really wants to shoot the threes if you take that away youre forcing them to do other things well first So you have to be able to get inside the paint Youve got to be able to finish 5 10 15 ft jump shots if youre not going to have an over rotating defense So there is an adjustment form that they just have to figure it out at halftime Well the one thing that McMillan praised this group if if we want to use some recent history against Pittsburgh Yep They had some leads they lost those leads ultimately came back one by eight He really complimented the poise how measured his group played Well you find the game it becomes a game of rugs right And thats kind of what happened with Pit Pit went on a couple runs but if you watch that game AM didnt sweat it Its the type of game they wanted to play So if they can turn the game into that style theyll be better off So 7 seconds Pierre up to Yigatu Lost it Edwards get that out of here Theres two seconds Pierre draws the foul So SMU but they are crashing that offensive glass this entirety of the first And Pierre is going to go to the free throw line to try to extend this lead back to 14 with 210 on the timer I would say whats ultimately lacking to me it just jumps out sitting courtside here is just the energy There there is a lack of energy fromm right now that that halftime might be the best thing And lets restart this thing This is this is not over by any means Theyre down 13 points and they really havent showed up yet Yep Meanwhile Pierre into double figures as well as Yigolu You know he has been an explosive scorer in his career and that has certainly carried over here Hes averaging 18 a game So SMU remember feels like forever ago they were down 102 out of the gates and they actually take a 14point lead after 20 minutes Old Southwest Conference rivals in Arlington We love it Instate battle betweenm and SMU Mustangs Threepoint shots have not been there forms got to take control and music dictate this game first Find ways to cut into the lead Get comfortable Take over the tempo the intensity the pace of this game and make it bucky ball If youre Bucky McMillan no music field goals last eight seven Thats annoying I think he would call that annoying To me thats annoying I want to see up and down like we sold Bucky Ball I want to see it I I understand their potential particularly with the depth if theyve got to get the game established here in the first 5 minutes Again a couple of wins last week against Pittsburgh scored 81 They dropped 95 on Florida State That game was never close But today they are trying to settle into a rhythm You put it this way at the end of the half All that said theyre still down 14 So if there there have been bigger holes to dig yourself out ofm of course starts it starts with it on this side of the floor Its hard to go on a 6o run in your turn my turn basketball A lot easier to do that if you can get the game played the way you want the game played Get a made shot Pick up your defense full court So getting good looks or dead balls like a like a foul You score up there a free throw You get your defense set You got to get the ball in bounds too They just really Theyre really just not there yet The energy level as a whole just hasnt been there Sometimes thats what happens if SMU is successful in taking them out of everything they want to do Well theyre going to try it again So Lane twice attempts to lob it over the sevenfooter And I think I think our man there on the the end line the nachos he saved them Basketball coming at him Hes sucking them down fast now Hes like Oh god I better get these Paid 12 for these I might as well get him down Oh sevenfooter is clear His nachos are safem looking for an encouraging start to this second half Boco back out to Hill This is Marcus Hill Banks it in Now this is where you got to get your defense set You got to start playing this as a more of a fullcourt game and just dictate the game at your own pace your own way We sold Bucky Ball We just havent really seen it yet And you got to credit SMU for that So the most productive scorer form has been Hill Hes the lone man in double figures He has 11 Miller No theres another offensive board Yiglu Zy trying to lean on him Dominguez smacked it free Sorry Defined lean Defini lean That was like a double forearm shiver just pushing as much as you can And this is tough stuff This is how its going to be But the key is the main basket the main baskets gets your defense set Now good defensive possession play with better pace Again intensity and energy have to follow You can told what do you have You got the Dodge Ram out there Yeah its a GMC Excuse me Okay GMC three in the air Thats Edwards We got a whistle before Yigu actually had tapped that back in but there is a foul beforehand That is the first on the sophomore from Istanbul AndMs got to do a really good job of playing defense early which means you got to win the position battle down low You cant cant allow easy entry passes but when the shot goes up you got to play position rebounding just given the lack of size Its a foul on Miller Its whistle for the hand check So that is all of a sudden uh three very quick team fouls on SMU in the first 90 seconds Oh its an absolute hand check Booby Millers acting like he didnt do it Two hands on the ball handler is going to get called and I like the fact that they let it go the first time but if you continue its gonna get called Try to persuade to no avail Lane nearly crossed him up Lane drive and kick in 43 But now you got defense set This is what youre trying to do if yourem You get a shot to fall that that puts a little rhythm in your favor Now get your defense set a good possession and start to dictate how the games played for that air Boy he has hit that little baseline fall away a couple of times Hes got 13 Well form So theyve hit consecutive shots That hadnt happened since that 102 lead trying to make it three in a row And Bako wide open Hill has hands on it and it bounces out to Miller Look at Yiglu running the floor How about that I mean he has been incredibly active Its not as if he wasnt preso on that defensive possession So for him to get the run out impressive Lane cant answer And thats another foul on SMU Thats going to be on Yugato He Hes important Hes probably going to have to come out right now And kind of what I saw from him at times last year was when you get a step behind the play fullcourt game thats when he tends to foul Youve got to learn how to foul a physical game Heres the other thing Hes got six or eight inches on everybody hes going up against So he is getting pushed on constantly That wears you down in a different way And so John three fouls on Yiglu Now the man who replaces him is a true freshman Thats Jaden Tombs Coaching staff likes him Thats number 10 in the white But Yigolu sits down 2 and 12 minutes into this second half So how impactful will that be Theres a foul on the drive in and Pierre is going back to the free throw line I think the biggest impact may be that it allowsm to establish the game a bit music but Pierres been really good off the bounce He hes found hes found a matchup he likes and hes been able to attack but a lot of that comes from the fact that be able to get stops Pierre now with 14 While weve got a moment remember Jimmy B Classic coming up on Tuesday Thats on ESPN starts with Clemson BYU and then we get the top 15 battle afterward Florida and Yukon at nine I really like BYU I mean I kind of like I fought it a little bit Uh NIL pay for play whatever you want to call it the other free agency we see I fought it a little bit but if if this is where were going there are going to be teams like BYU And I think SMU frankly considering the resources they could say you want to play pro ball well play pro ball And thats what BYU did Theyre also playing a pro style with pros who are making prolevel money Lets just be real Uh I really like what theyre doing though Theyve been a fun watch to start the season and in the end ultimately great talent is good for basketball Couple of wins last week Thanksgiving week down in Orlando against quality competition as a goes up with the right But John that word to underscore its you hear every coach talk about it these days Its just the resources What what sort of resources does an institution have This is tombs Chuck that one up Lane has it 15point holeM is trying to dig itself out of this Sunday in Arlington Yeah Hill has been aggressive If you can get the defense to lift I mean it was just an initial quick little dribble drive Got inside threepoint line kick out hard close out Just get to the lane You continue to get to the lane If theres no shot blocking presence I toldus out of the game Youll finish Its going to sink that defense and thats wherem can start to find some threes McMillan has very lane has earned his trust very quickly Yes senior from Huntsville Alabama Played against him last year or coached against him when he was at North Northern Alabama Boy Pierre loves that baseline jumper Well and once you find a couple to go you start to seek it out with confidence And when good shooters seek out jump shot opportunities with confidence they make a higher percentage So Giron Pierre has music been an explosive scorer his whole career Today hes got 17ation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research And this is gamechanging research that helps saves lives If youre able give now vorgdonate 100 of the donations go directly to cancer research Back in Arlington TexasM and SMU The Aggies had only hit two triples to this point in the game And thats a big one right there to get it back to a dozen the deficit that is Tombs close range look and the freshman hes going to the free throw line You know theres a part of me too and Bako has been two of those three made threes Theres a part of me that says live with that You can live with not closing out hard and giving up an extra triple drive and kick by making him make threes You know there can be certain guys that that youre not going to close hard on He would be one of them Obviously Dominguez is one of those guys youre just not going to let get a shot off cuz he changes the game Dominguez we havent seen him much here in this second half He is uh its been difficult for him to get clean looks by the way So this a vaunted freshman class for SMU So Andy Enfield who is known to do that quite often at USC he signs a handful of ESPN top 100 recruits Tombs Hes definitely the one there at the top who probably at this point has got the most upside 6 10 from Amarillo Theres another triple in the corner And som all of a sudden theyve got a surplus here from distance Back within 11 after the agree If Imm I got to take advantage of Ilu on the bench Hes been such a force on both ends Got to capitalize make a nice run with the big man on the bench Its been about 3 minutes now Yugu has been sitting down with the three fouls Tombs again smothered by Griffin Time that beautifully and nowm is running Hill inside OUT DRIBBLE OH MARCUS HILL FINISHES This is the energy we were talking about Just hasnt been there And I wonder at what point you get told comes back in this game cheering cheering Washington goes up strong Thats Cory Washington Absorbs the contact and hits it with the right hand Can give up some baskets They just need to get this thing played at a better pace So far even giving up a basket is gettingm back out and running Theyre not playing a slow pace anymore Theyre really trying to get inside the paint And when they do that kick outs there Tire defense claps when you get nose on rim inside the paint And then if nobody helps up takes it away you not in there Hes not just a shot blocking presence Hes a deterrent by just standing there Yeah Yeah Lane a legit lane protector Now Marcus Hill he has looked for his and he has been efficient You see six out of eight shooting Hes got 15 And som all of a sudden they made their last four shots before that Washington basket It was back to single digits Federico Federico is back on the floor Again theres a certain style of game that allows for runs right and and a team that does well in a game of runs likem they can live with the music fact that SMU may go on a little run but that almost helps establish and kind of forces the be the game to be played their way And there you go So Federico Federico rips that away from SMU Its back to nine cheering Theres the heat in the back court now Washington hes got a couple of cheering seconds to get it over and he does You can see how it scramles you a little bit The pressure the first time all day them fan base is up off their feet and getting into this game as is their bench cheering They have been resuscitated revived here Washington threw it up Isaacs has the board Isaacs got his eyes cheering up Hes got Griffin in the corner Baseline drive going up strong Ryland Griffin draws the foul on Tombs And so the back of five man just got whistled for his third I think getting back to who you are right Are you willing to take the the quickest best shot and just create some opportunities here Tims not being strong with the basketball Yigos coming back in Thats thats been a game changer all game Hes really been impactful But the quick hitters are there Ju just put your head down and attack Watch the defense rotate They dont stop the basketball You got a layup They stop the basketball Somebodys open Now Tombs does sit down So I think when Yigolu checked out SMU was up by 14 and all of a suddenm cheering is back within eight So they have trimmed and trimmed away at the deficit cheering And even 11 to four run is an important one for the Aggies in this one Miller had it poked away by Griffin Isaacs has it Pop Is got it And the foul cheering Thats what they do They try to force you into playing at a pace thats faster than youre really comfortable with and they get you to turn that thing over with good ball pressure And what a finish by Bob Isac the defense we talk about just the pressure the constant pressure Continue to wear your opponent down with constant intensity and pressure All of a sudden a little burst from the Aggies Its a 134 run Theyre back in music it We talk were talking about the freshman before Another one down there at Chapel Hill Yeah hes not bad either Hes actually his energy his motor is incredible Then add that with a skill set Thats wild He he plays as hard as someone whos not that good and has to kind of like Tyler Hanssboro here Im just going to play so hard until I develop that skill set to be dominant He does He plays with an incredibly high motor So speaking of that we have seen a little different bounce from thism team So they have chiseled away at that uh at one point 15point deficit Theyre back within five Theyve made their last six shots You see theres number 24 in the white Cement Yiglu back on the floor This is Washington and Washington draws quick foul on Federico Feder Rico So that is the fourth team foul onm Meanwhile Aggies are in the bonus 1230 mark of the second and given the you know lack of depth where youve got your starting fives going to play 30 minutes Got to keep it up Pierre in particular his confidence on the offensive end has been everything Yeah hes got it here to your point He has been uh been called for three fouls Good contest running Clemens hits THE FERICO and he finishes cheering Threepoint game and a foul in the back court Thats on Isaacs And this is really set up by Clemens being able to get the ball out and he gets the rebound and he leads the break Hes got his head up the entire time In a way he was almost waiting for Feder Rico to get there cuz the pass was there I toldus behind the play cheering Its an extended Yeah John 16 to4 run for the Aggies Yeah theyre starting to play their game We set up Bucky Ball in the first half and didnt really see it This is what weve talked about Can you wear him down over the second half Its a total flip in efficiency SMU shooting just 36 from the floor Wow Eat had to fight through a lot of bodies and hands flying And maybe there was Yeah basket interference It looks like I think is what Lee Cassell is signaling Theyre going to say Yiglu grabbed the rim while the ball was up there M has it Theyre on a run with his team up by three He goes up tries to slam down that that basketball and then Lee Cassell music comes in and signals basket interference that his left hand had touched the rim We just had one of our officials Vlad Tad Doll come over and say Yes a legal assist to score Yeah I Im not sure if you look that one up in the rulebook dictionary that that would be the perfect example of it but that is what was called And this is a big possession because this could completely shift momentum Look at AG putting it up Almost had a chance for that conventional threepoint play but you just signal it partner The bigger uh situation here Fourth foul on Yiglu I mean that thats significant Yugato Yukatollu gets the illegal assist to score whatever that means Basket interference and on the other end good action little dump down and Yutolo picks up his fourth So this is significant 1130 to go in the second So while we have a moment our Monday Night Football matchup coming up Eagles Chargers and uh are you ready for this one Yeah Yeah Go ahead Got the uh Monsters Funday football version on ESPN 2 I I was a big fan of Mike Rosowski Yeah Todays more of a Sully guy but Where are your uh your kids Were they leaning on this one Yeah theyll be in bed Theyll be in bed Um the game could get moved up to like 600 pm Thatd be lovely 6 pm kickoff Fourpoint game in Arlington Hill Little too much heat behind that one tried to bank it in Then a loose ball foul thats on the AT Thats the seventh team foul Were going to see a lot of free throws here rest of the way Both teams in the bonus Yeah 11 minutes Both team in the bonus Hope you dont have anywhere to go after this cuz cuz things could get choppy But a lot of times when those fouls pick up youre going to start to see teams settle in The fullcourt pressure fromm has shifted the way this this game simply feels cheering They have made uh theyre starting to make their shots too Theyre nine out of 14 from the floor in the second half 64 from the field Its a fourpoint game Washington 43 They connect Thats big They they kind of drop back that fullcourt pressure back into a 131 And Washingtons just able to line it up Thats too easy Hes the third Mustang in double figures the last 12 You know Hill has been so crafty around the rim That time he was open on the block And so Marcus Hill the fifth year senior from Rockford Illinois leads the way for the Agies Hes got 17 Miller on the baseline gets it back Miller spins Miller attacks Hes going to the line Hes just Hes so much more patient Hes just really patient in terms of not moving too fast not not making predetermined decisions Thats a good look against the zone Good shot preparedness And you said he was open He was open for the catch He sure as anything wasnt open for that shot That was ridiculous Nine points three assists for Miller He could still end up with 20 and seven Oh for sure Like cheering it happens fast Hes hes gone for 20 points five times already But you nailed it Sometimes its not all about that athlet athleticism or speed but how you how you utilize it the change of speeds I think in this lineup too with Pierre just going to the bench he he does have to be more assertive with the basketball It doesnt mean you have to score but you have to create an advantage for your teammates 10 to play and SMU is back in front by seven Got two teams that have gotten off to good starts to begin the year They both have some encouraging wins They want to add another before conference play gets cranked up in a few weeks Isaacs way off that time Its on the floor Hill got bumped So Hill hits the deck Whos the foul on Thats going to be on Miller Ill tell you if Im picking up teams today Hills my first choice Hes been everywhere I Hes been loose balls tough finishes around the rim Doesnt matter what the matchup is hes getting there off the bounce Hes been really impactful He has disrupted the game on both ends and hes picking up full every time theres a made basket So Bucky McMillan remember he gets he gets the job first week of April had to work very quickly to put a roster together Marcus Hill is one of the 14 newcomers So he has very quickly earned the trust of his head coach Really everywhere Hill has been NC State last year Bowling Green before that hes been a scorer Hes had that knack Hes had that instinct and today continues to go off Hes got cheering 18 I think its easier to attract depth when you play this way where multiple guys are going to get plenty of minutes And if youre playing well if you if your rotations working maybe you play a little bit more Oh this ones going to be too far for Washington He saved it to ONeal They were in danger for a moment Yep 19 for Hill That ties his season high And thats an easy foul on Ali Da his second Thats an example of how Boopy Bill has gotten better at changing speeds You know there are a lot of guys out there that are lightning quick but if they dont know how to go from first to second to third and back down to first and up to fifth really quickly then youre pretty much easy and predictable to cover Yeah But the change of speeds the change of pace the threepoint threat but also the threat off the bounce the midrange threat and then threat at the rim and the threat at the lob like thats where you get really difficult to cover Savviness too to know whos defending you in this moment earns himself a trip to the free throw line Well he shoots it pretty well there too 94 free throw line Ill take that And he could live there to close this game out given the fouls that are looming for both teams Both teams in the bonus And for at this point now its been a couple of minutes Both went into the bonus the 11 12 minute mark SMU keepingM at arms length away right now Lead back to seven In a game where the Mustangs led by 15 earlier this halfM has gotten it back to three a couple of times They have charged back into this one And wheres that pass going to ball back to SMU Throw six seat seven Uhoh laughter I know what he the idea was the passing lane that was there was to the short corner but but sometimes you just got to get the ball moving faster to get the defense to rotate Heres Miller now plotting his attack The fadeaway left it short AG crosscourt pass to Griffin Defended by Edwards andbako nowhere to go cheering Ag fouled And so Isaacs does hit the roller that time and Rashawn Agy goes to the free throw line in a moment And that was really set up by Bob Isaacs I mean the the look away to get the defender to just vacate the paint area and make that pass Sometimes using your eyeballs getting the defense to create a passing lane for you is key You know were talking about free throws a lot lately And both of these teams they have really excelled at the free throw line and theyre both better than 75 at the stripe Texas AM as a team theyre close to 80 this year So just about everybody is shot very well at the stripe and this is now going to be a very important factor in this game Yeah I mean both teams were able to get there early in the second half and if your aggressiveness could allow you to live at the free throw line and you look at what 15 to 16 from the free throw line for SMU Yep Boopy Miller could live there for the rest of the game Meanwhilem theyve made 15 free throws And so this one stays tight Federico Federer Rico back on the floor Lane back in the game for form And hes a guy that he does a good job when hes able to get an angle get to the rim just forces a convergence from the defense and then you play out of it Theyre going to get Miller yet for the offensive foul And for Miller thats his fourth Youve got three SMU starters that have been whistled for four fouls Yeah And if anything look 828 left Hes got four You got to get him out now for for at least a defensive possession but likely to the under eight At some point you youve got to trust Boopy Miller to play with four fouls But I would say you would trust him enough not to pick up his fourth there Yep So Andy Enfield meanwhile has got to trust the guards hes got on the floor now They had some struggles against Vanderbilt with Miller off the floor because of that He didnt come off the floor that much So you got Edwards got to play 30 plus minutes Yep There are the culprits Miller Yutolo and then also Pardon me its just those two that have been whistled for four Pierre has three Griffin offline That was ONeal with the contest Hes off and running So is Edwards SMU looking for a quick score instead Back out No Pierres going to take it Oh Gerard Pierre is pure Tell you his confidence is at a different level right now I keep feeding and play to him Maybe not quickly in the shot clock but I like an ISO situation because of his ability to knock down a 16 18 ft jump shot Its a smooth looking jumper He is 19 Washington rips it away cheering SMU with numbers Ag hustling back Edwards All right that works Time out M Its a quick burst for SMU The Mustangs Some pretty good network of games there Its not bad Like I I think conference networks and then youre like Holy smokes theres a lot of good teams So its pretty darn good A lot of good teams in both of these leagues So SMU today has led for the majority of this game outside of you know four or five minutes early in the first They have been ahead for much of it And uh by by the way fans seated in the first couple of rows that was I guess them bench uh this side of the floor look out theres another turnover So for SMU its the starting five Its very prolific starting five You see what they average most of them in double figures but heres the catch Two of them Yolu and Miller Theyre uh impactful playmaking point guard and theyre 72 center on the bench right now with four fouls each So 640 to play Heres ONeal on the attack trying to get bailed out Pierre puts it up Another one for Geron Pierre Im telling you you see it in the shot preparation that hes got a different level of confidence tonight and theyre going to need every bit of it Isaacs responds Well going back to the foul situation look youre up nine How do you manage that with Miller and Yigolu now next few minutes Just feel the game I I mean if theres a run that youre concerned with then then maybe you can do little offense defense see if you can get to the free throw line I think thats going to be a big part of closing this out You can come back in at some point here too And he has been impactful He just shifted the whole music feel of the game Late shot clock offense again You got 3 seconds Lets get it back to Pierre Puts it up Thats offline Andm looked like they saved it No lord That time was on the baseline Hes out of bounds So SMU is going to get a fresh 30 here Just no reason cuz it definitely looked like Grays the rim but Im back and forth at times Sometimes it if a balls almost going out of bounds everyone almost stops Thats really close Definitely I thought it definitely hit the rim Yeah it definitely grazed the rim But but I get saving it You dont want to give him one He was open Pierre who has 22 today misfires again I would say if the balls close to the sideline where you getting the basketball quickly and pushing it up gives you an advantage I dont mind saving it but down there it doesnt make sensem dodges a bullet but they cant cash in on this end of the floor 530 to play Mustangs by nine Edwards dials it up That one was offline to the right Hill spin and a foul Thats Marcus Hill going back to the free throw line Hes going to shoot his eighth and ninth free throws today I think one of the more telling things is is Dominguez not really getting into the action at all Hes been a bit of a nonfactor and and since hes been bit of a nonfactor he hasnt really played much Guys a 15 point per game scorer 48 from three Just hasnt gotten good looks and its kind of been dictated by the game All right So you got two guys with four fouls in the game Nikki and Boopy Miller cheering Meanwhile for Bucky McMillan Ali Da comes back on the floor Sevenpoint game after the Hill free throws New season high for Hill Oh does he have a steal Wow That time Edwards was able to shield him off and rip it away but only by a by a fraction Heres Miller back on the floor as you mentioned Miller on the attack Rises Left it short Theres Hill Hes everywhere Yeah With another rebound Hes got a few boards few assists Underneath the rim Oh he slams on the brakes Great idea but he could not finish and fooled the 7 foot2 Yigolu So they are back out there with four and a half to play Each playing with four fouls Miller lines up the three and Hiller drew a Hill drew a foul on Washington Right Hill really jumps out Pierre for sure His shot making today has been terrific but Hills really influenced this game Getting to the basket he almost makes that last play The last play was terrific Just couldnt get the shot to go Rebounding the ball establishing pressure Hes played a fullcourt game Hes been good I mean the ball has been in his hands primarily here most of the time in this second half So hes going to add you would think to this season high total now You know Bucky McMillan has been candid about Hills personality Hes one of those hate to lose guys more than he likes to win Practice ends He doesnt like it Wants to keep playing Hes a competitor Yeah thats all youre asking for especially when youre building lets call it the last minute team and the way you want to play Bucky Ball You just want competitors Not going to fight whether Im playing enough minutes or not go out and play John Its a fivepoint game again SMU feeling the pressure cheering They almost had Miller in the corner there and they escape 415 to go cheering in a game thats tightened up Heres Miller looking for Yigolu trying to get position They shovel it to Pierre Great cut The cuts there because seeking out shot opportunities So when you get on the high side hes looking for an opportunity to score You become a better cutter Griffin from distance Theres a lead feed in the front court Dangerous pass Aggies have a chance to capitalize They can get it back to maybe a one or a twopoint game after the Griffin three and cheering the Griffin knock away Hes calling for it Edwards tried to gamble Little scrambled sequence now Holloway with a hesitation Theres a timeout So Bucky McMillan Nothing was happens the timeout with 10 on the shot clock Its a fourpoint game They probably should have just put up a picture of Marcus Hill I mean he has been bucky ball Hes been the guy getting to the basket finish the tough then hes the first one to step up and defend the full court Marcus Hill has done everything you could ask a guy to do Jakari hasnt really been the guy tonight Not getting downhill enough Marcus Hill has been that guy Playmaker on both sides of the floor He has established everything theyve done well in the second half Oh big time three with 315 to go AM cheering is back within ONE DOWN BY AS many as 15 earlier cheering cheering This is Miller Hate to shoot Miller scoop with a left Nice answer I mean just cool calm took his time changed speeds used the burst at the right time and finished with the left One possession game with two and a half to go Griffin wants it way off Pierre trying to track down the board That was kicked out off of somebodys shoe I think that was off of SMU Its going to stay here And if if Marcus Hill aint going after it theyre just going to corral that rebound But Poopy just he gets the he gets the matchup he wants Bako got a big one to go but Poopy got the matchup he liked It was a little ball screen action You got a switch He got somebody he felt comfortable taking it to the basket The change of speeds hes able to get where he wants with less effort You look hes got 15 He only had seven at the break Wow How is Hill that open Onepoint game again One of the better games of Hills career Then the turnover looking for a lead YEAH TIME OUT SMU and the Aggies ARE BACK IN FRONT FOR cheering THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 15minute mark in the first five minutes into the game It has really shifted and so much of that falls back on Marcus Hill Getting made baskets is huge Why it allows you to set up your pressure When you set up your pressure you just change the entire feel of the game It feels more like the Bucky ball we talked about And it might not be pretty It doesnt have to be They havent shot it particularly well but if you make the shots you need to make down the stretch you walk away with a win And at this point its not about pretty points its about winning Now I do like the fact if youre SMU youve got the best player music on the floor in group Miller And if you can continue to seek out the right matchup with a switch out top and keep you totally on that block short corner area to be able to throw the ball up if the defense helps music too much Just allow Boopy Miller to determine what you do on the offensive end and use Pierre If you help off Pierre he hes shooting the ball with confidence But its a different story now when youve been up and youre SMU Youve been up Its a different feel Youre now down one Every shot feels like it matters John 206 to play Both these teams theyre off to strong starts You see the records We thought these were two evenly matched squads coming into this one We thought it could be competitive Both teams want to pick up another critical cheering or just very important out of conference victory A lot of pressure again by Texas AM in the back court And how much is that wearing down the Mustangs Theyre playing from behind for the first time in forever cheering Miller with eight to shoot with size and uphill Instead its Washington Yigu goes up AM has it Guess who got it Marcus Hill has been unbelievable Most impactful player on the floor obviously Yeah especially for form Hes got 25 and five boards but a lot of those have been scoring 88 Yeah Is for three Puts it in cheering cheering Its a 204M run for the last 5 minutes WHAT A FLIP 60 seconds left now SMU has got to respond And Andy Enfield uses his last time out Theyre down two possessions with 59 seconds to go Look at this gutsy three Theres a certain style of game that allows it to be a game of runs and thats whatms been able to do in the second half Theyve been able to shift the way the games played to the point where run in this second half It is a 20 to4 surge for Texas AM for the last 5 12 minutes Its almost like they got down enough to be fearless in the comeback Theyll be fearless in their purpose of taking control of the game in terms of dictating the game And since theyve been able to dictate the game four fouls on Poopy Miller he goes out Yigolu goes out You lost a lot of momentum by having those two guys on the bench music for an extended period of time It Its been a different story I would say the last 15 minutes The Aggies poised measured fearless here in this second half That is the one compliment that McMillan gave his team after the Pittsburgh win They had a 12point lead in that game Lost in the second half Lost it ultimately hung on and won He said Look I was really happy with how poised they played Theyve done that today Playing with a deeper bench allows you to figure out whos having the game Pierre who has with a hot hand for SMU misfires So now all of a sudden start looking at the clock Its about a 21se second differential SMU and theyre going to play it out here They have to get the stop Oh its Edwards with the knock away Edwards going up Fouled So BJ Edwards known as the defensive stalwart for this team Hes going to the line for two critical free throws Thats thats inexcusable for Pop Isacs in that situation I I I dont care Be loose be fluid whatever But just dont make a lane onehanded pass in this situation Youre talking about 40 seconds left on the clock and you give up a near pick six Now it has been Marcus Hill and Pop Isaacs in the game as theyve come back It hasnt been Jar Lane whos been good Not as much in this game but but he has been Carl Lane getting to the basket has been good for them But the outside presence of Pop Isaacs has been impactful and then everything Marcus Hill has done But youve got to be strong with the basketball in this situation if youre Pop Isaac My goodness If Edwards hits this we like to use the phrase that changes the calculus That certainly does Edwards the program veteran third year at SMU Its two mighty free throws One possession game 362 You got a 6second differential between shot and game clock SMU aggressive in the back court Another steel THIS IS PIERRE WE ARE cheering TIED I dont know how much you pressure here Maybe not the same way you pressured on the last possession Yeah you got to back it off Ms got a timeout 22 seconds Four straight for SMU but the Aggies have it cheering and applause Vic Mill is saying hang on for one more 11 seconds Iss it AG coming to set the screen Isaacs going the other way 5 seconds Isaacs slams on the break Hes got to give it to somebody and he threw it away 11 on the clock I just dont like it You did nothing And now youve got Boopy Miller You can go music going back in I mean do you throw it long Obviously you do risk throwing it long and no one touching it and then the ball gets right back on the baseline Yeah So Pierre is going to inbound it 11 on the clock Question is if you have SMU do you feel more confident thanm at this point if you get into overtime I I think theres something to that What momentum are you carrying into overtime So dont risk anything I think SMUs got a little bit more confidence with what theyve done to come back Well whoever catches it you might have one dribble instead into the front court I dont think that touched anybody And if it didnt AM is going to have a chance to inbound underneath their hoop I think it was touched I I dont I dont see how no one touched that This is gigantic whether or not It absolutely is I I dont know how no one touched that ball It wasnt close It was not above every hand Was it This is a great angle of it The balls touched Okay Yes Feder Rico I dont know what were doing here I mean it changed direction I mean this is what youre concerned with throwing the ball long but but come on now If theres one thing youre watching music on that possession as an official its whether that ball is touched And that seemed pretty obvious to all of us music Wow John this this is going to be an incredible snorts What a break form That clearly deflected off of Feder Ricos fingertips Clock would have expired Here we go This is Isaacs to Griffin out of balance Does anybody want to win What in the world This is a strange finish That was kind of bald Dont lie though because the ball was clearly touched and there is no way they should have gotten the ball out of bounds there on the baseline Partner that is well said Theres still 410en of a second here Youre SMU What do you do now Yeah play overtime Lets play A wacky strange end of the second half sequence there End of regulations And then they ultimately got music two points after the turnovers each time They go from down four to tie it at 77 Yeah Pop music Is Isaac wants that turnover back And lets just forget about the last 11 shall we Yes Lets play five more minutes Nothing happened anyway Boy this one tightened up very quicklym with that gigantic 204 run to get back in the game take a lead which they lost Here we are in overtime This is Ryland Griffith trying to turn the corner Hes hit some timely threes Isaacs little pocket pass Why not Marcus Hill front rimmed it andu rips down his eighth rebound Hes got 12 and eight today The Mustangs They were the team that forced overtime with the four straight I feel like a lot of people were just walking around the streets and heard that the game got good and all of a sudden we got a bunch of people here Its been good Energy has been building the building Welcome Welcome Well take it Couple of programs in state foes playing in Arlington Griffin get that out of here Its really good defense knowing that hes not going to have a lot of help You you cant leave Nikku You got to trust your on the ball defenders to just force a tough one Griffin did a good job holding his own but then that happens Pierre has just been on fire Its a near 30 point game for Giron Pierre Hes got 28 A lot of midrange too I mean everybody talks about Oh its bad Its gone Well sort of Its there Its 11 out of 19 from the What a very Carmelo Anthony night for him Very effective from the midrange Hes hit a couple of threes Isaac wants another Its a foul on the interior That might be five on Yugato Is it on Yugato Yeah it is Yes it is That is his fifth Bart Lennox saying that he he clocked Ag in the head Maybe not intentionally but See Yigolu the 7 foot2 sophomore has fouled out or watch the top of your screen Uh I dont know Um I was watching the screen and Im not sure what really happened there cheering I mean he may have gotten popped a little but its just one of those things where to take him out of the game To already watching the replay of his fifth foul Thats where we are Its 2025 Were going to see his reaction in a moment but lets lets take a look again Top here Top of the screen Its a box out music Not to take a guy out of the game Look not not at all I mean hes just boxing out This is the problem What happens when you go look at it to see if it was flagrant and realize I never should have blown the whistle at all I mean lets be real in this situation Thats whats happening right now Youre going to go look and see if there was anything flavor In reality youre going to realize you put a fifth foul on a guy that didnt really do anything point you know particularly 334 left in overtime I Ill say this from those angles I didnt see the elbow hit them A was grabbing his basically grabbing his right cheek I thought the elbow went kind of right into his sternum And there are times though where you officiate outcomes music And you really didnt see it I mean this is I mean its tough to see He may have caught him a little bit with the left arm just kind of coming through the left hand but all right So nothing music is being overturned There was a dispute that they were arguing and he said no no indisputable evidence to overturn it Now theres also the other part which is you can told him man you got four fouls like and it has been physical against you Thats what happens when youre the biggest guy on the floor Everybody else is smaller Theyre using two arms and you really cant do as much as theyre doing to you Kind of the shack effect You see those numbersm basically right at their season average That was their 20th made free throw So how big is that going to loom Texas A or pardon me SMU loses Theyre very impactful sevenfooters Cemelu lane back onto the floor Isaac sits down You can see thats just brewing with the frustration and hes going to have to watch his teammates in overtime rest of the way 330 to play Now its really Boopy Miller and and Pierre You know Pierres just shooting the ball with such a confidence Let Boopy Miller go to work and then you got to trust your best player to make the right plays Miller with 15 and four assists Its Pierre right here with a game high 28 Sizing up Griffin going to work Puts it up and he draws the foul Jump shooters are are so hard to cover because of their willingness to pull up from 10 to 15 ft I know everything is layups dunks and threes but Michael Kit Gilchrist has done pretty well with a midrange game Not a ton there either Pretty good defense Thats on Griffin Thats his second So Giron Pierre Jr sixth year senior from New Orleans first year with the program Hes top 10 in the league in scoring You know 10 games into the year He has got a season high 29 Hes been an explosive scorer Andy Enfield hes mentioned that you know first year with us He was a great player last year at Jacksonville State Top five in the nation in scoring but he earned the trust the respect of his teammates and staff very quickly Hill meanwhile blew by him And so Hill is going to go to the free throw line to see if he can tie this one up Thats a foul on Holmes Holmes doesnt like the call but youve got to be there first I get it You You do have the right to verticality He walls up but he was kind of on the side coming into the ball handler and Marcus Hill Just another great attack from Hill Hill and Pierre today Two guys we didnt mention in the open Thanks a lot But just great individual performances Its kind of the whatever we need whatever we actually needed today Y was what they did Pierre I mean he was the guy getting tough shots to go Hills just making play after making play Were going to see Jakari Lane check in He had played in a while Wow He misses them both So he has made eight free throws Hes also missed five Hes eight out of 13 at the line cheering Overtime in Arlington The instate foes Pierre crossover the three sticks it WHAT A day for Gerard Pierre cheering Hes got 33 and now approaching a careerhigh Isaacs the step through into the paint Hill trying to tap it back Millers got it Thats a foul Its on Agy and Boopy Miller is going to the free throw line I just cant get over the performance from Pierre When you watch him size up his defender he feels as if hes going to score the basketball You You can see it You can feel it And as a defender heres the problem You can feel it too as a defender Like Ive been there trying to defend someone that already knows theyre about to score on me That is hard Pierre is playing with a different level of confidence today Hes playing like high school conference Look at that 30 33 today on 12 of 20 shooting So oh by the way one of your other prolific scorers Hes at the free throw line where he rarely misses SMU with another free throw here Theyre up three possessions with 220 to go in overtime Loopy Miller has the quietest 166 and four real quiet about it and just doing his thing Saying to you get overshadowed when someone else goes goes for 33 But it says something about the maturity of Ruthie Miller too Hes not forcing Hes not putting himself in bad situations He made big plays down the stretch to force overtime M finds itself down seven Aging offensive board back out tomb Imbako wants three They need it They missed it Still free Whos got it Ag He gets a trip to the free throw line That was a tough situation Youre up seven if youre SMU You just cant chase to the point where you get yourself out of rebounding position You know tough shots are going to go up so you have to anticipate tough shots going up which means you always got to maintain position prior to the shot going up Yeah it just feels like weve mentioned it a couple of times its been Pierre but Yuto Miller a lot of these veterans for SMU at times they have had really big moments Well I think Yutolo early kind of slowed the game down his presence inside He ran the floor well so its not as if there arent any transition opportunities where hes not really doing anything up and down the floor but playing inside to a sizable advantage it definitely slows the game down And now thats three state straight misses from the free throw line form Not good I guess to simplify Andy Enfield hes got an experience starting five that he relies on They all have been impactful at important times tonight Now theres still two to play Back to a sixpoint game after the aging M uh make and none more than than Pierre And hes done a good job of being patient working off the ball and getting in a position where he can create an advantage whether it be with a switch But now you got to get the ball in Thats going to be a giveaway Did Lane keep his feet in Yes he did So the pressure leads to the turnover Griffin picks up the dribble Wheres he going to go Back out to Lane Griffins open Puts it up Thats offline Hill Another board SOUTHERN WASHINGTON BLOCKED A shot and he draws the foul And how about Hill getting in there once again getting the offensive rebound but but Washington stayed right there Timed the jump perfectly You know weve seen the individual scoring performances that there are some games where the competition level is just skyhigh and late in the second and overtime we have seen all forms of that hustle the effort and thats a big moment right there from Washington So Edwards by the way is the lone starter whos not in double figures but nevertheless you can see just how important that experienced starting five is All five of them average 10 or more points I think the experience also allows you to be flexible and adaptable in terms of the style of play right You can adjust to different game styles when you have experience Especially when you have a point guard in Boopy Miller who can score it share it take care of it cheering kind of dictate the game on his own you know And let me point out too Edwards Okay hes got eight Only eight Hes got 10 assists Hes got eight boards He had that critical steal at the end of regulation I mean inevitably the best played game is the game determines your productivity SMU they have got the upper hand clearly right now playing with some swagger Kildo draws the foul and yeah Pierre gets whistled for a head scratcher I tell you my player con comparison for Marcus Hill is John Newman Look him up Hes just that kind of gritty do everything guy Plus hes got a little hes got a pillow man Hes got a knack for the camera little personality But while he is pretty effervescent you know we have seen him Oh hes awesome Yeah thats a guy a first team all play with Hate to play against Those guys are the best Got to make the free throws though Oh my goodness He now Hill has missed four in a row in the last minute and change These are back breaking misses at the line and a Pierre easy layup SMU by 10 with a minute to go Another giveaway Edwards into the front court SMU got the upper hand Theyre going to just drain some time All right theres a giveaways got to hurry in a big hole and Bakaco offline Pierre the rebound and so SMU they can drain the clock now less than 30 seconds They forced overtime with pivotal end of regulation steel right You felt that it really seized momentum Its a new game Whos created momentum into the new game And I felt like it was SMU They they made a few plays couple careless plays down the stretch fromm to just hand the ball over SMU is able to make big plays They get into a a overtime frame and here you go This is what happens They have outscored Texas AM in this extra period with the free throw now 143 andm has had some really untimely giveaways turnovers in this extra period Theyve missed they missed one too many free throws that ultimately allowed SMU to really stretch it out to a double digit lead Well I think allowing it to go overtimem lost their edge They just lost their edge They they found something in the second half and they lost it very quickly by allowing SMU back into it So these Mustangs last week they beat Mississippi State in overtime and theyre going to beat another SEC team in overtime with that late end of regulation burst and behind one of the breakout performances Yeah so far in the early goings of ACC play Giron Pierre going for 35 was uh saying Yeah hey call me when you need a bucket I got you Hes going to finish one point shy of his careerhigh 35 for Giron Pierre applause on 13 of 21 shooting Well I think there are a lot of guys out there great talent and the question is can they level up Can you go from Jacksonville State to SMU and still play at a high level And hes proven he can SMU applause is about to improve to 9 and one Andy Enfield said it to us earlier Look we didnt play very well earlier this week against Vandy We got to bounce back They did with some big time plays at the end of regulation to force overtime Then they outscore the Agies 163 in the extra period Sometimes you play your best games when you just again throw caution to the wind play fearlessly And if anybody did that it was Drop Pierre
