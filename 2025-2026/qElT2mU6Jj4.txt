at Doug McDaniel who leads the way 64 assists per game for the Tigers accounting for almost half of their assists on the season So for the first time since they played in the Gotham Classic almost 8 years ago we get the cards and Tigers for you today downtown and the freshman Mikel Brown gets it to Conwell Memphis opens in a man This is Sandanda Fu and a hell ball whistled by Chuck Jones whos on the whistle today with AJ Desai and Ron Guber Will send it to Memphis A great defensive stand on the first possession for the Memphis Tigers recognizing the action and having two on as soon as he catches the ball in the post This is McDaniel against Conwell Tried to go back door Stolen by Brown and the Cards on the run Isaac McNeely a three and the rebound gathered by Machop And one thing you will see with the Cards they will shoot the three ball One of the tops in the country in the 10th over 30 a game They dont have a problem shooting him in transition Hakee the fall away too This is a senior transfer from Toronto Hassan Abdul Hakee who did not play last Saturday against Baylor Started the two prior games McNeely to answer and it will bounce over the top of the glass and off to the Tigers it goes And you talked about Hakee This is has only played two games coming into this one So Penny Hardway happy to be able to get Hakee back into the lineup and is paying dividends for him on their second offensive possession McDaniel right against Conwell in the pressure and theres a foul on Conwell Whistled by Ron Guber First on Ryan Conwell first against Louisville and Pat Kelsey in season number two Coaches his 45th game as the headman of the cards here today and last years ACC coach of the year Welldeserving and more importantly has a culture created in a very short time here with the cards Hakee inside fall away against McNeely and last touch by the Tigers as down low you had a battle for the football or battle for the ball I should say with Zack Davis laughter Im getting there Dont worry Im with you I tell you what it could be a football match out here today As physical as both these teams want to be especially on the defensive end we could see some definite first and 10 out here and third and shorts Brown against this pressure and this something Pat Kelsey talked about too with his team today the ability to understand the physicality THERES A LOB AND A DUNK FOR San Die The experience of Javon Hadley recognizing as soon as he sees a defender trying to help in the matchup where hes got a smaller defender and Doug McDaniel guarding him just throwing it up to Fu for the easy McDaniel trying to find a pass Heres Davis who played pretty well last Saturday in the win against Baylor baseline Thats Bradshaw back up with the offensive rebound and the dunk Bradshaw Penny Hardway has been excited about the development of Aaron Bradshaw Really over the last four games had a big performance against Baylor in their win 17 points for him last time out Brown working on Hakee all the way through Hadley skips it for Conwell 10 to shoot They tap it McNeely Brown Conwell a triple Too strong And finally the Tigers all underneath with the rebound But you see Memphis and you see four blue uniforms in there going after the defensive rebound Thats in this one the points of emphasis for Penny Hardway coming into this game They have to take care of the boards on both ends They have to be aggressive offensively on the rebounding as well McDaniel a race to the rack Couldnt finish it McNeely back for Fu into traffic WITH A RIGHT HAND AND ONE BOY Brew ran the floor well Cory He He ran the floor well but more importantly his ability to adjust in mid stride there Not quite euro maybe half a euro but still allows him to be able to show off his soft touch through the contact and opportunity for one more strike 23 a euro Im only going 50 Im going half half Through to the line hes 72 Louisvilles second best free throw shooting team in the ACC at 77 Sand has got all five of the card points But you see Conwell continues to pick up Doug McDaniel 94 ft making sure he tries to wear down McDaniel It may not work in the first half but it can pay dividends in the second half as you put pressure on Aston Hardaway handles the ball on the baseline digging down on Conwell Out front you get our first look at Adrien Woolly on the floor Hes on McDaniel Fall away three THATS DAVIS ON A DOUBLE CLUTCH THAT GOES Zack Daviss ninth three of the young season All you can do is pat the guy on the back and tell him good shot There was great defense by Muel Brown on that one Just a shot and Davis is able to get to go Conwell misfires on the three Fu gives Louisville a second chance Hadley Conwell again Its almost automatic when an offensive rebound and you find a three for a 42 threepoint shooter as Conwell is is pretty much automatic Its going to go down Those are the type of mistakes that Benny Hardway does not want to give up throughout this game Here goes Davis on the scoop Mock the rebound back up offensively They crash the glass Look at all the bodies in the paint Bradshaw burned the dribble and cant finish with a right hand But thats Memphis basketball They want to beat you up on the offensive glass Conwell another one And thats Louisville basketball They want to get out in transition and find threes for their great shooters that they have on the perimeter Especially three and white Brian Conwell knocking down backto back threes on the last two possessions to give the Cards a fourpoint lead here And its valuable to these fan bases who are two of the elite fan bases in college basketball We all know about the global Cardinal fan base but Memphis as well And when you have a rivalry as such that has gone back dating back to 1949 Yep There are people that want to show up to see this McDaniel the miss jump shot Ali Khalifa the rebound Heres Codwell whos hit backtoback threes for the car Kai Roose on the floor for the first time as well as Khalifa out of the Louisville break and Sincere Parker is out there for the first time for Memphis Heres Brown and he spins off and its picked up by Julius Pep or beg you pardon thats uh Tariq Ingram Missed shot second chance Brown the three bounced out Thats Ingram the rebound but got a great look from three Mike Brown the beneficiary unable to get that one to go down but thats a shot that PK wants to take even though hes not shooting a great percentage from beyond the arc Ingram with the right hand couldnt finish Look at Rusco get the rebound Can rip it front court for the Cards back door Khalifa and thats the reverse order is normally Khalifa dropping the dime This time Kai Roose recognizes Khalifa with the nice cut to the rim picking up the easy deuce Eight nothing run by number 11 Louisville to take an early sixpoint advantage McDaniel spot up and Roose right there I dont think well have to worry about tempo No shot clock most likely wont become a factor in this Nice find skip for Woolly Adrien Woolly was eight of 25 from three before that one But backto back productive possessions from Kai Roos And now he gets a deflection This is what Patel he wants to see from Roos Not not concerned about the scoring Its more about his playmaking decision making The nice dime to Khalifa and then driving the crosscourt swing to Wulie was able to knock down the three ball the deflection on the other end An 110 Louisville run They started out struggling from the field and Memphis is now on their last six after starting three of six to start the game Yeah it feels like the Tigers need an answer here early They really do This is a tough possession for them And you look at the pressure that the Cards are applying pushing the offense out Look how far out everyone from Memphis is having to catch the basketball Parker tough shot Rebounded Kobe Rogers Talk about a guy can start a fire offensively Thats Rogers wearing 11 for the Cards Roose for Woolly Khalifa who is an excellent passer Rogers skips Can I Roose a three Nope Ingram the rebound Heres Memphis trying to get something Theyre 0 for their last seven And theres a foul on McNeely and Isaac Mcely the transfer from Virginia will draw his first Thats number two on the cards and Penny Hardaway to the bench Here comes Quante Barry into the ball game for Memphis And you see McDaniel get a break as he checks out for coach Hardaway And a welldeserved break Doug McDaniels had to handle the pressure for the cars throughout this game Memphis is a very forgive me Louisville is a very underrated defensive team And you notice how much pressure they put on you but theyre a deep team They promote without nine to 10 players out there And every one of them is doing the job defensively trying to force you to catch that basketball further and further away from the basket You see Roose is going to be ticketed for the foul here with Bradshaw So Kai Roose his first third against the Cards Crowd does not like it They see a replay on the big hanging video board inside the Yum Center Ingram bully ball against Khalifa and a foul on Ali Khalifa Itll be his first Thats four on the cards And thats going to put Tariq Ingram at the line grad transfer from Ryder who Cory originally started his college basketball career Wake Forest cheering Tariq Ingram no stranger to the ACC but this is a different Louisville program that hes coming to than when he first started his ACC journey That is a fact I can tell you right now there are people hanging from the rafters in this building today seeing 20 22000 Im not sure if its quite sold out but there are a lot of people in the building today And the majority of them are wearing red Yep Ingram the first and misses the second And theres a foul on Bradshaw trying to keep it alive And those are the type of fouls that Aaron Bradshaw has to stay away from Too valuable to his team especially as of late to get yourself in foul trouble just going over the back when the ch you really dont have much of a chance to get that offensive rebound So the Cards will put it in play You see tonight 730 on ESPN The combination you never knew you needed but now you get it Absolutely Good opportunity to see Oh thats going to be cut off of Louisville Chuck Jones is is he going to go into conversation here or is it going to be to play a home and home Theyll figure it out after that as to whether or not therell be a home court advantages But when you have the two buildings that they play in FedEx Forum of course in Memphis and this beautiful building here in Louisville I think this rivalry should stay between these two home buildings McNeely back for Khalifa Louisville was awarded the ball on the challenge So Pat Kelsey keeps his time out and has another challenge They cant do anything with it as the ball gets turned over in an eightpoint game with eight minutes gone here in this first half You see Barry Hakee Parker Bradshaw and Ingram are on the floor 10 to shoot And heres Parker working against Kobe Rogers who pokes it away now Five to shoot for the Tigers And here comes some reinforcements as Mike Browns back in the game So is Fu along with Conwell and Javon Hadley Yeah So the starting lineup back on the floor for the Cards So the reinforcements come back in after the reserves did a tremendous job Specifically Kenya Roots and his performance Heres Barry trying to lift and and does and it misses short and they got touched last out of bounds and hell ball will send it to Louisville Theyre going to Neither guy had a clear look at it and neither Chuck Jones or Ron Groover Penny Hardaway is like come on three of you guys out here Nobody saw this Well the ball actually went off of Isaac McNeelys foot out of bounds last but the officials were shielded also Hes going to challenge Yeah Penny Hardway going to challenge that one and and hes have come down to singledigit games every possession matter Baseline Parker feeds Barry Nicely done by the Tigers and see what happens You get two points on the board where the Tigers have struggled offensively You get a field goal after winning the challenge Barry helps Memphis get to within six Look at F go down the lane and a hill ball will stay with the Cards this time Penny Hardway put Tariq Ingram in the game and this might be Ingrams style of fight today Cory Well we talked about him is going to be physical and again hes built for this where you Penny Hardway is really starting to get a great understanding of his roster He feels as though now guys are starting to separate themselves and earning more and more minutes after they struggled to do so to start the season 15 to shoot for Browns Working on Bradshaw with the drive and thats two on Aaron Bradshaw and the third on the Tigers And so free throws coming for Mike Brown on Bradshaws second foul Well Penny Hardaways got a roster that is one of just three in college basketball to be entirely rebuilt And I mean entirely Cory zero returning players only one of three division one teams They just played the last one of the other ones in Baylor who had zero returning players But when you think about what Penny Hardway has been able to do and this is nothing new for Penny hes used to restructuring teams but he told us yesterday that the difference with this team is they dont he didnt feel like they were ready to play from day one Its taken longer to truly be able to create a rotation of guys that deserve minutes from the beginning He feels now eight games in theyve started to separate themselves to where he can have a five that he relies on and now be able to build a bench And to that point today was his seventh different lineup in nine games And only Doug McDaniel has started every ball game for Penny Hardway Hakee playing for just the third time this year started today Here goes Parker down the lane Couldnt finish They crashed the glass Theres Hakee and one But that is what the Tigers want to do Theres no one back on defense There are five blue jerseys in the paint going after an offensive rebound So its feast or famine but that time its a feast simply because they come up with the offensive rebound And now an opportunity for a threepoint play to cap off two productive backtoback offensive possessions Just the fifth free throw attempt of the year for Hassan Abdul Hakee from Toronto who played at UT Rio Grand Valley a season ago And Penny talked about how good of a player he was The injuries really havent given him opportunity to be seen Look at McNeely draw the foul going to the basket Louisville got ahead in the play Foul number foul is on Tariq Ingram Itll be his first It is the fourth on the Cards or on the Tigers rather And thatll send Isaac McNeely the former polka dot Cory to the free throw line Mhm I first for McNeely is good Dont forget tomorrow afternoon two great womens basketball contests await you First at 1 Eastern on ABC number 13 Baylor and number two Texas in the inaugural Sprouts Farmers Market ESPN Invitational And thats followed by Penn State at South Carolina McNeely makes it a sixpoint game That got blocked by Brown on the drive and a basket My goodness Zack Davis has got five And you can see the point of emphasis by the Tigers is to drive the basketball as Ruse continues his strong production Knocks down the three Thats been a struggle for him on the season Not shooting the ball well But after a productive first stint on the court hes playing with a tremendous amount of confidence And now the lead is seven cheering applause Barry for McDaniel trying to break down Michael Brown High arc with the right hand Off with it is Brown Standing three Got him cheering Theres a whole lot in his trunk Oh absolutely His bag is full of tricks when you consider Mike Brown His ability to go play off the bounce and of course attack the rim as well This is an elite talent that the Cards have at the point guard spot McDaniel races to the basket feeds Ingram That got blocked by Conwell Hakee with seven to shoot applause Im not sure if theyre aware of the shot clock Hakee is back rim miss Brown threw it away McDaniel with McNeely and the layup good First points for Doug McDaniel And Pat Kelsey wanted a foul at half court Felt like Mikel Brown got pushed out of bounds to force him to turn that turn the basketball over And now Fu backto back turnovers for the Cards Its an eightpoint lead for number 11 Louisville And substitutions both ways here Two hands to the body I understand Pat Kelseys concern on that one but it turns into two points the other direction for the Tigers Doug McDaniels with his first bucket of the game Woollys come back on the floor First time today for Louisville Were going to see Vellis Sugarus the junior from Greece wears 53 for the Cards Out of the corner three ball air ball out the hand of Barry and Zubarus cleans it up Heres a lead and Rogers cheering applause cheering 10point advantage for the Cardinals Mach out front against Zugarus cheering Barry with five to shoot Hakee scores on the layup Nice response by Hakee attacking the basket after the momentum has swung absolutely in favor of the home team Thats the way you have to silence the home crowd Ruth steerus runs down the second opportunity for Louisville Baseline Canai out front Adrien Willie another three cheering The cards six of 14 from beyond the ark That has been the true difference maker in this game Memphis only one threepoint field goal made a plus 15 advantage in that category for Louisville Hakee tries to answer the three and does with one of his own And thats an area where the Tigers are going to need much more of that if they want to compete in this game Louisville comes in averaging over 93 points per game Youre going to have to score to beat the Cardinals Heres Woolly with seven minutes to go in this first half Fights through the double team Kobe Rogers leaves it inside for Roose He got stripped and fouled Thatll get us to a timeout Free throws for the Cards Gord No No Stay right where you are Stay right where you are Just watch it all the way through As they said when radios have knobs just rip the knob off Youre fine Canny Roose at the line here Free throws for Louisville You saw our game summary Its kind of been early on We had a lot of you know trading punches if you will Louisville as Cory noted though has built this lead with free throws or threepoint shots as Roose gets ready for the second free throw Thats good And Roose has had a very productive first half now Five points three assists three rebounds for Kai Roos And this is the type of production that Pat Kelseys looking for from Roos Coming in off the bench even though hes had two starts this year while Hadley was injured coming in off the bench and providing energy just like Taan Prior does coming in doing the job defensively Ends up getting the foul but this is a young man who can really make this team better as well He was one of their best players last season before getting injured tearing his ACL in Atlantis Now Kase Prior is a complete energy guy now so he fits Kelseys mode from the start And he bleached the hair again So hes back to being the guy that we saw last year His superpower Thats it Yeah I tell you what speaking of superpower Abdul Hakee has been terrific man He has been special for the Tigers Yep Getting back in the lineup in the starting lineup as well Only his third game of the season Prior quickly for Woolly Oh nice Adrien Woolly into traffic McNeelys been quiet Heres Prior a three How about Kase Prior his second triple of the year first points today cheering The lead is 11 again for Louisville Under six to go first half on the drive Thats Parker Tough shot in his first basket and Sincere Parker going off the bounce and really just a strong individual move against Isaac McNeely But the cards to waste no time getting back down the floor on the offensive end Woolly a three at the front Well Adrien Woolly is showing you something here today and this is the production theyve really been waiting for with such a loaded back court with Brown Conwell and McNeely Woolly has really been the odd man out but now starting to find his way Heres Woolly again after the Memphis miss Prior another three Oh boy Im telling you WD ITS THE HAIR THIS IS THE first time hes bleached the hair this season Thats the Kan Pire that weve watched a season ago cheering have a very strong start for this Louisville Cardinal team Yep applause Quickly its 15 and Penny Hardaways concerned Theres the drive by Ashton Hardaway Ranked out of bounds and heres Kase Prior on the floor today for the first time One for seven from behind the line when he entered the game However he did not have his hair bleached back then Thats the superpower He has found it and is feeling good about things not just once but twice watching it go down and is excited about what hes been able to provide for his team here in the first half My goodness Holy cow What is this guy doing laughter Inbounds for Rogers Memphis trying to catch Louisville again with some of the double team pressure that worked early in the game Cards are really moving the ball well and Rogers knocks another one down WD Theyre building this lead with only two starters on the floor and their two leading scorers are on the bench watching right now as they continue to expand this out to an 18point lead Theres the drive and Hakee is keeping hope alive for Memphis He absolutely is Hakee has been special Just hasnt gotten much help from his friends Prior another one Oh boy cheering cheering Prior grabbed the net Thats going to count Maybe a little exuberant is Kase Prior Most nationally Oh by the way theyre a good defensive team Well Patel has the mix for a a championship contender this year As a friend of mine told me this week he said I saw them last Saturday in Indianapolis and they went Golden State on us laughter What is this They made 11 threes in the first half They had a game earlier this year where they made 20 I know And we could be approaching that and then some Here this afternoon Parker And we get a foul on Hardway I believe Yep Not that Hardway though It would be his son Its his son And and when we talk about Memphis having zero returning players you actually do have one Ashton Hardway who signed with Memphis and played there his freshman year transferred to St Marys last season and now back with the Tigers I asked Penny I said When did you know he was coming back He said Well you know fortunately I still got to play dad over his year that he was away from me and so Im hearing whats going on with the coach not know then hell be back with us next season I I love that he left and then wanted to come back and Penny tells us said Yeah I knew that ball thrown up under the basket on the drive by Davis and well go back to the Cards I mean you think about the landscape of college basketball when your own son leaves goes to another school and then wants to come back The portal is a busy place Lets just say that zone defensively now from Memphis But this is the scary part When youre playing a zone how do you identify all the shooters that the Cardinals have on the floor Mike Brown steps up and knocks down the three Now the Cards up to 12 threes made in the first half Three minutes to go in this first half Hakee has been the most consistent offensive piece for Memphis and hes too strong with the fall away Kase Prior Heres Conwell who started the barrage today And look at Prior hustled from the loose change And itll belong to the Titans But thats who Kase Prior is and and Kase Prior trying to get Pat Kelsey to challenge that saying that the coach Kelsey recognizing we already won one probably not the time I dont think he would win that one This is Hardway Hakee will try another one and knock it down My goodness I tell you what you cant ask for more from Hakee if youre Penny Hardway What hes been able to provide in the starting lineup Cory hes got 17 in the first half Hes been all of the offense for the Tigers thus far 17 of their 33 Conwell Too easy if youre Benny Hardway Yeah that cant happen when you consider just getting to the rim that easily No resistance at all for a leading score of the Cardinal I tell you this Doug McDaniel has but one bucket in this first half and everything has been hard work for the Tigers and that was a transition bucket off of a steal because the cars defense has made it very difficult on Doug McDaniel throughout this afternoon Parker knocks down the jump shot and here in the final 100 seconds Hadley scoreless today Theres Conwell and it rattled off on the Parker foul First on Sincere Parker is the seventh on Memphis So a couple of free throws coming for Ryan Conwell out of Indianapolis who is the number six scorer in the ACC at almost 20 a game Hes already had four games of 20 or more this year including 32 against NJIT and 25 against Cincinnati But look at the jump that hes made Starting his freshman year at South Florida transferring to Indiana State A nice jump there Then back home to Xavier And now at Louisville where he really dished out a beating to the home squad in the Indiana win 21 points for him but more importantly his 10 of 11 at the free throw line was the difference maker in that game where the Cards made nine more free throws than did the Hooers He came into this game three straight double figure games Cory with 14 threes This guy hes going to be a problem when ACC play starts He really is But thats the genius of Pat Kelsey When you have a star in Mike Brown but as a freshman the best thing that you can do is surround a player like that with experienced talent And I believe this roster makeup is is great for Mikel Brown because they beat Indiana without him having a big game Thats right Conwell was the star Isaac McNeely made five threes You had a number of guys stepping up and giving them a performance So with a freshman regardless of how talented they are theyre going to be up and down And now when you have a supporting cast to help that guy when the freshman are good now your team is great Coming up on a minute to play McDaniel a little runner with a right hand off the window Doug McDaniels second and recognizing he had a much bigger defender coming over and Fu trying to contest that shot got it off quickly and didnt have to use the floater to do so WD No Oh he was nice Conwell with Brown Hadley Fu and McNeely Brown trying to get in on the act Fu the offensive chance Hell kick it right back The freshman with a three at the top and hes fouled Three free throws coming on Sincere Parkers second foul He becomes the third Tiger with three joining Mach and Aaron Bradshaw But you can see that Michael Brown felt Parker contesting that shot Sticks the right leg out a little bit to get contact But however when youre contesting a shooter you cannot be in the cylinder and there was absolutely contact there sending Brown to the line for three free throws You watch the right leg come out a little bit there to get some contact but a smart play and thats not one Again Memphis has already used their challenge You want to have it for later in the game Im not sure thats one Penny Hardway is going to want to challenge at that point We got to the Louisville workout last night at their offcampus uh facility I should say away from the arena on campus practice facility and the Louisville Cardinals Mike El Brown was finishing up their workout with free throws Mhm Mike very detailed driven on the free throw approach Hes four of five today Well hes got the basketball in his hands a lot So being you know hes an 83 free throw shooter which is very good and theyre going to need him to be that especially as they continue to go move on into ACC play But hes got a couple of guys with him and Conwell at 85 and a half and McNeely at 80 So theyre pretty sureanded at the strike Eight to shoot for Hakee Now McDaniel slipped down with three to shoot Hakee trying to complete the half on a scoring spree Cant Knocked away and shot clock violation with 47 left So with less than 5 seconds to go see what Pat Kelsey wants here Oh believe me hes got something Yeah theres something Hes got What What do they say Somethings up Yeah Whats going on over there Somethings up The terminology from shoot around from PK Somethings up He absolutely has something up his sleeve here 47 More than enough time Does he want to burn a timeout Does he have a 30 he can use I think hes already used the use it or lose it timeout So hes not going to take that one And his guys are prepared We watch it all the time in their shoot around Theyre prepared to get a good look with this amount of time Look at Willie shoots it up the floor Heres Conwell Three two follow away at the horn off the mark and the half comes to a close But Louisville has a barrage in this first half They are 12 of 22 from behind the three ever Louisville has a 20point lead McDaniel whos got Davis on the floor along with Hakee Mach and Bradshaw And on the drive goes Zack Davis Hes now got seven Zack Davis is the guy who really carried the Tigers in their win over Baylor last time out 23 points for him Double digit rebound So theyre going to need his production in the second half to try to get back into it Hadley gets in on the act First points of the day for Javon Hadley And of course they happen from beyond the threepoint arc That is now 13 of them And Bradshaw and Hadley jocking for position And Javon Hadley from St Paul Minnesota in his sixth year is ticketed with his second foul First on the card WD Normally it takes you midway through the second half when you start thinking about okay is a record going to be broken tonight We were asking the questions at halftime with 12 threepoint field goals made is Aaron Bradshaws able to get the opportunity right around the rim to go down But we were asking the questions whats the school record Will we see one tonight Out of the corner Hadley again Its a strong possibility The first two possessions end up in threes And a great job by Michael Brown beating the pressure and finding his teammate on the outside for the second three already on two possessions alone Zack Davis leaning in on McNeely and its Hakee on the second chance and thats an offensive foul on Hassan Abdul Hakee A nice job by Conwell laying his body on the line and more importantly the reason you love this if youre Pat Kelsey your team has a 22point lead However you have not forgotten about the small details as to what makes you a winning program Conwell absolutely embodying that on the defensive end here Conwell on the drive See Hleys better than me Just made two threes from that spot No way Im giving that one up Exactly right And theres the drive by Brown It was slapped off the glass and thats goalending So Mikel Browns got his third field goal in a dozen points And as he attacks the basket you see the ball hit the backboard before music Mach is able to get a hand on it Easy call for this great officiating crew we had here tonight Yep And here is Doug McDaniel who has just two field goals trying to get it on the block to Bradshaw and last touch by the Tigers And thats been one of the Achilles heels of the Tigers this year They have a negative6 music six assist to turnover ratio coming into this game And nothing frustrates an alltime great point guard tell the truth as is Penny Hardway more so than seeing his turn his team continue to give the basketball away through a double team Brown had it poked away Cards turn it right back over to the Tigers Look at McDaniel trying to get pace And look at all the white jerseys with eyes on him making sure he did not have a run to the rim Mismatch here for McNeely Tough guard on a and Isaac McNeely is going to pay for it with his third foul Second on the cards in the half So Hassan Abdul Hakee from Toronto will go to the line here for a couple of free throws Hes got 17 Hes the only Memphis player in double figures you see averaging seven on the season cheering and that was coming into the ball game he had seven points seven total points in two games three and a half points a game you saw the number of shots he had taken but yet talking to Penny Hardway last night this a guy they were waiting on if you will one of six now or two of uh seven I should say at the line Cory thats been a struggle for him Everything else has been good but shooting the free throws has not been his strength this year Look at Conwell rolled to the deck Tried to scramble for it Now Woolly in there Hes trying to battle and hell ball going to go to Louisville And Adrien Woolly got just one hand in but that was enough to force it That was enough to force it But more importantly you think about a 24point lead but youve got guys still diving on the floor after the basketball Thats the culture that Pat Kelsey has created in Louisville in a very short time But Woolly has gotten the message If you want to play for this team this is the type of effort that you have to be able to do perform with consistently Oh Brown Conwell trying to beat Hakee off the bounce Will draw the foul Second on Hakee in the half the competitive element of this Louisville team not necessarily the competitive element of who theyre playing but within themselves could be a differencemaker for this club Im not saying that its not a talented team because it is Yes But their talent is secondary to their mental approach When you take the sum of the parts of all the guys that Pat Kelsey has assembled now youve got a returner and Hadley Khalifa who was whos red shirting last year with a knee injury Prior who sat out the majority of last season with a knee injury When you consider all of these guys who are talented but they all play hard as Hamilton knocked down his third three of this second half after going scoreless in the first half already up to nine points And now Caleb Wilson Both those guys have chances to be superstars at the next level Michael Brown Kingston Flemings was not even on the list Is so many talented freshman in this years college basketball But more importantly theyre actually the best players in college basketball Yeah it is such an impactful group and almost they embrace the big stage Well and they like to outdo each other Yeah Well thats true too KA Pete goes for 30 in game one So what does AJ Devonta do He comes back He has 22 points in the second half against Clemson at the Garden last night Look at Brown running up on the rim with the clock winding down by Celtic fall on the baseline And Memphis tried to get something cheap but knocked out of bounds by Louisville And there is Darren Peterson ready to roll in Raleigh Feeling good about being back He he came into this building and went but 21 in the first half in the exhibition game You want to talk about an elite guard Bill Self said he is the most talented and best recruit that he has ever had at Kansas Yes said that verbatim He is the guy And you know what I believe him Wow Thats how good Darren Peterson is Early test for the Wolfpack today huh In December you can build your resume Thats why we said its by resume Saturday Will Wade has had a lot of tests already Yep Going to Auburn in the challenge He has definitely challenged his team throughout this year early in the nonconference schedule as has the majority of the ACC Pat Kelseys done the same Think about this Look at the teams that that Louisville has played right They went to Arkansas They play Indiana neutral court They have this game against Memphis and I believe its Tennessee next Yes at Tennessee Yes sir That is He mentioned it Schedule the Lakers schedule the Celtics You asked for it you got it Yeah Foul by the way will be on Brown You saw Hadley picked up his third a moment ago First on the freshman from Orlando four on Louisville here in the second half You see the lead is 25 almost four minutes into the second half They led by 20 at the break did the Cards drive and block Fu got all over Daviss attempt and thatll send it back to Louisville But first a timeout opportunity to MC the ACCs Legends Brunch in 2017 Louisvilles inductee as far as their legend was Junior Bridgeman I learned so much about the man but more importantly about what he did for others And whats so inspiring in the video today where they showed Martin Lawrence Chris Tucker he had just on and on and on Michael Strahan the list of people who had to make sure they spoke out on his behalf to talk about his legacy was amazing And you see Davis Zack Davis got hit in the face going along the baseline Foul is on Kana Roose Itll be his second Thats five on Louisville Yeah it was a it was quite a moment Very emotional moment for Bridgemonds family of course to see his banner raised here in the Yum Center and rightly so The impact is just phenomenal Zack Davis will get to the Memphis bench Daryl Turner is their athletic trainer Well keep an eye on Zack Davis Inbounds for Brad Shaw And heres McDaniel Came into the ball game top 20 in the American in scoring is Doug McDaniel And Ingram couldnt control it before it went out of bounds But you can only imagine the point of emphasis that Pat Kelsey put on his team in their scouting report to try to take Doug McDaniel out of this game as much as you possibly can You mentioned it depending in practice yesterday Your team goes as Doug goes Y and again averaging 64 assists per game So its not just his scoring Hes the only Tiger in double figures on the season But also his 64 assists per game has him in the top 15 nationally So he is the engine for this team And they have really done a job on him this afternoon Yeah hes first in the American in assist second in steals 10 to shoot Rogers Heres Woolly who knocked down the three a moment ago Conwell and turned over by the Cards Sincere Parker on the run and scores with a left hand Great anticipation by Doug McDaniel that back line back there at WD Doug was an elite wide receiver in high school Also a good baseball player Hes one of those young men that could do anything you put him up to But theyre going to need much more of that from Doug here this afternoon They want to try to get back into this game Yeah Louisville by 26 Here is Roose and a mismatch Thats a little DMV matchup right there Woolly and threw it away from Conwell And Louisville kind of an unforced error in the half court Thats the one area where Louisvilles not great We talked about their offense We talked about their defense The one thing they do they turn the basketball over a little much to coach Kelces taste And again theyre high assist team but a 18 to one assist to turnover ratio for such a high assist team means youre turning the basketball over quite a bit Bradshaw trying to back down Roose and Kana stayed with it Gets the rebound and a skip pass is thrown away Theres a good example of what youre talking about Cory Yeah And again its an unnecessary play but this is a team that wants to play fast They want to share the basketball but sometimes the better role is to just keep it and make a simple play Another steal by Doug Yep McDaniel got it Hell take Khalifa baseline and score Six for Doug McDaniel Now heres Rogers racing to the other end to scoop and the score Second field goal for Rogers Both of them have been at the rim And great to see Kobe Rogers back healthy and contributing with coach Kelsey Came along with coach Kelce from College of Charleston when he made the move and now integral part really of the reserve unit for this team where there has been no drop off from the starters to the reserves throughout this game Yep Zugurus is going to check in Heres the timeline on Kobe Rogers He won a division 2 title by the way at Nova Southeastern Then went to the College of Charleston and hit 45 of his threes by the way two years ago Got hurt in their NCAA tournament appearance And then last year as a red shirt really just kind of got acclimated to what the Louisville system was And he was a communicator Every coach who comes in has got to have a guy to spread the gospel as they say right is a culture builder He understands the culture that coach Kelseys trying to build So what better you know example to have of that than one of your former players or a player thats been with you where youve had success to lead the way Woolly had it bounce out and Ingram went to the deck and Ron Grews got a foul and I believe its on Vela Sugar Thatll be the first on the junior from Greece And the 16 foul on the cards I believe by Jealous his physical size is going to buy him one or two 5050 fouls along the way But but thats the same call that was called against Aaron Brashaw earlier in the game The difference is its the wrong guys doing it Yeah They dont they dont want that call to go against the guys in white By the way if Im Pat Kelsey I keep Zugurus away from Jeff Braum laughter because a 68 240 lb guy who looks like this tight end uh potentially outside linebacker you know defend Okay By the way he didnt start playing basketball till he was 15 So technically this is just his sixth year of the game for Zugurus from Greece Cory the influence of international players across the landscape but in particular the ACC has been really really interesting this year And that brings us to another point that we need to bring about Im not sure why college basketball and the and the powers that be think its okay to bring guys from overseas that play professionally but its not okay to bring guys that play professionally in the United States I mean again London Johnson who has just joined Yes the Cardinal program is on the bench today for the first time Played professionally in for GLeague Ignite and playing the G League Yep And now hes back playing going to be part of college basketball Hes not going to play this year Hell play next season But its okay when you do it in Europe but its not okay when you do it in the United States Thats kind of a double standard if if theres such a thing Yeah And London Johnsons case made some headlines back in the summer but London Johnson never played a college basketball games which means he never used any college basketball eligibility Theres the drive Hardaway feeds Ingram And Tariq Ingram the easy dunk for his first field goal of the game Mikel Brown Beautiful Got to make that Isaac has been cold today from behind the line Rare off day if you will for McNeely Three ball rattles off That was hardway Cards have got substitutions at the table Look at Brown weave and then put it up That got blocked by a King Sincere Parker and thatll bounce in He played at McNe State a year ago for Will Wade He was a big spark off the bench for that Cowboy team that went to the NCAA tournament out of the South Lake Conference Time out Little bulky with just under 11 to go Well continue from Louisville in a moment Got to recognize today One more time season ticket members of the game presented by the lottery truly imagination and funding education for college since 1999 Thank you so much And now ladies and gentlemen a part of tradition since 1969 where you can find your next car online And if you want a tshirt I want a tshirt Get on your Heat Heat Heat Heat better start growing that music beard Yeah laughter we dont have much time We dont have much time left man You got a couple weeks Better get after it Cardinals in control But Cory theyre teachable moments here for Pat Kelsey They absolutely are And one of the things you love about Pat Kelsey as you see Mike Brown take a questionable shot that gets blocked and leads into two points on the other end of the floor forcing the timeout Pat Kelsey coaching up his superstar guard I had the fortune pleasure of playing for Greg Papovic who was a firm believer that you coach your best players the hardest Tim Duncan David Robinson because if your best players can co can accept hard coaching everyone else has to fall in line Pat Kelsey does a tremendous job of that coaching up Mike Brown Most importantly Brown is still in the game stays on the floor stays confident but the message gets across to his star player McNeely now Prior Conwell through out there with Brown And heres Sanda and foul And thats going to be on Hassan Abdul Hakeim Thatll be his third all here in the second half Five on the Tigers But look at the adjustments that the guards have made against Hassan Abdul who starred in the first half but has been blanked in the second half Hasnt scored So this is a guy that really got it going early Was all the offense for Memphis and theyve taken him out of it here in the second Well Conwell left it on the front rim Fu cleans it up and hes fouled by Parker Third on Sincere Parker Thats six on Memphis So FR will go to the line Sand from Germany is 72 at the strike 22 years of age and the first one rims out Dont forget tonight 700 Eastern on ABC in the ESPN app Chris Fowler hosts the 91st annual Heisman Trophy Ceremony Notre Dames Jeremiah Love Indianas Fernando Mendoza Vanderbilts Diego Pavia and Ohio States Julian Sean are the finalists tonight to be honored in New York All welld deserve of the trip Heres McDaniel on the drive and the hierarching layup good over Prior Eight for Doug McDaniel Cards by 20 The unfortunate part for the Tigers is that everything they do on the offensive end at this point you got to score points but it doesnt matter as much if you cant get stops on this other end Prior picked up his dribble gets it to McNeel Isaac got to find that ally and theres down the lane and that that just cant happen for Penny Hardways defense You do a great job Theres a dead dribble cheering So therefore theres no reason for two players to be guarding another one Just deny everyone else an opportunity Fu the biggest guy on the floor should absolutely not be able to get that get an easy one like that Hardaways scoop rolled off Here is Prior who set this building on edge with three threes And look Conwell Wow Strong attack by Conwell keeping his eyes on the rim as he absorbs the contact Great job defensively staying vertical but Conwell able to finish through the physicality Prior the steel buried a beat and fouled Quant Barry will draw his first seventh on Memphis with 859 to play You know we in this role were not supposed to roof anybody But I love seeing Prior having success tonight This a young man who started off last season and you know with a team that was loaded with stars may have been their best player Yeah Early Only got seven games before the injury only seven games before the injury was injured in that seventh game in the battle for Atlantis where Louisville went to the championship game but didnt have prior unable to pull it off but when you look at what he was able to do early before tearing his ACL he truly gave them an interior presence a guy that could stretch the floor and I would love to see if they can find that from him get him back playing confidently not concerned about the knee because people dont realize when you have an injury and Ive spent a number of them throughout my career The biggest issue is you dont get to work on your game youre busy rehab and you dont get a chance to work on your game So Prior not quite back to where he was but this has been a positive showing for him Yeah I would say here today theres a lob in traffic Prior to that challenge and a foul is going to be called PKs going to challenge that one Hes going to challenge that one He has to laughter Its going to be on Case and Brier for the time being screaming Im shocked Im shocked hes not challenging And up 26 I get it You dont necessarily have to And the free throw for Quante Barry is good But again when you when youre making threes and youre feeling good about things look at the defensive effort he makes in that play Right Thats the type of energy and the effort plays that coach Kelsey wants to see from Prior Yep Barry knocks them both down I think Louisvilles team is its really about finding the elements and the collaboration that goes on here is interesting Now Cory we asked about three guys in particular coming into the game today Prior would certainly be on that list Kai Roose as a sophomore who played more minutes a year ago and Adrien Woolly All three have really answered questions today about how they fit in the big picture And with already an elite starting lineup where Javon Hadley is the only one that doesnt average double figures and hes at 98 coming in with an elite starting lineup those three guys were talking about all come off the bench You add that consistent production Now youre talking about a national championship contender Conwell the front rim miss there Bradshaw the rebound And you think about those three guys and you know look Kobe Rogers could factor into that equation at some point and you see Prior after the Memphis miss But how many teams do you know that have eight guys in the landscape of college basketball where theres a lot of parody Eight talented guys that bet thats a pretty good team now And that is a very good possibly great team especially if they can keep all these guys healthy down music the stretch Darthy lights up an arena with her smile She reminds me of my mother great heart loves everyone Shes a special special person And we wish Darthy all the best And Vew touches this entire company Tonight of course youll see one of the great champions of the foundation The work Dick Vital has done in this country for pediatric cancer in particular Cory Unbelievable It is unbelievable You know what And I I got to give a shout out to Jay Bis who on Tuesday night as Im watching the games and he made it very clear where he talked about the Jimmy B Classic B Foundation That is the most important night that we have throughout our network during the year right Yep And and you consider all that goes on Basketball is basketball Its a game We all love it But what the V Foundation does for this world not just the United States not just for a community for this world is you know next level And when you consider that I never really thought of it that way until I heard Bill say it but its spot on That is the most important night that we have throughout our season Yep cheering McDaniel at the line after the foul on Kobe Rogers Doug McDaniel 19th best scorer in the American first in assist second in steals Hes a preseason all American conference player in most of the publications and you can understand why when you see him play He drives the engine You saw what he was able to do at Michigan Yep And then of course going to K State having some moments there as well And now playing for Penny Hardway is the Cards break the pressure to perfection And when teams are going to press you you have to take advantage of those opportunities at the rim Seven over seven minutes remaining Its not time to you know pull the basketball out and kill the clock When teams press you you have to go score to make them back the pressure off or you continue to build on your lead Under seven to go now in a ball game that has seen Louisville build this advantage to almost 30 And look at Prior go to fight with Mach And last touch by Memphis says AJ Desai So itll belong to the Cards We were having a conversation earlier today with Louisvilles fabulous sports information director Ask Matt Kelsey No we asked Dana Yeah and she broke down exactly what coach Kelsey is looking for for these guys to be able to add to their team in their role And what weve seen and the reason why they have a 28point lead is all three of those guys have done exactly what Dana described to us earlier So shout out to Dana Shes wearing her junior bridge pen Y and shout out to Dana for providing us the info cuz coach Kelsey was so busy at shoot around today He didnt even talk to us No he did come over and give us a hug before Yeah but but again Dana broke down everything that we needed to hear about the cards earlier for us to prepare to do our game And at the same time we give a shout out to our man Kirk as well Kirk DS helped us with Memphis last night Yes And uh we had a terrific visit with Penny Hardway And I will tell you Penny never played in this rivalry which is hard to believe coming out of Treadwell in Memphis But it just so happened that the conference positioning and jockeying of these institutions and now theyre getting ready to play This is the first of six scheduled meetings between Memphis and Louisville Its terrific for those terrific Those that know the history know Penny only played two years of college Thats right And we had a young man earlier in the game today wearing a Memphis State Yeah Number 25 jersey which is the jersey that Penny Hardway wore Everybody thinks he wore number one He didnt wear one till the NBA right Cuz at the time you couldnt wear one right In college basketball you couldnt wear one or two or zero for that matter But Penny Hardway wore 25 for two years Played for the great Larry Finch and Aaron Bradshaw inside for his fourth field goal And he was great to visit with last night Yeah And Penny Penny likes his team and again he feels as though its taken them longer to really kind of develop that chemistry and the understanding as to how they have to play as a unit to be successful Theres the guy Look at that Ive won so many different trivia questions with that one Ill ask people what number does Penny have Hardway have retired at Memphis State Everybody says one Wrong Wrong He wasnt a penny He was a quarter 25 cent But he he broke down why he wore the number 25 He was a huge Danny Manning Danny Manning And Ill tell you this that last night caught me by surprise Yeah Said Ed Manning recruited him extremely hard at Kansas And he was a huge Danny Manning fan Danny the Miracles of course in 88 Yep and love Danny Manning so much that he wore the number 25 in high school and at and at Memphis State And I got him last night as you see Hakee go to the line I asked him his five favorite Memphis players You think about it grew up in Memphis and I said and and properly so I said excluding you laughter And he gave me Keith Lee Elliot Perry Larry Finch who people forget took Memphis to the 1973 National Championship game against UCLA in St Louis Derek Rose and then the one William Bedford at the end Mhm And in all fairness he didnt give you Elliot Perry I did Well yeah you threw laughter EP in there You did put Elliot Perry I just reminded him EP has to be in there And Penny talked about how EP helped him develop as a player by doing just this stealing the basketball and doing the job defensively Quant Barry got the turnover and the timeout called and so a with under five to go Its become a house of horrors for opponents coming in here trying to beat this team And you see the confidence that they shoot it with 17 made threepoint field goals in this game already They already had a 20 point I mean a 23point field goal game here So they shoot extremely well in this building and that always makes you difficult to beat McDaniel fouled on the drive So McDaniel will go to the line after the foul And Pat Kelsey talking to Ron Groover here about the personal that was whistled on Kobe Rogers And Doug McDaniel knocks down the free throws Hes been Memphiss He and Bradshaw Theyve been their two top scorers here in the second half cheering Yeah who had 17 first half points zero in the second half So me the cards adjusted defensively to take away the guy that was hurting them And again thats the mark of a good team Anything that hurts you in the first half you go into the locker room you figure it out you find a way to adjust to it been able to extend the lead in the second half But in all honesty Hassan Abdul Hakeim did not have a lot of tape for you to review two games Although Penny Hardway was excited to see him Theres a three from Roose Canai Roose has got two threes and now eight in the game Up to 18 made threepoint field goals We said we would start talking about record territory Over four minutes remaining Had 19 last January at SMU Folks may remember Rain Smith had 10 of them 10 And Chucky Heburn had 16 assists of that game Yeah they did And they put on a show at the Moody that night Heres Woolly That rattled out And a foul called on Memphis Well Jason Charless idea He went with went to Dicky V with it and of course they were able to make it happen Will be an entertaining watch No question about it I dont know if my man Notorious Do gets a word in tonight He does the open and thats pretty much going to be it Well we welcome those of you whove come over from ESPN to ESPN News for the final three and a half as Ruth is fouled by Brad Shaw on the drive Cory Alexander Westerum and our terrific ESPN college basketball team here at the Young Center We have seen the cards just erupt from behind the threepoint line today And this is a pretty good Memphis team whos even though theyre four and four and going to be four and five after today with Vanderbilt looming next week Penny Hardways team is going to be tournament tested Cory before they get to January Theyre going to open the American on New Years Eve against North Texas but theyve got Vanderbilt and Mississippi State by the time next Saturday closes Well and this is the thing and you know we talked with Penny about it last night One of the things he made very clear was in being in the American its important to challenge his team in the nonconference which he has done every year that hes been the head coach at Memphis They need the quality opportunities to get quad one quad 2 wins for the committee A season ago remember they they went to the championship game at Mount right They did very well in the nonconference but now it will most likely be four and five by the end of this game cheering This scenario where theyre going to probably have to win the American Conference tournament to find their way into the NCAA tournament too But hes hes also had to deal with injuries Correct You know theyre theyre dealing with injuries Theyve got two of their main rotation guys who arent even playing this evening Thats right And so when you consider that the injuries they dealt with we talked about a This is only his third game of the season So Benny Hardway has not only had to re you know construct his roster but hes had to deal with the injuries to go along with it music This a team that he feels as though will be really good by the time they get to January and February The problem is their nonconference slate has been extremely difficult and they havent won as many of those games as he normally would Yeah Juliusford and Curtis Given the third combined to about 16 a game And in Bedfords case hes the 20th best scoreer in the America transfer from Western Kentucky And yeah Memphis is going to the team you see today may not be the team you see in February and Brown to the line and the first one is good Dont forget bowl season is underway on ABC in the ESPN app tonight at 8 Eastern Boise State the Mountain West champ for the third straight year squares off against Washington Its the up LA Bowl It kicks off Capital One Bowl Mania tonight 800 Eastern on ABC You havent seen De Man Williams of Washington at quarterback by the way Might want to get a look at the Husky signal caller And of course Boise State beat Nevada Las Vegas last week to capture the Mountain West title The bowl season waits for no man Just so you know Just so you know Second week in December Yes Mach misses the three Mach can make the three You know hes a true freshman only true freshman on Penny Hardways team And when you consider you know Penny talk to us about his language the language barrier makes it difficult for him to pick up things on the fly but as he continues hes going to be a really good player You see him able to stay in front of Mike El Brown and contest the shot and then run the rim on the other end of the floor will be of much added player to this rotation as the season goes along and he starts to get more and more experienced in traffic Barry the follow and a foul called on the cards with 205 to go So Javon Hadley thats number four And heres Quante Barry from Cleveland Tennessee who transferred from Temple where he averaged 10 points a season ago And the free throw bounces away Memphis was 12 and six against ranked opponents in the last three years until a buzzerbeating loss Wake Forest right Against Wake Forest Penny Hardway was 6 and0 versus the ACC Thats includes wins at Clemson and at Virginia last season Hes had his way with the ACC until this season And again it was a it was a buzzer beater a heave that that allowed Wake Forest to beat them in the Baja Mar Classic Now this one not so close Back door Oh THAT GOT THROWN IN Thats a bucket for McNeely Three I think thats a three That is a three And now the 18th three of the game Oh 19th three of the game for the car Theyre going to score that a three I think Well have to double check here Theyre going to give it to Zuberous but I think theyve got to score They got to go back and look at this to make sure they get Now Zug never touches the basketball Oh he does He did He does touch it Yep So now back to 18 threes So Zugarus touched it on the way in So it is a twopoint goal Velis gets credit for his fifth field goal of the year although Im not sure he wanted it laughter I think he would have Theres the free throw from Ingram So Louisville Cory told you this Tennessee waits for the next week in Knoxville cheering Yeah I I love what we have had this nonconference season through when you consider all the quality matchups that weve had right We havent seen as many of as what my guy Dicky B likes to call the cupcakes Yeah This year youve seen a lot of quality competition You look at Louisville schedule alone Look at the teams that theyve already played and they have Tennessee cheering Oh Oh the J get that Oh he sure is The language barrier was not a problem on that one And Hadley thought he was going to get fouled Instead its a technical foul on Maj So the technical foul will get Hadley you know and its its such a small thing but if Mach does exactly what he did but turns the other direction Now his back is facing right Hadley Yeah its no tactical foul right Hes running back down the floor He can say what he said he can you know flex and do whatever his gesture was right But if hes running away from Hadley its not a technical foul But you cant look at a player on the ground flex say what you have to say especially when youre down third Yep And now Pat Kelseys going to take Will Hank Cole Sherman and Spencer leg off his bench here at the end Put those guys in for the final minute if he can 99 points today for Louisville And theres the drive and score by Parker Hes into double figures Louisville has had four games already this year where theyve broken the century mark And Pat Kelsey wants to get Spencer Le into the lineup wearing number 55 Cole Sherman And Will Hanky comes in So theyll check in for the Cards I love that moment Yep Pat Kelsey coaching up Mike El Brown who didnt have a huge performance in this game and he coached him hard earlier but making sure he pulls him to the side has a quick conversation lets him know I still love you leg by the way missed the triple and theres Ingram at the other end strong finish be a turnover and it sure is turned over by the cards I love it Pat Kelsey stopping Mike Brown and you See Mel smiling with those two guys just sharing a moment and again when you when youre coaching a young star as such that relationship becomes so important and Pat Kelsey has it down to a science with the way hes coaching up Michael Brown Heres Kai Ruse coming through the backboard and now leg thought about it with the job The crowd wants 100 Yeah they do Kelsey doesnt want that to happen Nope And Spencer Le going to dribble this out and the ball game will end Louisville goes to nine and one and they win by 26 9973
