modest winning streaks Virginia Tech looks to run it to five in a row today as once again they welcome the Phoenix of Elon out of the CAA inside Castle Fans continuing to file in final Saturday before Christmas Happy youve chosen to spend a portion of this busy weekend with us First possession of Virginia Tech Youre noticing some new faces on the floor Well get you the full starting lineup in a moment but number of individuals needing to elevate their game in this one goes inside and now heres Hanssbury your player to keep an eye on coach Just three to shoot He will Nothing but the air And heres the first possession for Elon as the Phoenix bring it up the floor Number of talented players that you have to focus on here Was the first to knock something down here Take a look at this from Harold immediately Yeah Isaac Herold is the one holdover from last years team A big threeman who can step out and knock down the shot you just saw First start for Gerdak as you look at the starting five for Virginia Tech Yeah Gerdak has played some significant minutes and played effectively but this is his first time out there with that first five Well see how he does He needs to stay out of foul trouble replacing Antonio Dorne in that starting lineup who of course replaced Toby Lw Yeah without Avdal you mentioned Lw Thorne not there either with a back injury It is going to be interesting today to see who can step up for the Hokes But Elon enters the building with some fire here coach Yeah Isaac Harrell uh I I was talking with Coach Taylor He he has made big shots and big games And gosh hes off to a great start here in Blackburg They talk about his leadership Hes been a winner at every stop along the journey high school and college alike Hes an Arkansas kid Got the first six to get things rolling And here is a Virginia Tech answer Slicing down the lane Hansbury does eventually have the first points Yeah the West Virginia transfer is going to have to play a big role in a lot of different ways for Virginia Tech here this afternoon Leads the team in points 159 rebounds 79 Here are the individuals the Hokes are without today Yeah thats a thats a lot of production to replace just in sheer bodies What was a really deep team now becomes a little bit smaller on the bench That was double figures with Lau to begin with Then you add the back injury that has Dorne sideline and the illness as its being called that has of Dallas out today A completely different look on the floor Good look underneath quickly to the basket Theres your player to watch on the other side with his first play Yeah Cuchel and and Haspberry do a lot of similar things They can put it on the floor get to the rim They both can step out and they ironically both have about 30 offensive rebounds Bedford from the top How about that from the elbows Very nicely done Yeah Hasnt played well lately and uh back in the lineup after missing a game with with illness And uh hes another one whos going to have to step up here for Mike Youngs team Four seasons for Billy Taylor at Elon Youll remember him He was recruited by Digger at Notre Dame Graduated up there in the land of the Irish in 1995 Hes been wellraveled since really good player with Fran McCaffrey out at Iowa for a long time and even at UNCCG before that Yeah plenty of history between he and Mike Young when they were assistants at Walford in Coach Youngs case and at UNCCG which you mentioned in the case of Coach Taylor a couple of guys that have been on opposing sidelines for a long long time with a great deal of respect for one another Just before a transition opportunity perhaps for Hanssbury a whistle and a foul called instead Yeah and and that has implications further down the road Hanssbury cannot get into foul trouble for Virginia Tech here this afternoon And here he picked one up in the first three minutes of the game Seat going to be taken here as into the contest for the Hokes or check that for Elon making the change here Thats Kley seeing his first action Hes a guy they rely heavily upon in a variety of ways Yeah great shooter Wake Forest commit went to George Mason transferred to Elon and he is like lightning in a bottle coming off that bench Talk about his high IQ and how versatile he can be Just three to shoot for Elon This is a team that shoots it really well from beyond the arc That one wont go but they make 10 of them a game coach They shoot almost 30 of them a game Oh yeah and Randall Pettis the second is their best at that number one in the CIA at over 46 from long range having doubled up the hokes to begin things at 84 on a fast start by the Phoenix out of Elon North Carolina and a big long arb of Hanssberry in there to clean it up and finish Hansberry is going to be one tired young man after this game Hes got a lot riding on his shoulders on both ends of the floor All right I ask you about a couple of different things you watch with all the personnel changes here The first one youve already mentioned is foul trouble The other one you said is pace Yeah Pace of the game And and I think both these teams still want to get up and down but Im not sure the Hogs want to make this a horse race And thats been a different wrinkle for this Mike Young coach team this year Theyve been so good in transition along the way in this 2025 fall portion of the season Today may be a little more of a half court game one of the pillars for this Elon team off to a boy is it more critical than ever coach with the moving pieces in the landscape that now exist in college sports Yeah So so few people have a lot of production back and you try to get these people to uh come together and be a team and play as a team right away Its a and it has to happen organically but anything you can do to enhance it and coach Taylor has been very proactive in that Yeah Nice to have a brother active duty in the military and what he brings to the table as Tamara just told you so wonderfully really changing the aspects of the Elon program Well suffice it to say Elon off to a fast start in here Hit a couple of quick threes and still find himself up a bucket Yeah Isaac Harrell with a couple threes made a difference and then uh Cutrol with a nice baseline move down there and uh and now we get to see a little bit of their matchup zone which they will trap some out of See how Virginia Tech react reacts to that rather than the manto man Shot into the basketball game as well for the Hokes Goes into his hands as we speak Just two to shoot for the Hokes Hammond will back of the iron and a quick whistle as Johnson contacts with an Elon player up top Thats two on him quickly And here is a look at the head coach of the Hoke Seven years now at the helm of this Virginia Tech program Yeah And hes getting more gray hair by the minute right here Johnson less than 5 minutes into the game has to go to the bench Hes one of those versile guys They can play small with him at the four or play big with him at the three And now theyve gone to Isaiah Pasha who played his first extended minutes against Maryland Eastern Shore in the last game Yeah 9 minutes the high water mark Well see if theres more than that Tamara coach when I almost called you guys coach coach you are coach coach M sometimes I was listening to coach young during that media timeout and he said during this first four minutes guys you have been way too casual you guys have have to corral number three and stop him from shooting these three coach the other piece of that is frankly theyre without their their field general theyre without the gentleman who has been the distributor one of the things that folks have watched the hooks this season know what a difference maker Neo has been without him out there It takes some adjusting Yeah And they literally have one starter a normal starter on the floor right now Four people who are not used to being in this cheering and playing against a team thats playing with a lot of confidence here early Well and this is a squad that has been sparked by the international trio There was even an article a nice article about them this week and the work theyve provided for Virginia Tech without all those international connections today Yeah And and that and that has left Mike Young shorthanded A little bit of foul trouble here as added to that And what does it look like The actual numbers of those three not being available today Major difference for the Hokes And Elon trying to take advantage of that Thats good work in the interior by Spell to get the job done Yeah Coming off the bench A transfer from Liberty Grad transfer They got four grad transfers Three of them in the starting lineup And Spell comes in off the bench 100 coach And hes a Virginia Beach kid Remember that Heres a young man crossing over from the state of North Carolina where hes playing his college basketball Back into his home Commonwealth Pasha looks into the interior Hanssbury plenty of room underneath Boy he positioned himself well that time Nice job Pasha recognizing the shot clock Got it to Hanssbury just in time group on the floor still looking for points with the exception of the guy who just scored his sixth of the contest Click a really skilled fourman plays like a guard but bigbodied that rattles down Theres the three which is such a weapon and you said it Randle Pettis the second the junior guard who is the Northern Kentucky transfer Rattles it down Yeah Number one in the Ca in field goal percentage from threepoint land number 24 in America and number one in the CIA in uh free throw percentage This guy is a big time shooter Creates a little separation on the scoreboard now The crossover 13 and a half to go in the opening half of action and thats a nice little kiss off the glass Yeah Pasha Isaiah Pasha came from Delaware out of the CA at the time Theyve changed conferences now and hadnt gotten a lot of playing time but but a talented guy who was rookie of the year in that league a year ago Pasha saw 27 minutes against the University of Maryland Eastern Shore That vision of what the Hokes hope will be some things to come in terms of his ability to eat up some minutes for this squad And a whistle that the fans are going to let their thoughts be heard about here Last sequence that we just witnessed Yeah nice job right here recognizing the time Hansbury right at the end of the shot clock really heads up and then getting there too late and Pettis made a pay That was a whistle on Hammond just a first his direction and this is from the corner and that goes down Yeah check we talked about 485 doesnt take a ton of threes but he really has good ball skills Yeah the native of Poland He was on the national team there at one point now a grad student at 68 And we told you how many they knock down in a given contest Thats how well they shoot it for top tier in the CIA 12 nothing from the threepoint line so far back inside for Virginia Tech using the tools that they have and Hansbury is the best one out there You said that was going to be the formula today Theres a snapshot from the corner When I have talked to Hansberry you know previous games one of the things hes told me about his biggest growth spot from last year to this year is that hes seen the next play better He feels like hes connecting everything and he knows that the offense flows through him So its a big deal when he knows that he has this confidence hes able to play with like today Theres the development and critical that he experiences more of it today He attacks on Q but a whistle sends us to our media timeout Elon out front in the early stages here in Blackburg Heres a glance at how it has been distributed today for the Phoenix of Elon They have led from the very beginning It was a couple of backtoback threes as coach told you those coming from Harold that set the tone and theyve stayed out front Virginia Tech Plenty of movement Five to shoot now for the Hokes Shoot Will rims off Shoot Got a pretty good look against that matchup zone They start manto man but then they slide into that matchup zone and you kind of have to adjust and do some different things to find open shots playing with some confidence now as well with how solidly things have gone in the beginning stages here on the road Another offensive chance here and Hall who is really just like a one skill guy can really shoot the ball The red shirt sophomore joins the threepoint parade just like that Its 2112 Yeah came as a walkon but uh has earned that scholarship with that threepoint ability whistle out tap on his first rebound takes his time Put some air under that thing didnt he Well the other thing you notice from that package we rolled a moment ago in this latest three Coach this team does not mind shooting the threepointer from anywhere all the way around Yeah Yeah They got good range and thats thats the difference in this game at this point They have run Virginia Tech off the threepoint line For more on those threes lets check in with Tamara We were talking to associate head coach Chester Fraser His first thing out of his mouth when he brought up Elon was We have to guard the threepoint line He said Elon runs a free flowing motion offense designed to lull you to sleep and then theyll kick out the three And thats exactly what weve seen so far Yeah youre right Been on display right before our eyes And coach that was a much needed jumper from Hammond there Yeah just just a two but it was helpful Tyler Johnson back on the floor with those two fouls for Mike Young Cleaned up by Gerak and pushed up the floor Pasha grabs the handle Good job by Eli getting back Hooks had numbers right there Speaking of Johnson he zips a pass near side Pasha seven to shoot Thats front of the iron Carr will slow things down a bit His team up Well right now its a touchdown right Seven When you think in terms of everything happening around the country this weekend little football action I know youre keeping an eye on what happens all across the land Boy a nice job of penetration here after all that outside scoring Yeah Carr doesnt look for his shot very much but but kind of has a sense of when they need him Uh got off to a great start against Richmond in a big win for Elon just the other night Yeah Jawan Carr came over from UNCC Pimpro Hes played in three NCAA tournaments during his time there and was the conference Carolinas MVP in the championship game last season So he comes over from some winning programs This was a needed role Pasha again Yeah a little midrange jumper that time Now they wanted a whistle did the fans but able to plant that foot so it stays with Eli Thats off the mark One of the few from threepoint land that have been that but its cleaned up by Pettis underneath Yeah offensive rebound right there again Second chance points We talked about how good they are at it in the thick of it music mid first half between Elon and Virginia Tech Young started things off by saying Elon is playing harder than we are And Tyler Johnson echoed his coach to say We have to come together Were already letting them shoot way too many threes and now were allowing them to have easy layups We have to come together guys Its resulted in an advantage of nine as it goes back to work inside eight and a half We get a whistle underneath By the way so much action in the early going We have not yet introduced you to our officials Jerry Heater handling things today with Shawn Hall and Ryan Cissan the threeman crew responsible for the contest on this 20th day of December Can you believe it Junior Tech with a wide open look on the out of bounds and it went through Tyler Johnsons hands Turnover now in the hands of Demarco Johnson going the other way backup point guard Long lengthy good good penetrator good passer nice feed Look who he found Theres Kley Remember Kley the guy they talk about being able to do so many different things well for this team He was good on the baseline there Really good shooter but a really good scoreer We talked about it being a Wake Forest commit Played at Mason last year but when he comes in he lights it up The George Mason transfer went to Christ School in Ardan North Carolina If that sounds familiar ACC connections there Thats where the Plumbley brothers and Duke spent their prep career So hes been in winning environments through and through And how about this controlled turn to the basket everything falling Elons way right now particularly Harolds Yeah Harold normally a catch and shoot kind of guy Put it on the floor Stumbled a little bit Theres the back cut with Kley Nice pass from Johnson And then off the dribble Harold who doesnt go off the dribble much did its a little spin move finishes through the contact and gets to go to the free throw line You know we referenced a prep career a moment ago Think about his He was a seventime state champion was Harold A combination of basketball and tennis championships and seven rings to show for it And why did coach tell us they wanted him on this roster Because hes a winner Winner Winner Same thing with Jawan Carr Pemrook You mentioned him in all those NCAA tournaments Ran out of eligibility at Penbrook Its a a completely different world now the way you have to piece together the roster Find the right elements Elon certainly has And they found the right stroke from Ned Hall right here The sophomore drains another three Yeah really sloppy ball hand right there turned into a wide open three for cheering for a guy who can really shoot the ball and another careless turnover and the Hokes are shook here at home Suddenly a difficult sequence for Virginia Tech Yeah here heres a a a sloppy pass and Hall catches it right in rhythm followed up by another turnover and another possession for Elon trying to extend that lead Already doubled up on the Hokes 326 pictures worth a thousand words And this has been the opposite of the story this year This was a team not turning the ball over at near the clip they did a season ago But coach you got to believe Neil of Dallas absence and his ability to handle the basketball completely changing the scenario in here today Well two or three starters out and and we saw the production that those guys present You see the production Elon puts together and on Q to match the graphic another from downtown and thats clock again Yeah we mentioned 485 just doesnt take a lot of them but very skilled and they are playing with so much confidence right now Phoenix on fire running off and hiding in this first half with 6 and a half to go have posted 35 Mentioned both these teams able to score this and Elon team averaging 85 points per contest and cruising toward it right now L check after he drives kicks it to Johnson and thatll rattle around until its eventually pulled out of the sky by Shu and he goes to the deck Foul right there on Caleb Middleton backup post player Middleton picking up his initial of the contest Theyll send it to the other end What do you see from the Hokes right now coach Well I think theyre in a little bit of shock Uh they they havent been able to get theyre frustrated on offense and and uh when they when they can when they do have the ball and get a stop uh they theyve been careless with the basketball and thats very unlike what you said what what theyve been like this year 89 turnovers per game number one in the ACC number four in the NCAA That hasnt been the case here this afternoon First point of the contest for Jaden Shoot comes from the charity strike Five turnovers already for Virginia Tech And it seems like every one of them has resulted in something good for Elon You said it just has been a quick strike for the Phoenix right after those Hokes miscues Heres some pressure from Virginia Tech The Hokes decided theyre going to pick up the pressure a little bit Of course with a shorter bench that thats thats a tough thing to look at long term but they got to do something to to mix this game up a little bit That falls right into the grasp of Caleb Middleton who provides the finish Boy sometimes it the balls bouncing your way and everything Yeah that was a miscommunication on the ball screen right there left the center wide open in the lane and uh yeah it it kind of bounced around the rim but he got it to fall with force Hanssbury attacks and he draws contact Theres the mixup Left the center wide open Help Got there too late Then Hansbury attacks off the dribble Draws the contact Gets to go to the free throw line Foul on Middleton Hes picked up a couple quickly here And Hansberry gets the first to rattle around and fall He has been the one individual Hes the gentleman you called on before the contest started Closing in on double figures in this first half Yeah he he had to have a big game but hes got to have some help too And so far we have not seen anybody consistently contribute outside of Hans Nothing but the twine gives him 10 to lead the way for Virginia Tech Coo back in at center replacing Middleton who we were talking about a little bit earlier Middleton came in made his mark on the contest from without and within Phoenix breaking that press cheering Pettis some in the building Thought might have moved that foot a bit Good to hear that the crowds still lively trying to get in behind the Hogs And now contact out top real physical on the screen right there Heres another look at the screen Very physical Ill just leave it at that They havent done much wrong in this game though Elon has been playing great on both ends As a result stake to a 17point lead with five minutes to play in the first half Closing out on the shooters like that Carr found Bedford kept him from getting the shot up Porson shoot to drive the basketball cheering Call an offensive foul there Foul on Virginia 32 your way Thats his first This is nothing new for Elon Pushing an ACC team to the brink Look no further than one season ago when his team rolled into South Bend against his alma mater no less and picked up an ACC win Yeah we we had a good talk with him about that and talked with him a year ago about that And of course he had Digger Phelps speak to the team prior to the game And uh that is a big moment for Billy Taylor Yeah trying to make it backtoback seasons in which he goes into an ACC building Perhaps steals one away Long way to go in this one but a fast start for Elon to that end And pestering D cheering for Hammond as we check in for more on that contest with Tamar You brought up that ACC win that they had against Notre Dame Coach Billy Taylor talked a lot about the reason why they won that game was out rebound out rebounding the Irish and they had to do the same thing here today Well the combo of that work and what they have done beyond the arc has Elon sitting pretty and they will add to the lead Beautiful touch from Coutrol right there Just not simply the outside game coach Theres so many other ways Elon is taking care of business as well And finally an open window to slam one home for Derak if many easy shots for Virginia Tech but that certainly was one where they didnt communicate postto post on that matchup zone Thats his first basket on what was his first start for the Hokes this season Another offensive rebound Long shots equal long rebounds Mutral nearly found a way to force that down What a start its been for Eli Yeah Off to a 17point lead late in the first half That cuts music oneonone forcing turnovers finding open threes We talked about music their diversity scoring over 85 points a game and its on full display here in Blackburg this afternoon Seven of nine field goals for Elon and seven threepoint baskets already poured in by the Phoenix in this first half Yeah shooting 62 from the field 54 from threepoint music land Theyve only been to the free throw line once It hadnt mattered Theyre still filling it up Well the other amazing part of this coach when you think about it is there music nine individuals who already have placed their name in the scorebook on the Elon side of things Yeah thats we talked about the their depth and of course Virginia Tech uh had depth uh until the the last little bit here when uh three guys that they count on for heavy minutes are are not available with Lau with the double double and of course meanwhile uh their star cheering and even Antonio Dorne has been playing quality minutes lately with Lao out of the lineup Well and Bedford just came back after missing some time in the previous contest So it uh is a matter of whos available for the Hokes right now Thats been as big a story as anything else on this Saturday inside Castle Cleaning it up inside putting it back Good job by Gerak Remember now hes got a couple on him but he has done a nice job in the interior on more than one occasion He is old school Yeah hes not going to be up above that rim but he is fundamentally sound and solid performer Three and change to go in the opening half Every time it looks like something positive happens for the Hokes Elon has an answer on the other end of the floor This time its Harold again Another beautiful pass and Harold is excellent at moving without the ball cheering Its going to be picked up by Click there Number six Casper Both teams in the bonus now Taking the double bonus 32 Christian We are looking ahead at our final womens basketball double header of 2025 on the ACC network Thats Monday the 29th music Anahalgo 13th ranked Notre Dame hosting pit in South Bend 6 Eastern Then music in 12th ranked North Carolina traveling to take on BC Both also available on the ESPN app Womens basketball coming your way as we roll on toward the new year The partner Virginia Tech has to make a little run here at the end of the half Have to have a little bit of momentum going at halftime And of course Elons job is to keep that from happening And uh they are operating from a position of strength right now with that big lead market gets 18 with just under three minutes to play Track exactly what coach is talking about 10 to shoot and good disruption That blocked away by Pasha cheering out front his direction Looked to be just as good on the other end of the floor Shoot is there when it matters Something we talked about Virginia Tech in transition We have not seen it much but the crowd is in it right now They want to see more of it Theyll need more of it That cuts it to 4327 cheering Headed the other way An illegal screen right there Defense can always create some high percentage offense Blocked the shot Came up with the ball Pasha attacked And here comes Shoot Normally a threepoint shooter but theyll take that offensive rebound at this point Yeah right where he needed to be and it cuts it as we said 4327 two and change to play in the opening half which to this point had belonged to Elon and heres a traveling violation that will give it back to the Phoenix shot fake right there got a little bit of a hurry Elon wanting to talk it over with 202 to play will take the timeout and rolling on through the playoffs this weekend What uh an entertaining music contest last night to get it started Full day of football today Good game Alabama 17 down Came back to win by 10 Miami and Texas AM in a in a slobber knocker here this afternoon First round games on campus always makes for quite the environment in the new setup in college football Well thats disrupted down on the baseline Its out of bounds 17 to shoot 149 to go in the half What do you need to see in this final 149 coach Well Billy Taylor called a timeout He just wanted to make sure they said they understood how important this next minute and a half is because Yeah they built a big lead but they dont want to give Virginia Tech any life or any momentum going in at halftime Elon team shooting 61 from the floor 17 of 28 in this first half and much of that from beyond the arc Well Hokes have been able to get a few calls here to provide some possession opportunities Heres another Yeah another illegal screen sends it the other way Virginia Tech with a another chance to cut into that 16point deficit Elons gone They showed they talked about going manto man but theyre back in the matchup zone 11 of 25 Virginia Tech has not hit a three in the contest That one of the major differences cheering trending in this game And another whistle underneath Looks to be against Ned Hall Thats going to be two on Hall And here is a chance at the line for Gerak Gerak going back to the line But but again even that was a good play by Elon running shoot off of the threepoint line making him take a contested two Gerock helped out there with the offensive rebound for Virginia Tech Now two of his six points in this first half have come from the charity stripe Tyler Johnson back in We mentioned he got those fouls on him early in the game Hadnt been able to play as many minutes as he normally does Such a key guys and and even more of a key guy today without Dorne L and Yeah And you watching uh throughout the the foul scenario Got four players with a couple of them on the Elon side of things We mentioned nine scorers for Elon Nine out of the 10 that have participated Also picking up a whistle somewhere along the way Inside 90 seconds to play in the half cheering Futral It had worked so well throughout this first half That certainly has another offensive board Yeah that thats just unacceptable right there That wouldnt have boxed out Seven offensive rebounds now cheering Will it turn into points Johnson off the mark Heres another offensive board now taken away cheering There to handle it is Hanssbury Well he has been the one major bright spot for the Hokes in this first half Then just do a little bit of everything Running the floor that time with the foot back cheering crowd here is into the game Strong cheering He has 12 Hookies have cut it to just that with a half minute to go in half number one cheering cheering Shot clock off and one coming for Gerk cheering Really nice play Hammond had shoot on the wing decided to go inside and Gdak paid off After all that the Hokes with a made free throw on the and one could cut it to single digits Nice play And Gak we talked about the fact that Ben will play above the rim or beat you down to four but he works his tail off He is old school if I ever saw it Just the push Virginia Tech needed coming down the stretch in the first half Yeah if they could get another stop right here that would be huge for Mike Young Even better than the made free throw Pants kept it alive Posasha put it in cheering The lead in the blink of an eye Down to eight cheering A lead that moments ago was 18 Now in single digits thanks to the Virginia Tech Second half action for the first possession belonging to Elon cheering Be interesting to see what Elon tries to do right away cheering Tried that three It had been the catalyst in the first half but a drive to the cheering bucket for the Phoenix first points this time around And its Pettis who lays it home Yeah Pettis known for the threepoint shot but that shot fake and get to the rim is something that he can do also First six belong to Elon Couple of threes So Virginia Tech has not led in this basketball game Their second largest deficit of the year The 19point advantage Elon at one point held in the half Only the VCU game earlier in which they trailed by 20 as Virginia Tech experienced a larger deficit But took a big bite out of it at the end of the half though Coach what do you see as adjustments for the second half Yeah I I think they I think theyre going to continue to go inside and hope that opens up something from the perimeter for Virginia Tech Coo has it rim out and the first few threes of this second half will not go And heres a whistle Yeah And and you know running for those loose balls that doesnt show up necessarily on the stat sheet but uh but two second chances here already for Elon to start the second half And heres a third foul picked up by Johnson here as this is assessed his direction Yeah that thats tough And he survived the first half with only two Thats the good news But picking up a third one is tough Tamara Mack just brought up the two second chance uh two second chances that Elon has had It reminds me of what coach Fraser told us earlier He said Elon we cannot let them get comfortable early especially from Deep And the second thing he said was We have to limit Elons cutters and limit them to only one shot per possession You talked about the offensive rebounds in that first half and how they translated into points coach Yeah And theyve got three here to start the second half on the first three possessions and theyve all been long rebounds Car on the baseline Had it taken away and theyll say it went off Carrs leg Itll be Hocus ball Oh Virginia got finally got a stop right there Contested shots fine but uh got to stop giving them second chance opportunities cheering Three ball for Virginia Tech this time Johnson drains it home First one of the game for Virginia Tech cheering cheering That finish to the first half got this crowd going in the game Now the Hooks after going oh of their first eight from beyond the arc Smack just told you drain the first cheering looking up the floor Oh that wrap right off the hand of Hansbury that time Here is that first elusive threepointer Yeah inside out defense cant get there in time Johnson with the nice stroke Shoot 41 from long range this year Big improvement for him in the offseason in a lot of categories but thats the most noticeable statistically Trying to open up some space for Pettis there cheering His have all the passing lanes closed Itll stay on this end as theres a collision between Johnson and a couple of those Phoenix underneath Yeah and again kept keeping the ball alive keeping the ball in their possession Take another look at it Crowd didnt like it It does look a little bit like Oh theres the reach And officials got it right Actually just he and Harrow that time in the neighborhood once you get a look at it straight on long three again Theyre attacking the offensive glass and cheering we were at practice and shoot around and coach Young couldnt emphasize it enough They are going to send everybody to the glass and dare you to beat him down the floor Well and that has been a catalyst for the Hookies taking a bite out of this lead Second foul picked up by Harold there as he was whistled for the infraction The last Bach had his man sealed Hammond couldnt get it to him How about this Bordock kept working cheering Difference maker down low The other difference maker The three has gone away to some degree for Eli You got to go all the way back to the 6 and 12 minute mark in the first half for the last made three Theyve missed nine consecutive That will end the trend on Q The first in a while for Elon Yeah an absolute miscommunication on the ball screen right there And Harold found himself wide open And hes got range Remember Harold hit the first two that initiated the threepoint shooting to open the game And heres number 11 Another foul call out top will take us You also see foot and back issues that have some of the key contributors out for the Hokes It has required the individuals on the floor to step up with the depth a bit of a challenge against Elon today Nobody more so than Hansbury coach Yeah hes been the best and keeping it alive on the glass and doing all he can Getting a little bit of a break right here He and Gerak in double figures Heres a takeaway and Johnson takes it the other way for Elon and lays it home Definitely Just an absolute careless turnover Just a gift of two points right there Thatll drive coach Young crazy Well right before the break Elon hit a big three took it back to eight which is exactly where we were at the half And now the lead back to double digits Sincere Jones in form Hanssbury right now cheering Front of the iron And Tamara was in the Hokes cuddle moments ago Tamara coach Mike Young told his team to relax Weve got plenty of time Lets just focus on the next four minutes one possession at a time You guys are doing great Youre getting stops but one thing I want more out of you is being more physical on the glass Thanks Tamara Johnson to the line And that had the potential to cut it back to single digits still have a second coming Some adjustments coming to the personnel grouping as well Yeah Hansbury and Shu come back in along with Pasha A really small lineup now with Tyler Johnson at the four Shu at the three and Pasha and Hammond in the back court If the Hookies can rebound with this lineup it could be good for him on the offensive end The lead nine inside 15 to play Taken away from Harold Pasha will slow it up pulled down by Kley Quick three right there Hanssbury was the only one on the glass Thats thats the issue with a a small lineup If a big is shooting a perimeter shot not much chance to get a second look Post up right there Mismatch Bell at 69 Pasha at 64 65 around and yeah got him on the arm Crowd didnt like it Pasha didnt like it Officials got it right First one his direction So no worries in terms of Pashas status And heres a catch and shoot three from the corner like theyve done it before Kley drains it Yeah Pasha went under the screen instead of over the screen and gave up a wide open three takes it back to double figures as Elon seems to have an answer for everything Virginia Tech provides Hammond trades him though from the corner cheering Virginia Tech can find a way to make some threes that would be huge in trying to cut this deficit Hammond who had a huge game against South Carolina in the overtime win Went for 16 in that 86 83 victory earlier in the year trying to contribute with the Hokes down a handful of key contributors today Thats going to be a tieup Possession arrow is with Virginia Tech So its Hokes basketball Good stop right there for the turnover Theres the out of bounds play special situations Kley good quick reversal right there Got the ball to Hammond Just a second three for the Hokes pass

Virginia Tech Yeah he he has kept Virginia Tech in front of 103000 and the 12th man The Hurricanes get it done Early returns not so bad for the road teams through the first couple of contests in the college football playoff Its a good observation After a year to kick the whole thing off a season ago where no road team advanced the first two road teams win it thus far in 2025 Congrats to Miami of the ACC will have a representative a little deeper into the college football playoffs A road team trying to win one right here Theyve led the whole way Its a six nothing spurt to start it on a couple of made threes by the leading scoreer for Elon Harold who has 16 at this point and Virginia Tech has pulled within one on more than one occasion as they have right now But with 722 to play theyre still looking to tie it or lead it for the first time Theres a lot of basketball left Couple of big runs for the Hokes 110 to end the half 9000 just a few minutes ago for his squad as theyve continued to fight somewhat shorthanded today coach Yeah they have Theyve been battling the whole time And now baseline out of bounds which has been awfully good to Elon This time Virginia Tech does a nice job of taking the primary priority away cheering Johnson with two to shoot uses the glass beautifully What a job to drive in and finish by Demarco Johnson Shot fake Be the second guy off the floor near the basket He was Nice play by Johnson If youre just joining us and havent been with us today Neo Advado Abdales is not playing in this contest Also without Dorne in this contest but working inside here is Gerak got his first start in this one today and hes able to get the job done Yeah hes had a really good game and Hanssbury on the bench for Virginia Tech right now Hope hes hanging in there So without Abdales without Dorne obviously without Low whose impact is tremendous and for right now without Hansberry and Hanssberry down with the four fouls I mean you think about just how shorthanded this team is right now coach Yet you look up and theyre within one Yeah And and battling hard trying to get stops Still not smooth on the offensive end but theyve been able to create some things Good good effort by Hammond right here Paul with a little physicality kind of incidental contact Sure Thats what Coach Young was talking about Well thats how physical we saw things get toward the end of the half And now that its getting closer to crunch time cheering 10 on the shot clock up again Boy what a job he does Backs his defender down there And theres Kusel again Hes been so important today You know you talk about leaders Heres a guy who came in 215 per game leading the CIA among the leaders across the entire mid major ranks Yet hes been somewhat quiet to this point coach Yeah he really has And Coach Taylor talked about how unselfish he is not hunting his shot necessarily just doing what he needs to have done Hookies Well here comes Hanssbury into the personnel grouping Keep in mind hes working with four at the 557 mark Itll be interesting to see if they leave him or try a little offense defense but hes got to be smart Theyre going to attack him for sure on the other end applause He has risen to the occasion in the absence of of Dallas Dorne continues to lead everybody on the Hoke side He returns with that 16 points to pace things Look at the scoreboard again inside six The separation a single point Posasha now in double figures More points than hes had all season Howard Johnson with a huge steal Oh thats a nice play by Elon Shoot Looked like he was going to get a wideopen three They recognized it And think about it on more than one occasion today Shoot has been the guy in a big moment for the Hokes down the right side Just would not go down Guess whos there Hanssbury playing tough with those four fouls Puts it back Questioned who it was going to be cheering was there Virginia Tech out front for the first time today And guess who put them there Offensive glass Hes been doing it all day long We talked about it in the open He and Cutral with 29 apiece coming into this thing And thats been one of the big differences in Virginia Techs comeback effort Could anything be more fitting than Hansbury with the way he has battled today Putting this team out front for the first time in the contest cheering Comes with just over five to play cheering cheering Bodies hit the floor Continuation allowed AND HERES HAMMOND AND ONE cheering Im glad youre doing the playbyplay And if youre wondering can they get it done in an ACC building no further than

out on Hammond Hammond with seven A trio in double figures now Shoot cheering Pasha Gerdak among those out there And of course you know what Hansbury has done today cheering Put Elon in the bonus Thats his music second foul on Pasha on the drive Just a couple on Pasha today Smart play by Carr Recognizing the defense was a little out of position Take off on the dribble Talked about him the other night at Richmond They were a little stagnant offensively He jump started him Scored the first six points of the game Then had a little run in the second half where he did the same thing cheering Carr good on the first Well were looking ahead to our final womens basketball double header of 2025 on the ACC Network music comes your way Monday the 29th Hannah had speaking of Notre Dame

transpiring inside Castle Okis up a single digit looking for more Itll have to happen from the free throw line Yeah Hammond doing a nice job attacking off the dribble You You have to You have to attack this this matchup zone You You cant just pass it around the perimeter Traditional screening doesnt really work but penetration works against any defense That was a third personal picked up by Coutrol there cheering True from the stripe on the first is Hammond got seven on his roster right now Have he picked up a trio or more along the way as things have really tensed up tightened up for this Eline squad that owned some separation earlier this afternoon cheering Playing from a deficit of three now Carr steps back tried the three Perhaps not a bad thought for Harold but it just stuck and stays with the Hokes Yeah it was great effort by him to go get that ball Hookies are going to have to really do a good job on that defensive glass cuz theyre going to continue to attack on every shot Shoot front of the rim Penetration created a decent look at that Wow what a pass What a catch The look ahead by Carr A thing of beauty right there Cant let that that uh wide receiver get behind your safeties Well just throw a football reference in there Well you know its appropriate because Cudrol played cheering and uh in the earlier stages of his career as most of these players do multiple sports along the way Of course we didnt say it His athletic ability across the three minutes and change that were the balance Youll remember the 90 run in the early stages of this second half cheering And the Hoks with the most recent spurt taking the lead for the first time with under six minutes to play And now with three and a half to go Johnson makes one of those to set the lead steady at two I remember cheering all this happening in the second half for Virginia Tech since that late first half run The carryover tremendous and he stepped back across the line An over and back call Going to give it over to Virginia Tech I give Isaiah Pasha a lot of credit there The guy hadnt played an awful lot until the last two games but gets his hand on the ball Puts enough pressure on him A little slippage right there Back court Isaiah Pasha forcing the turnover Hokes have a chance to extend this lead Boy thats a great look right there John were told on camera right on top of it Making sure you can see just how close that was You know this youre reminded on days like this game of inches And here with three and change remaining are the Hokes up by a pair Hanssberry weave through traffic Just couldnt quite lay it on Gosh I think he he thought he was going to have some some uh you know competition there and it was wide open Hanssbury of course still the leading scorer with 18 for Virginia Tech The absence of so many of the key contributors including today have Dallas the distributor who did not go Dorne today who did not go Illness and a back issue both the reasons for that Heres Elon not going quietly into the afternoon No smart play right there Coo against Hanssbury right there Hansbury cant be too physical with him Nice job of getting to that matchup by talked to Ammani Hansberry earlier about why theyre winning through adversity and he said its come down comes down to through these three things Communication playing hard and being together Its nothing about a complex complex offense Its just old school tough basketball And coach Mike Young said in the huddle a few minutes ago he said Do your job and let your teammates do his Today it has also been next man up basketball Okis answering that bell So were dead even between these two with just over two minutes to play Well said it could be a holiday feast this weekend A lot of football some tremendous basketball taking place inside Castle on this Saturday afternoon Elons gone with a small lineup so that they can match up Cutral against Hansbury Four to shoot What a job to take it down the lane by Kley when they needed him most So Spark off the bench continues to do it for Coach Taylor Elon back out front 95 to play Little stop rise and pop from Ben His for Virginia Tech And in their absence the Hokes rising to the occasion battling back to even inside a minute and a half to play Has very matched up against clock check now Well have to watch that one as this cheering as this possession unfolds Kley who had the most recent bucket cheering inside Cutthro when they need him most size advantage Tyler Johnson giving away three or four inches there Elon back out front One minute to play Elons done a nice job of getting to the matchup that they want to Tipped away It will be lost out of bounds Virginia Tech basketball And you know what the Elon bench is thinking right there They wanted a whistle Yeah they they they thought either a foul or their ball going the other way But cheering yeah Johnson needs to be careful right here Hes now attracted the attention of the official Thats a long arm Good oneonone ball defender Hanssberry close enough to lay it home Tied again Boy he really worked his defender down there into close proximity And why not Hansbury who has done so much for Virginia Tech today Yeah thats why we talked about him in the open Hes just such a tough matchup Here he music goes against Kobe He realizes he has a size advantage with not a problem at all Played through whatever contacted You always have contact near the rim None of those are free music Theyre looking at time to make sure with every music second currently precious it reached properly currently at 279 Hansbury with 20 points down music 14 rebounds Appears as if theyre going to run it to music 28 Dont think were going 289 Thatd be something we had never seen before right Overtime

an ACC foe on the road after leading for the majority of this one locked into a tie 72 Pressure from Virginia Tech cheering Gets it in the front court Nice job right there They knew they wouldnt attack necessarily cheering Obviously the shot clock is off Which matchup do you want cheering You got Gerak against Coo down low Virginia Tech basketball with 29 to play Eli will inbound from the baseline Yeah interesting that theyve got Hull in the game and hes taking the ball out of bounds I wouldnt be surprised to see him step inbounds and try to get the basketball back for a shot too cheering Now after seeing Virginia Techs alignment Elon burns a timeout Haha the chess vets cheering Elon looking for the W Too strong and there will be a little more basketball in Blackburg Virginia on the Saturday before Christmas Happy holidays to you Honey Hanssberry with 20 of 14 The other thing you keep in mind related to Hansberry the four personals are charged to his account as well Youve got four players with three fouls and two players with four fouls on the Elon side of things So just another item to tuck away in the back of your mind as we are underway in the overtime between Elon and Virginia Tech First possession to the Phoenix cheering in third overtime for the Hokes this year Two and 0 in that vein to this point They tried to feed Kley cutting down the lane He draws contact Yeah I thought they were ISO and Coorol in the corner because he has liked going oneonone against Gerock but uh an alert pass from Coorol to the back cutting Kley He cut all the way from the top of the key and Muchel saw him and got him the ball and cheering went to the free throw line for a couple where hes really good 81 on the season But this is his first opportunity from the charity strike today He knocks it down giving him eight points in the contest Got to ask you while he completes these coach what did you see from each team that you liked that they can build on coming down the stretch in regulation now that were in the overtime period I think Virginia Tech got some confidence defensively especially but uh they also found a few things that worked on the offensive end but still the best thing that they have going on the offensive end is offensive rebounding Kley knocks down the two free throws putting Elon out front to begin the overtime period Hokeis picked up their first lead in regulation with just under six to play Now theres going to be some discussion Yeah about whose basketball this is Yeah its Yeah he just pointed the wrong direction Everybody calms down It will stay Seven on the shot clock though All the way out top to Hanssbury Now five to shoot Boy handling that pass was one thing Kurtak then is going to work himself to the line That was look what found me for a moment there Yeah Yeah Hes like a wide receiver He caught it with his chest right there But uh but he gets to go to the free throw line and its an innovative creative play by Hammond up in the air What am I going to do Quite the big guy Quite a zip pass if if James Franklins looking for a little help right laughter Really able to work it in there And he may want Gerak too Kurdak rattles it down Well hes got the size you want right Second line number six And a change coming as Click is going to work his way back in for Eli Yeah one of those guys with four fouls coming in on the offensive end Well see if they do a little offense defense right here cheering Well and Kley just picked up his fourth there So three guys with four fouls four guys with three fouls for Elon Its becoming a factor cheering Four of those with four fouls Might become a battle of attrition Yep With between the two sides are on the floor right now So keep an eye on it cheering Hanssbury reached out That will do it it would seem for Hansberry and he has been the leader for Virginia Tech today He departs with this afternoon The line for number music six for a foul shot referenced the absence of of Dallas and Dorne today specifically and you know Lel is going to be such a contributor whenever he returns in ACC plays have been without his services for some time So cheering thought check for one of those guys who shoots almost 50 from three but only 64 from the free throw line cheering works the second one down and it pushes Elon slightly back out front Yeah and they did go offense defense Hes going back out Pettis back in Hole back in Isaiah Posit in a big role right here directing the offense He and Ben Hammond being the decision makers Johnson Beautiful touch That was a nice job of moving the defense multiple times Johnson just seven but a timely basket here cheering Shot clock works to 10 cheering Pokes up one Elon trying to change that tie off the glass Pettis front of the iron from the elbow Theyre just going to get the ball They are They are pursuing the ball when it comes off no matter where it goes Well and very slow working his way from the baseline is Tyler Johnson who just went to the deck at a moment when depth is a major concern And Tyler Johnson appears shaken up Yeah it looks like Sincere Jones is the one going to come in Hes hes played a few minutes tonight A talented young freshman but he hasnt been on the floor during critical minutes of very many games See right here right there like he stepped on Hammonds foot maybe We got great camera work What a nice job by the crew all the way around today to make sure youve been right in the midst of the action Landed on Hammond as you can see there and Tyler Johnson departs to the line One of the leading scorers cheering in all of mid major basketball and you can see why that is the case Such a true shooting stroke from the charity stripe Of course his dad Eric a Hall of Famer at UNCCG one of the great locations for coach Billy Taylor along the way in his journey And he is so true from the free throw line Knocks them both down Puts Elon back out front 7776 Demarco Johnson Such a good defender Hammond dribbles out of trouble and lays it off the glass And put him on his hip took him to the rim shot a little floating right hand semi hook 13 for Hammond Youll remember he scored 16 in that overtime game against South Carolina The 8683 win seems to relish overtime and he has the biggest hokeies basket snorts in recent moments but it is answered by Coutril again Yeah Coutrol one from 1617 ft Thats a tough matchup for Gerak now toward two minutes even in the initial overtime period cheering Just a little too strong from Hammond Thats into the hands of Pettis Sincere Jones got to get on that offensive glass cheering cheering Theres that oneonone corner three No dice Yeah that thats not necessarily what Johnson does well He can make an open three but that probably wasnt the shot that coach Taylor wanted Trailing by one Oh Durock had his man buried Got to get it to him cheering Got to get it to him right there Still got a good look but only getting one look now with Hansbury out of that lineup on that offensive glass And its Harold who pulls down the board You think about what the junior has meant today And talk about his leadership What hes been as a winner He
