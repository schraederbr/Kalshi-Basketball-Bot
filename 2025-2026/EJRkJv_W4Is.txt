171 this season for Duke 60 in conference play Wake Force is 11 and eight and two and four in the ACC And Duke will possess the ball first A near steel for Wake Battle for the loose ball applause and the arrow is going to favor the Demon Deaks Take a look at the starting lineups Miles Kovven Hes the second leading scorer on the team Almost 13 points per game for the Demon Dixon Cameron Boozer fourth in the nation just over 23 points per game And he shoots 59 from the floor Thats fourth in the conference And he leads them in assists and steals as well Does everything so well for the Blue Devils And Wake is going to have to find that second and third scoreer in this game to compliment Harris Pville can be that guy Tom He has been during the course of the year but just has been very inconsistent Schwigger inside for the first two of our game for the Knicks Thatd be another bonus if he can get going Hes not He hasnt scored much for this team Hasnt been a factor inside He only averages just over four points per game for Cooper Schwagger Trying to get it inside to Boozer one power dribble through the double team and he lays it in for Duke Thats the thing thats been impressive about him is his footwork inside along the baseline and bounces out for Cal Miz Yeah Cal Me has tweaked his ankle in the last game which was the low reason for the low production but he has been on a roll prior to that He is a double digit scoreer on average for Wake Forest That goes out of bounds and will be Deacon basketball Before that SMU game um he was averaging 22 and a half points a game And they get a nice screen and anytime you can get the catch the ball in motion youre tough to double team He makes a very decisive quick move inside Boozer scored in double digits every game And nine times this season Mike hes gone for 25 points or more including 35 in a win against Arkansas in late November Along the baseline the kick out Spillers Spillers on target for three And again hes a guy Hes three of 14 coming in Tom from three You take a chance on him but uh those are the open shots that Wake is going to have to knock down Spillers is the third leading scoreer on the team 11 12 points per game And as Mike mentioned just made his fourth three of the season early in this first half Boozer puts it up on the rim Tipped up and in Kunga for Duke Gung but thats his game Throw him a lot Let him go up and catch the ball Hes been a little inconsistent over this last stretch Long distance three is good Juke Harris You know his size really gives you problems Hes very creative with the ball Hes got threepoint range but uh very good if he gets into the lane 49 made threes on the season from Juke Harris and that leads the team in that category Foul on the play inside as Dom Sar tried to get to the rim Spillers in the neighborhood Theres one area where they where Wake Forest has a a slight advantage in this game Its at the free throw line Uh Duke not a great shooting team 70 not bad but uh a a strike for Wake Forest and SAR at 50 Doesnt look like a 50 shooter though Head coach for the Blue Devils John Sh in his fourth season Got his 100th career victory And look at the record in this facility 56 and three at home Yeah Room for improvement though Tom I mean you know come on three losses that works out to 95 people Sh is 42 against Wake Forest but both of those losses coming in Winston Salem straight away at Spillers Another three ball Gman He had three coming in on the season in the first 19 games Now hes got two already And the Deaks have made all three of their attempts from beyond the arc in the first half Boozer trying to force the issue against the triple team He got it back Sent it back out Sar had nowhere to go Evans fosters in to grab it to preserve the possession Stops play You know sometimes you just dont know on a noon start and uh boy but Spiller I you know it probably gave him a huge boost of confidence to come out and knock down that first one Tom And they may have to readjust the scouting a little bit on him Juke Harris picked up that last foul for Wake Forest They go to Boozer and hits the rim on the attempted pass from Kame Sar Elise had to give it up Got it right back Trying to drive down the lane Turn around Cuts up way short Assar actually got a hand on that I think Evans was cut off momentarily by Golden and then a foul is called as we continue here in the opening minutes Its Boozer against the double team and it doesnt stop him And you know thats the thing that makes him dangerous He can step out with 15 to 18 ft put it on the floor and finish How about with his off hand that time It did not take long for Steve Forbes to identify the main issue today against the Blue Devils Were going to double team him Were going to triple team And sometimes Mike its just not enough Well and the great thing is that he is such a good passer Steve Forbes in his sixth season Hes got 103 wins as the head coach of the Geeks Six road wins last season tying a school record Wake Forest went 21 and 11 They were fourth in the ACC They got the double buy but lost to North Carolina in the first game they played at in Charlotte at the ACC tournament The destination this season as well Duke the defending champs at our ACC tournament Knocked away and recovered Schwigger Shot clock is at five Straight away Kov this We said hes been up and down Hes had a 30point game this year A lot of it um sometimes depends on his start Not a great look there for him Hmana into the game for Duke Wheres number 14 in white Boozer crosscourt catch and release Evans Thats a great look And thats the thing You you double team Boozer and theyre going to throw that skip pass in the corner to shooters on the other side Blue Devils yet to connect from threepoint distance Wake is three of four from long range Kelseys you can see Dukes defense under three has gotten a lot stiffer Blue Devils as a team this season by 35 on threepointers That is ninth in the ACC Boozer wants to tee one up but cant knock it down Schwigger had the position Yeah I talk about percentage but uh Duke scores almost a quarter of its points at the free throw line So thats been a real strength They get there a ton Coven driving against two defenders Lost it on the way up Smothered by Boozer and a foul called You know we were talking to John Shire before the game Tom and uh you know he he sent out a text to his team earlier this year that teams were two and nine when they came back from the West Coast like Duke did You know just getting acclimated for the time change Its not something that these guys are used to Last year you look at Steve Forbess team They went out one at Cal one at Stanford and then one also in a trip down to Dallas and lost each of the games coming back cheering Dont forget game two coming up after us CW courtside Saturday Virginia Tech and Louisville In fact Louisville was the opponent last year in the title game in Charlotte Mike for these Duke Blue Devils Well you know and it seems like Pat Kelsey every year I mean he had a fabulous year last year but hes had to fight through injuries and kind of keep his team afloat hes been able to do that Um you know theyre certainly going to be a factor when they get completely healthy Yeah the Cards will be here Monday And Virginia Tech has just had some heartbreaking losses Although this week they did go to the dome and win on the road which is not an easy place to get a victory Boozer tries the other side And once again another miss But if if youre going to if youre going to settle for something with him thats the shot that you want to give Harris misses Tapped around Duke has it Bendy trying to get to the rim Double teams Contact in the paint A foul called Blue Devils now just one of their last six shooting trailing 137 Well thing to keep an eye on too thats Blakes fourth team foul So three more and Duke will be getting to the free throw line Thats what theyre aggressiveness does You draw those early fouls you get into the bonus a little earlier in the half Substitution for Wake Omaha Paloo comes in Zero in black and old goal Kaitton Boozer battle truck for Kaitton applause Yeah hes hes really progressed nicely this year in that backup role at point guard inside for the digs Well defended by Cameron Boozer Mason was turned back Many had to give it up Trying to establish position An immediate double D Shot clock is at six Kaden dribbles into the Wake D Cannot calculate the angle and its scooped up by Wake Forest and Mai Mason Well Wakes big double team really cut down Boozers vision He couldnt see the opposite corner and thats why they had to settle for a tough shot That is five straight misses for Duke Spillers the midrange He needs to back it out to the threepoint distance Mike cheering Too close You saw it was an awkward distance though Yeah but you also you could see too the attention to detail Well there are you know theyve got to lock in on him and and you know quiet him down Both teams at 36 shooting as Spillers deflects that one out of bounds and it will remain with Duke And you know to to tap finish up on that point I as a player especially in the in the NBA it was very tough to travel west to east You know you you losing that time They John said they got back at 4 in the morning from the from the West Coast Takes you a while They It was fortunate for them They had a week to recover Missed by Gumba Wait werent you on the charter flights Mike Uh only for my last four years I flew commercially for the first 10 Thank you very much Sometimes inside Schwigger Foul called Willie Brown was defending won and they had about 15000 people in the building and we lost in overtime Came back here had that ceremonian game and won in overtime by the same score Amazing Gman had 29 points 19 rebounds seven assists for the OT win against Clemson back in 1980 Seven blocks Seven blocks and seven assists right Oh my team My teammates would be stunned if I had seven assists on the year If you pass it into me Yeah probably not coming back out Everything disappears Light matter everything Dukes still cannot find the range from long distance It goes out of bounds Its Wake Forest basketball right now Tom Duke really needs to concentrate in getting into the lane area getting to the rim getting fouls Theyre 0 of6 from behind the ark Four of seven everywhere else They are not a bad threepoint shooting team 35 ninth in the conference and they make over nine per game on average fifth best in the ACC for Duke And that was their big strength in this in the West Coast run And then talk about unexpected scoring from guys and uh you know Schwagger has got four quick points So you know he and Spillers have gotten them off to this quick start Schwaker above a season average with his scoring production of the first half Itll stay with two right now Wake has its largest lead Mike well and this you know sometimes great players do this They make things available to other people and and early on you know those two have gotten lost and uh you know just a great look inside Blue Devils right now 31 as a team Steve Forbes having a quick discussion there with Tony Padilla along that sideline off the inbounds Gumba on a rim fender for Duke Yeah we told him its its his game like Derek Lively here a few years ago Runs the floor gets to the rim just throw it up high and let him go get it Race with the ball on the weak side out of bounds and back to Duke This is tough They they fake the pass to the wing and thats just thats just really too easy from an inbounds play Just that little screen Mike that Evans set Well and and also Gungba faked outside He had his hand out thinking All right hes going to be the release in the corner and then just got a perfect screen Gungba is the third leading scoreer on the team Almost 11 points per game had a thunderous deuce at this end just a moment ago Evans hesitation and drive stumbles down wrestled for the basketball and the arrow will favor the new Blue Devils Got tied up with Mason and Evans is a guy they need to get going Hes been fabulous especially in league play is up the scoring average to 20 per All of the Duke field goals so far as they trail by five have come in the paint See what they do on this inbounds Evans along the baseline against three defenders nowhere to go Scooped up and kept alive Sar shot clock at three Boozer must shoot A little old school runner that did not hit the rim Shot clock violation against Duke And they tried to get him aware And you know for Boozer youre out front You should be able to see the clock Now this is Schweer again Actually there were three guys who converged on that play Great defensive help on the drive Gungbos got some blood Got a cut on his hand somewhere He and his teammates have won six in a row defeated Stanford last Saturday 80 to 5th But Duncan Tim Duncan never lost in this building Four came here four times Came away with four Ws That was the last win for Wake back in 97 Tim Duncan Tyler Hanssbro the only other player in modern times or recent memory to do that Caleb Foster picks up the foul Junior from Harrisburg North Carolina Blue Devils 0 for seven from beyond the arc Three of seven on threepointers for Wake Forest Spillers has two of those made threes The shot clock is at eight Schwagger show and go against Boozer Hesitation move Schwigger against Boozer Yeah I just you know its its fine to lock in and take the primary scorers out and thats what youre you know defensively thats what youre focused on but credit wakes third fourth and fifth scorers who have stepped up Sweeters got seven points to lead the way and Duke gets a dunk at the other end from Brown applause Malik Brown he just makes winning plays for this team So good defensively cheering Easy rebound for Sar Foster trying to get to the rim Got tied up It was fouled by Akens Yeah And then you know his ability we havent seen that much from him to create off the dribble But then again all eyes just locked in on Cameron Boozer and those are the passes that he makes extremely well trying to attack the rim of the baseline and a foul as Sar had ahead of Steve and he got bumped in midair mind you by Mason Well in the last few possessions Duke has really tried to attack the basket build their offense from inside out Steve Forbes two and eight against Duke as the head coach and 0 and five in this building Your favorite board games are now your favorite game shows All new seasons of Tribute Pursuit hosted by Lavar music Burton and Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson are on now every Thursday 87 central right here on the CW Tell you I mean you look at I said the number 50 but sometimes you look at a player and say thats not a 50 shooting form And Sar looks very comfortable at the line front rim on the three Khaliz cheering Wake lost at home on Tuesday against SMU Quickly in transition for Foster and its an 82 run and a TMU at home this week He had four points and two rebounds in 23 minutes and thats been his average Thats about what hes done Hes been in the starting lineup a couple times recently He has not hit double digits in scoring all season although he has done it 50 times in her career He spent two years the Val Perezo program Sar picked up the foul his second for Duke Harris the miss Spillers keeps it alive And thats a big foul that Duke picked up because Sar has been guarding Harrison Hes done a decent job on him Galmese angling to the rim over the defender They needed to get him going He had not scored up to that point in the game Oh of four before his last game Tweaked his ankle against SMU Didnt play the second half but was averaging 22 and a half in the four games before that had just four points in the game against the Mustangs A loss for Wake Forest this week at home Still looking for a made three Sar got it back to keep it alive And now Boozer makes his way to the rim Sar cleans up the mess Nobody there blocking him out He had a great run at it from the weak side Five points for Sar the freshman from Oso Italy They go inside Spillers cant handle them How about that In the I dont know if that was in the scouting report as Schwer lobed to Spillers inside of seven minutes to go in our first half Boozer teing up a three ball Follow jam Its Evans for Duke And thats the thing thats really bailed Duke out in this game to this point First lead but the offensive rebounds second six of them Sar on the run tried to kick it out KME ends up with it for Wake COVEN FROM THE CORNER COVEN RIPPING ropes for the Knicks That way he is capable of a big game As a matter of fact he was the name that John Shy brought up in our pregame talk with him about hey you know we cant overlook this guy Hes got a 33point game on his resume this season Boozers got the three Purdue And the first main three of the game comes with inside of six minutes to go All right so both teams have shaken off the winter chill from outside cheering Harris had nowhere to go Spillers on the block BACKING IT DOWN AGAINST BOOZER AND Spillers wins the fight Well its right there I mean there was no chance to double team You catch the ball with both feet in the paint and good things are going to happen 19 points for Spillers in the home loss against SMU on Tuesday 9179 Eight points now for Spillers in the first half down for Duke One for 10 on the year coming in Sure why not Lets have Malik Brown and Trayvon Spillers have a threepoint contest Second year of the program for Brown after two years at Syracuse He makes the defensive play Foster Boozer Itll fall AND THE FOUL BOOZER TO THE FREE THROW LINE cheering Heres the play and and actually Malik Brown gets the block to start this very unselfish play Cameron Boozer runs the floor extremely well and so good finishing with either hand Yeah thats uh seniors would be happy in those with those numbers back in the day but thats a freshman Completes the old school threepoint play And the largest lead for Duke is at five right now inside of 5 minutes to go in our first half of play 264th all time meeting Schwigger hustled cheering inside by GBA knocked away Foster trying to work around the screen to Gungbo Twisting attempts up on the rim and Kovven emerges with it Kovvin had it knocked away by Boozer Foster an alley to the rim Its been Dukes team Its not only the turnovers but where theyve been happening for Wake Forest Theyve been out front above the three their own threepoint line cheering Those turn into automatic points Six turnovers for Wig seven points for Duke Dung by the position flusterous Overall its a 217 run late in this half cheering Inside the open man is Jimena And the run is now 237 Yeah theyre going to really cheat on him and try to force overplay him in the outside It was a good back cut Quick shot at the other end by Wake Deaks now four of 13 on threepoint tries Two of 11 for Duke from threepoint real estate Make it three of 12 Its not the play its whos running it And when you have a pick and roll with Boozer and Isaiah Evans it was in Charlotte Thats where were going this year as well after Duke won it last year also in Charlotte Wake looking for some sort of response and theyll get it with a threepointer from Mason Yeah And you know the thing and Steve Forbes talked about it with us beforehand about you know theyve been getting some good looks They just havent been knocking down shots And today a much different story Deon shot bounces out Boozer able to keep it alive And again second chance opportunities for Duke And then you know its rare that a that a big man has a positive assist to turnover ratio but Boozer does and you see why Third assist of the game for Kevin Boozer Leads the team in that category this season Perimeter work by Wake They end up with a three from the other side this time Beloo for second chances are keeping Duke in the game right now The threepoint shooting for Wake 15 of their 24 attempts have been from beyond the arc Theyve made six Same combination again Besa down the lane But Id you know I almost think that Steve Forbes would prefer that to them getting on fire from behind the threepoint line Three of 12 on threes in the first half for Duke Gungook backing down on Schwagger held his ground committed the foul with 134 to go in the first half Yeah heres the look And then they actually it was a real it was a late double team which allowed Gumba to come in right behind it and then really good movement of the basketball You know the guys who havent been big threats are going to get good looks and then you know for Duke I you know for if Im Wake Forest I Im packing it inside and saying you know try to beat us over over the top Schwigger picked up the foul for the deeps Gungas at the free throw line 67 On the season 13 points in the win at Stanford last Saturday Its been a week off for Duke after the trip out to California Wins against the Bears and the Cardinal Just the one loss this season Yeah Out against Stanford Cameron Boozer had 20 points in the first half Stanford had 19 as a team That was a huge 30point lead against Stanford for Duke Gung by the onehanded rebound Kayen to Cameron on the double team Evans was thinking about pulling the trigger there Evans has made a three in the first half Boozers offline into the corner and out of bounds near the Wake bench It will be Demon Deaks basketball Coming up on the halftime show presented by Subaru Love what makes Subaru Subaru Check out whats happening around the ACC this weekend A preview of our next game Virginia Tech Louisville with Tom Brad and Brian Oliver Well talk about the triple header coming up next weekend as well All in the Subaru halftime report 45 seconds to go in the first half cheering All the way across balloon Venuss uncontested rebound from Kaden Boozer About a sixse second difference game and shot despite the struggles from threepoint distance Mike 50 shooting as a team in the first half for Duke A lot of close range buckets Fmenya tease it up Gumba right back out to Evans Three ft behind the line INTO THE CORNER ONE LAST chance on an 186 run to take the 11point lead against Wake as the Knicks put it in play And we crank up the second half cheering on CW Courtside Saturday Well lets see what Duke does If Harris can come alive for Wake Forest they did a nice job blanketing him in that first half against Stanford Our is one of the other leading scorers in the league They held him 14 points below his average Coleman behind the back dribble and spin Attempted follow by Harris who came flying in It was Evans who was defending on Coven Sar picked up the foul Third on Sar and thats a big early foul for Wake Forest cuz he has been the primary defender on Drew Harris cheering Harris third in the conference in scoring has the first the fastest growing cheering Hes a cop shes a con together Theyre unstoppable CWs hit series Wild Cards returns with an all new season Dont miss Wild Cards season premiere season 3 Monday 87 central right here on the CW Lets see for Harris if he gets going getting to the free throw line Another good look Third attempt of the offensive glass Gunga for Duke I think he just wanted to pad his rebounding stats a little bit Tom and uh didnt score initially but boy boozer doing a nice job finding people there you see almost a triple team but uh in gang doom what you should do if your guy leaves the double team follow him right to the rim second foul on Schweer 67 for the stripe on the season for Patrick Gunga the sophomore from Manasses Virginias also the second leading rebounder on the team just over six per game for Gunga Hes got five rebounds in this game He is the leading scoreer for Duke with 12 after the free throw Turnaround from Harris No good Its Its interesting that John Sh some guys would have taken their guy out with three fouls and hes trusting Sar to play with those three fouls in defending Boozer on target for three straight away And thats a bad sign for Wet Forest if he gets going from out there A miss from the corner Coleman Boozer The clearance 13 points now for Boozer The drive and bucket from Caleb Foster And the lead is 12 to 17 Boy you know I just love the way he has not forced anything in this game Hes just taken the drives when they presented themselves Schwagger Young behind for the board Coven tries to tie him up unsuccessfully Second shot second half shots are you normally a little tougher than first half Spiller held his ground took it away from Boozer Harris drew three defenders got it out to Cal Mason It bounces out and Gunga has the rebound Foster wants to slow it down for the Blue Devils cheering in the midst of an 80 run as we start the second half Opening moments Gongba had it knocked away by Spillers and out of bounds you know against great players and you have to give a you know you got to make choices and the way hes been shooting threes you got to test them from there but he knocks that down and that just a a great crossover move against Cvin in the half court Boozer has a couple of made threes in the game Evan stepping back but I but I hope Gongba is taking Cameron Boozer out to dinner after this game is over the way hes gotten buckets in this in this game Four assists in the game for Cameron Boozer Thatll bounce over the rim and in the Deaks needed that one desperately from Cooper Schwagger Another unexpected both both guys for Wake for three Schwagger is the only Wig player in double digits in scoring Try to defend Boozer and its hard to do Well again the choice No double team coming that time Boozer Look he he takes a look He sees nobody coming Go to the middle and then drop in And the ability to finish with both hands left and right serves him on either side of the floor So either you double team and you leave somebody open on the outside or you play him oneonone and he does that Amazing how quiet over 9000 fans can be Its another sellout I never liked that I like to like the noise when I free throw I didnt like quiet How about 550 consecutive sellouts for the Blue Devils here at Cameron Indoor Stadium their home since 1940 So Sar comes out of the game Hes got four personal fouls now And lets see if if this gives Harris a little bit of an opening Sar has done such a great job defensively on him We showed you earlier coach Sh is 56 and3 in this building on this floor Coach Ken doing a nice job cheering staying in front 48 seconds on the shot clock cheering Wake has lost three of its last four Looking for a comeback Schwigger attacking the rim Well you know if youre if youre looking for positives I mean going forward this is the game that maybe Schwigger is one he builds confidence on Hes having a terrific afternoon 12 points on 507 shooting Evans lost it at the last second Spillers took it away and the outlet comes nowhere to go against Boozer cheering Harris trying to get in rhythm Stumbles at the free throw line Shot clocks at seven Spillers got it back somehow to Harris against Boozer And Boozer fouls Harris late in the shot clock by one Coming off a 3014 rebound performance at Stanford a week ago both of those numbers game high and he was 12 of 17 from the floor in the win against the Cardinal Juke Harris is at the free throw line Sophomore from Salsbury North Carolina Hes a guy that again theyve had SAR on him defensively and SAR in foul trouble right now So that could be an issue And really Harris has been kind of sneaking back into this game at the free throw line Hes an explosive scorer Mike Backtoback games against Miami and North Carolina 56 points in those two games And he had 27 in the loss to SMU this week at home And he he really has forced the issue this afternoon Tom I mean you know some guys are big time scorers get a little twitchy and start forcing shots but hes been pretty patient So Belaloo comes in for Schwiger Picked up his fourth personal foul Hes the leading scorer for Wake now on the bench with 12 points Out of the corner Java playing horse out there He had ordinary defender in the same zip code The freshman from Los Angeles 18th made three of the season and the fifth in the game for Duke up by 16 Harris knocked away Boozer talk about this team really charts deflections And speaking of Duke and theyve been really good steals deflections in this game working on a 25game home winning streak Coven boxes out for the rebound cheering Dukes won 12 in a row at home against ACC opponents Thats a three from Harris Maybe that gets him going Mike Yeah thats the thing and and I I talk about it in games from time to time about getting into a rhythm at the free throw line and you know nobody guarding you you just feel very comfortable and then all of a sudden your jump shot opens up for you 50 made threes on the season now for Jude Paris and that leads the team Boozer on the entry over the defender balloon You know I talk about getting the ball in motion and for a big guy its really important and Boozer does a great job of that So difficult to defend Harris again found the hot spot We touched on him in the open was very quiet in the first half but Juke Harris starting to heat up Trying to get weak back into this one And a turnover Harris hell jam it AND ITS THE JUKE HARRIS SHOW MIKE OVER the last couple minutes I mean he you know scorers are going to get their numbers and uh it took him a little while to get going but especially you know you give him an easy layup like that Hmena turned down the threepointer Gave it off for a three And its money from Darren Harris Well I mean both Harris and Jmena have gotten wide open looks but they paid them off J Carris has the last 10 points for Wake Forest They work it to the corner and they get a three out of Omaha Belaloo Give Wake Forest a lot of credit in this game so far Just coming up on 12 minutes that uh every time Duke looks like theyre getting ready to really stretch things out Wake has had an answer Coven had a block on the driving Foster trying to get it back and a foul called Itll go against the Blue Devils And Wake Forest now Mike has made 10 threepointers in the game on 25 tries which was going to be a necessary stat for them coming into this game They make about nine per game Mike which is sixth for the ACC but their percentage overall near the bottom at 33 for the body of work this season Well and frankly too I mean we talk about the defensive job on on um on Harris but Schwagger has stepped up into the learn you know hes filled the void and kept them in this game He is on the bench right now though Mike with the four personal fouls Well and they were they were Trinity College back then They were not Duke and cheering you know that yeah this series goes back to 05 06 not 209 founded as Trinity College in 1838 Duke on the run Kaden Boozer tied up on the way to the basket in a foul ball Do you think those two have run a couple of twoman breaks in their time together Cameron Boozer four time state champs The Boozer brothers Kaden Boozer at the free throw line 73 of the season He averages 6 and a half points per game The fastest growing cable news network in all of television is NewsNation NewsNation respects all Americans and is music news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom The headline in this game an 11point halftime lead for Duke after Wake had led by seven earlier in the first half behind Juke Harris Wake trying to make a move here midway through the second half with inside of 11 and 12 minutes to go This is Harris 15 points in the game right now for Juke Harris who had just three in the first half on a main threepoint bucket Hes got 10 of the last 13 points for Wake And aside from that breakaway layup uh hes had some tough looks Hes made some good jump shots cheering Mason gave it up Spillers shot clock is inside of 10 Akens around the edge Harris got it away late in the clock Cameron Boozer has another rebound He mistakes it in the other corner and followed that play all the way the other side of the floor to get a look Six rebounds in the game now for Cameron Cruzer at 18 points He leads all scorers Notice that a lot of the players been slipping at both ends of the floor Well again we touched on him in the open and averaging 20 points a game And this is why he was very quiet first half Tom Only three points but has really gotten things going here in the second An easy breakaway layup and it really started for him at the free throw line in this half Travis is four of four from the line in the game for Wake Cluster out of the com Harris for three Long rebound Brown got it Looking for Boozer for the doublefisted jam You know its amazing If there is a loose Brown and Malik Brown is anywhere near it like on that play hes going to get his hands on it Um you know it leads this team in deflections We talked about that stat earlier but uh from the long rebound and this is a you know normally its a good time to get a three but it also the defense was scattered and Boozer just was all alone Harris into the paint Got a bump from Foster on his hip Yeah theyre switching up and theyre theyre giving Harris some different looks defensively and hes got a little bit of a size advantage over Caleb Foster but not much Thats the thing thats its sneaky about this Duke team Theyre second tallest team in the country just because they have nobody on the roster who is shorter than 64 Evans just picked up that foul for Coach SH his second And uh again a nice nice uh a good thing for Wake Forest to get into the early bonus here 10 minutes to go Harris whos been to the free throw line 145 times this season Mark Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands So glad that youre with us And Tom hes had double figure free throw attempts six times this year which is really ridiculous But thats well thats the ability to not only shoot threes but put the ball on the floor as well draw contact Harris has 12 of the last 15 points for Wake Foster Boozer one power dribble to the basket got his own miss and let it in And a foul on the play Just 14th offensive rebound for Duke Staying with it He just beat everybody off the floor on a second effort Spillers picked up his third personal to put Boozer at the free throw line with 22 points Three for three on free throws Hes earned himself a breather on the John Sh bench This is the time you got the media under eight coming up But uh with Boozer out an opportunity to kind of hang in there for Wake Forest And this is what they want If they can do this if they can slow the game down make it ugly get to the free throw line it be a great game plan for the last nine and a half minutes Thats the fourth foul on Foster as Steve Forbes looks on Well you see you see the problem that Juke Harris poses for you defensively Dame Sar sitting on dem Sar sitting on the bench with four fouls Now Foster has four fouls That was Brown who threw it off below out of bounds Duke ball This is Harris missed the free throw Foster to the bench We showed you a moment ago 26 in a row at this venue for Duke against visiting Wake Forest The last win in the series for Wake was February of 2024 They beat Duke at home 8379 The last win here January of 97 8169 Wake it Havent won since So Mason has picked up his second personal Mena on the inbounds Kaden Boozer has four points in the game One of two for the floor A couple of free throws as well His brothers on the bench with 23 points Gumba at the rim Foul called but he should have a play that he should have finished Yeah you if you give up the baseline in this situation theres no way help can come and you know you got to try to force him back to the middle somehow But again that that good quick move you just get there If any kind of double team is coming you beat it 13 points now for Gunga And dont forget game two of CW courts Saturday Mike Young and Virginia Tech on their road to take on Pat Kelsey in the Louisville Cardinals KFC Yum Center Just wishing everybody safe travels and being safe over the next few days cheering This game moved from 545 to noon because of the impending weather Three of five now from the line for Gunga 6953 Duke in front trying to win their seventh game in a row and improve their record to 181 and 70 in conference play at the top of the standings Knocked away by Brown Mason was driving for week Those are just the little things that he does out on the floor Thats tough You know I knew with threepoint shooting there are longer rebounds Evans all the way to the basket and the largest lead of the game for the Blue Devils and Evans doing a good job The three wasnt going so he decided to go to the rim Spillers off target This may be in the timeout range You know Steve Forbes you may be trying to get underneath eight but Brown got it back Twoman game Evans balloon bumped Evans as he hit the deck How about 15 offensive rebounds for Duke as Brown knocks this one away music And then Isaiah Evans all the way to the rim Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State music And that that lead this extension came with him on the bench as well Evans at the free throw line for Duke Sophomore from Fagville North Carolina 88 free throw shooter Thats the best on the team Had the gamewinning shot against Florida in early December in the ACC SEC challenge That was right here on Coach Kort Shot clock is at 10 for Wake taken by Kaden Boozer Amena couldnt handle a pass Just a count too early that time Theyve gone and sold out Luckily broke up the uh the play on the other end cheering 41 as a team for the floor of the game for Wink Very early in this half they cut the lead to nine Spillers look for the monster jam and didnt get it Well you know I I looked at him and he was looking for the defensive help and rather than concentrating on finishing the play deflected out of bounds off weight You can see him when he goes up here hes kind of looking around and just completely misjudged it Duke has his largest lead of the game at this juncture inside of 7 minutes to go in regulation 7353 after leading by 11 at halftime Evans back to Boozer Cameron on the offensive glass Kaden missed Cameron didnt Yeah Beloo just couldnt he couldnt block him out Nice job forcing him under the rim Easy conversion Second chance opportunities Beloo Brown might have got a piece of balloon on the way up This just game one of CW courtside Saturday game two Mikel Brown Jr returns for the Louisville Cardinals We talked about it Tom that you know theyve been injured and hes been a huge part of it Another freshman having an outstanding season but Google needs him to come back desperately cheering taking on Virginia Tech which has lost some excruciating games at the buzzer including a Boopy Miller midcourt shot Yep And Boopy used to wear the colors of Wake Forest in the ACC After the free throws Belaloo will go to the Steve Forbes bench Steve Forbes the ACC coach of the year back in 2022 Won 25 games 13 in the ACC 182 at home Theyre on the road today And uh in his stint at Wake Forest has done as well in the portal as getting great players Salis Applebee Alis Williams the list goes on Players of the year Boozer whistle prior to the jam by Brown So that is the fifth on Schwagger Mikey had 12 points today on five of seven shooting Hes been disqualified Fifth personal foul Certainly a bright spot for Steve Forbes today Well and thats you know I was saying that earlier that this is maybe a game for him to build it on Hes shown a little leadership over on the sideline but uh to kind of break out and say Hey I can be a factor offensively for this team Hes certainly a veteran player playing in his 84th game in college this afternoon Hell leave the game with the five personal fouls Boozers at the free throw line 10th time this season 25 points or more as a freshman in a Duke uniform Hes in some elite company And this is Yeah and weve talked about it too those two at the top of the list in the same year Who do you lock in on Um but for Boozer hes gotten much more efficient at the free throw line 2019 Duke was ACC tournament champs as they were last year Theyve won it 23 times the most of any ACC program Spillers came up short Fight for the loose ball Harris squeezes up the shot Brown ended up with it all the way to the final four last year for Duke under John Sh now in his fourth season as one of the more decorated players to come through Durham Beloo third personal You know youre getting old when you call games of the fathers who are sitting in the stands watching their sons play But Carlos a great player here remember the 2001 national championship team A win against Arizona in the title game Mike in Minneapolis By the way Mike the Final Four this year is in Indianapolis Yeah its uh it has served this school well Um its interesting you know I I think that Cameron has got a little bit more of a face up game than his father Can put it on the floor a little bit better last national title back in 2015 in a win against Wisconsin in the title game at Lucas Oil Stadium Wake Forest has not made a field goal in over 7 minutes Aens midrange round the board John Sh got to 100 wins as the head coach at Duke Fastest of any coach in ACC history He did it in 122 games Gman Yeah you go you win 95 of games at home and you can get there a little bit quicker than most Got number 100 m in December You know its one its its really hard and then knocking down the three is bel Its not easy to follow a legend and you know we see that with Jim Beaheim and uh up in up in Syracuse but to follow Mike Shasheesky here and the coach at your alma mada is not is not an easy thing either And John has handled it really well Freshman season uniform and for the season Mike he shoots close to 60 from the floor Its outrageous Might even be salacious HARRIS STRAIGHTAWAY three for Juke Yeah Yeah And hes uh he has quietly got snuck back up and almost getting to his season average So Juke Harris has 20 points His season average 205 which is third in the ACC It was a slow start for Harris inside Evans behind the back line of the week again with him with a threepoint shooter I mean you got to pick what youre going to do and you want to youre going to pressure out on the threepoint line Hes hes done a decent job taking what the defense has given him Evans is the third Blue Devil to get to double digits and score against Belaloo Misses close to the basket I mean Mike we told you what Wake was up against Duke the number five team in the nation 171 on a sixgame winning streak They won 13 in a row against ACC opponents and 28 of the last 29 against teams in this league Well and I think too the the real impressive number and it started in the preseason with the finish in there with Foster Theyre 8 and one in quad one games Lethala weapon three Brians a former ACC tournament MVP playing for Bobby Kre our friend and colleague And you know Bobbys watching from somewhere as Duke is closing in on its 18th win of the season Just over two and a half minutes to go in regulation So glad youve been with us Tom Wormy Mike Jimky the allAmerican from Duke and our outstanding CW production team led by executive producer Robley director Ken Neil off the edge of the rim That might be this game in a nutshell for Rick Forest Especially second half theyve gotten in There have been some missed dunks some missed layups missed opportunities inside the omination for the effort this afternoon for the Blue Devils Cameron Boozer 32 points 11 of 20 from the floor Hes made threepointers Hasnt missed the free throw nine rebounds and four assists I got to take a breather after all that Mike Yeah I know Its a Its a great fantasy league pickup if you can get it Just an amazing talent Well and you know and Ive said this and Danny Ferry is in the crowd today and uh you know that sons of guys who play pro ball have a little bit of an edge I mean he just learns stuff that you know the normal kids dont learn and you know hes grown up with it Um and you know especially having a a father who who plays a lot like you so much of a big edge scored 30 a week ago at Stanford and then 32 today against Wake Forest This the only meeting between the teams this season Mike the big thing on both of those games out west is they hold them in the 50s you know So and John SH was talking about getting back and and playing Duke defense which theyve done here in the second half Mike you were talking about the quad one victories Duke is 61 against ranked opponents this season as well That only loss was late December Texas Tech now the number 12 team in the nation at Madison Square Garden And in that game they were like zero for 100 from the free throw line you know and they lose by one So Wake also played Texas Tech this season and lost So Monday night Louisville which is part of our CW courtside Saturday double header against Virginia Tech coming up And then Virginia Tech on the road Castle Coliseum BC North Carolina Pit and uh tie you know a little actually the moving the game to noon on Saturday gives them some more rest going into Mondays game Blue Devils will remain perfect in the league and at home Theyll be 9 and0 on Coach K 30 in conference play cheering Technically 60 on the road because the game against Texas Tech was neutral court Madison Square Garden What a season the Blue Devils who went to the national semifinals last year before losing in a close game to Houston in San Antonio Texas Final minute for Cameron Indoor Stadium Spillers for Wake Well Im really glad that they let the students come in from Siberia last night Would have been cold in those tents Kaden Boozer is fouled on his way to the basket Yeah but they were back out there very early this morning as we showed you at the beginning of the broadcast We were Mike and I were handing out coffee and donuts like the USO running laughter out there So the Blue Devils putting the finishing touches on this victory 18th of the season 181 Heres what we got for Wake They are on the road couple of home games Theyll travel to Georgia Tech NC State and Louisville NC State what a victory during the week after they lost at home against Georgia Tech last Saturday They go to Clemson and hand the Tigers their first home loss of the season How can you figure it out Gman Yeah No its its been a little crazy down a little down the uh down the roster but again to remind people that game we have next week on this on this air going to be honoring Rodney Rogers It is a triple header next week on CW Courtside Saturday Two womens games on Sunday as that goes out of bounds off of Duke and Jack Scott in there number 20 in white Scott spent three years in the Princeton program and a timeout on the court with 188 to go So in the series Duke will continue its dominance Again you have to go back to 1997 to find that last win for Wake here in Durham Dont forget Virginia Tech Louisville right after the conclusion of this game Well and I you know Im again Im a traditionalist and Im going to be sounding like my grandfather but I you know its a shame that these guys only play once this year And you know for Wake Forest their games versus Duke and Carolina both on the road so they dont get to see those The people at home dont get to see those games Teams played twice last year in Winston Salem and here in Durham Both wins for the Blue Devils at the end of the shot clock Thats a bucket from a corner and Harris Wake did everything it could to try to stay with Duke today Mike But in the end Cameron Boozer too much He and his teammates will get the victory Boozer leads the way with 32 points 90 69 Duke overweight and also Patrick Gong about having a nice
