Lee Cassell and Mark Schneer with Cal State Fullerton in the navy blue and SMU in the white Tip one back by 72 Cemetu and two of the most highpowered teams in the nation matching up today What do you expect from the defense of Fullerton today Well it looks like Fullerton starting manto man A little bit surprising because theyre so much smaller than SMU But how about that start for the Mustangs Cory Washington who had a under performance in the Mustangs victory over Central Arkansas when he only scored four for the entire game Well Titans have taken a look at this lineup so far this year This has been their lineup most of the year Ward Williams and Koffield at the guard spots along with Da Cruz Manro and then Duna on the inside Theyll take a lot of threes Bryce Koffield comes up short the freshman but an offensive rebound by Mouse Williams sticks it out for another rim down three by De La Cruz Manro and a third crack for the Titans John you said they take a lot of threes but the key is they make a lot of threes 49 in their last two ball games Yeah they made 16 last time out on the road at OSU Out to the corner captain shoot by Mouse Williams who made six of them Hes in and out 0 for three on that opening trip up the floor for Cal State Fullerton The SNU starting lineup as Gerrodon Pierre takes the corner three is in and out Edwards Miller Pierre and Washington with Sam at Yigolu on the inside fight for that ball and the Titans come out with it Titans had great ball movement on their opening possession Of course it didnt hurt to get three offensive rebounds All good shots all threes Cal State Fullerton theyre averaging 103 points a game over their last three got in a big hole on the road at Stillwater a week ago but came back made it a onepoint game several times in the second half Deep two is way off by Bryce Koffield Good defensive start for SMU Yeah good block out by Yigulu that time to get the Mustangs transition started BJ Edwards one of the starting guards for SMU Washington bottled up Hits Poopy Miller in the corner His shot was blocked by one of the best defenders in the Big West this year Josh Ward Yeah good reaction by Ward coming over there and getting his finger tip on that shot by Boofy Miller His fifth block of the season Ward dashes baseline all the way to the cup Cant get it to go Slow start for the Titans Lets take a look at the keys to the game coach Well Fullerton says they must get better defensively so put stops together and they got to take care of the ball SMU averages eight steals per game SMU needs to dominate in the paint much bigger and theyve got to get to the charity stripe often Second straight game for Cal State Fullerton where they have started slow but theyre capable of you know John they have started slow but the key is theyve gotten very good shots And how about Washington now Two out of two from the field to start the game Theyre one of the best teams in transition in the nation Ward gets cut off Extra little pass and its slapped away underneath Credit Edwards with that steal And here comes Miller out TO EDWARDS BACK DOOR PIERRE STUFFS IT BOY what beautiful transition basketball by the Mustangs Run hard and youll get rewarded Two great transition teams SMU top 40 in the nation in transition points as music again Ward misses on the way to the hole Yeah both ball clubs averaging 89 points a game Mustangs on fire to start Their running game has never been better this year Great start Timeout called by Dedrick Taylor music and the Cal State Fullerton Titans SMU starts with a 100 run to this game music music before conference game begins So its that grind time to get all of those nonconference wrinkles out And both coaches said that theyre trying to do so today by improving on defense Both teams are averaging 90 points per game so neither team has any issues scoring Coach Enfield said the Mustangs need to see more consistency and intensity on the defensive end And Coach Taylor echoed that same focus emphasizing that defense is the missing piece to match their productive offense So John and Jim teams both have to prove that they can score already but today is about who can lock in defensively Thats exactly right Bri and coach Howard SMU got off to a great start against UCA a week ago but then got a little bit discombobulated defensively at the end of the first half as a threepointer goes down for BJ Edwards Great offense Boopy Miller hits it Well you started beautifully on both ends of the floor Their defense intensity is better than I saw it last Sunday against Central Arkansas carrying over to the offensive end as we see coach Enfield encouraging his ball club Andy Enfield uh said that during the last game that SMU was much better in the first few minutes of the second half Threepointer from out front Hard off the heel by De La Cruz Mangro Well De La Cruz Mongro made their first basket on their last possession but poor ball handling here That was one of the keys that coach Taylor said they had to stay away from is turnovers EDWARDS WITH HIS SECOND SWIPE WASHINGTON takes it baseline on the reverse He has seven already Yeah great start for Washington You can tell he is playing with great confidence out here this afternoon Maybe that little Christmas break helped him after just a fourpoint outing against Central Arkansas Well hes still one of the best players defensively and effortwise that SMU has Ball in the post for Duna And his fadeaway jumper goes over the freshman Jaden Tombs Well how about that great shot by D Luna the only Texan on this Titan ball club Hes from San Antonio He got some interest from SMU and TCU when he was coming out of San Antonio Really glue player for them Great block by ONeal Jr in transition rejecting de la Cruz Manro Good example of SMUs fantastic athleticism right there on that block The freshman getting after it defensively Its a kick ball by Bryce Koffield John you mentioned earlier this Cal State Fullerton team played Oklahoma State great last week up in Stillwater Terrific block there by ONeal Just fabulous effort Perfect timing But they scored 89 points up there at Oklahoma State last week This ball club can put the ball in the hole Now theyre just trying to slow this SMU attack down Well it was after a horrible start against Oklahoma State They were down 2710 8 minutes in and out played OSU the rest of the way Thats tough to do up there Thats a tough tough arena to play in Coming off a huge game I went seven of seven against UCA and starts out with a hook shot here A nice job by SMU getting the ball in on the block to him Still nothing from outside going for Cal State Bullard but its going to stay right here for the Titans as SMU cant handle the rebound Well both these ball clubs are so good in transition Looking at coach Taylor there for the Titans Alltime winning as coach in Titan basketball history 13th season as the head coach at Cal State Fullerton Hes taken them to the NCAA tournament three times 320 win seasons as well or two NCAA tournament trips and finally cracking the scoreboard from three Josh Ward their leading scoreer at 15 points a game Yeah he came into todays game hitting 21 out of 61 threes A very good threepoint shooter showing us why right there Iu hasnt tried one this season Hell screen instead for Miller Miller back down to Yigato Doubled inside and its out Last touched by SMU as Josh Ward came out from behind to poke it away Yeah Ward showed his quickness right there doubling down quickly when the ball went inside Coach Taylor mentioned winning as head coach and Cal State Fullerton history Longtime assistant coach at Arizona State seven years native Californian who wrapped up his collegiate basketball career at UC Davis to the call against SMUs Deron Pierre Jr whistled for his first in team foul number one In fact the first foul on either team You know most ball clubs that come in here try to slow it down against SMU Not the Titans You cant play too fast for this bunch Now theyre are top five in the nation in pace coming in They want to shoot it early and often Christian Mouse Williams unable to hit from three after knocking down six last time out SMU able to keep it to one miss Miller around the screen leans into the three comes up short long rebound to Josh Ward Ward in transition crossing over denied finds Dela Cruz Manro What a great ball movement by Cal State Furton spreading the floor beautifully Bryce Koffield the freshman from the elbow high release but too strong Good defense by Boopy Miller that time Very fundamentally sound Deron Pierre Jr takes the rhythm three and its tipped back in Yucatollu Nine for nine over his last two games Yeah that was one of the keys for SMU dominating the paint The big fella getting it done early Ward unable to knock down the triple Pierre rebounding and bringing it up himself Big Euro step through the lane Cant hit the backhand Oh what a great move That was that was very creative Now the NIA transfer Landon Seaman wearing number 99 in the game for the first time One of their leading scorers but he hasnt started a game this season Ward sinks the defense over Yato No good on the shot but a foul out front It will go on SMU Its a region music on Germaine ONeal Jr to pick up his first free throws on the other side for Josh Warden music Cal State Fullerton a team that lives at the free throw line but SMU up by a dozen early music among all conferences and SMU is ranked number 36 in the net right now Well no doubt about that John Of course well get an early look of the Mustangs against Traditional Power North Carolina right here at Moody Coliseum next Saturday afternoon Five of the first six games for SMU in ACC play will be quad one games Thats either a game at home against a top 30 team a neutral side against a top 50 or a game against a top 75 team on the road here Unable to handle that rebound Ward trying to get into it in the corner and coming up with another steal is BJ Edwards who also already has five assists and were only 8 minutes into this game A great on ball defense continuing for SMU and how about the offensive production Great balance up right there by Germaine ONeal Germaine ONeal Jr pulls up and hits and its another Edwards assist already his sixth Yeah keep in mind Edwards season high is 10 had a triple double earlier this season against Arkansas State Actually 13 assists in that game He also had 10 steals if you remember Yeah 10 steals Im sorry Yeah Josh Ward on the baseline flicks it up and Landon Seaman in midair able to kiss it home Averaging 14 points a game The transfer from Menllo College Oh that was a great job by using long fingers right there to get that put back by Seaman Heads up play Sam Walters in for the first time in a forward spot for SMU wearing number four Takes it baseline but stepped out before he threw it through for SMU Its giveaway number three of the day Davis BJ Davis Ray on for the first time coming off of a fourpoint game against UCA The third time this season hes hit four points part of the outstanding freshman and red shirt freshman class for SMU More challenging defenders but unable to hit Pierre comes out with it and attacks in transition all the way to the rack and they just could not get out in front of him Jeron Pierre Jr who has tried more field goals than anybody in the ACC goes to the line for two Boy this SMU team looks so fresh today They are running the floor extremely well Of course they had the few days off at Christmas time Coming back full of energy and never seen them run the transition game better than they are so far this afternoon But you got an opponent that wants to run as well coach How do you think that Well the key for the Titans they have got to get back quicker on defense That time they were playing catchup and put SMU at the free throw line for the first time today Don Pierre Jr the fourth active leading scorer in division 1 with more than than 1800 points in his career Knocks down both free throws 74 foul shooter this year Makes it a 13point lead for SMU See if the Titans can figure it out offensively shooting just 22 KJ Garris in off the bench Taylor Cruz Mongro against Pierre Both teams showing their depth early in this game playing lots of players only n minutes into the contest Illu pokes it away Coach Enfield was really impressed with Eigatollus defense in the UCA game as well especially on the exterior And I was really impressed with his passing I just love the way he keeps the ball up so high and can see his open teammates cutting popping open on the perimeter He just getting better and better in all phases of the game each time out Look at that help on the hedge right there defensively But underneath open is Seaman unable to make it go as Yigulu ties him up Oh Iu got out there on the help defense out front Got back to tie it up down on the block Watch the big fella here moving quickly Reaching up and over and getting the tie up for the Mustangs Still the Titans will have it after the block by Ilu Only two to shoot Seaman an awkward shot comes up short but its right back at him Corner triple Williams still over and thats out of bounds A tough start for Williams from outside after a 6 for10 day in Stillwater Hes 0 for five in the first game after the Christmas break But Dedric Taylor really likes Nouse Williams Even kind of gave him the cues to the program as he came on a recruiting visit Well and he talked to you and Bri earlier this week about what a high basketball IQ Mouse Williams has and hes showing it here today so far Really believes in the kid I was actually on a recruiting trip to St Louis to see somebody else when he came across Williams and said I cant leave without this dude As Pierre hits from the corner Well Geron Pierre is an absolute scoring machine SMU continues to be on fire for the from the perimeter He and Poopy Miller both averaging more than 19 a game And on the carry into the lane Bryce Koffield who can really get to the rack is fouled Its the first one on See Yigatollu and team foul number two on SMU Well Charity Stripe could be a big advantage for SMU this afternoon They came into this game one of the better free throw shooting teams in the nation hitting 77 Cal State Fullerton only 69 and they wont go to the free throw line here But SMU does not want to get into foul trouble against a poor shooting free throw team Yeah Titans get there a lot They just dont make as many as SMU does Yeah thats thats a big advantage 77 to 69 Yeah one of the best years ever for SMU from the free throw line Creative move by Jefferson Dela Cruz Mangro The transfer from Valareerezo Yeah Del Cruz Mongro right there showed a nice shooters touch on that little high arch friendly roll Cal State Fullerton trying to hang around Their first matchup in 52 years against the Mustangs Theyve both been here in Dallas Little push off by Pierre out front Its Washington in the corner 10 to shoot it Washington spinning out of control Leaves it behind and Koffield comes out with a loose ball Yeah not a wise decision by Washington Looked like he had his mind made up before he made the move Ela Cruz Mongro goes down awkwardly as Gigatlu just stood there and waited for him to come in HERES PIERRE FOR THREE BRING IT UP FOR GERON Pierre Jr What a start What did I say while ago He was a scoring machine Make that double Dela Cruz Mongro looking to fire back from three and Fullerton starting just one of 12 Miller crosscourt Pierre pulling up No And on the rebound Miller its called for the foul as Josh Ward tried to break out Well Boofy Miller thought he had a chance for the steal there but got the brush foul in the back court Thats one way to stop the fast break against a team that averages 20 fast break points a game best in the Big West and fifth in the nation Yeah this Cal State Fullerton ball club came into todays game hitting at a 33 clip from threepoint land Only one out of 12 so far today SMU pressure defense on the perimeter Very good Theres one way back into it if they can just get those to start falling though Thats how they got back back into it against OSU Thats how they beat Denver on the road Koffield in the paint And this will be a three in the lane call against Cal State Fullerton as the Titans offense is not in full form music averaging 90 points a game this year under Dedric Taylor but limited to 12 music through the first 12 minutes of this game music music gained So Coach Schultz is redefining what it means to be a Mustang in the weight room and its paying off for this team on the court Thanks so much Bri Thats so big as you know you move forward in your career to keep improving your body coach Well theres no doubt the players nowadays are much bigger stronger faster quicker all because of the terrific offcourt training in the weight room and better diets Just all round better treatment Oh absolutely And its topnotch here at SMU Just the way these players are treated not only on the basketball floor but sports all across SMU athletics as the uneven start continues for the Titans on the throwway Six turnover for the Titans If you want to know why you have a 16point deficit try this Titans come in at hitting 20 of their shots so far SMU hitting 61 Thats why you have a 16point differential already Another rhythm triple by Cory Washington off the assist by Boopy Miller Boy what a great performance by Washington so far Just adding to the Mustangs impressive percentage from the field Confident three taken by Ward but it rims off and just a rough start for the Titans And everything going SMUs way with a 19point lead early on SNU continues to do a great job on the defensive boards after the opening possession when Cal State Fullerton got two offensive boards No more Tombs making it tough inside Nearly came out with the offensive music rebound and forces Cal State Fullerton to fumble it out as Christian Williams comes back in for Cal State Fullerton Think of that Their only two offensive rebounds came in the first 30 seconds of the game Weve played what 14 minutes in Cal State Fullerton because of SMUs good blockout has not retrieved another one Here goes Edwards against the zone defense BJ Davis Ray dislodged Needs an outlet Finds Boofy Miller Only five to shoot Miller against a great defender in Ward Races to his left pulls up stops on a dime no good but Washington clears the carum His elbow jumper falls off Yeah that zone defense seemed to surprise SMU right there Ended up getting a good shot because of Boofy Millers creative ability but uh have to do better next time How about this The Titans average 20 points in transition a game coach They dont have any yet SMU getting back defensively and the Mustangs are there at every turn making it so tough on a great offensive team Yeah SMUs scouting report on Cal State Fullerton is just absolutely right on Theyre everywhere that the Titans want to pass it SMU all of a sudden is there forcing way too many turnovers in the ball game so far I believe thats number seven early in the contest And its a Cal State Fullerton team that doesnt turn it over a lot coach They only give it away about 11 and a half times a game Thats a really low number Yeah SMU is so quick particularly on the perimeter defensively and its it is hurting the Titans confidence Freshman out of Houston Nigel Walls is in wearing number 22 A rare appearance for one of the freshman on this outstanding recruiting class Miller slashes in Great elevation Unable to hit down low Titans come out with a rebound Its Bryce Koffield out of Sierra Canyon in California Koffield loses his footing and a throw out front EDWARDS WITH ANOTHER SWIPE AND THE JAM IN TRANSITION BOY what great anticipation by Edwards showing why hes one of the leading steel makers in the Atlantic Coast Conference He and Boofy Miller both in the top four in ACC thefts He can jump a little bit too partner laughter H Thats the weight room we were talking about Absolutely Thats the third steel by BJ Edwards Hes having a big start Five points six assists three rebounds and the three steals But thats what he does The senior fills up every column of the stat sheet What a defensive performance by SMU Finally the Titans going to get an opportunity at the line as Josh Ward The senior transfer heads to the line for two after Boopy Miller fell down Foul is going on Nigel Walls Well well have a chance to watch this again You can see Boopy Miller falling right there He kind of grimaces grabbing his ankle but everything looks okay You can see him there on his back but great drive by Ward going hard to the rack This will just be the uh third free throw attempt of the game for the Titans Very interesting Both these ball clubs average right at 25 free throw attempts per game This is only number three attempt for for Cal State Fullerton SMU still has just two So neither team fouling much here today Cal State Fullerton they either want to put up a three or they want to pressure the rim SMU is a team that loves to pressure the rim but theyve looked shot ready so far in this one Josh Ward has tried to lead the way but hes only one of six from the field in this one and one of two at the foul line on that trip Big early lead for SMU at home In the nonconference finale SMU is 80 at home this season Loopy Miller grinding out front around the tomb screen Pierre jump stop in the lane blocked going up Itll stay here with SMU SMU continuing to do a terrific job getting the ball on the perimeter and making quick moves to the rack Kicking it out for the open shot that time keeping it all the way Landon Seaman back in Hes coming off his first Division One double double 19 points 13 rebounds at OSU Miller down the baseline and he is one of the leaders in free throw shooting in the nation 92 and hell get his first crack Boopy Miller showing his terrific quickness on this move down the right baseline So tough to defend oneonone Preseason his preseason second team allconerence selection in the Atlantic Coast Conference You know that that gave him a little bit of motivation He wants first team Absolutely Well he was a star at Wake Forest and hes now a star at SMU and I feel quite certain that uh he will be the focal point of all ACC defensive preparations when they play the Mustangs Averaging careerh highs across the board points per game rebounds per game assists per game steals per game field goal percentage threepoint percentage free throw percentage Hes having his best year by far Yeah 20 and a half points per game 6 and 12 assists per game Cant get much better than that 22point lead for SMU as a team shooting 50 and limiting Cal State Fullerton to just 20 shooting Defense has been on point The double on Williams throws it crosscourt and through the hands of Davis White Oh SMUs changing defensive maneuvers are really confusing the Titans right now SMU just keeping the pressure on Constant harassment No time for Cal music State Fullerton to get comfortable on the offensive end chance for ONeal Jr to come back in He had a careerhigh 21 minutes played last time out against UCA Sam Walters also on as well How have you felt like this SMU freshman especially ONeal have evolved into the fold here Are they ready for conference play Well what what Ive been watching since the very first game is how those freshman evolved defensively What about that Showtime for Bookie Miller continues But John in answer to your question their defense is improving drastically and thats why youre seeing more court time for all of them As Andy Edenfield tries to get his lineup worked out bench always shortens come conference play UNC up next for SMU Seaman out front Catch and shoot three off to the right ONeal clears the carum Its a one of 14 start from outside for Cal State Fullerton Just dreadful shooting Great defensive rebound continuing for the Mustangs Also ONeal rises fires and hits Its a D2 How about that Full extension Arms up as high as they can possibly go Quick release at the top ONeal does it all perfectly 14 to1 run Another miss at the other end And it is just tumbling downhill for Cal State Fullerton Quick misses no second opportunities and SMU will have it on the other side with a 26point lead thanks to this music great start for the Mustangs music information One of the smartest guys around when youre talking about professional hoops and his son sitting next to him in the SMU gear and he goes to SMU right now So great to see Mark in attendance in his blue and orange And Germaine ONeal Jr Hes been showing off more and more of his output over the last few games as BJ Davis Ray comes out of nowhere to thieve it and score it and SMU is just rolling Oh that freshman from St Louis Missouri right there making a big impact quickly Man BJ Davis Ray doing it against another player from St Louis and Christian Williams You know Christian Williams came into this game hitting 40 of his threes John we talked about in the open and here today hes zero for five so far Good indication of how well this SMU defense is playing SMU has two runs of 100 in this game Theyre on one right now and 14 runs of at least 100 this season Thats how Andy Enfields teams can overwhelm you Well theyre just so athletic John They can hurt you at every position and theyve just coach Infield and his staff have done a phenomenal job of recruiting players that perfectly fit their system SMU has come in focused and ready for this matchup ONeal Jr FROM OUT FRONT ON TIME AND ON target off the assist by Miller Oh what a show he is putting on this afternoon Plays bigger than his 65 listed height Has a great great repertoire of ability and his first three And then the freshman Williams forced into stepping out and the tough first half continues Turnover number 12 Well SMUs defense has been responsible for every one of those Great pressure on the ball Good job of playing away from the ball on the other side of the floor Poopy Miller six assists no turnovers so far Gets it back from Walters and looks to create No look skip out to ONeal Jr Corner triple doesnt fall but Sam Walters is there for the rebound Thats one of the things that Andy Enfield wants the 69 junior to do He needs to defend rebound and make shots And thats a big O board there Well hes shown that he has ability and hes going to get more playing time as the season goes on Just another indicator of SMUs great great depth His second game back after missing six with a badly rolled ankle earlier in the season Miller finds Walters Two big steps behind the threepoint line Not able to hit Davis Ray crashes in and has it dislodged from behind SMU gets another crack with 20 to shoot Oh great court awareness that time by Davis Ray Saw the opportunity for the possible put back Crashed hard to the glass SMU looks like a focused team playing their best Iu Miller no look Walters wing three off the back rim Here comes Koffield Cal State Fullerton still looking for fast break points They dont have any yet And SMU continuing to do a great great job in transition defense Seaman lines up a triple He didnt hit one during his time in the NIA ranks but thats his 10th of the year Yeah he came into this game having made nine out of 21 Thats a pretty darn high percentage Drilled that one nicely Hes been given the green light by Coach Taylor Its part of their DNA as ONeal off the jump stop is hit and fouled by Jefferson de la Cruz Mongro But Dedric Taylor this season he was absolutely you know focused on the fact his team needed to play at a higher pace and they are right now the fifth highest paced team in the nation about 80 possessions a game after averaging around 70 last year Well and obviously that was the focus of the SMU scouting report When you play the Titans youve got to get back on defense quickly SMU has done that beautifully this afternoon Yeah Again no fast break points as Pierre and Washington starters are back in for SMU Edwards out there too And this is a scoring showdown or at least we thought it was coming into this one right You know points per game top 20 or so Well just look they went to a tough place in the Big 12 in their last game And that was 9481 So all indications were we would have another one like it today Not so because of SMUs defense Normally we talk about how great SMUs offense is Today its their defense Yeah SMUs defense looks locked in De La Cruz Manro one shot and done as Yucatollu tears down the rebound Great first half for Edwards Five points six assists four rebounds Pierre to the baseline Lobs it up way off Yeah I think he was really trying to get that ball over to Egulu I dont think that was a shot Great point See the Titans can make a couple shots here at the end of the half Gather a little momentum after a tough first half but See Yigulu denies KJ Garris heading downhill Well terrific reactions by Igotulu Watch him right here sliding his feet Doesnt reach Just gets the block at the height of the letgo Just beautiful defense by the Mustangs Cons continuing No second thoughts He is returning that Christmas gift Back door feed Yikus quick hands were there Corner three by Koffield And look what I found Bryce Koffield nails his fifth three of the season Yeah Titans now three out of 17 from the threepoint line Its been all SMU in the first half Edwards to the corner Spot up three WHAT A FIRST HALF BY GERMAINE ONEAL JR WITH 14 points and he puts a capper on a per passes out of the double here Washington from out front Edwards comes up with the offensive rebound and the stick back Oh Edwards is all over the floor today in all phases of the game Beautiful job of crashing the offensive glass that time Edwards now has uh seven points in todays ball game 77 and five for Edwards By the way he was called for a delay of game warning and SMU just owning this game so far We didnt see much from Kendrick Luna Deluna in the first half skipping through the lane Bryce Koffield trying to go to the cup and hell earn two foul shots Well he listened to the coach well They came down and took it straight to the basket Picked up a foul on SMU after only four free throw attempts that first half Here they go back to the line already for their first two of the second half Koffield a guy that can do a little bit of everything Had a careerhigh 27 against Northern Colorado earlier this season Koffield trying to come around at the free throw line He gets there a lot but only shoots 64 Uh he is really a nice looking freshman at 66 Hes got a bright future in this program Coach says hes just got to get more consistent and thats typical of the description of just about any freshman Maybe not for Germaine ONeal Hes been pretty consistent Oh he has as a sixth man for SMU in this one Mustangs by 33 SMU with 15 assists on 20 made baskets Edwards side steps fires the three Great arch on that one and he buries it BJ Edwards shot is coming around How about a great lesson for all young basketball players Edwards right there gave the little head fake Ball fake Defender went flying by Jump it up and drill it Perfect job Well take a look right here Look at the ball fake Look at the head fake Bounce back Clear shot to the basket Beautiful basketball by Edwards Edwards two of three from outside today after a three for eight effort last time out And thats a three for Jefferson De La Cruz Mangro Cal State Fullerton only knocked down three threes in the first half Yeah he was balanced up Took his time First time all afternoon that SMU didnt really have a tight hand in the face of the threepoint shooter and he drilled it First turnover by Boopy Miller and that is his third foul of the game as he tries to fight back after Mouse Williams picked him clean Well SMU only had five team fouls in that first half So they did a good job of being aggressive under control Miller in a little bit of foul trouble Watch that Obviously the game at this point not competitive SMU there at every turn defensively Ward picked up by Yigato What a great job sliding his feet by and spotting up for three Christian Williams splash down making his first of the day Well same exact spot on the floor Two straight three balls from that deep left wing for the Titans Pierre challenging the shot blocker right into the body of Duna to lay it home how he hit that three ball late in the first half They said weve got to come out on him tight You do that He drives to the basket Williams drop shot He just hit a three and now he kisses one home Well first time today weve seen a little flow to this game Both teams hitting buckets right in a row Now Cal State Fullerton theyve got a lot of talent Its just that consistency you talk about thats what Coach Taylor wants to see Taylor underneath wraparound pass to Washington Corner pocket The triple goes down Yeah same exact spot he made that bucket from and to open the game for the Mustangs 13 points for Cory Washington His ninth double figure game Another three This time it goes down for Josh Ward Now this is the kind of basketball we were expecting today Both teams now hitting on all cylinders Fun to watch Maybe too little too late of course for Cal State Fullerton but exactly what they wanted Gigatu out to the corner A rare giveaway Ward strips it away And look at the way he gets out in the open floor Extra pass Koffield all the way underneath Fouled by Yigato Koffield blowing by and earning foul shots Its the second foul on Sam Yigu Well all of a sudden Cal State Fullerton looks like a different ball club moving a little step quicker than they did in the first half I mean theyre very capable coach Weve seen it this year Well if youre averaging right at 90 points per game on the season youre doing a lot of things right on the offensive end Coach Taylor keeps talking how theyve got to improve their defense which obvious is obvious here this afternoon SMU scoring at will Only six wins last season for Dedric Taylors team They were one and 19 in Big West play Really really tough year but theyve already got five wins this season as they go into the meat of Big West action coming up in the new year Koffield will have another Well this shows me something that this ball club listened to their coach at halftime He told Brie We need to get to the free throw line Four free throws the first half already four free throws in the first three and a half minutes of the second half shows what driving to the basket can do for you Coach Taylor he really does love this team Okay maybe theyre a little bit up and down Theyre not the most perfect team hes ever had but he really likes the makeup of this program Koffield again going one of two SMU getting the freshman on the floor First big off the bench in Tombs and the first guard off the bench in ONeal Miller around the Tombs screen slips it back TOMBS GREAT CATCH JUST THE BODY TAKES CONTACT hits plus the foul What a play by the young man from Amarillo Well just a beautiful job of body control here Look at Tombs taking that step Perfect tough finish for the 610 freshman I mean had to catch the ball behind him showed the good hands and then as you say the body control and the foul on Ward Now this is an area where he needs to improve on Only six out of 10 from the charity stripe coming into todays game But nice form and follow through right there by the 610 freshman And Andy Enfield says the better the bigs play well the more theyll get playing time And Tombs starting the second half very well Koffield lost it Catch and shoot three by Ward Off the mark Deluna shoves it back in First to the floor is Boopy but he slides out of bounds with the basketball Itll stay with the Titans Well you can watch right here Great effort continuing by Boopy Miller Look at there Theres nothing in his ball game that says let up any little bit Diving on the hardwood right there Miller already with nine assists on the offensive end He has nine of the 19 helpers for SMU Koffield back to work on the baseline Forces the contact against Germaine ONeal Jr And you see why Bryce Koffield is so good going to the bucket Well very creative Reads the defense well Very very very quick on that first step Tough to defend and as you pointed out earlier a 66 wing So hes going to be able to defend anybody on the wing that they see in the Big West Koffield has a bright future ahead of him Well this is going to give coach Infield something to talk about now This will be the sixth free throw in the first four minutes of this second half Mustangs cannot let that get started Koffield goes to the line a lot True freshman Top 20 in the Big West this season in scoring at almost 14 a game Its the sixth rebound for Edwards to go along with seven assists and 10 points Boopy Miller headed up by Duna Gets rid of it Heres Washington working on a big game The step back from the baseline Overplayed and fouled by De La Cruz Mengro Two shots for Cory Washington Oh a great job by Washington drawing that foul there went hard to that left baseline Stopped on the dime Up and over the defender going to the strike Thats the third music on Taylor Cruz Manro SMU holding Cal State Fullerton in arms length music music Cory Washington for the SMU Mustangs four points in 23 minutes against UCA last time out Before that just seven points in 23 minutes and fouling out against LSU But trying to get on track the senior transfer from Witchah State has erupted in this one and it started early Coach Hower well and hes run the floor so well today Hes been a a big difference maker in this game when the Mustangs were wanting to get off to a quick start talked often about he knocked down that first shot of the ball game from that left corner and hes continued to play beautifully since Knocked down three threes as well for SMU and one of the leading free throw tossers in the league at 86 Hes got 15 and leaves as SMU gets cement Yigutou out there and that will move Tombs to the four spot An opportunity to see a little bigger lineup for SMU SMU now has four players in double figure scoring very very very impressive Of course SMU one of the few teams in the country that has five players averaging 10 or more Did it last year as well for an entire season basically Seaman really rough game for him and it continues as he turns it over on that quick move to the baseline called for the travel Well Edwards did a great job of what I call bodying him up Just kept him off balance there Didnt foul didnt reach Just a terrific defensive job in the mismatch Edwards much smaller But Edwards one of the best defensive players in the ACC part of the Atlantic Coast Conference all defensive team And Edwards just out of control Loses it out of bounds Well nice team defense by the Titans that time Koffield coming over and doing a nice job of forcing the turnover by the Mustangs I think BJs thinking triple double and was looking for an assist there He could have taken it right to the rack Koffield blocked inside by Tombs Knocked away It stays with Cal State Fuller Yeah that turnover was just the seventh of the ball game for SMU Theyve handled the ball very very well Good team defense right there Fifth block for SMU in the game Koffield against ONeal AND ERASED AGAIN by Tombs Return to Sender Boy what great instincts Tombs has Watch this reaction here Just coming over Look how high he gets up on the swat What a freshman that young man is He and ONeal have been very special here so far today Tombs where shots go to die Curling drive by Ward Extra pass to the corner Koffield late in the shot clock with two Fade away off the mark and the rebound knocked out to Yigu for SMU Tombs and Igato right there on the defensive rebound for the Mustangs JOBS RUNNING THE FLOOR and great position inside And great position but how about reading the defense and going with the left hand Beautiful job by Tombs and rewarded And Boopy Miller has his 10th assist Fadeaway jumper goes for Landon Seaman One of the best scorers on the team 144 games Yeah thats interesting Seamans their second leading scoreer but has not started a game yet for Cal State Fullerton Tombs flashing ONeal lets the skies clear Has his pocket picked by Ward Its going to stay with SMU Yeah good point Pocket picked He actually brought that ball down and enabled the Titans to get a little theft Great entry pass by Boopy Miller And how about using that left hand protecting himself with the right side of the body for the easy put in And Boopy Miller averaging 67 assists a game coming in 12th in the nation already has 10 Yigolu the high catch inside Count the bucket and one Sam Yigolu a man among men Well these last games Ive talked about and how much his hands have improved Look at this All over him Triple team just going right up quickly and getting the bucket for the Mustangs Stand aside I take large steps says IU Thats one area of his game hes really got to improve on He came into the day shooting 25 out of 47 He can get a lot more points if he gets better on the stripe Ward may have pushed off No call Extra pass White out of the corner Threepointer No Seaman friendly fire able to hold on to it Tries to rip against Eigolu and out of room He knocks it off the big fellows legs Yeah nice job by Seaman that time reading the defense quickly and thought quick enough to throw it off the Mustangs body First appearance by Mitchell Holmes in this one as Yikatu gets a little bit of a rest with his six points and six rebounds Quick pass in and unawares Bryce Koffield is able to get past Thats really the first breakdown defensively SMU has had today you start making a lot of substitutions with freshman and that will happen ONeal rises fires in and out Koffield comes down with a loose ball but SMU out rebounding Cal State Fullerton by one Good head fake Ward short corner brings it home A nice shooters role right there Wards a terrific player Not helping his team get close today but I like his game Very very smart Hes played on both coasts Played for Palm Beach Atlantic in South Florida last year near Boca Raton Miller overhead pass BJ Davis Ray grinding in sets it up Boopy fires a deep two and stays here with SMU Boopy Miller having another outstanding game here this afternoon Getting very close to a double double Yeah Miller leading scoreer on the team at 20 points a game Not really looking for a shot today Has got 11 terrific assist and seven points Edwards will now run the point with Miller out Another takeaway by Josh Ward Flying up the floor stepping to the cup and laying it in Well theres that smart game we keep talking about with Ward Quite an outstanding player in all phases of the game That was quick hands quick feet quick quick thinking Coach Taylor thinks defense defense defense ONeal Jr he is stuck on automatic A careerhigh 17 for Germaine ONeal Hes always ready to shoot Hes just got a quick release on that shot Christian Williams Oh look at that vertical jump by ONeal That was a wow moment Holmes trailing Great sharing inside the tombs Three freshman combining on the bucket in transition Yeah but how about that That was 610 to 610 in transition That makes it even more special Everybodys running the floor including Josh Ward who goes to the line SMU getting out and running 14 fast break points for the Mustangs music including this doozy Its all SMU with Told you SMU is one of the most experienced teams in the nation but a lot of their depth are these true freshmen four of which have played in this game and have made huge contributions Well and theyre just so athletic John These guys can all run they jump they think quickly Theyre just super talented Very easy to see why they were ranked in the top 10 in all rankings for recruiting And theyre just theyre even more impressive in person than I thought they would be This is the third time Ive seen them this year and they all just keep getting better and better and better And Germaine ONeal Jr pouring in 17 a game high in this one A new careerhigh and doing it in just 15 minutes of work Josh Ward at the line A two of two trip Yeah easily the games leading scoreer for the Titans He now has 14 putting on a nice exhibition this afternoon here at Moody Coliseum Senior out of Memphis takes a seat playing his first year of D1 ball after a year in division 2 and two seasons at the NIA level Part of this hodgepodge group for Cal State Fullerton Only two returners and one who plays off last years team I see how SMU handles this zone defense of Cal State Fullerton Didnt handle it well turned it over on that possession When Cal State Fullerton went to that zone in the first half SMU had a couple of possessions that didnt look real confident This would probably be good for SMU experiencewise to see some zone here heading into conference play Oh no doubt about it SMU with that outstanding first half leading by 32 after the first 20 minutes Well listen listen to these stats SMU shooting 69 in the second half Cal State Fullerton shooting 57 Were seeing some good offensive basketball here this second 20 minutes as Edwards attacks what he hopes will be a triple double He had a rebound stolen from him on one end by See you could tell Lou And then on the other end he has an assist taken away as CeT misses for the first time in his last 10 shots He didnt realize he was so far up under the rim He actually hit the bottom of the basket and as he went up on that shot attempt ONeal Davis Ray and Holmes out Hoopy Miller Washington and Pierre on as SMU comes back with their starting lineup with 11 minutes left in regulation and a complete takeover here in Dallas Well if our viewers are wondering how you get a 32point lead listen to some of these numbers SMU leads in points in the paint 2810 Fast break points 142 and also is for has scored 18 points off of turnovers to only six for the Titans Its pretty impressive Of course the Titans have only turned it over once in the second half Layoff to Seaman underneath off the assist by Christian Williams Well remember Coach Taylor told Bri at halftime he wanted them to drive it more Theyre doing that and having way fewer turnovers Thats an offensive foul Moving screen against Cory Washington as he brushed by Yeah Boopy Miller using that good screen from Washington right there Taking it with the left hand Washington called for the moving screen though Thats his first foul Team foul number seven Well Boopy knows how to use those screens as good as any small guard that Ive ever watched Cal State Fullerton is in the bonus as Poopy Miller picks up his fourth Yeah remember Cal State Fullerton only had four free throw attempts the first half Theyve already had eight here in the second half 9 minutes and 45 seconds into the second 20 minutes of action So Miller picks up number four That means free throws the rest of the way for the Titans Rare game in foul trouble for Boopy Miller who is leading the ACC in minutes played First one by Christian Williams Good Dedric Taylor on Williams visit handed him a ball on his visit and said he was giving them the keys to the program That is a high honor for a freshman who knocks down both foul shots Well I can certainly see why he would say that Christian Williams came into todays game hitting 40 of his threepoint attempts Only one out of seven here this afternoon Seven points for Williams Theyre all in the second half Edwards to Miller Rises fires around and off Out of bounds last touched by Christian Williams Hoopy with 11 assists in this one in 25 minutes of action Miller has a mismatch Bigger player on him Sets up Pierre OUT FRONT NO GOOD BUT CRASHING IN FOR THE REBOUND AND THE SCORE BJ Edwards Well Edwards has gotten a couple of good offensive rebounds here this afternoon That was beautifully timed Edwards now three rebounds and three assists shy of his second triple double of the season He already has one trip up and he also fell shy just shy in one game Well look how smart Edwards is Just came blowing in there the left side of your screen for the uncontested putback Saw the opportunity went quick SMU with 12 offensive rebounds in this game Edwards has such great anticipation Anytime you player see a player that has a lot of steals they have good anticipation and hes certainly a perfect example of that Leading the league in steals almost two and a half a game Had that 10 steel game second most in a contest in ACC history SMU the whole way Theyve never trailed Scored the first 10 of the game Quick catch and shoot by White Offensive rebound grabbed by Garris Ward cant hit the three and then Washington pulls down the rebound but theres a foul call against SMU Well great effort continuing by the Titans The scoreboard may not show like they have played as hard as they have Just had tough luck on their shots because of SMUs great pressure but look at that job right there going hard to the bucket Both teams continuing to play aggressively and Davis White transfer from College of the Sequoas where he averaged 13 and a half points four and a half rebounds three assists a game last season Hits the front end Hes a good looking athlete Got a strong body good threepoint shooter had 10 coming into todays ball game on the season Does a lot of the dirty work for this team off the bench and hits both foul shots Yeah hes actually started four games for them this year and he will be a valuable member of this ball club in Big West competition Titans back in that zone defense once again Lets see how SMU attacks Need to get the ball at the free throw line Yeah you see IU posting up inside Miller throws it through Washington ready to shoot from the wing Strongu has the offensive rebound goes right back to work and he is fouled What a nice job by Igotulu using those strong hands once again Good reactions Look to his left Nobody there Put it on the hardwood Went hard Watch this right here Kind of pushes off a little bit He sees the opening Just goes right between the Navy shirted defenders and goes to the charity stripe Nice job by the big fella Just a sophomore He just gets better and better and better Something the SMU coaches want to see from their bigs is grabbing rebounds above the head jumping for the rebound catching it at a high point not just relying on the fact that youre 7 foot2 in the case of Seemet Yatu Well hes doing that quite well and I like the way he gets those entry passes and immediately puts the ball up high where no small guards can double down and knock it out of his hands Jouu working toward his fourth double double of the season Yeah once again he has got to get better on the charity stripe Heres the problem You know I say he could score a lot more points but he cant be in the game in the last seconds if he cant knock down crucial free throws Hes not anywhere near consistent enough there And Cal State Fullerton again over the limit is now over the double limit on the 10th team foul on SMU You can going after his own rebound has whistled for his third foul of the afternoon So Josh Ward is up to 14 points Had a careerhigh 31 against Northern Colorado earlier this season Well hes definitely been the best most consistent player on the floor for Cal State Fullerton this afternoon and just an absolute leader with a great motor for this Fullerton team as Bryce Koffield reenters Give Davis White a little bit of a rest I like this for SMUs case that the Titans continue to play this zone Gives SMU a chance to work against the defense that theyll probably see some in the Atlantic Coast Conference Look at that offensive rebound by Igulu Great hands continuing for the big fella Another offensive rebound but unable to stick it back Garris up the floor Ward out to the corner Extra pass for a trailing three by Koffield Way short Nice transition defense by SMU Again Miller head down in the air Shot doesnt fall but hes fouled on that quick move toward the hole music KJ Garriss first foul Now SMUs running game continues to be very very impressive this afternoon Both these ball clubs run the floor very well Fun to watch Miller Booby Miller trying to get closer to that magic double double Seven points and 11 assists already Yeah hes already done it three times this year and hed done it four times his entire career coming into the season but his assist numbers are the best of his career Hes already sixth among active players in total number of assists in his career Its fun to watch him play at just six foot He is dynamic Started his career at Central Michigan University then played at Wake Forest in the ACC and now reached true stardom at SMU And Miller although hes undersized doesnt seem to bother him from that point guard spot Garris on the pullup Yigu goes high to grab it for his 10th rebound Miller behind that screen by Yigu DROPS IN THE THREE from straight on Well we heard he heard us say hes got a chance for another double double How about it Does it right there 12 points and 11 assists fourth of the season the ninth of his career Cupping it Ward blocked by Yigato and out of bounds And a big block by Yiglu Its rejection number seven of the afternoon for music the Mustangs points Then they want to hold their opponent to under 40 shooting from the field And last but not least they want to shoot more free throws than the other team attempts And Jim these stats are adding up with this dominant lead Cal State Fullerton only has two fast break points and shooting 31 So SUs hit majority of these goals already with seven minutes left in this game Well certainly the scouting report Bree said you must stop their transition game first and foremost and thats the biggest factor in todays game SMU eliminated that totally in the first half and continuing to do that here in the second 20 minutes Yeah the Titans not able to get in the flow early and although they have scored with SMU in the second half its not going to be enough Tombs corner three Edwards comes down with the rebound and he is fouled on the region and goes to the line as KJ Garris picks up the foul for Garris Its his second team foul number seven Well Edwards one of five Mustangs already in double figure scoring Great balance as always for SMU Edwards on the front end of the one and one up to 13 points nine rebounds and seven assists Yeah hes just so consistent That last game where we were here last Sunday he had 17 points seven rebounds and four assists So just so consistent Four steals to go along with it as Edwards is one of the many Mustangs in double figures five of them today Quickly to the cup Bryce Koffield Well that was really the first time SMU has not retreated quickly enough in transition defense too easy but Koffield made a great move very rapidly for the Titans 77 rebounds for Koffield Edwards out of the corner Reigns in a three Well what a show that young man He Hes just developing into a great great player Threepoint shooting continuing very impressively here in the second half for both teams SMU now has 12 threes in the ball game Cal State Fullerton seven Garris has knocked down two of those in the second half High low pass Yigu Easy from Tombs What a great play High post to low post That is so tough to defend Tombs down to the big fella and a point away from a double double for See Eigatu Yeah itd be his second in a row Catch and shoot Triple down for Garris Hes three for three from outside Oh this is this I said it while ago This is what we expected but were finally seeing it Both teams shooting the ball well moving it well Another Tombs opportunity Way over the top Edwards has the double double and reverses it in Yeah Edwards showing us how he can score in all phases of the game Live ball turnover Watch out Miller slithering THROUGH TRAFFIC ALL the way to the glass weaving his way doing what Boopy Miller does best Create as you go Games gotten a little bit wild here recently Oh I like it Lets have fun partner Sounds good to me Final nonconference game of the year for both these teams Quickly into Tombs and hooks it home Well a beautiful job looking over that left shoulder Nobody there Just keep going and put it in the in the hole He did it All nine of Tombs points have come in the second half Triple try no good Two assists shy of a triple double for BJ Edwards by the way as Pierre moves baseline Here comes Edwards Hes going to want to pass off Looking for somewhere to go Finds Eigolu and he scores it Timeout called by SMU as the Mustangs go up 98 59 And BJ Edwards stands just an assist away from a triple double snorts Tombs is one point away from SMU having seven players in double figure scoring but congratulations to those three on the double double Absolutely And SMUs second double double in a row SMU also with the possibility of getting a player with a triple double as well in this game And BJ Edwards is on the cusp with his 19 points 10 rebounds and nine assists Yeah I just said I hope somebody told Coach Infield Edwards was that close Ill never forget during my coaching career we had a radio announcer named Frank Fallon He leaned over to me one game Id taken Benny Johnson out of the game He had 46 points Frank leaned over He said Coach he only needs four more to be the first 50 point scorer in Baylor history I put him back in thanks to Franks recommendation and he got the 50 So Edwards is in Did you pass word to coach Infield that Edwards needed It wasnt me It wasnt me Turnover by Edwards as SMU is looking for that triple double White goes inside and throws it through the intended recipient Ben Winkler Four and a half to play A lot of time remaining A lot of runway for BJ Edwards to be the second SMU player with two triple doubles in one season EDWARDS LOBS IT AND THERES THE TRIPLE DOUBLE THATS HOW YOU PUT THE CHERRY ON TOP A huge dunk by Germaine ONeal Jr BJ Edwards becomes the first mens basketball player in D1 this season with two triple doubles Well hes so deserving of any recognition he gets is just a fantastic allround athlete What a performance by SMU Also out to 100 points again And Edwards picks it Its his fifth steel EDWARDS PUTS A CAPPER ON IT A 20POINT TRIPLE double for BJ Edwards What a day at the office I think this team is tuned up for ACC action What do you think coach Well Edward just continuing to put on a show here this afternoon Another terrific rebound Thats his 11th board of the game to go with the 21 points and 10 assists Time for a standing ovation for number zero BJ music Edwards has done it again music BJ Edwards becomes the second SMU player with multiple triple doubles in a single season Gerald Lewis in 9293 had three And BJ Edwards not even halfway through the year already at two Well hes just put on a fantastic show here Hes such an unselfish player Just fun fun fun fun to watch him in action Hes had some huge highlights in the second half All on Andy Enfields way to another 100point game Nine for coach Enfield over the first now 48 games of his coaching career here at SMU And the alltime record is within reach Its just about three away now Yeah The alltime record was by the late great Doc Hayes who was back in my era and he coached 20 years here and had 12 100point games So what Andy Infield and his staff are doing is super impressive and what a bright future for SMU basketball with this style of play Yeah its just hes recruited the right guys for it Of course BJ Edwards sticking around through the coaching transition and hes being rewarded handsomely for it as Edwards leaves with a huge applause after his second triple double of the year Garris a one for two trip and the Mustangs get Chance Purer in another red shirt freshman Young lineup out there for SMU Well what contrasting halves for Cal State Fullerton Four free throws the first half 18 here in the second half ONeal with a high release but off to the right Yeah that was his first poor shot selection of the day Little miscommunication underneath but unable to take advantage Winkler misses inside Talking about Cal State Fullerton 18 free throws this half to only four the first half How about pointwise for Cal State Fullerton Oh how about that beautiful job by Sam Walters getting that ball off quickly with the southpaw hand A line drive three by the natural floor spacer puts SMU up 10561 Well its nice to see Walters healthy and back in action for the Mustangs He could be a real difference maker with his size and shooting ability Oh no Hes a mismatched player for sure Yes he is Germaine ONeal Jr already with a careerhigh 19 Walters looking for back to back and he rolls it down String music Yeah I think hes not ready to shoot after being out so long Give me that basketball teammates Matthew Quinnland for Cal State Bullerton missing on his three SMU just continues to pump in points Purer cant knock it down but the extra effort by BJ Davis Ray to get on their shot Step back SMU just attacking the glass Walters wants ANOTHER ONE AND THE JAM BY ONEAL JR TO FOLLOW IT UP 21 FOR THE FRESHMAN What an afternoon he has had Showing his full array of ability driving to the basket Great outside jump shooting Terrific defense One of six in double figures for SMU in this one White spots up Winkler unable to bring down the rebound Its a threeon two And before the ball comes up the floor SMU is going to get everybody else into the game Well this is certainly a without any question about it the season high in scoring for the Mustangs Their f previous highs scoring game was against Arkansas Pine Bluff way back in mid November Their fourth 100point game of the year and by far their highest scoring outing Cal State Fullerton playing right into SMUs hands SMU is a team wants to get up and down and Fullerton of course thats what they want to do this season So for the Mustangs they get Trey Utter into the matchup all the way to the glass and fouled is Kisher Stor A couple free throws on the way for another one of those SMU depth players that gets to play in blowouts Well nice job driving to the rack Actually got away with a little push off with that left forearm but beautiful move by Makolo Trying to get on the board Coming up just a little short on a day where SMU has had nine different players score Nine score and six in double figures Pretty impressive Showing the great depth of this Mustang team working on nearly a 50point victory today Cant knock down either one of those but its been all Mustangs all day in a complete effort Is this team ready for conference play What do you think Coach Ally Well Im Im telling you they are rounding into shape Today was a great indicator with their terrific intensity the first half And I would say this next week as they get ready for traditional power North Carolina will be their best practice of the season Everybody wants Trey Utter to shoot But with the shot clock off and already at 110 the SMU Mustangs will put it in the barn cheering 9 and0 at home in nonconference play And now its on to ACC action See
