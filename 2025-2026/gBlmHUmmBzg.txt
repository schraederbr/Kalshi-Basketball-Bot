He is back starting making his first appearance since the beginning of this month In the circle its Mo Cila the freshman against Caleb Washington the senior from Atlanta And its the freshman Cila who controls the opening tap And we are ready to go Game two of our Sunday double header Georgia Tech and FloridaM on the mens side Speaking of freshman Fleming tries to zip it inside to Dongo Georgia Tech lucky to keep possession of Moila Crushes it down That onetwo punch inside with Dongo and Cila A high low action great interior passing Now CEA he wasnt fully healthy last time out against Lafayette His limits were limited to a season low 14 minutes That front court is so critical to Georgia Tech success as you see form and their starting lineup Three Georgia natives Youve got Antonio Baker down from Savannah Caleb Washington and Tyler Shirley both from Atlanta With five to shoot its Shirley hoisting a three Way off the mark and Sila rips away the rebound Dongo one on three See L cuts Oh he lost his control on the way up Another high low action The passing on this side They really play well together Cila and Dongo And in some ways you felt like youve been a little cheated from seeing that high low action at times this year John because of the injuries particularly to buy But for Georgia Tech to have success in ACC play which will begin on Wednesday in Durham against number six Duke they need both these guys not just to be healthy but to be impactful As Dongo with hook shot ball drop high quality shoting You know he is a preeason second team allaccc selection and um you know the Jackets need him Its good to see him back on the floor and he can knock a little rust off before they go to Cameron on Wednesday night to play the Dookies And a turnover Washington racing down the floor Reeves goes up lays it in and give the assist to Washington Hes coming off a 10 assist one turnover outing and the win against Lafayette He was outstanding in that game Had 20 points as well Hes climbed into the top five in the ACC in assists per game those last couple of outings Jordan Chapman feeds Jaquan Sanders drills it I mentioned him off the top He uh had a great outing 16 points against TCU on December 21st and he picks off right where he left off Johnny B those are your players TO WATCH PLAYERS to watch Reeves knocks down the triple Again I mentioned earlier hes shooting above 40 from the threepoint arc on the season And hes catching the ball in rhythm Hes taking high quality shots He He really is playing like a senior leader Shirley penetrates fades away Another rebound from Osilo Hes got three now Reeves floater off the window and good Honor off one leg Nice touch high off the glass by Reeves Shirley drives baseline Walled off by Dongo Threepoint try for Washington And Lamar Washington with the rebound at the start of started this game in zone two three and you know theyre going for contested shots one and duns and I really like the pace of play theyve got right right now has it jarred loose John you pointed out entering this matchup Georgia Techs opponents are shooting below 40 from the floor you love what youve seen from them defensively this year yeah I think the guard play some veteran guard leadership Reeves got a ton of minutes Washington has a ton of minutes the length of Uh Fleming hes super versatile Can guard one through four So they just got good size good length a very good defensive team And Caleb Washington goes up contact but no whistle Itll stick with FloridaM Get another look at it here Cila left his feet A little bit of body will be out of bounds underneath Caleb Washingtons got to be excited today Making his first start of the season doing it in his hometown number 10 in green Stepping in for Miles Zendalamov Seems like Lama is in street clothes No official word on his health status but doesnt appear hell play today Another turnover Dongo with a mismatch Tries to feed it to CEA and its knocked away Chapman trailer catch shoot and the rebound controlled by Dongo Florida trying to get it inside the seal but keeps active hands for Florida and forcing some turnovers Washington from the corner down the well Caleb Washington playing just shy of 21 minutes per game on the season Hes got 10 games under the belt Averaging 55 points coming into this one But with the start he steps up right there Wy Yeah Out of Wheeler High School won a state championship with Wheeler No surprise Teammates with Isaiah Collier Jeene Hudson A jump ball through four and a half minutes The yellow jack teams that Charlie was a part of They had Sam Cassell Bob Sur Doug Edwards Head coach was Pat Kennedy at the time had some great battles against the great Bobby Kummings and his Yellow Jacket teams and a couple of Sweet 16s for Charlie Ward and the Seminals in that stretch including an Elite 8 Tyler Shirley straight away Cole Kirwak has the rebound fall in his lap Chaz Kelly and Jaden Mustaf on the floor First time Jaden Mustaf has played for the Yellow Jackets since December 6th He too was feeling less than 100 But good to see a couple of Jackets knocking some rust off Cam Craft also onto the floor So everyones subbing out with the exception of Moa and Mustaf walked with it He dragged the foot on the spin dribble Just kind of lost his balance And again thats four turnovers now for the Yellow Jackets Uh but you said it Wy Its going to take some time to knock the rust off Been out since early December Um but the great thing about this Georgia Tech roster is theres depth Yes And uh thats something that uh the recruiting has helped and theyre going to need that as they enter ACC play Little sagging pressure here from Georgia Tech on the inbound FloridaM two for nine from the floor so far Both those two makes their threes And theres a twopointer from Antonio Baker Jr out of Johnson High School down in Savannah Georgia Nice job going off the bounce Dribble penetration get into the paint good things happen Cila outside to Craft Found a little space Shot wont drop Stick with Jordan 10 Was nice defensive recovery by Balden on that He stayed with the play Elevated Had a hand right in the face of the jump shooter on the baseline Here we see the dribble drive Get to the paint loader So Kelly on the baseline inbounds for the Yellow Jackets Gets it into Kiraowak Mustaf battling Balden Mustaf gets a step thanks to the screen HE GOES UP AND HE JAMS IT IN JAYEN Mustaf merciless Carowak with the good screen on the twoman game and there was no hedge defensively wide open for the flush Okay Washington lowers his shoulder and takes it in Senior on the freshman Curway and hes at home Hes playing in Atlanta Gets fired up You mentioned that at Wheeler High School He won a state championship in 6A his first year at FloridaM after spending time at Dayton and Butler Community College in Kansas Eight to shoot Greavves already has seven and he is fouled And that is our first foul called against either side That one Tyler Shirley One more look at this dunk Jaden welcome back Been out a couple weeks Legs are fresh Hello Anthony Nolles checks in for FloridaM as Caleb Washington has a seat By the way our officing crew we hadnt had a chance to introduce him but Tony Henderson Leslie Jones and Kell Miller And now another foul coming You can count the basket A threepoint play for Chaz Kelly Chaz Kelly another guy that transfer uh from Boston College Hes got good minutes under his belt really good experience Hes coming off the bench So again some veteran guys with heavy D1 minutes able to come in and contribute off the bench for the Yellow Jackets in that 95 to 81 win over Lafayette You mentioned it was the highest point total for Georgia Tech not just this season but in the Damon Statamire era but I could give you five guesses as to who came up with the best plus minus in that game and you wouldnt have gotten it Chaz Kelly Not that plus minus is everything in basketball but that kind of perked your eyebrows up right Great stat The game of analytics around the sport of basketball is just so important Trying to find the winning edge studying the data They got to be good here Georgia Tech come on The institute you cant win on data alone here at this institute Youre in trouble Well they have been eight and one here at home Thats right Thats right Homecourt advantage Foul that time on Jaden Mustaf puts Jaquan Sanders at the line The senior from far Rockaway New York cheering Rattlers 0 and6 on the road this season Theyre still looking for a win on the road And they started 0 and5 this year then rattled off three straight wins over Florida Memorial and NIA school before taking down Alb State and Jacksonville And then they spent last weekend in Texas where they lost to Tarlington State and TCU They played four games in a 7day span Coach Wards got to be happy I mean theyre theyre competing Theyre up four at TCU uh in their last game That says something right there Its a one possession game now Were almost a quarter of the way into this So FAMU is scrapping Dont have the wins to show for it but Charlie Ward doing a nice job keeping the momentum going for this team keeping the spirits high and getting ready for league play And I know its an entirely different level but at Florida High School Charlie Ward he led Florida High to their first state championship in nearly 60 years Able to create a winning tradition in his last stop Shirley gets it to Nolles the senior from Miami Dumps it off Shirley out of Pebble Brook High School here in Atlanta Kick out Nolles three Wont go Mustaf with the rebound Georgia Tech did nice job forcing east to west basketball right there Quick possession for the Yellow Jackets Here come the Rattlers Shirley lets it fly No another rebound from Amar Washington Flirt with a triple double the last couple of times out Got the switch on Chapman And now a foul going against Ch Yes his father Anquin Balden long career in the NFL a Super Bowl champion with the Ravens about 13 years ago Also the Walter Payeyton man of the year and his son who started at the University of or Buffalo University transferring to FloridaM back home near Delray Beach Kelly drills a three You know Johnny come on B He was a problem for your Patriots every once in a while He was had Curt Warner firing away to him That was a tough offense right there I You saw the field goal uh set up in the back of that photo I dont recommend trying to kick on that without a stretch Last time I was in there I tried to tee one up from 30 thinking it was easy I think I strained my left quad on the way planting and pulled the right hammy on the extension It was It was not pretty Babe you know sharing your pearls of wisdom here with our audience is critically important Thats good advice there A little PSA there as Lamar Washington makes it look easy It is a great outing though if anyone gets to Atlanta uh College Football Hall of Fame Real special spot Washington get two on that one Hes got three assists in this one as well Little dump off and theres Caleb Washington Cordan hanging around and that ricochet is out of bounds Got a line change in right now Taylor Junior in Sanders Fleming Dongo all stepping onto the floor One possession game WY Jackets uh started off strong Points in the paint was a factor but the turnovers five turnovers The Rattlers have converted five points off those turnovers Thats kind of been the story thus far Georgia Tech they do average the most turnovers offensively in the ACC although that number has dropped considerably in the month of December in a positive way Starters back out on the floor along with Lamard Taylor Jr Zeroing Green and Baker penetrating in Shirley dials up a three Little too strong Another rebound and run down by Lamar Washington Hes already got two points three boards and four assists Another turnover Threepoint try for Baker Little too low and strong And thatll stick with FloridaM The Rattlers Theyve taken 18 shots today John 11 of them from three Three makes on those 11 attempts And theyve gotten some good looks Theres a little hesitation on that last one but theyre moving the basketball finding open shooters just not being able to drop them Sanders his jumper doesnt fall Georgia Tech meanwhile shooting over 50 They just cant avoid the turnovers Rattlers in a sagging zone Fleming the freshman kicks out Washington trying to shake him KICKS OUT TO FLEMING AND he buries a three Flemings coming off 20 points in his last outing Had 11 of 12 from the free throw line in that one But I love his versatility Wy Hes you know three and D type guy Hes athletic can rebound the basketball Uh and hes just a freshman And by Dongo rising up and rubbing out that layup And on the other end Dongo in a little bit of trouble And hell stick with Georgia Tech Dongo its great to have his presence out there defensively He throws up for that block shot Kept the ball in play Heres the dribble drive and kick Washington gets to the paint collapses the defense throws back behind it and then theres the defense Dongo welcome back playing in his first game since December 3rd Three and a half weeks And the guy plumbing with the take Georgia Tech has stretched their lead to eight See the last two Georgia Tech possessions The ability to get into the paint one time for a kick out three And then there Fleming finishes in the paint for two Foul coming here on Mustaf Its going to be his second Cam Crafts going to check in for Georgia Tech and replace Mustaf Weve also seen Davi Remagan come in for the first time today a moment ago Pretty fastpaced game Clean game out there Two fouls on Georgia Tech in the game Three fouls for the Rattlers Only three free throws attempted in this one Theres a good flow to it Eight and a half minute mark in the first half Baker driving baseline Cant find the touch Remagan back down to Dongo Couple little veterans going on Caleb Washington Dongo kept his pivot foot and kisses it off the glass And I like the concerted effort by the Jackets on that possession to throw the ball inside The patience you know just being aware that there was a mismatch and Dongo went to work Coach Distom stressed how important it was to get by on the floor in advance of the ACC opener against Duke Theyre going to get Dongo for reaching in Now Coach Denmark said you know we got to drive the car around a little bit before we throw it on the highway Protect the onetwo punch of them on the front court Interior defense rim protection is going to bode well for the Jackets come ACC play Reminds you that onetwo punch that Mike and John Babel had on the grid iron Yeah And defensive ends Defensive end Two tight ends one wide receiver split Just throw it up Got some bounce Quarterbacks with tails between their legs Remack into the corner Crab triggers a three Air ball And now Washington draws contact till head is the line Chance to snap Georgia Techs 70 run that has stretched this to a 10point lead Jackets in this one 11 of 18 from the field High efficiency three of five 60 from threepoint range I like the concerted effort to throw it inside Points in the paint The advantage for the Jackets 14 to6 a plus eight advantage Lamar Washington stepping in for Chaz Kelly That was the biggest question coming into the season was what did that point guard position look like And on the eve of ACC play John I think youve got to be pretty satisfied with the way the pieces have fallen into place the way Lamar Washington has taken that primary role but also the quality minutes Chaz Kelly has given when he spells Washington in that spot Absolutely And a guy like Mustaf who started with the ball in his hands at point guard the first few games of the season Washington thought that was going to shake Washingtons more of a pure point guard But to come off the bench with Mustaf Kelly Craft a guy that can shoot the ball Uh I I like the rotation that coach starters found Game number 13 of the season for the Yellow Jackets Cila a little off balance Brings it in and lays it in Reeves kind of hung up there lobbed it up high only where Sila could get it Nice assist by Reeves Think theres any question Reeves playing the best basketball of his 5year college career Baker attacks Cila swats Will they give him the basket They will not Cas been called for a couple of goendings this year I think coach Charlie Ward had a question about it What do you see here Great shot blockers coming away from the basketball Its on the way up Its going up Cila elevates Get a good look at it right here Mo said no That production crew on point right there Just quick George Institute of Technology Oh man thats on point Shot clock about to expire Baker got it away And now Washington slings it ahead plenty oneonone He draws the foul and hell go to the free throw line Thats guy you won at the line coming off an 11 for 12 uh outing at the stripe in the win against Lafayette on December 20th That was the Jackets last game So hes got some rest Hes probably got some more reps in the gym on the week off And uh this guy wanted the money line And take a look at that number on the bottom right of our scorebug This is as a team for Georgia Tech Shot 61 from the free throw line And yes weve put the curse on a Kai Fleming apparently But to see that improvement and coach Damar credits a lot of it to that 10day break he had between the Monmouth game on December 6th and returning to action after finals against Merist But the Yellow Jackets its no secret they have struggled from the free throw line the last few years you know beyond the Damon Statamire era And that is a a significant step and one thats going to help them in ACC play You just you cant afford to leave points at the line in this league FloridaM struggling to get in the half court and Shirley has it knocked loose And with four seconds left Floridas got to get it in and let it clock Swarming Yellow Jackets defense on there And Rattlers just 25 from the field on this one Three of 12 from beyond the arc six of 24 from the field Georgia Tech really didnt ask for their defense to get a half court Missed their last eight shots and now just three seconds to shoot And this is some of the defense we saw in the first month of the season in November Just tremendous length for the Yellow Jackets Really one through five Yeah thats their strength And Georgia Techs on a 100 run 122 over the last 5 minutes Rattlers early offense is a premium for them Theyve got to get something going in transition and early in the offense They get in a half court game against Georgia Tech Its going to be a long long day Over five minutes without a point for FloridaM Anquin Balden Jr trying to change that Goes up and he got the foul Georgia Tech with that last turnover Six turnovers in game here Well get another look defensively Ramadan moving right Got to hold his position there Wy two feet straight Automatic foul Slide the feet hands came down Anquin Balden Jr at the line missed his first And we mentioned Anquin Balden senior former Florida State seol Heres a look at Popss resume here with his son at the free throw line NCAA champion a 1999 Super Bowl champion And you know that Walter Payton man of the year award that if you talk to Anquin Balden senior thats right up there with those other two accomplishments and Balden missed them both By the way quarterback on that 1999 Florida State team Chris Winky called the plays yesterday for Georgia Tech in their bowl game Moila hits another two and Georgia Tech starting to really separate themselves The lead is up to 15 FloridaM they have not scored in nearly six minutes in the corner Another miss Rattlers just cannot buy a bucket right now Washington got the roll Thats where hes been great Uh north to south playing downhill Hes got six rebounds in this Five assists four points for Washington Seven different scores for the Yellow Jackets Like I said hes been flirting with a triple double though Lamar Washington Looks like he might be on track to do that again today Shirley there it is More of a sigh of relief from Shirley than anything else FloridaM just happy to see one go through Reeves to a cutting sila and Jaquan Sanders sniffs it out but he cant stop it without the foul Georgia Tech did a nice job penetrating pass into the high post and that sagging two3 defense and if the ball gets high in the post thats where the defense collaps corner wide open nice execution by Georgia Tech and this is Cila this is where he needs to improve and he knows it hes working on it but hes a sub 40 free throw shooter hes got the second most free throw attempts on the season for Georgia Tech and thats why their free throw percentage numbers a a little bit screwed That one looked straight on Now Anthony Nullles going to replace Antonio Baker Jr See on the season 18 of 44 from the free throw line and hes going to live here I mean hes just so talented Hes got great hands He plays above the rim and weve already seen it today Hes going to get those interior opportunities and the opponent will foul So hes just got to keep working on it And its going to be critical if you want to have him on the floor at the end of games too Knowing the free throw struggles hes going to have to knock those down late Sanders Poor pass And now Mustaf floats to Reeves Its off his foot And now the Rattlers racing the other way Balden with a step and hes stuffed Reeves Keep your head on a swivel in this one John Well thats just great execution by the Jackets Uh its swarming defense Elevate with two guys contesting I think Fleming got the block but it was just a quick keep it in play One lob pass up 3 seconds later Reeves is laid in on the other side Defense to offense conversion was tremendous on that play Nolles cutting Chapman tough threepoint shot Balden wins the rebound Nolles No FloridaM now four of 17 from three Cila cant finish from point blank Got his own miss But go back to the free throw line Yellow Jackets getting it done defensive points to lead all Yellow Jacket scorers and gets the roll Committed to the shot I like it Holding the free throw uh follow through and gets the bounce Two of three from the line in the game came in as a top 30 prospect in his freshman class across the country As Mo hits to the bench John this is the seventh time youve had a chance to watch him up close and personal What has your impression been of watching Mo Sila for two months I love his competitive spirit I think theres a super high ceiling on where he can take his game just based on his size his athleticism his heart his hustle Um certainly free throws today Hes three or four from the field Thats an area of weakness but guys averaging 11 and eight as a freshman Um and hes going to be a major piece of the puzzle for the Jackets as they get in the league play FloridaM we talked about their struggles shooting How much of that is due to shot selection versus just not making shots that they should hit I think a combination Theyve had some really good looks Uh theyve theyre moving the basketball well Theyre executing their stuff offensively and and Georgia Tech got to be careful its not fools gold Yes of course theyre holding the opponent to 22 but when you walk into Cameron Indoor on Wednesday night thats a different opponent And and so you you got to coach through that and and you dont want to have um you know like they say never celebrate the success too much and dont get too too low on the losses Uh but just being real with yourself and the film never lies Wy I know this coaching staff does a great job watching film with these players Kelly drills a three Thats now nine points for Chaz Kelly today Thats already a season high The Yellow Jackets up by 22 And look at Dongo coming across the lane to block him Fleming Flying Thats what I like about the Georgia Tech shot blockers their ability to block shots and keep them in play And its really valuable to keep them in play start the break Georgia Tech scoring in transition off of those blocks Looks like Lamar Washington may have reached in Washington And one more time you see Dongo on the defensive end And then how about the vision from Mustaf lift off Again it was a year ago that Kai Fleming underwent that knee surgery and was on the shelf for months Uh it doesnt look like he has lost any spring from where he was prior to the injury Hes got serious bounce Great length there Another one and done possession for the Jackets Theyre really doing a nice job defensively Mike Dungo bringing up the floor Zipped inside Washington steps into a three home run pass and Caleb Washington with the jam here in his hometown Nine points for Caleb Hes got some bounce too First career start Graduate of Wheeler High School And now going the other way 3 seconds to locker room out of the timeout Baker into Balden Jr attacks wont go Texas doing a great job securing 5050 balls in the paint Theyre just seeming a little bit quicker to the punch getting their hands on loose live balls and a plus 14 advantage on the backboard 28 to 14 in this one Not a single Yellow Jacket in double figures yet and very balanced Another turnover Thats nine now in the first half for the Yellow Jackets I imagine Coach Stoddier and staff will hop on that at halftime Um you know continuing to coach continuing to get better Again a 22point advantage but coach Stomire knows whats coming Youre going into Duke on Wednesday night and you just cant beat yourself You got to take care of the basketball The rebounding and defense has been on point for the Jackets but thats an area improvement that you can address at the half 5 seconds left in the first half Nolles off balance A wild shot Dongo the rebound and thatll close the book on the first 20 Georgia Tech a 22 point Was great They got a nice punch off the bench But as you bring bench players into the second half you dont want to dip You actually want to go up in energy with those guys coming off the bench Lamar Washington taking it to the hole to get the second half started with the bucket A great start I think you know put your opponent away Thats thatd be a strong focus Dont allow FloridaM to get back in this Washington Its been the highlight for FloridaM thus far and hes now the only player in double figures with that bucket 11 points FloridaM if they can just string together a few consecutive stops theyre not having the ability to get second chance points so I think transition offense for them is at a premium theyve really got to push the pace if they want to get back in this one by Dongo splash now three for seven from threepoint land this year continuing to feed Caleb Washington making his first start of the season Shirley tries to feed down low disrupted by Fleming of Kuisi Reeves comes up with it Congo just backing down on Washington and he gets the roll Washington giving up probably 20 pounds on that a couple inches and that was just ISO basketball Dongo backed it in There was no offense called It was just oneonone Sanders A long three swish Jaquan Sanders Hes shooting close to 40 from three this year Moa on the other end Easy Sanders on the season was 15 of 41 from beyond the arc coming into this one And that was from long range Offensive rebound Rare chance for second chance points Jaquan Sanders cashes it in All of a sudden FloridaM starting to find their rhythm offensively They scored just five points in the final nine minutes of that first half Theyve put up eight already in the opening two and a half minutes of the second Sila not quite with the touch Tongo on the offensive glass again Tongo filling the stat sheet early on in this second half Theres two rebounds on that one Another two points Uh the interior passing again the ability for Georgia Tech to get the ball to the high post breaking down the defense one and done Alioop look maybe and Dongo has it knocked loose Good line entry pass though Yeah great court vision by Washington He had a solid first half Uh four points but he had six rebounds and uh five assists just one turnover in the first half Caleb Washington takes a seat as does Moila for Georgia Tech Balden and Mustaf come back in for FloridaM and Georgia Tech respectively Mustaf tough shot and he earns the free throws Just too much size for the Yellow Jackets on the interior And theyve really done a nice job a concerted effort to find Dongo find Cila inside the paint The perimeters done a nice job attacking off the bounce Take it in post to the line I got three I got three Hits the first Sophomore out of Buoie Maryland Coming off the bench for the second time this year today goes one for two at the line And a turnover on a poor pass from FloridaM That one stinks Coach Board looking on now Cant do much about that one East to west pass Unforced turnover Washington The runner Yellow Jackets shooting 62 from the floor They hit six of their first nine shots in this half Long rebound Chapmans got it Balden slicing and now cutting Chapman goes up Hes blocked off of FloridaM Couldnt handle another block for the Yellow Jackets And that presence in the front court court I mean he feels like theyve got one of the best front courts in the nation The problem has been they hadnt been fully healthy most of the starting to get healthy at the right time with Duke and ACC play on the horizon High low draft backside cut Yeah when Georgia Tech gets the ball into the elbow area free throw area that middle section of the zone soft zone theyre just really having their way with the Rattlers Batman trying to curl in Fleming denies it Five to shoot Shirley at the end of the clock Tested shot and great defensive possession for Georgia Tech around the ACC today Boston College sweating one out against Le Moine under four to play Thats a fourpoint game The Eagles have the advantage and then SMU have their way with Cal State Fullerton up by 32 in that one Those are the final nonconference ACC games this year League play starts Tuesday night Everybody off tomorrow Dongo puts it on the floor with the left Work back up to Chaz Kelly going to face his former school in the ACC home opener when BC comes here on Saturday Remigan off the mark down for Baker three ball No Really that possession has been a snapshot of what its been like for FAMU today That was really good offense They moved the ball crisp unselfish play and resulted in a miss threepoint shot but high percentage shot still bad for coach Ward and Mustaf lays it in and theres some positive to be drawn from that if youre FloridaM right I mean obviously you got to make your shots but if youre running good offense youre getting those looks theres got to be a belief of okay you know next time out were going to hit those Gustaf baseline acceleration And a foul coming here on Tyler Shirley This is going to be his fourth Mustaf on that play Nice read on a poor closeout And hes one of the best players on the Yellow Jackets roster at drawing fouls He has a knack for that Another interior music score right there Interior passing but Mustaf going north to south off the bounce His ability to draw contact and get to the free throw line Its one of his strengths Now this wont be his first time going through an ACC schedule but you know how critical is having that presence of a guy who can drive and draw contact against some pretty difficult front courts How valuable is that going to be for Georgia Tech You know I I think what he brings is is size and strength and defense And you know he doesnt need to be the best scorer He just needs to be in control out there take care of the basketball when you get to the line knock those free throws down But Mustaf has a great build great athleticism He can guard one through three If hes going to switch on a four he can hold his own Uh hes a valuable player on the defensive side of the basketball Balden floats it in Kelly take another trip to the free throw line This foul coming and Antonio Baker Jr doing a nice job from the free throw line today Theyre eight for 11 from strike today That continues that trend we talked about where the Yellow Jacket shooting nearly 60 from the free throw line in November They have shot close to 80 so far in December Second free throw coming for Chaz Kelly By the way he is Charles Kelly the third Some didnt luck Charles just had to go to Chaz I thought Chaz was going to be perfect for the game until he missed that free throw Hes three of three from the field Two of two from three before that miss He was two of two from the line Uh hes got 10 points Second lead score for the Jackets Yeah First time in double figures this year for Georgia Tech Washington gets separation from Mustafa Thats where its a big time offensive play and the ability to control pace had great positioning and put that right shoulder into the chest of Mustaf to create space Hes been a bright spot today for FloridaM And theres Chaz Kelly with a dozen Leads all Yellow Jackets The Rattlers Washington and Sanders have combined for 25 of their 35 in the game Washington to add to that total He will Caleb Washington What a homecoming for the senior from Atlanta Wheeler High School Kira tries to go up and has it knocked away and we got a foul coming here on Mustaf not happy about but their schedule has not been overtly challenging I think for the Yellow Jackets you know you knock out that Duke game early first game of the year on the road and then well see North Carolina at home on January 31st well see Virginia in Atlanta on February 18th and then you go to Louisville So those four top 25 ranked ACC opponents Theres some balance there Two at home two on the road for coach startm But then you come back and you got Boston College and Syracuse backtoback home games on January 3rd and January 6th And theres a premium on winning at home Wy we know in this league you got to try to take care of home Georgia Tech in the nonconference slate 81 on preman court Good take that time from Jacoan Sanders And the real question that I have John is how many bids is the ACC going to get as a league They only got four last year which many would tell you was hard to imagine but the league appears to be stronger this year Yeah I believe so I I think across the league uh theres more parody in that you know we saw those four teams in the top 25 Duke Carolina Virginia Louisville but the parody from say five to nine in this league Uh it just depends how it shakes here uh in January and February but the talent is there Jackets finished eighth in the ACC last year at 10 and 10 I think you look at teams like Clemson and Miami has had a nice nonconference slate Um some good wins Mustaf draws the foul there against the Nard Taylor Thatll put him at the line And I think I mean objectively looking at where Georgia Tech currently stands youre eight and four The schedule has been softer than in years past I think that made a lot of sense given how much turnover you had on the roster and what you were hoping to sort of gel into which feels like was where Georgia Tech has gotten to But knowing that you knew they were going to have to have a quality ACC record if they want to make the NCAA tournament and all that still in front of them But you mentioned those four ranked teams I think you know for the Yellow Jackets you got to have the feel you want to pick off maybe a couple of them those two games at home just from a quality wins standoint stepped on the line So a turnover by FloridaM got a long way to go WY 1022 Georgia Tech up 28 Uh FloridaM continues to just hurt themselves with some errant passes and the missed threes have been the Achilles heel for them today Eric Chadfield Jr on the floor And John we were looking at that schedule Georgia Tech they will not play SMU They will play Cal twice and Clemson twice but they will not play SMU And going from an 18 game schedule or big part from a 20ame ACC schedule back down to 18 this year Thats where you get to sometimes these leagues are so big Its got a little more complicated than the old uh 16 game schedule eight and eight home and away and and that was it laughter I know Atlantic coast you dont expect to play Cal and Stanford on the Atlantic coast but uh you know thats thats the way it shakes under 10 minutes to play Sanders No offensive rebound Balden and FloridaM Theyve now hit six of their last eight shots Again that doesnt feel like the game is in question quite yet but the Rattlers are playing much better I music think the onetwo punch with Washington and Sanders uh for FloridaM on most nights in league play those two guys can score with the best of them Theyre athletic Theyve got great size great length and they have versatile offensive skill sets What a night its been for Caleb Washington 18 points He came in today averaging just 5 and a half but stepping in for Miles Lama their 611 center And Washingtons come up big Now Boulder great cut and finish The strongest stretch for FloridaM so far this afternoon Weve seen glimpses the Rattlers the ability to move without the basketball and still fighting still competing but Georgia Tech dominating the interior and Damon Statamire didnt from so first ever meeting as opposing head coaches and while they were contemporaries in college Florida State and Arizona never faced each other when they were both there Although for what its worth Charlie Wards first year in the NBA Florida State went to Tucson Damon Statamire and the Wildcats got the win So turnover out of the timeout Georgia Tech is back on defense Washingtons already got 18 today Cutting in and the pass picked off Dongo wants to run the floor Chadfield a three Drilled it Just earned some minutes Chadfield quick trigger Great looking freshman Had a great senior year at Pace Academy playing for uh coach Charman White Also instrumental in USA basketballs under 18 program Jquad Sanders with the answer Eric Champfield Jr the AJC Metro player of the year Great write up by Georgia Tech beat writer Chad Bishop the Eric Chadfield story A lot of good threads to pull Go check that out Foul coming here ongo and Fleming throwa in the mix Those are three freshman that you can build around uh talented guys can play both sides of the basketball and all three what I like about them is their competitive spirit They all play hard Under eight minutes to play Washingtonm with it The extra pass Sanders Oh he missed the chip shot and he cant finish the threepoint play either Foul coming on Fleming and itll be couple of free throws Wednesday night and then a triple header of quarterfinal action all day New Years Day and then you move ahead to the semifinals John One of those two semifinals will be at the ChickfilA Bowl or I should say will be the ChickfilA Bowl at MercedesBenz Stadium just down the street Atlanta can draw some events Historically city has hosted some of the great sporting events cross basketball football baseball college and professional levels They never had the ACC tournament when you were here in Atlanta did they Senior year we played No kidding Oh yeah We lost to North Carolina in the semifinal Uh Jill Forte was their best player that year Chris Lang Brennan Hayward Its a pretty good team I just remember guarding Julius Peppers I took an elbow from him and I still hurt from it laughter If we if we bump shoulders I think I would hurt Yeah he he did well on Sundays Lets say you know I got a taste of that on the on the hoops court No question Suppose its fitting we began the day talking about John Babel at defensive end We finished talking about Julius Peppers on John Babel laughter Yellow Jackets get the stop I do remember the feel though coming out uh you know running out on on this court you know the Thriller Dome and then going out on that court that day at the Georgia Dome 60000 fans and it just the energy in that building was you know something Ill remember for my life Caleb Washington hes going to remember this one for a long time How about 20 points in your first start of the season in your hometown I really like his game I Hes versatile Hes got a great high release Goes off the bounce Knocked down a three earlier in this one His first ever division one start He spent a couple years at Dayton and transferred to B Community College in Kansas A big part He did start nine games last year beforeM But first start of the season And look at his size uh his high release his confidence uh looks like its through the roof right now Gets the start feeling good about himself in front of his family and friends here in Atlanta And he was a guy that came on late for FloridaM last year in swag play Seven of those nine starts he made were inside the league Kisi Reeves this three short and Washington zips it inside by Dongo Knows what to do Yeah Sanders lost track of Dongo behind him An easy bucket for the Jackets So Dongo not a bad return to action Uh 11 points 10 boards You go double double in your first game back since early December He is in ACC form averaging a double double in the league last year as Tyler Shirley comes on for Caleb Washington Sanders to the line shooting one and one We talked a lot about Georgia Tech in their upcoming schedule and how drawn Duke out of the shoot Thats a tough assignment Well courtm theyve got a tough first game as well inside the swag Bethun Cookman was picked to win the league They go on the road to face Bthun Cookman to get the league started And on the offensive rebound off the free throw theres Jaquan Sanders again Sanders 14 points in the second half Washington has 11 in the second half 25 of the 31 second half points from those two bright spots for the Rattlers You know second half play you come out youre down 20 plus The ability to keep playing hard and working on your craft Theyre 13 of 25 from the field in the second half just shy of 50 Whats peculiar is Sanders going two of six from the free throw line He was 15 for 15 entering today He hadnt missed one all year Now hes two of six today Another foul coming here Its going to be number three on Chapman Washingtons back in One of the stats you look at as a coach is effort plays and offensive rebounding is certainly an effort stat FloridaM with eight offensive rebounds in the second half So theyve you know theyve continued to fight Uh Georgia Tech just the better team today Sanders nails another jump Leads down to 19 Down to 17 on the turnover Georgia Techs got to refocus A little bit casual lackadasical right now And Washington with the block but itll also be called for the foul 4 am right back in this one 17point game And theyve left get this eight points at the free throw line Theyre two of 10 from the free throw line Could be a much different story if they were knocking them down 70 run over the last minute Reeves gets the roll on his free throw in double figures again today That puts four Yellow Jackets now in double figures Kelly with 12 Dongo 11 and Nila 11 Got three other three others in addition to those four with eight points on board So lead is 19 Still five minutes to play Nearly turned over as Fleming got his hand in the way of that pass targeting Sanders laughter Well Babel youre on it He saved my my head He caught it right here It was right in front of me Didnt miss it Sanders jacks a three And an offensive rebound Washington goes up Two more free throws coming again Right there The effort I I I love the way FloridaM has come out in the second half and just continue to play hard They have outscored Georgia Tech in this second half 3532 as it currently stands Charlie Ward wants to look at the box score I think thats an old one I think that might be from the first half Took that right from you Babel Hes referencing fouls Its going to be about 8 minutes low Theres a look at 40 combined points between Washington and Sanders Under five minutes to play the lead is down to 18 Ill stick with Georgia Tech Well John it felt like Georgia Tech came out of the locker room in the second half Theyre playing sharp They got the lead up to as many as 30 in the opening five minutes In fact they got all the way up to 34 before FloridaMs begun chipping away at it And again at 20 points and four and a half to go I dont feel like the games in jeopardy but the Rattlers have certainly played sharper these last 10 minutes Gongo with the rebound already with a double double today Wsons a little off balance but gets to go How about that The change of pace took a little contact on the way to the basket and throws the floater in Reeves lost his footing Three goes up and down Tyler Shirley Rattlers five of 11 from beyond the arc in the second half Like you pointed out they had the lead over TCU after one half of play in Fort Worth last week They put together a similarly strong second half but Georgia Tech with a 202 point lead at halftime has kept this game out OF REACHES BY DGO RIPS IT AWAY from Sanders He goes up and hes got two 15 points 11 rebounds five assists for Dongo And a foul coming here underneath the basket The offensive foul on Balden Extended the right arm Did the shoulder Georgia Tech in control Up 21 317 to play Rattlers trying to hang around knocked a few down but Georgia Tech music continues to dominate with plays like this dongo music One assist today eight from Lamar Washington four more from Jaden Mustaf and five from Bona Yeah B just clean up the turnovers of the RI Hes five turnovers five assists Clean that up Thats solid floor game Fleming a little out of control Gets the foul call on Washington here Foul coming here on Washington And now we got a technical foul Looks like a technical foul coming here on a Kai Fleming See what happens after this We didnt see it in that shot Maybe he threw a foot out or kicked I dont know Did Did you see any action Not Not on that shot Im going to try and take a look back here as Shirley misses the first free throw It didnt look like he said anything My only thing is did he kick when he was on the ground We couldnt catch it in that camera angle but well try to find out Shirley hits the second free throw Would have to be either a verbal See what does he do with the basketball The ball comes back at him So he kind of threw it towards Washington Suspect I dont know if I agree with that one Wy It looked like he gunned the ball Yeah might have been one to go over the wall And I think if you talk to Tony Henderson he would tell you been calling it by the book But if youre able to incorporate intent there so next time just you hand the ball to the official Thats the I suppose thats thats the coaching takeaway I think so Think you would have called that on coach K at Cameron John laughter Thats a question Im not going to answer Just saying Yep I I didnt think there was much to that No it didnt appear Certainly no intent Surely crossover three too strong By the way those five assists for uh Bango do tie a careerhigh looking for Kiraak instead of turnover and Anquan Balden Jr Rerss got some nice size and athleticism Um you know they did not shoot the ball well in the first half from beyond the arc but second half theyve really competed on both sides of the ball Theyve made 17 shots in this second half compared to just the eight in the first half Theres now a lot of subs coming in here for FloridaM Well see from Amir Raman as well as Malcolm Study And bringing the ball up the floor Anthony Nolles freshman from Miami Final two minutes here The Yellow Jackets are going to improve 10 and0 all time against FloridaM And a foul coming here on Deb Raman our big part Is that Chadfield Its Chadfield It was Chadfield They do favor each other from behind I I give you that side profile the hair number 10 right there And Chatfield number two he they can throw you off if youre looking quick glance or if you dont know what youre doing Yeah Same same hairstyle Nolles knocks down the first free throw And thats going to be probably the top of the list for coach Charlie Ward Five of 15 for FloridaM from the free throw line And for all the good that Jaquan Sanders and Caleb Washington did combining for 41 points they went three for 10 combined at the free throw line No youre right about that And I think Florida did a much better job in the second half certainly shooting the basketball Uh but rebounding They really rebounded on both sides of the floor They competed uh for Georgia Tech You go into Duke on Wednesday night you look at the turnovers 20 turnovers Uh but defensively for the game hold your opponent to 37 from the field Thats pretty good And Chaz Kelly 14 points now five of five from the floor Its about as efficient as it gets just two shy off his careerhigh all time in college He had 17 a couple years ago when playing for Boston College As efficient as it gets while he would be if he was three I was waiting for that I was waiting for that He did miss one free throw One more time on this take as he brings it past Jacobe Hall number 23 joined the team today We are told he was with the football team as a tight end up until today Boy he has no name in the back of his jersey We hardly saw any fouls called earlier in this game John Weve seen a ton called here in the second half Yes for sure Georgia Tech again that was a bright spot today 15 of 20 from the line 75 Theyve missed a couple down the stretch but its good to see them continuing to improve at the free throw line And they are 60 shooting now from the field in this game Fleming hits them both As we enter the final minute FloridaM has outscored Georgia Tech Beg your pardon Both Theyre dead even now 44 all in the second half Andm has outrebounded Georgia Tech in the second half Thats gonna be Yellow Jacket basketball But to your point Chaz Kelly efficient Youve got Bango 15 points 11 boards another double double along with careerhigh five assists Lamar Washington 10 points seven boards eight assists He he can flirt with a triple double by the end of the season And he had three turnovers eight assists to three turnovers I I love his toughness Hes hes playing solid basketball and Georgia Tech will need him um just to step up His leadership his toughness his steadiness is the word I look for Who can steady the ship on the road as youre going to face teams youre going to go that are going to go on runs you know can you stick around Uh and whos your vocal leader Thats one thing that you know whos going to huddle you up on the road by Dongo packed today Hes a guy that could really step up with the Jackets and being that you know more senior leader vocal guy Rema again with the rebound And with that that ought to bring this 13game nonconference schedule to a close for Georgia Tech And they do it with a comfortable win the second game of a mens and womens double header Georgia Tech sweeps them both And now it is on to the 18 game ACC schedule for head coach Damon Statamire and the Yellow Jackets
