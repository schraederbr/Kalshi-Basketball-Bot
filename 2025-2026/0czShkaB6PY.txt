comes in with a seven and six record Clarence Armstrong our lead official And Boston College wins the tip into the hands of their point guard Luca Tay a sophomore from Tokyo Japan His mom is Japanese Dad is American Hes got the basketball now His dad as a matter of fact is a womens basketball coach in Japan Its the family business Inside they go first possession to Jaden Hastings And the sophomore from Orlando has Boston College on the board first I like that right there And Tay settles them down that first possession They go right inside their bread and butter Little hook shot right at the rim Good high field goal percentage shot Theyre going to need good looks like that all night long There There you see the big fella Pton Marshall getting the start because Mohamed Cila is out with an ankle sprain And if you watch the game at Duke the other day you could see he was laboring up and down the floor And so CILA did not participate in shoot round this morning Not available here today And a starting five for BC trying to take a four five nothing lead Instead here comes Georgia Tech back the other way Kasi Reeves first shot attempt a little bit strong Pulled down by Fred Payne who will dribble up Payne into the lane and his pass is stolen away by Bayandongo Quickly back the other way Kesi throws it down Well thats what Kesi Reed does Sure he can shoot the triple Like I say 48 over his last eight games but hes really good in transation Hes got great legs Loves to get out and run Averaging 16 points Little Wy as hes known to his family His dad of course is Big Wasy Makes it 22 Pay Good challenge by the freshman Aai Fleming Ball goes out of bounds Yeah Got to take care of those outlet passes and secure them I love that rebound by Dongo Going to need more Kimchu and glass today But a quick outlet looking up the floor find cutter in the middle of the paint for the easy two hand a onehand finish And Scott that was one of the concerns Boston College head coach Earl Grant talked about prior to tip off How about the bounce for three by Luca Taves Iron so kind here in the new year for TAZ That thing went up well above the square on that first bounce and fell back through the net That was a long two for the 44 threepoint shooter Dongo getting himself back into game shape Beautiful feed Marshall couldnt finish Ball comes around back to Dongo That was a beautiful pass by Dongo Marshalls got to go up more power around the basket Now hes working on Aiden Shaw who rips the ball away Its a held ball Possession error will stay at this end for the Yellow Jackets I tell you what right now Eagles really playing some good defense Talented ball handlers in at the rim there that time against Marshall to come out as a fired up bunch Theyre one of the best teams in the ACC defensively Well get into some of their numbers as this game goes on Coach Grant wants his team as always to build a fort around the basket defensively Try to make it tough on Georgia Tech And with two on the shot clock the foul is called Meanwhile for Damon Starttomire year number three is the head coach at Georgia Tech The 52yearold native of Portland Oregon Back in the day started Woodro Wilson High School has been renamed since for civil rights activist IdaB Wells And of course Damon Starttomire the rookie of the year in the NBA back in 95 One heck of a player in the NBA and doing a good job here as a coach had him 17 up 17 down last year Already looking for the 10th win this afternoon Marshall turns it over Caves drives on Lamar Washington who stays with him Heres Donald Han Jr averaging nearly 16 points per game looking for his first two Hand into the lane Finds the cutter That was Marshall that went down like a pile of bricks Good use of the pump fake got Marshall in the air Im glad that young man is okay He went down hard Theres one more time Both teams with some good early interior passing and you see that little just head and shoulder fake gets Marshall up off the floor and he was able to protect himself before he hit the hardwood At 300 lb anytime he comes down its hard You aint got to tell me about it Im Im well over 300 We got to be about four or five guys that help me up if I hit the hard one Dont go down We need you Taves tough shot Air balls it Tracks down his own miss Seven on the timer Nice dump off but the reverse is missed by Hastings Around and out on Donald Han Jr Three looks at that Both of whom are very good looks and couldnt get it to go down Cole Kurowak has come into the game for the first time Big number eight for Tech And for the Yellow Jackets not having Mohamed Cila here today What does that do to what theyre doing on both ends of the floor Well its going to theyre not going to be able to get as big a presence defensively Marshalls going to try to provide some size down there but music uh Big Mo is just a little bit more better athletic player And on the offensive end some of the finishes you can see Marshall struggling around the basket with finishes Once he didnt finish another time he got it stripped away On the inbound Reeves is fouled and will shoot two Meanwhile the big story line for BC is that Fred Payne has gone out of the game with his second personal foul replaced by Caleb Steager And Payne and Hand are really their only two reliable offensive pieces Yeah theyre top two top two two and three uh in the top of the ACC in minutes played So we were saying before we came on air theyre going to need 35 minutes uh out of both of these guys So a quick two for pain is bad news for coach Grant at the line shooting to Kesi Reeves Jr from Mon Georgia in his fifth year third here at Georgia Tech after starting his college career in Gainesville Florida Boston College one of its last six from the floor including those three misses on one possession you were talking about Scott Inside they go again to Hastings Over the left shoulder for two Well I like this kid Hastings the more I watch BC on tape Big strong young man Hes like a chicken wing connoisseur Loves throwing that left elbow into you and throwing that right hand hook And we welcome those of you watching Virginia Tech and Wake Forest We are in Atlanta Georgia Early stages of the Boston College Georgia Tech game with Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman And weve got our first media to start this basketball game He had to come out Yeah So for Earl Grant the head coach at Boston College you really only got two reliable offensive players in Donald Han Jr and Fred Payne Where do you go if youre Coach Grant with Payne already saddled in foul trouble Well I like this big kid Jaden Hastings I tell you what this guys a wide load down there He goes 69 245 lbs Hes out of IMG Academy Hes got a great little left shoulder turn right hand hook Hes got a lot of beef Hes got a little nasty to him but you got to get him to that ball down on that low block for him to be effective Well Hastings already has four of BCs six points Gentleman coming out of IMG Academy was offered by Georgia Tech among others before choosing BC Breeze with all six Georgia Tech points Bowden Capy has come into the game for Boston College Thats number 33 in the maroon And Chase Forte he has been a starting point guard at times this year for BC Back in there And now the former Boston College Eagle comes into the game to go against his former teammates Chaz Kelly III a senior from Houston who was the starting point guard at times last year for the visiting team Got to be weird It is a little weird Ive had that happen to me a number of times in the NBA but I tell you what you get hyped for it Youre ready to play You want to show those guys what theyre missing Well I guess the equivalent would have been if you left North Carolina and then transferred to Clemson or something how weird it would have been to beat Little John and here come the Tarheelss walking in I would never go to Clemson but laughter or Duke for that matter Well I knew that I Theres no way youre going to the school I have to get at least Yeah I have to get at least a state or two away Thats for sure Nearly 5 minutes in here at McCamish Pavilion The first ACC regular season game for BC The second for Georgia Tech This is their home conference opener Smooth move in the lane for DJ Donald Han Jr his first two points Yeah I tell you what Donald Han Jr can absolutely do it Most improved player in the ACC last year He makes tough takes tough shots and makes tough shots but his usage and his efficiency has gone down this year shooting only 34 from the floor Heroak grabs the miss able to find Jay Mustaf who missed from in the lane Boston College with it on top by two Yeah I like the big fella grabbing that basketball that offensive rebound crunching glass but he got to take his time when hes down there He acted like that was a live grenade in his hands Well hes 7 ft 199 lbs Kiraak is going to be a handful once he puts on more weight and more strength Here he is defending captain Staker has it blocked by Reeves who is called for the foul And Kesi cant believe it Jerry Heer the official who called it had a long stare back at Reeves and said Uh Im not so sure I want you doing that No but it was nice the way he gave the young man to get his emotions under control Right Its that side challenge It looks like its pretty much all Paul Coach Dontomire also agreed with Reeves and thought it was a good block but he gave the young man enough time to get himself back under control and guard you know gather his emotions Hes having too good a game to get a technical or get tossed out of this thing and derail his early offense and then Well Reeves was right You saw on the replay that was a clean block but he has now got two personal fouls and at least for the time being Damon Starttomire leaves him on the floor Yeah he does not have the luxury of pulling out of this one You know down by three now down by four early in this game Hes going to get him out of the game Thatll calm down a moment Um but I think he could stay on that bench Certainly not the rest of this half Maybe not more than a minute or two Well youll remember in the game against Duke last Wednesday they went small for a good part of the second half Part because of injury but part out of necessity flanked four guards with only one bigger guy We may see more of that here in the first half with Moila out for the game with an ankle injury And now Reeves out with two fouls Yeah And coach Donire he he said listen I dont have talent as some of these teams in the ACC I guess hes got a grimy bunch that love to compete and uh hes happy to roll with the guys lot on his squad that just like you said are just toughminded individuals and go out there or just leave it all on the floor Mustaf traveled Good defense off the bench for freshman Marco Redovich to help force that turnover Out of the game goes Kiraak And there is Ronovich who doesnt provide much offensively And now Cam Craft will come into the game for Georgia Tech A red shirt junior from Chicago and a transfer from Xavier and most recently Miami Ohio Yeah hes got to get himself going offensively And this is the guy with leaves out who can get hot but hes he has to make his first couple shots to gain that early confidence Hands going to work and Trap has his first rebound since coming in And here is Lamar Washington Jamon Stomire said I should have started him earlier in the season He came off the bench for a handful of games after missing the first two with injury He has been that good in that point guard role for the Jackets this season Yeah it really has Hes led him in uh assist in nine games Hes fourth in the ACC in assist Looked like Dango got his hand on that pass Last to touch The Boston College will keep with 13 on the time clock Theres Marco Rodanovich 66 205 freshman from Montenegro at this early start time has not thrown Georgia Tech off just a little bit Right This is a couple fouls by Reeds A little sloppy play by some of the the other guys Missed opportunities around the basket Got shots blocked Sometimes starting early just throw your body clock off BC turns it over Heres Chaz Kelly the third off the hesitation able to go to the left hand but it rolls out Yeah just not finishing at the basket right now Just something uh just not in rhythm not working They had 14 points in the first four minutes at Duke Meanwhile Georgia Tech has missed nine of its last 10 shots Well that will put the percentage up off the nice feed Dungo has his first two points Thats a beautiful feed by Jaden Moose just bounced it right there in the painted air where he comes up high for the big fella to be able to catch and finish Heres Forte Brad transfer on his fourth stop in college Hand back out Kathys got a clean look off the back iron No Down with it cheering The senior point guard Lamar Washington puts his head down Gets into the lane Finds the open man from the corner 43 As we talk about Craft Being that bump off the bench knocking down the triple He had 25 points off the bench at Duke That was a big shot there out of the corner pocket three Well he shot 43 last year at Miami Ohio from distance So far not as well this year 33 But a big triple to tie the score at 11 Now weve got a foul on the drive And thatll bring us to our under2 media timeout the Eagles and the Yellow Jackets deadlocked at 11 As we saw Brett Payne sitting on the BC bench with a couple of fouls His running mate Donald Han Jr at the free throw line and he still has a hitch in his free throw But after a dreadful start to the season at the line hes actually been very good since the second game of the year Hes made 80 Yeah that hitch does not look good Im not sure whos working with him but they got to try to fix that cuz you said hes under 14 of 27 from the uh free throw line to start the season And as you said shooting 80 over his last 10 games So its getting better but thats not something that you want in your game long term Well he got one out of two was honorable mention all ACC last year while he was the most improved player in the league Ill tell you what Jaden Mustaf at 63 210 is a physical force for Georgia Tech Yeah Big chest wide shoulders good uh foot speed and that time finished going to his left with his right hand Snuck it underneath the defenders armpit Aiden Shaw number 23 back into the game The Missouri transfer for BC Heres Luca Tay Had it blocked Washington got his hand on it Here he comes the other way for Tech Yellow Jackets with their first lead of the game And Washington turns it over Fred Payne will check in at the next stoppage and try to keep it at just two personal fouls for BC I just getting ready to sing Lamar Washingtons praises on how good hes been at running this squad leading this team the last nine games and assists and then he came down and just coughed throwing up before I could even spit it out of my mouth Great helpside defense Thats again wasnt it It sure was Georgia Tech playing for the moment without its leading scoreer Kawasi Reeves who has two fouls Find Dongo gets the friendly roll Thats what I want to see Dongo do Right Just pick roll down to the front of the basket Throw it up there and let him finish Thats got to feel good for him He did not score in that first half at Duke He finished in double figure scoring but he was over in that first half Steager pulls the trigger and connects tied once again at 15 Caleb Steer 65 180lb freshman This kids got some moxy He made a big three They were trailing in a basketball game against Le Moy their last time out and he made a big three to give them the lead and he never looked back Yellow Jackets turn it back over to the Eagles Yeah Caleb we talked about him is just nice job getting on balance right When you get to the top of the floor you get a good look at the front of that rim get yourself on balance and follow through And then that threepointer is just like a long free throw Fred Payne back on the floor the red shirt sophomore second leading scoreer for BC He has yet to score so far today Seven to shoot Caves keeps his dribble And now Paynes going to have to let it loose We just gave Boston Collins some love defensively How about that defensive possession by the Yellow Jackets Well again Damon Starttomire says to his guys Play hard mind your business And with pride he says This team is grinding Mustaf on the back A beautiful feed from Endango Dongo We dont have Mo Cela out there tonight but theyre both of those bigs in Georgia Tech Im not sure who the big mans coach is but they have been well taught on how to deliver a basketball to a cutting shoot a cutting player Well coach starter is high on his team with the idea that they are improving and have room to grow Theyre nine and five overall 0 and one in league play having lost on Wednesday at Duke 8579 Shot clock again down to one And Fred Paynes percentage is not going to be good But its not his fault They keep giving him the basketball when theres only two on the shot clock Its a grenade Hes got to get rid of it Yeah Like pass it to him Hes got a live rattlesnake on it Hes got to get rid of it real quick Thats a little desert term for you there partner Uh he gets it he gets it up but it cant even get it you know on on balance or on target Thats for sure And thats allowed the Yellow Jackets now to to snag this lead Got to get this thing across Well Tech offensively has picked it up a bit Getting better looks They started one of eight from the floor Now five of their last seven And on Q the Yellow Jackets turn it back over Thats the freshman Aai Fleming Yeah thats the fourth excuse me the fifth turnover now for the uh Yellow Jackets in this one So you start three of 12 from the field Youve turned it over five times as well here in the first 12 minutes Not a an ideal start for coach Stamires squad Jesus did not find the range that many jump shot Washington to the baseline cutter Fleming who hangs in the air and finishes Hey HE TOOK SOME CONTACT GOOD concentration after the contact and finish by that young freshman Well he has been good as a first year player for coach Starttomire among the many many very good freshman around the Atlantic Coast Conference this year And well short Georgia Tech has had the better of it in transition so far today but not that time Mustaf lost it out of bounds And itll be Boston College basketball when we music come back to McCamish Pavilion the home conference Coach Grant feels the same way about his squad Well Tech has dominated the glass 15 rebounds to seven for BC They have been able to get out in transition as we see it And on Q that is what BCs head coach was worried about Earl Grant wanting to control the tempo and keep the Jackets from getting out They now have nine fast break points Yeah nine nothing fast break points And if you told me Coach Grant wants to build a fort in that paint You cant build that fort if youre trying to get back in transition Terrific move to Hastings Hes got six to lead the Eagles Hes Hes kind of my pick to click right You know a pain in foul trouble on that bench or maybe a little uh apprehensive not to make sure he doesnt draw a foul trying to drive to the basket Its Hastings is that guys got to give him that nice little bump offensively Georgia Tech going small Fleming No Kiraak the only big on the floor Couldnt get the rebound Boxed out nicely by Jaden Hastings Exactly Doesnt have the lbs to move anybody around that basket to get in better position Its one thing to be long but you also got to be powerful and strong down there when youre trying to get on that offensive glass and move some bodies with your lower body not with your arms Well you know that may come for Cole Kiraak His grandfather Lou started in football at Boston College and played both offensive line and was the place kicker for the Eagles and then went on and did both in the NFL So including here in Atlanta with the Falcons So you would think if Cole has those sort of jeans in him hes going to put on some good weight going forward Yeah I Im sure he will And if he needs a few pounds Im willing to give him a few of mine And they used to make me drink music weight formula when I was at Carolina is being reviewed when I was so skinny as mentioned that calls being reviewed in and the strength and conditioning coach I couldnt gain a pound my freshman year told me Hey youre going to get me fired Start drinking beer and the way the weight came on after that Now I cant keep it off So they are reviewing the out of bounds call Oh did that not just go off his groin or thigh Yeah it looked like hand may have been the last to touch Hes got it poked away as you see Watch the slap down here Tell me if it hits his thigh or groin as it goes out of bound there right off that right thigh Does anybody touch it after that Thought about it Yeah hes thought about it and he let it go Lets see what the determination is After review the calls been overturned Georgia Tech basketball Thats Clarence Armstrong along with Jerry Heer and Trey Steins our three officials here in Atlanta for this early season game in the ACC I love these officials coming over here taking a look at the monitor making a determination quickly so this game can continue to move Im all for video replay but sometimes the the replays take three four almost five minutes at times and it just kills the momentum of the game of basketball Its supposed to be played with tempo and a rhythm And I think sometimes these replays steal that from a game Chaz Kelly and Lamar Washington two point guards in there together for Tech Yellow Jack has continue to thrive even with their best player on the bench with foul trouble The flush by Aai Fleming and another big with a great delivery of the basketball to a cutter Give those that big man coach an extra bump in pay here to start the new year Hes got those bigs working well out there on the floor While BCs big one two on the offensive end has yet to deliver today Hand and pain are a combined one of 10 from the floor Yeah this has been an 8 to2 run over the last few moments here But look at that Good vision by the back the by the big man Sees his teammate flying right down the lane there I love that headband Dreads everything Working and finishing high and hard at the basket Go hands it off Fleming tes it up Pulled down by Fred Payne the red shirt sophomore from Bramling from Louisiana averaging over 13 points per game Still looking for his first two here today Pay for three And the struggles at the offensive end for the Eagles continue Now Payne was coming off a heater right last game He went for a careerhigh 22 points five made threes And sometimes when you get those early fouls like that it just totally derails your game offensively Hes got to work himself into it by getting something going to the basket And in that game of the win over Le Moine as Payne misses again Can score 26 So those two guys were lighting it up against the Dolphins Have yet to get going here against the Yellow Jackets who continue to get out in transition and finish Lamar Washington just dropped a dime right over the top of the defense Look at this This is like a quarterback hitting a guy streaking down the field right over the DBs arms and finding his putting it right where only his guy can get it And Dongo nice finish after the contact at the rim Now chance to give Georgia Tech their largest lead of the game here with nine points Second foul on Jaden Hastings the defensive back who couldnt quite get there Dango off the back iron and were going to get it over the back foul that goes against Jaden Mustaf Thats going to be the fourth team foul now on Georgia Tech So no damage done there with under five to play In fact just actually look at David Stomire told his team get down there pick up full court He wants to put a little pressure on the Eagles and see if theyll crack again He says his team is grimy How many times did he say that after shoot around this morning The word grimy Half a dozen or more And yeah he used some other colorful language in there as well But we keep it clean on air But I love coach starter You know I I could play for coach He talks to his team for a good 5 to 8 minutes after the shoot around today preparing them to come out and compete And it hasnt been pretty but theyre playing solid D and theyre running again Well as you said for Boston College you cannot build a defensive fort if the other team is running music out transition time after time Yeah 12 low fast break points right And again they wont get credit for fast break points there but these free throws are going to lead to some fast break points And so Akai Fleming a top 50 recruit out of Marietta Georgia last year We are so excited about this Saturday night January 10th freshman phenom Caleb Wilson and 12th ranked North Carolina host Wake Forest at the Smith Center at 6 Eastern And then immediately following that game well debut our documentary chronicling the 1993 National Championship winning North Carolina Tarheels led of course by the great Dean Smith your former head coach Youll get neverbeforeseen footage as well as interviews with players and coaches Both are right here on ACC Network and the ESPN Oh Im looking forward to both of those things First of all have you seen the kid Caleb Wilson at North Carolina playing yet Hes a superstar in basketball shorts as a freshman And again of course Coach Smith I was a little jealous when they won it in 93 I couldnt get it done for Coach Smith 87 to 90 You were too busy winning an NBA championship that year Well yes but I listen I trade one of those world championship rings for a uh championship ring uh with Coach Smith and the Tarhill And Ill tell you that I do that in a heartbeat Come on Doug Fresh Michael Jordan and Scotty Pippen are on the line Im not sure they want to give one of those back Well hey listen Jordan scored a ton of points before I arrived at uh Chicago but my first year there I made him a championship And then the next three years after that he got so bored of winning he retired and played baseball for a year Then you went away and what happened He came back I wanted his neck I wanted to ring his neck Douggee Fresh I I couldnt believe I said Well Im a Tarhill Why dont you just give me a little hint that you might be coming back I never would have signed that 8year deal in Philadelphia Yeah it all worked out Under four minutes to go for them you got three NBA championships out of the deal I could have got three more Reddanovich off the mark for BC The Eagles are now one of 12 from beyond the threepoint line Yeah theyve gone theyve gone cold and Georgia Tech is tacking inside trips paint just constantly with the fast breaks All our cutters going down the lane So strong by Washington Boston College with it The Eagles led by as many as five early now down by double digits This is where they get they had two faint They got to go inside Oh they tried to go inside with the players got tanged up I got worried about him for a second They called the foul on Lamar Walk Thats football program that when he took over two years ago there was no consideration at all for winning a Big 10 championship let alone a national championship And now they are two wins away from bringing the title back to Bloomington Indiana of all places Yeah Hoohoo H Whos are doing a great job but Im all about the underdog The 10th place Kings Give me the Hurricanes to win the natty this year And Michael Urbans going to lose his mind I think if that happens Yeah he and Ray Lewis get a lot of camera time on the sideline of those games Aiden Shaw gets above the rim and the senior from Overland Park Kansas makes it 2719 Well when you cant shoot in this first half youre only six of 25 and one of 12 from three You need a high percentage shot Nothing harder than higher than a hard finish at the rim Then they get a turnover Kefky on the block trying to impose his will Able to put it up and over and Dango for two He sure did Right He took his time down there there He got stoned on his first move but didnt panic I like a young big man that can gather himself keep his composure stay on balance and he threw that little right hand hook right over the top of the shot blocker So four quick points after the timeout have the Eagles back to within six One and done at this end And dribbling up Donald Han Jr the red shirt Jr from Virginia Beach ACC fans remember his father terrific player at the University of Virginia back in the day Forte takes it back out Spotting up No turn down the three Drives into the paint Forte No And once again hand after the ball And weve got a rebounding foul thats going to go against Georgia Tech Yeah I believe thats going to be the 17 foul on Tech as well Thats going to send the Eagles to the free throw line had done such a nice job avoiding fouls and all of a sudden now theyre theyre picking them up with a regularity but Boston College just cannot find the range from the outside Their last two field goals because theyve been going they went inside uh for for buckets You can see right there just a lot of white shirts around a hand and here again not great free throw number 72 on the season but 80 over his last 10 games That foul Scott was on Jaden Mustaf his second personal as Han makes the front end and again Georgia Tech has been doing it with uh Reed down Yeah So he went out at the 1414 mark with his second foul At the time Boston College led 8 to6 Since that time the Yellow Jackets have extended the lead to as many as 10 Yeah Got some pretty good play Washingtons come over here Hes hes got these guys playing well Must stops a nice little bunch off the pine as well Guys let me know at this guy Dongo Hes a force on that block Just couldnt get that right hand hook to go Boston College down five Way too strong on that threepoint try Trying to do it off the dribble with hand BC keeps possession Shot clock at 13 These coaches ever just say Hey red light the rest of this half on threepoint shots They cant throw it in the ocean if they were sitting in a boat right now Theyre one of 15 from threepoint range Rodanovich Did he beat the buzzer He did Just couldnt make the shot Another offensive rebound and a huge put back for Kapi Its a 7 nothing Boston College run and the Eagles are right back in it Keen flexing his muscles in the interior Washington drive and dish Kelly around and out Its all Boston College here in the latter stages of the first half Yeah and they can hold this ball Theres only about a three second differential between shot clock and game clock In fact Coach Grant wants a timeout He takes that timeout Well take a break and be on the defensive end and erect that fort you were talking about Now Georgia Tech cant score against thats that defense Lets see where they go here They go to hand try to get something here at the buzzer Its a seven nothing Boston College run A chance to head to the locker room with a tie Forte puts his head down Puts it up Doesnt get the roll 3 seconds to go in the half Kelly puts it up Rough end of the first half for the Yellow Jackets but they do take a threepoint lead into the locker room Yeah it wasnt pretty on either side uh of the court here offensively Both teams doing it Boston College youve got to be happy with the idea that youre right there despite missing 14 of 15 from three in the first half and the fact that Scott as they try again on their first possession now one for 16 from distance Their two big guns pain in hand a combined one of 14 They missed all eight of their threes Only four points out of those two guys And yet theyre only down by three points Yeah Coach Grants got to be thinking what is this Uh a freaky Friday situation And both my guys uh are coming off a game where they combined for 50 points And yet in the first half of this one they got just two of four from the free throw line and one field goal out of their that their duo Its a technically a Saturday isnt it Get my days mixed up around the holidays Georgia Tech once again playing without its freshman big Mohamad Sila thanks to a sprained ankle that you saw in the Duke game on Wednesday was giving him trouble He didnt play much as the game progressed and so he has his foot and ankle in a boot today And again for Georgia Tech Payton Marshall starting the second half in his place as he did in the first half but didnt have a huge imprint on that first half Yeah And then you know you get a a missed threepoint shot You turn the basketball over Meanwhile Georgia Techs gone inside twice now and Dongo whos a poor free throw shooter Uh but this sophomore runs the floor well Gave him an opportunity to score some more points in that paint That fouls on Jaden Hastings He is the first to pick up three fouls today And so Coach Grant sends him to the bench Yeah Dono shooting about 67 from the free throw line which isnt horrible for a big probably better than I shot at Carolina from the free throw line just as just a sophomore So hes got a nice touch Uh I just like to see him put more air under the basketball I think when his free throw gets a little flat its when he has it issues His seven points lead Georgia Tech so far today Donald Han Jr contested on his way to the basket It goes out of bounds and it looks like itll stay at this end with Boston College Yeah and it went right at Ree trying to get an early third foul on Ree So smart crafty play uh by the junior hand trying to draw an early foul sent Ree back to that punt mention the good game Reeds had at Duke 23 points five made threes but he cant get off the launch pad on this one He had six points in that first half but hes got to get going Payne missed again Nice screen and roll to get a good shot inside by Endango Everything but the finish and then the foul on the rebound against Boston College Hey was that Washington that slipping that ball inside again to Dongo He is so good I see why this kid is fourth in the ACC and assists Look at this little pick and roll Little pocket pass there between the defenders Thats a thing of beauty Damus Dontomires got himself a stud senior here running his squad Now remember Nathan George was Georgia Techs starting point guard the last two years Led the ACC last year in assists per game but he transferred to Syracuse And so Damon Starttomire had to go into the transfer portal to find a replacement and he went to Pacific a place that Damon Stomire used to be the head coach and they are both from Portland Oregon There were a lot of connections and he has been very pleased by the returns theyve gotten from Lamar Washington this season Yeah I mentioned fourth in the ACC in assist 21st nationally So does a good job with Georgia Tech won four of their last five leading the squad Look at Dave making it a three Well its been that kind of day Youll take whatever you can get Theyve only hit one of 16 Hell take him any way you can get it Youre absolutely right partner Onepoint game Three Yes Makes it a onepoint game And then the takeaway gives the Eagles a chance to retake the lead They havent led since early in the ball game Fred Payne right down the lane No Oh big shot blocker Uhoh Marshalls holding his right knee as play continues He looks like that young man is in a lot of pain holding the top of that knee That is never Im not a doctor but thats never a good sign somebody grabbed the front of that knee like that Maybe they bump knees and I and I got it all wrong But I I think that was one where he landed and put some weight on his knee and twisted Yikes Marshall is a sophomore from here in Atlanta Played at Kell High School Led them to a state championship before finishing up at overtime elite And he is in some pain Yeah theyre taking him straight to the locker room too Douge just not looking good Hes really walking gingerly on that right knee that he was holding Lets see if they when they land there Oh it looks like his own partner there went into his knee Maybe its about one of where your knee gets bent backwards Now hes walking a little better now Thats a good sign Those first few steps werent looking too good Moving a little bit better there Could be one where we call hyperextension where that knee gets bent back the wrong direction Hopefully its just quite like a stinging pain and hell be fine if not later this game in the near future Well coach Stamire has had to deal with one injury after another this season without Cila today And now the other starting big four today filling in Marshall back in the locker room off another Georgia Tech turnover Payne unable to finish Kawasi Reeves pulls it down and the Yellow Jackets need to take care of the basketball better They are last in the ACC committing the most turnovers per game Nearly 14 per game And thats a lot to overcome Yeah And how about Dongo though He he gets the block at one end or change itll change at least affect his shot and then hes using his wheels kind of as a trail big and before Capki can get in position Yes outside that restricted area but not squarely in front of Dongo Hes able to get back to the basket again I mentioned his 67 free throw shoot Lets see if he can get this first one down and lead to maybe a a good look at the second one Well he is a marvelous athlete 69 240 Moves like a guard He is from Sagal played his high school ball in Connecticut at Putnham Science Academy and then played his AA ball for one of the national powers the Albany City Rocks a program that has produced guys like Kevin Herder Andre Jackson Tobias Harris Isaiah Stewart Jaylen Picket all in the NBA right now Yeah I mean look at those numbers in the 20 ACC contest last year Over 14 points and 10 rebounds a game Averaged a double double Are you kidding me as a freshman Tremendous effort Dono now two of seven from the line Hes got the Yellow Jackets back up too Boston College with early second half here at McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta Caves into the lane Ky from the corner around and out Must will dribble it up Heres Akai Fleming Had a good first half for the Yellow Jackets Must Dango had his pocket picked fights for the basketball Taves is on the floor The possession arrow will keep it down at this end I tell you TAs one of the smallest guys out there on the floor Not afraid to go down there on the ground there and take a knee burn and tie that ball up and fighting for his teammates Look you just see what was that dongo trying to get a handle on it And Paige just went and jumped on it And then Dongo hes so big He got the ball ent wrapped up in his arms Kelly to the corner Washington got I like this kid Lamar Washington He can dish and he can swish it from the outside as well Averaging 10 points in a game his last four basketball games the offensive rebound and the layup by Bowden Kapki Kapi Ill tell you what Kappy he got a little something going there at the end of that first half and a couple buckets inside and hes carrying it over here to the second half Washington got in the lane got the shot over Taves just couldnt finish Washington thats one hell hunt on back Hes I cant get a better look against a smaller defender right from 7 ft in front of the basket fouled off the ball Mustaf as we have seen repeatedly this year when they go small hes the one who has to give up size on the post and so when youre battling Boden Kappy who is 611 255 youre trying for leverage but youre going to get called sometimes yeah you cant get that foot in the backside of of the offensive player anymore a handful last game out against trying to scarf uh Camboozer down on the block a few times third foul on Mustaf and weve got a timeout on the Well I love this right here there Just that whip pass to the short porch corner music three Knocking into three Got Georgia Tech up by three here in the second half music Wins the division and goes to the NFL playoffs Cole Kurowaks grandfather played in the NFL He was an offensive lineman and a place kicker for the New York Giants the Baltimore Colts and the Atlanta Falcons Family stayed here in the area Cole grew up in Cummings Georgia And uh yeah lo in the house right Coles dad Kirk but again Coles grandfather played at Boston College So perhaps a little divided interest here for grandfather I figure he cant quite like it No nice shot there by Cap That is true Sure was Were noted up at 32 you know Yeah Either Cole plays well and Georgia Tech gets the win or his old alma mother gets the win He cant lose Boston College has erased a 10point deficit Lamar Washington puts Georgia Tech back in front Yeah And not only that he has put Hayes in the torture chamber twice now He has taken that thing deep into the paint and just put little shots over the top and smaller Hes got three inches on him and has made Taves pay Washington now with five points Wow We got Tesla Jonathan about how to keep those guys out of the paint right He was a pretty good little player with the black Very good NHL Allstar time on the floor early second half music second team all WCC last year for Pacific when he averaged over 13 per game He went for 40 in a game including the gamewinning three at the buzzer at Washington State a year ago He was 16 for 22 from the floor So he can fill it up Yeah 16 for 22 I mean thats the way you get 40 Yeah I used to have to watch Allan Iverson get 40 on 35 shots and we all stand around and watched him shoot 10 10 for 35 and get to the line another 20 times I like that 16 to 22 for 40 points Thats amazing So fullourt pressure here by Boston College after the made free throws toy soaring to the bucket his first field goal attempt of the second half We were just talking about him Maybe he heard us and said Hey I got to do something to get these guys up off me here Like a blur down the left side Thats going to be a charge Oh I got it wrong Block says the official What did I do there What does Rep Chapman say Charge Thats right Lets go to the video replay on that one Costtoire thought his player was set there waiting with a cup of coffee and a newspaper But Gracie Reed just beat that fullcourt press down that left sideline and then you can see right there just that that knife to the left by hand just so crafty scoring kissing the outside of the defenders shoulders and thats going to be a whistle off the defender every time Fourth foul on Mustaf sends hand back to the line They havent got much from Ham They havent got much for Payne And yet here we go Chance to cut this thing to one Like we say Coach Stamire and Coach Grant we got a grindy basketball game I dont know if it means hes any griier than this It might be one of those games that first person to first team to 55 wins If coachberg is watching back in the studio he would call this a rock fight More like dirt Clemens Boston College back within one after the two free throws from Dahan Jr Georgia Tech basketball Yeah Fleming and and Washington have missed some point blank shots in that painted area It just seems like theres cellophane over the top of that rim All these little short shots that just roll off Start cant believe it His leading scoreer Kawasi Reeves has eight the leading scoreer in the game so far Bowden Capy off the bench with nine points for BC And lets take a listen to what Clarence Armstrong is coming over for Play is under review out of bounds So theyre trying to determine who that ball went off last time Last time the review benefited Georgia Tech See what happens this time around Weve got a couple of looks for you Yeah this is that one by Fleming He thought he had it for sure and then he was able to get that right and left hand in there And I think Flemings out of bounds and both of them are holding on to the ball Thats interesting I agree Thats the case Wouldnt they go to the the jump mall Go to the arrow Which way is the arrow Well not if Fleming is the only one out of bounds when theyre holding the ball If hes the first one to touch out of bounds while theyre both touching the ball Interesting I I I dont know if hes the first one because you cant really see the BC defenders feet in that shot One thing I like about these officials though they come over here all three of them look at the monitor at the same time to try to get a succinct answer a quick answer to this thing and play on Jerry Heater Trey Steins Clarence Armstrong I told him before the game we had 630 flights Doug so lets keep this thing pushing He just looked at me and left They probably got six oclock flights I dont think hes caring about my my flight back to Scottsdale Im trying to get back to the Fiesta Bowl Watch the Canes play next week After review the call on the floor has been confirmed Georgia Tech basketball cheering Well there you have it Twice now theyve gone to that replay A little home cooking for the Yellow Jackets to challenge for the remainder of the game and well be charged a timeout Its that its that left foot right there Is that is that Hastings that steps on the inline first Couldnt tell the number on the back of that jersey there if its 22 or 23 And because that was a coachs challenge for Boston College that it lost that means Earl Grant has no more challenges Cant do any more the rest of the game Andy loses a timeout from having challenged and lost Chaz Kelly turns it over Here comes Boston College with it down by a point All that for not Thats probably going to drive coach Damian Stamire mad We lose this game by a field goal We want to remember that careless turn And they go to Capy Draws the second defender and Reeves passes out of it to nobody Well sometimes you double team a big man down on the block not because he can score offensively with his back to the basket but because you want to force him to have to throw the ball out of that post and hope that it leads to an errant pass just like it did So nice time job there by Georgia Tech realizing that Kis been hurting him and they got to do something different Give him a different look and he turned it over Dango hands it off Kawasi Reeves on the pull up around and out Kathy fights for it Bodies go down He and Dongo wound up on the deck The BC bench is calling for a hook and hold 11 Second foul on Dungo Yeah a nice job here boxing out getting that inside position there And he didnt really have the ball but like you said Dongo hooks an arm there and then through Kappy uh aside like a dirty dish rag DC coach wants a little bit more there And I dont know if these officials are going to give it to him or not but sometimes you just got to let big strong young men beat big strong young men And and thats part of what basketball is all about right I mean the physicalness of the the SEC or the Big 12 So we need a little bit more of that here in the ACC in my opinion Well and were going to see if this will rise to the level of a flagrant foul Have to review common foul stands So that didnt take long I dont think the officials even played the replay He laughter said I dont like Im not buying what youre selling Im going to walk over here just to appease you and were going to play some basketball I like this crew And thats it Right Sometimes you get thrown to the ground Ive been throwing down many times by Mason and Oakley and Lamb Beer and John Sally back in my playing days And youre saying you like that No but sometimes you get thrown to the ground Sometimes you throw some other some other dudes to the ground right You cant just sit there and take it but you hope after 82 games or one of the 35 here at the college level It all evens itself out the wall And we just got a quick look at somebodys shoulder I think that might have been Bowden Captain Indeed it was showing the handtoh hand combat that has been going on inside in this ball game Foul against Kurowak Thatll send Aiden Shaw to the free throw line Second foul on Kirowak Another play right here by Tase Beautiful little slip between the defense there in the paint the sha 69 210 wiry legs there He transferred over from Missouri Uh is the teams best rebounder Hes got those live legs around the basket Aiden Shaw former top 100 recruit out of Blue Valley High School gets one out of two Young man from Overland Park Kansas ties the game at 36 Here goes Washington with a full head of steam and a foul called Ky blocked the shot up top but weve got a foul across the face against Fred Payne That is his third Remember he picked up two early and has yet to get going offensively Fred Payne averaging over 13 per game has yet to score today for BC Yeah Washington hes just so good at putting that pressure on that defense He he had his way a little bit a while ago got back with Taz and then this well drive in there in there against Payne and I think just people kind of just forget that hes a lefty and he wants to go and finish with his left hands and thats why he catches the defense slightly at a disadvantage and hes able to get that that contact and he went to line top two in real easy to put Tech 77 foul shooter He spent his first two years in college at Texas Tech before last year at Pacific second team all conference and now playing very very well in his one season at Tech Here he is with the basketball Kelly still without a point today against his former team Sometimes you get a little too amped to play against your former team and all that adrenaline works against you Taves on the pull up Three Yellow Jackets after it And its the point guard Lamar Washington who averages five rebounds a game who rips it away Doing a good job controlling their defense and glass after a little sloppy with it the end of the first half Starter cracking down Whitford down the middle Boy with the step with the finish He seemingly can get to the rim anytime he wants He needed that He needed something to get himself going here in this second half We mentioned the the 323point game he had in December and how good hes been in the last four and is fouled Yeah Reeves is the first player in this game to get to double figures His 10 points give Georgia Tech fourpoint lead Yeah you know this is a team Georgia Tech in their last four games theyve been over five 50 shooting in each of their last four four basketball games And and today you wouldnt know that cuz theyre shooting 40 and theyre just barely crept up to 40 to get there They they shot 68 in the first cheering half versus two Maybe they used the ball in bullets Well not that you were a perimeter shooter for Dean Smith but Cameron Stadium is a tremendous place to shoot the basketball I asked Kesi before the game this morning Is that your favorite place And he just got a big smile on his face because going to Duke now youre playing the Blue Devils and youre dealing with the Cameron crazies but the sightelines are terrific Oh yeah Now theyre right on top of the corner line about 10000 Its actually probably a little easier to shoot there than it is in some of those big stadiums like the Dean Done where it hosts 21000 Uh but I always played well at Duke We won three out of four Im proud to say my four years at Carolina I had 22 and 11 at one time and Dicky B called me a PTP broadcast Nice Ill never forget that Im surprised you remember that I never legend calling you a PTP You aint forgetting that Dango stopped the first time and then the rebound is ripped by Kappy Did a good job to wall up Steager back into the game Misses from three out of bounds Back to Georgia Tech The rock fight continues here in Atlanta Georgia The Yellow Jackets who allowed BC music to come back and tie it have forged a fourpoint lead Well Reed trying to do what he can to get his team a victory on this Saturday afternoon Takes it hard to the rack I love this Thats a big man step to the basket So hopefully the free throws seeing visualizing that ball going to the basket to get him going Just got to get Pay taking that ball to the rack trying to get uh something inside the ball Georgia Tech has controlled the tempo as well as anything 15 nothing in transition points leading by two Kelly feeds to the right side Kira West gives it back to Fleming looking to go to work and hes fouled on his drive Personal against Caleb Steager the freshman out of Jesuit Dallas in Texas Yeah 15 foul now on the Eagles Going to be baseline out of bounds This is something I watched the practice of coach Stamire earlier this year He really worked on his baseline out of bounds and his sideline out of bounds plays Lets see if itll result in a high uh percentage field goal shot on this touch Hastings in Shaw out for Boston College Really draws a crowd Able to rise above it but unable to make the shot Yeah just four of 10 now Make it four of 11 for Georgia Tech here in the second half from the field Forte gives it up The three ball is pure by Donald Pan Jr Youre three for 21 from the outside Like I said getting to the free throw line and then we get an offensive foul call on Dong here at the half court strike Chase Forte forces the turnover and gets a high five from his head coach Brand Well like I was saying getting to that foul line seven or 10 times when you making seven you visualizing that ball going through the basket It gives you a chance to work on your form and your stroke and hand delivered a big three there to give Boston College the first lead of this game in a long time Last lead was 1211 and they build on that lead Forte with that bucket has now scored 1000 points in his four Division One stops UNCC Asheville Northwestern State South Dakota and now at Boston College Some real good weak side action looking whipping around a couple down screens right from the rack Kesi Reed looking to heat up Nago from the weak side on the reverse lays it in Oh chewing that glass Nice job The seventh offensive rebound by Georgia Tech cutting into that deficit playing aggressively despite having just picked up his third personal foul Forte got a lock Got away with a walk there Tried to keep his pivot foot planted Hand in and out Carowak pulls it down for Georgia Tech Big rebound by Carowak Kelly gets it back Climbing on the Reed screen Its an opening cheering Look at the push off underneath Is that on Reing off underneath Indeed it is music Thats his third And its the 18 foul on Tech So they walk to the other end as Kelly goes out for Georgia Tech Fleming as well Mustaf returns Something uh Boston College has done real well here Uh better in this second half Even after that missed field goal attempt where got that rebound they were able to get nothing and set their defense They built that pool and you saw they just could not fast break it when they had to go to that static halfcourt offense Thats where theyve really struggled Just two or 12 from the field uh shooting that basketball here in the second half Well that is a great sign making the first for Jaden Hastings He had missed all five of his foul shots in the previous two games including the Warren Its one out of two Captain has been a factor off the bench today for Boston College Nice job by Capi Hes got about four buckets inside for the Eagles that have just been absolutely huge It is now a 102 Boston College run Reeves cant connect Ky with another rebound and in no hurry is Chase Forte The grad transfer from Raleigh Walks it up Grant calling out that orange high set trying to go low to the big man Captain could gather Unable to finish though Hastings Dongo with another rebound Washington works off the screen Dango off the airbo Washington had look then lost it out of bounds And its Boston College basketball Two good looks inside by Dong and Washington just got a little quick with his little lefty flip trying to get it between the backboard and the rim and it just got stuck right in the middle Well take another replay Look at this See who Wall went off of Right there There So theres a signetti He tough He tough minded coach thats for sure And then nobody gave Miami a chance against Ohio State and Kane put it on him Kathy denies at the rim dongo And you can tell by the Yellow Jackets having the basketball that on review the call was overturned Let me see Yellow Jackets a perfect three and0 uh or three for three I guess on replays Reviews rather Dongo not able to get that little lefty hook to drop So seems like every time Yellow Jackets get the ball back after a change they cant score Well Tech has missed nine of his last 10 shots from the field Ky swings it Hand attacks had it blocked Giouette hung in the air and got a piece Here comes Kesi Reeves looking to go end to end and he fakes it home Tracy Reeves doing what Tracy Reeves does Once we saw him on the left side attacking offensively quick before the Eagles could set their defense this time down on the right side after a great stop by Carol Damon Starttomires first recruit draws Georgia Tech back within two And off the air ball the Yellow Jackets get the ball back cheering Just shaking my head I I do not understand that a shot attempt early in the shot clock But how about the big fella stepping out big patrolling the paint and the guacing reach hanging in the air for his 12th point over the taller defender You see season high and fast break points Meanwhile Boston College has none Washington back to Aai Fleming Just over seven minutes left in regulation Kurowak left alone turn He throws it down Gerald Wax says Get out of my way Im not just a defensive stopper Let me show you how I can finish high and hard above the basket This place is fired up with that cheering cheering Forte lobs inside Hastings lost it Here comes Reeves one more time with numbers He lays it in himself and the Yellow Jackets are back in front The bench loves it The fans love it Starter loves it And Reed loves it Look at that rip away by Reeves So good coast to coast I thought he was going to dish off to one of his teammates but he says Im going to be the one to put the team on my my back with backto back buckets Sandwich in a little bit there by the big fella with the dunk as well And he was fouled by Caleb Steager His second foul Reeves cannot complete the threepoint play 6 and 12 minutes to go BC now with the basketball down by two Nearly three minutes since their last points Forte spins high off the window Multiple attempts by Hastings finally pay off A huge answer for BC Well we said that Fred Pay has just not been able to get it going Who else is going to step up for Boston Collins to help out Donald Han And it has been this young man right here 240 lbs of nastiness and beef around the basket Flicks and fles What a rebel yell there He loves it Chance to put his team up by one Mustaf get another whistle and Mustaf will go to the line See that shouldnt happen after a missed free throw Boston College has got to do a better job getting back like you said walling up getting that forward intact there and stopping that drive by moving about driving it into the hole because he doesnt see the advantage Foul number two on Capki as Mustaf had the strike Sophomore from Buoie Maryland Gustav shooting about 70 from the free throw line calmly goes up and knocks both of those in to give Boston College two point excuse me give Georgia Tech twopoint advantage And the energy out of Tech these last couple mo minutes has been much better Craig Payne still scoreless today for Boston College Gives it up to Sneer Under six minutes on the clock into the hands of the point guard Forte has got a good advantage down there Small defender being the ball Another contested three Great close out by Carowak not to foul The Yellow Jackets on the run again and Washington will head back to the free throw line Time and again Tech has been able to get out and run Yeah its those missed field goals by Boston College They not getting back defensively is allowing the guys in line to streak down the floor and they will not take away Washingtons left hand I dont know if they just dont know that hes lefthanded but constantly theyre letting him get back to that left hand where hes a better finisher Well when you take and miss as many threes as Boston College has youre bound to have a lot of long rebounds that allow the opponent to get out and go Im shaking my head over here at the number of threes Boston College has taken here in this basketball game and have missed And I understand the game has changed in the last since 40 years that I started playing but if youre not making them it doesnt make good sense to shoot Washington now has a double double 11 points 10 rebounds his third double double of the season cheering Forte cheering off the rim across Washington with another rebound Yeah and a better job though at least that time after the long shot gaining back and then setting the defense and having to make Georgia Tech play in a half court set where theyve been very successful at getting stopped Washington on the switch defended by Hastings He attacks and the help side defender swaps it away Shaw with the block fighting for the ball out of bounds Itll stay at this end with Georgia Tech 1 second actually 13 remaining on the shot clock Yeah So not much you can do with it here First guy that accepts this inbound pass has to fire it up at the basket More importantly than the shot going up Its the rebound for Boston College You got to get your defensive rebound uh and then try to get out and run and get yourself a fast break point And he scored a fast break point all game Washington from the sideline Reeves air ball So its a shot clock violation Back to Boston College When I was in Chicago with the Bulls I tell a quick story here Theyd find us in big guys if we shot threes and misss It it put the red light on guys if he got threes in games and couldnt make them It just makes good basketball sense to try to get something going inside Lets see if Boston College goes inside Pay thats the best look hes had all day Still though scoreless I knew it was coming and thats why I told that story because theyre not making threes from their outside Theyre shooting 16 from the land of three It does not make a sense when youre down by four to continue to fire blanks from the outside Its a two possession game and its been a lot of time to play Go inside Gustaf cheering is fouled by Hastings Case in point its been Georgia Tech the team attacking those games When they get into the paint they either get buckets or they get fouled and get trips to the free throw line Boston College has got to recognize theyre not doing what they did in the second half to cut into that double digit deficit and attacking inside Get the ball inside to Hastings Get the ball into Kappy Let let hand drive it inside Where are those at Foul number four on Hastings as misses the front end Back into the game Bowden Captain And Hastings will sit with those fouls Also Forte out replaced at the point by Luca Taves And here is Mustaf one of four Yellow Jackets who played at Overtime Elite which is less than a mile from here here in Atlanta He gets one out of two from the line Four minutes to go 5348 Another drought for Boston College Hand trying to force his hand and he is fouled Not a drive to the bucket Yeah thats what I was saying You drove six fouls early in this basketball game It was first about this Either way I kind of said first team to 55 is going to win this but I I dont know if thats going to be the case Georgia Tech cant hit their free throws and this time who heck you say the last 10 games 80 from the free throw line knocked that first one in Yeah he has been the one Eagle who has effectively been able to get himself into the lane and draw fouls and get to the line One out of two Reeds to the free throw line on the pull up for two more Hes got 16 to lead all scorers Gave coach Dontomire and the coaching staff an assist on that one Drew that play up nicely Get Reeves coming out of that left corner to the strong right hand for a little mini jump shot Put his team up by six 10 of the 16 points have come since the break Draws the double team and Washington took the basketball away Soon as he put it on the floor slap a double team on him Came on the blind side and took that basketball Washingtons been fantastic 11 points 11 uh rebounds in this game and a huge steal in that last possession mentioned hes got five assists as well Washington gets it back from Kiraak left alone from the foul line Two more points for the yellow to make it 5749 They got a little separation now is doing his thing Gets the defensive forward on the rebound Then he finds a nice little pass Washington slipped him the ball Hes making winning plays Not scoring but hes making winning plays Capino Washington with another rebound and he will take his time bringing it up This team is last in threepoint field goal percentage in the ACC And Im starting to get a reason why now they panicked down the stretch of this basketball game launching needless threes when they could have been attacking in the paint drawing fouls and getting themselves to the free throw line Five to shoot sets the screen and its a triple from Lamar Washington for the largest lead of the afternoon Yeah thats just my two minutes to play turn down double figures and they dont have a a place where they can go where they can score a puck pain The struggles continue Kasi Reeves secures the rebound and now Tech is firmly in control Yeah theyre going to burn a little clock on this one here And like you say up by 11 Going to try to get that same play where they get Reeves coming out of that corner Pop doesnt get all the way to the rack Went to the left hand and tried to give Kappy a facial puty on a poster didnt he Didnt know that young man could get down that left lane line and hey and rise high 3D loves it He said Hey Eagles watch me fly Taking a right at Ghy there drawing that foul A lot of body contact on the play If youre wondering where the fouls at you can see those bodies collide there in midair We got a quick glimpse there of Dennis Scott who works with us now The great yellow jacket who acknowledges he was not a great highriser back in the day Yeah Part of Lethal Weapon 3 but boy could he fill it out Where was he at We get his picture of him in the fan in the stand some place I missed that We just got a quick uh quick glimpse Oh he he broke my heart in a game here in the Thunderdome back in 89 Well his alma mater on a 141 run over the last 4 and 12 minutes runner no comes back to number 33 continues to work hard The layup gives him 13 points Yeah hes been hes been the one solid player I think on both sides of the floor here with Boston and Collins working hard but it might be too little too late now May have to start taking fouls here and try to extend this basketball game Mustaf gets rid of it Nice job by Fleming to come get it Under a minute to go in regulation Washington gives it back to Fleming Could have taken the three now into the lane Fouled by Tames I think coach MMI would have had his his head if he had taken that three Doug He wanted to drive the ball to the basket just like he did after a couple more ticks came off that gang clock to make sure that this thing was salted away and get himself to the Fleming line from the free throw line Uh Fleming has been one of these guys uh that hasnt had the the uh the numbers jump off the page Just a seventh point this afternoon but hes done some solid things defensively Hes ran the floor well in transition as well this up Walk this up Georgia Tech 64 Boston College 51 Boston College going to need some sort of miracle here Payne goes to the right hand and hes got his first two points of the game And its a shame it took the young man that long to figure out that I got to go inside for a basket And thatll come with a little bit more seasoning Um I think he got so enamored with the five threes that he made in the last game against Le Moine that he just stayed out there behind that arc too long and could never get his game on track because he was he couldnt find something to fall from the outside Now listen a lot to learn First game in the ACC youre on the road Um its going to take some time to figure it out but if Boston College wants to finish higher than where they were projected uh to finish last in the league they got to improve quickly on their mentality and how they approach these close basketball games Washington putting together a really nice game at the point 410 Taves graze the front iron and now Boston College will drop back with the shot clock off and allow for the Yellow Jackets to dribble it out what will be their first conference win of the year in their first home ACC game this season applause cheering Well a very nice come from behind victory by Georgia Tech to get their first ACC victory here Uh and it wasnt pretty but coach David Sodomire said Hey sometimes we just got to
