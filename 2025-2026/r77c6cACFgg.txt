Leonard has a beautiful sweater for every holiday Trayvon Spillers takes the tip Back to Nate Calmese and off we go Great to have you with us Lepeler and Lutter courtside with Little running the sidelines Juke Harris has been hot lately and he keeps it rolling to start this Sunday Keeps on rolling 27 threes on the season was phenomenal in their win against West Virginia 28 points against the Mountaineers Watford man Ashby Parker and Schwagger whose twin brother Cooper is on the Wake Forest bench to start Carson misses his first shot right in front of Cooper Cal me open rise and fire Culvin aggressively pursuing the rebound and he gets two Remember the last ball game that Wake Forest played was last Saturday Queens played on Friday night in a big win over South Carolina State But looks like Wake Forest got the message hey we got to start quick against this team Well theyre a threepoint shooting squad Theyve made 29 threes in their last two games both lopsided wins If youve not seen this Queens team or followed him yes they do They They do not cheering hinder themselves or scared to take any kind of three J Carris is going to try to match this They push the ball Maybe not the best defensive team in the world but thats okay because you cant outshoot him outscore You got to get a hand in front of many of these guys face Theres an inside shot for Avante Parker to tie the game Yeah hes a really young kid thats got great length at 69 610 Can elevate You saw that little jump hook Hes got it mastered Played his first couple seasons at Georgia Southern where he had 25 starts He can play basketball but hes moving inside out Guy Omaha Belaloo Rebounded by Parker the same man number one the leading scoreer for the Royals Almost 16 points a game coming off 23 on Friday You got to get out on Ashb Ashbys going to get a reload here He doesnt miss two in a row very often Hes got two threes already today Hes made 331 Beg your pardon 317 in his career Kovven answers at the other end Ashby came in knocked down 34 Schwiger 24 And then you got Burman at 14 These guys do not hesitate taking threes And what you have to remember is if theyre not making them its going to be long rebounds You cant get caught up in second chance opportunities A balls bounding over your head The first couple minutes are any indication And the shot clocks not going to be much of a factor No Wake Forest womens basketball victorious earlier today Onepoint win over Georgia Tech in their ACC opener Double header with the men taking the floor now and a reaching foul with five on the shot clock going against Ashby Wake Forest will just be a little patient on the offense and move the bell and make that reversal You can get the drive and score the drive and kick just like Juke Harris kid did You have to be in a big hurry to try to get shots up In what ways has Juke Harriss game grown and has how is his confidence grown from what youve seen All of the things you have to work on in the game ball handling defense hes gotten stronger hes taken more shots So thats given him the confidence to do everything hes doing He feels like the the basket is as big as the ocean right now or something and he can knock down shots but hes so much quicker And look at his body Hes you know he had the high school high school going into college a little bit Now hes got a chiseled body very good athlete thats running So youre right Everything has gotten better over the summer He had a really good summer He really did and hes playing like it Harris gets his hand on the ball deflection but this man strong take Itll stay with Queens And his willingness to improve as an own ball defender has made his offense better You see how active he is right now Queens in its fourth year as a division one program This is the first year theyre eligible for the big dance And they were a preseason pick to be among the winners in the a sun And their shooting shows you why Ashbys got a quick nine Preseason pick number one Ashby came in like you said 34 threes He had six in the game early against Lynburg five against UNCC Greensboro and he scored a three or at least three of them in nine of 10 ball games Heres another shot Coven answers again My goodness are they shooting the basketball today Both teams getting really good looks Both teams with three threes in the opening four minutes Flash to post Look for a cut on the weak side Drew Harris Harris saves it and then throws it to Parker and Steve Forbes cant believe it Those are one of those areas you talk about not throwing the ball back to your basket but you dont get mad because he did everything right but one play finishing it Got in the passing lane deflected saved it threw it to the wrong basket Ill take that on this one time Ev look at the spacing right now The movement youre sending out of Wake Forest Very impressed with the way theyve started this game First time I mentioned the shot clock Its down to five Harris over Parker and its a foul on the rebound action And if its against Ashby its his second So Ashbys got nine points and two fouls in the first 420 15 of 29 Great shooting against Gardenner Web They can do it And against UNCC Greensboro they were 15 to 32 They can shoot the basketball They will not hesitate Its 14 made threes in their five wins by on average and only eight per game in their five losses Meanwhile Nick Calme showing he can make the three as well Theres his 11th of the season Still knocking down jump shots Visions getting better and better after having the nose mishap a couple of weeks ago playing without the mask Strong Steve Forbes really praised what Cal Me did down the stretch at West Virginia Said it was his best stretch in a Wake Forest uniform without question Beloo comes up with a steal Pressured from behind Undeterred Omaha scores OMAHA OMAHA GOT TWO Deacons open up a fivepoint lead just over five minutes in Ashby on the bench with the two fouls replaced by the Israeli sophomore Yoo Burman Getting up in passing lanes Theres a deflection Drew Caris gets a deflection Omaha Belaloo takes it inside gets the layup Nice body control there Swagger couldnt quite get the block there Omaha with the solid finish Didnt try to do too much with that Early minutes for Isaac Carr off the Wake Forest bench as Schwagger rims it in and out Beloo grabs the rebound Schwagger the uh Carson variety is a threepoint shooter Hes attempted 60 field goal attempts entering this game 88 of his shots have been threes laughter and hes 0 for two to start today Had a nice game against South Carolina State with his brother in attendance Knocked down five threes OMAHA KNOCKS DOWN THE TRIPLE UHOH You remember on Omahas debut last year had a big game in knocking down threes Calmise picked up the foul on the previous trip This one goes against Isaac Carr And I think coach Forbes understand with the week layoff getting through exams I think you said they had one some of them had exams yesterday that youre going to have to try to get some bodies keep fresh because theyre going to push the tempo that of Queens Gus Lararsson Jabriel in the game for fourth year coach Grant Leonard This is Jabriel sophomore from Ontario Canada Burman number 24 is a very smart solid player Calm me rebounds as the Burman miss had started until about four games ago Hes continued to play well off the bench though Tells you something about him No question Oh Nate Calmese buries a three and Grant Leonard wants a timeout 11 straight for the Deaks game You know after a bit of a layoff too the holidays are coming knocked down 12 So theyve had some really good looks and continuing hot shooting pace Marcus Marion in for Wake Deacon six of 10 from three Queens kick to the corner Jabriel makes the extra pass 11 to shoot for Jordan Watford Man straight away triple try goes and man shaken up Grabbing his right knee Pass ahead Carr kick out Juke Harris open Look short by the time he was following a shot Man got there first Looks like the knees okay for Nier Corner three wont go for Watford Marian grabs his first rebound of the night Calmise pushing the pace working with Carr Spillers Marion and Harris Juke from the corner Hes really going bombs away Mary and the rebound creates another chance and a region foul against Watford Wa watch man number one come up there Carr gets there so late to contest It looks like the knees just kind of knocked there his right on his right and that could be a little painful but he got back into play eventually and looks like hes still in the basketball game now maybe did go to the bench hes still in the game still in the game Cooper Schwiger in the game for the first time for Wake Forest his brother Carson currently on the bench for Queens Sebastian Akens Mai Mason also in off the Wake Forest bench Steve Forbes played 10 guys in the first eight minutes here tonight The Deacon Schwagger closed off by Larson And as the shot clock buzzer sounds rebound for Gabriel Furman puts it on the deck crosscourt to a wideopen Isaiah Henry He attacks Schwagger who gets a piece of it cheering Cooper with the block Akens pass off the thigh of really of Larson Its called a kick ball Everybody in the gym wants Grant Leonard to send Carson back in the game so we get Schweer on Schweagger action laughter and then theyll revert back to the backyard Itll happen Itll happen Yeah Cant wait Aens to the corner Carr rebounded by Schwigger Cooper kicks it Mason and then Isaac Carr runs into a brick wall in the form of Yoo Burman Henry all the way cheering Great job to play through Youre exactly right Bumped into him and Henry so physical End up with the finish and layup And again this team just hangs around They they play good enough defense in lanes Theyre aggressive Burman especially on the basketball If you miss a shot because you play their tempo off they go Really a good rebounding team Akins could have launched it He found himself open Carr fakes the three kicks out Aikens now will fire cheering Thats a tough call Thats a tough tough call All Marian did was go straight up Steve Forbes feels the same way I do talk across the college basketball world At the Virginia game the day after Thanksgiving he wore a sweater that read Leftovers are for quitters For quitters Why did you deliver the line Because it was funny Under 11 Say it again Say it again cuz somebody might have missed it Leftovers are for quitters was the sweater he wore on Black Friday against Virginia I I I I love the sweater and I also like leftovers I know And thats why thats why I was you know Yeah Its too good not to talk about Speaking of leftovers All right You know interesting Both teams have really taken care of the basketball Henry misses at the buzzer Coven back out there for the Deaks Cooper Schwagger on the floor for Wake His twin brother Carson on the bench for Queens Culvin knocks down another three and Al Coven who had a sister that played volleyball at Purdue back in the day Hey hes knocking down jump shots So hey its all good family affair Making his second start in a Wake jersey after he started the West Virginia game last weekend Burman aggressive attack earns a couple of free throws for the sophomore from Tel Aviv Schweger picks up his first dead ball situation I admittedly looked over to the Queens bench Is Carson getting up Doesnt look like it Hes still sitting down I dont I dont know if Grant Leonard wants the the Schwagger on matchup One of thems in the ACC the others in the A Sun Theres a difference between the Schwiggers but its really cool that they get to square off against each other Well I I tell you what he really wants to do Weve talked about it They got family people here and everything He wants to win find a way to win a game So well the Schwigger brothers have said this is this is Wake versus Queens Queens is making things happen Henry kicks it Jabriel sticks it He can shoot Everyone on this team can shoot Yeah but hes one of those guys that when he catches the basketball you feel like hes going in when he takes it Nine out of 17 in his last five ball games So hes got that length Yeah Almost a wholesale substitution Four Demon Deacons at scorers table right now Aens tried to squeeze it through the small lane Intercepted by Jabriel And you cant do that against this Queens team because they push it They push you back on defense and theyre not afraid to take the shot as weve already seen Burman throws it away Kovvin the steal Look out everybody Akins missed it Culvin fouled Furman played that well He he was ready to anticipate the lob and he he defended the twoonone about as well as you can as he made the steal about right there I thought I heard a whistle Maybe it was a fan or something They slowed up and then boom He played it well defensively like he said and from the free throw line Miles has to earn it from the snorts strike Okay only eight points against West Virginia Hes already got a dozen here today And every Demon Deacon on the floor other than Miles heads to the bench Spillers Beloo Calmise and Harris return Starting five back on the floor for Steve Forbes Year six for Steve Forbes Wake can get this job done today He will be 168 heading into the Longwood game on Wednesday Longwood Wednesday Vanderbilt next Sunday 100 tip off and then conference play Corner jumper goes Jabriel with his second three and its a fourpoint game Kid from Ontario Canada Like we said the minute they go very long Hes been on a good shooting streak Culvin to Cal Me Not this time for Nate Gabriel the rebound Queens looking for their 73 Theyre hanging around here at the Joel Coliseum And theyll go with a two Its Watford with the easy bucket Timeout Wake Forest They come out and be aggressive and take away the long range Same five on the floor after that timeout for Steve Forbes Carson Schwagger back into the game with his brother Cooper on the bench News has been really quiet Culvin Three more 16 points in the half for Miles Coven Great timeout usage by Coach Forbes Run something can get the ball in the middle of the post to get the score there or kick it out to the wing and you continue Kovvens hot shooting Gabriel wraps the pass around for Watford Out of bounds to Queens and this is now the under eight media timeout So grab a snack everybody Wake Forest by five Told you 14 to 29 but you take me about a minute Yeah See thats thats why we more than one per minute Thats why I did what we do Then theres a turnover Not many turnovers out of these criminals In in uh Ashbys events Matt Woodley was open sitting right by the scorers table laughter but the Wake Forest assistant was eligible to catch and score Good play from Matt too He can shoot He can shoot in his day Or was he trying to show it Throw it to BJ Maybe We know BJ could shoot it One of the greats in South Carolina history Tough rub off the screen there Dead in that cutter by Burman Harris Great little contact Throws it in Count it and the foul What a play by Juke Remember theyve extended the rule now about continuation and well you should be This is a great example of that continuation You asked earlier about the improvements right there The physicality now that Juke Harris can play under control bounce Theres contact right there contact again May even travel in the process but whos counting Throws it off the glass and scores and gets a threepoint play laughter I mean theres a lot of stuff going on but he made the basket so lets go Quick 6 run to stretch the lead back to eight Heres your trap Carson Schwagger now 0 for three Rebounded though by Parker And on the reload its man in and out Calmise tips it to Harris Well they dont wait do they And the thing of it is youre getting some really good looks You said before Spillers have been quiet He still hasnt taken a shot Yeah And the time he got the ball in the paint he kicked it out to a pass for a jump shot Hes playing hard and I like that But I I want I want him my best true inside post threat I want him touching the basketball some If tonights not going to be his night for jump shots thats okay Well he I mean Spillers has double figures seven games Those are the seven wake wins He scored in single digits in all three of the losses Correlation doesnt mean causation but just throwing it out there Yeah but it does mean you need your best players post to get the ball sometimes Six points for Parker game They were all what possession losses except for the two of the three were Spillers gives it up Nice job defensively by Queens now Dont foul it for Queens Clock winding down under five Harris going right by Schwagger Missed the layup though and Burman grabs the rebound Watford ahead Parker What a fast break for the Royals What a pass What a finish Off the missed bucket No dribbles Just passes down the floor Beautiful basketball Thats like first day of practice type stuff in threeon none break One thing about this Queens team on paper this is the toughest of all of Wake Forest quote buy games this season Cali scores in the lane Queens currently 182 in the Ken Palm Every other by game Campbell American Morehead State etc has been 200s or 300s Reaching foul against Wake Forest Watch this What you talk about One dribble Nice bounce pass right on the money between two defenders Hands were down Pass right between them Caught it in stride late and that was nice Called it on Spillers his first Omaha Belaloo looks fired up to defend right here Grappling with Avonte Parker Burman throws it to Parker whos drilled Spillers now with two quick fouls and free throws here for Queens I guess Omaha didnt grapple long enough Is that sort of like holding pushing it It looked like there were two receivers handfighting down the field Why you say that then Were in football season Why you say hand fight about grappling grappling to didnt hold the D long enough and then the foul picked up on um Spillers off the lob All right its the moment weve all been waiting for Stan The Schwiggers are both on the floor together Yes they are 1610 168 517 to go first half Well see if we get any schwigger on Schweer oneonone play The twin brothers from Overland Park Kansas Theres dad A lot of family members are here here This is a moment that Im not sure he he ever fathomemed would would come to fruition All those many days in the backyard and AAU games and all those things and then look whats happening in college basketball Matched up with each other Really Nice switch Burmans got Wake now Culvin stays redot Does he ever Hes six for six from the floor Five for five from deep Hes got 19 and every one of them been great looks in rhythm No they werent Hes got Burman on the switch Carson Schwagger comes up short Hes missed all four of his shots and then he steals it but hes called for the foul Carson Schwagger picks up his first Thats his first number Carson went to Wright State when Cooper went to Valpo Carson didnt play the freshman year at Right State then came to Valpo last year Played 19 games scored 50 points Here we go Swigger vers Schwagger Hol sets up Cooper backing down his brother Queens bench is here for it Double team comes Its a tie up and its Queens ball And that split second of highlight is going to live on forever in Carsons head While you were talking about setting up Cooper I was wa Carson I was watching him He picked him up at the W and they kind of a bump They didnt really say anything but you could see it was going to happen I didnt know if they were going to switch or not How about that So Carson won the first one Yes he did Carsons got to break the seal at this end of the floor Is this the moment No sir Wake Forest ball And thats his shot Hes shooting 45 from three this season coming in Im sure uh just like Jimmy V speech on Steuart Scott Booyah And booya Yes indeed So uh again same premise but give give help help care and love 100 proceeds go to all foundation brothers remain on the court which is fun 345 to play first half wake by seven fun for us maybe not for the parents Miles Kovven has been a bucket here in this first half hes matched his season high with 18 points His careerh high is 20 against Old Miss November of 2024 That is very much in jeopardy right here No question about it One and one here for Miles Look at Miles versus the rest of the team Rest of the Ds got to pick it up Stan And think about it this game started We were talking about Juke Harris and what he did against West Virginia and he gets off to a nice start and all of a sudden Al Coven has been the person now 20 of the 41 points hes got How about 10 different Deaks have played but only four have scored Kovvens got 21 Harrison Kis each have eight Beloo has five The other six deaks whove played you know bunch of minutes all added up And one of those names you mentioned was has not scored is Trarevon Spillers Corner three Another miss for Carson Schwagger Not his half They got the foul on Gabriel The rebound action So it is officially a new career best for Miles Kovven Two seasons at Purdue played 67 games including a national championship game for the Boiler Makers and he has not missed Harris will be at the free throw line here after that foul called on Gabriel Juke could get into double figures again Enters today number three in the ACC in scoring number 21 in the nation Stan if I ask you this trivia question Juke Harris is one of how many players in the country averaging 20 a game so far 365 teams How many guys you think are averaging 20 plus Six 35 That was close Were you Yeah laughter I was close Closer than it could have been Yeah Harris one of 35 in division one college basketball mens side of things Over Schwagger goes Parker Hes had a fine first half He has 12 points for Avante Hes not one of those 36 but hey hes averaging about 11 a ball game So theyre still kind of in this thing too You know theyre just a few jump shots away Point is 20 a game is I think more than we expected from Juke COVEN STAYS ON FIRE WOW HES SEVEN FOR SEVEN from the floor Hes made six threes And heres the steel CULVIN KEEPS IT GOING OH MY WOW 26 points in the first half for Miles Culvin Are you kidding me Burman creates contact and Cole Me takes a shot to the chops Miles Coven highlight reel is pretty special right now Certainly is defensively Calm me with the steel kind of bumps him get away from him and just elevate how quickly he leapt to get there to finish to hold on Hes not wasting any emotion I mean hes just This is crazy Whats that 26 You said its been a long time since the Demon Deacons scored 26 and a half Yes Wow All right here we go One and one for Burman But you like it especially if its in this case Wake Forest Youre talking about them from a home standpoint to see players step up and have great effort and make great plays You know what Juke has been doing the last couple ball games Weve seen it out of Spillers today out of CO It just you got the hard work Thats the thing about the players The hard work theyre put putting in and put in is paying off And thats thats a lesson to all of us Keep working keep grinding you see the results Carson Schweer did go to the bench So only one Schweagger on the floor right now Its Wakes Belaloo with a hand in his face Doesnt matter Another guy thats been working on his shot a lot has got the green light in that weak side of that corner He just buries another three himself Eight for Beloo 52 for Wake Forest 52 points from four guys And a steal for Coven Bats it ahead Juke Harris Showtime Burman attacks Belaloo rebounds Wake pushes Culvin to Harris Rebounded by Aikens cheering After that miss Wake Forest field goal percentage drops to 57 But it has been a scorching hot half for the Digs Nice Harris Not this time Larson leads the break the other way for Queens Royals next two games both against SEC opponents as Watford scores on the drive They got Arkansas next Saturday and then couple weeks after that right before the new year they play at Auburn before they start conference play I was talking to a friend of mine before the ball game about Arkansas I couldnt remember We were talking they got a big game because somebody couldnt remember who it was It was It was Queens Thats right I mean it was on my mind you know Eight to shoot 18 in the half Aens has to create something Hurry Beloo got IT OFF PUTS IT IN laughter Theyre going to check Yeah but I think it was good I think he released it with 2 or 01 on the shot clock And if its good its the 55th 56th and 57th points of the first half Previous basket is under the demon digs Free timeout for Grant Leonard to draw something up Stan you be the judge Here we go Get it Does it does it does it in motion Oh its so close Run it back one more time Can you go a frame or two backwards If you go If they go backwards thats thats literally right at Youre watching the red light as opposed to as opposed to the clock per se Its off Hes got it Yeah hes got that Youre right They run it back one more frame It looks like theres a little space there because you can see the defenders hand in between the ball I feel like I feel like Billy Crystal at the uh start of Forget Paris when he waves off Charles Barkleys buzzer beater Youve seen that movie right You know I have And a friend of mines wife was in that movie Deborah Winger No Uhuh No cheering Theyre going to count it Three Okay After review the call on the floor is upheld Its a good threepoint basket Lets go Good clock management Omaha Thats 12 threes in the half for Wake Forest He had 13 against uh LOL UMass Land had 12 against Campbell So all of a sudden wakes up 18 I think thats going away Final seconds of the half Dont want to foul if youre wake Bobbled by Jabriel and he comes up short at the buzzer So neither Schweer scored which is disappointing but Miles Kovven has the two teams combined Twothirds belong to the home team Now lets see if they can get Spillers going But first lets hear what Grant Leonard was thinking Madison what you got Well he told me offensively the Royals are doing their job He said we only had five turnovers and Wake usually forces more than that So he is pleased with his offense but defensively he says we have to guard the threepoint line better And as you would expect they need to figure out a way to limit Miles Kovven Good luck Thank you Madison Well heres heres the thing about limiting Miles Kovven How hard will he work and how hard will they work to get the ball to him What happens if he doesnt make a shot for a minute and hes not hes a big scoreer but hes not a volume scoreer like that So sometimes guys kind of come back to earth but then again they dont He did not cool off at halftime Yeah Keep him going Keep him going Hes got 29 Wow Keep him going If he could have 26 in the second half just like he had in the first half he would set the record for most points ever in a Wake Forest basketball game by Adik Charlie Davis when he had uh that big first half he finished the game with 51 That was against American on February 15th 1969 Calm Nice will earn a trip to the free throw line for his perseverance here Its coach McCloskey days I think Jeff McCloskkey was a head coach in those days I think Gil McGregor long time broadcaster Hall of Famer was 1969 He did not have the threepoint No bucket No you didnt You know when you say that its funny It makes me think about it Theres so many big time scorers You know you think about Pete Maravic uh you know Frank Selby who had the 100 point game at Ferman back in the 50s The Earl Monroe still holds the CIAA and the Division 2 record for baskets over almost 3000 points And none of those guys that was in the 60s you know never had the the threepoint basket Can you imagine what they would have scored then Carson Schwagger still cant buy a bucket Yeah were in the 2000 Swaggers are still Miles Culvin thought it was fouled No whistle Pulls it back out Beloo Thats his spot It is You know you were talking the other game I think it was a Campbell game about him being a another big time factor scorer similar to what you see out of Spillers And we both kind of agreed but also said theres some things you got to do Consistency being one Today hes really stepped up on the defensive end Hes been active has done a really nice job shooting the basketball taking good shots and making good shots Coven rises for the rebound but hes not going to get credit for it because of the foul against Avante Parker Stan the the second highest score in half in Wake Forest history Of course Charlie Davis had 35 and 69 Every Wake fan of a certain age remembers Randolph Childris against Duke in the 1995 ACC tournament Yeah Yes Yes He had 27 and a half That was in route to the championship right To championship season Yeah Exactly Oh yeah I remember that The most iconic ACC tournament performance ever And it will never be tough I say that confidently The tournament doesnt mean now what it used to obviously Thats for certain Harris didnt get this one off So he doesnt get the miss to his ledger Instead its a turnover I I was 10 years old in Massachusetts I didnt know what Wake Forest was where it was I fell in love with Randolph Childris watching that ACC tournament And it is surreal that I now call him a friend because I was 10 years old I was a devastated Celtics fan when the Celtics didnt draft him I I thought he was the next basketball god Schwagger not the basketball god today How about that How about that So yeah its uh its cool that I gotten to know Randolph these recent years Played pickup with him a few times Cal Me knocks down the three And you know whats even better and and you know you you may disagree with this or not but the fact that one of the people that you grew up watching became a friend was as nice a person as you would have hoped he would have been when you watched him and now he certainly is Youre absolutely right about has 13 Harris has 12 Spillers who averages 14 a game hasnt taken a shot Carr Mason Aikens Marian and Cooper Schwiger all scoreless too And yet Wake thoroughly in control against the Queens Royals out of the Atlantic Sun laughter I mean what do you make of all that And look at Coven 9 for9 29 points Unreal Its basketball This This laughter is not normal basketball This is something extraordinary tonight But it also is good for coach Forbes Youre getting some guys in in the rotation sub out a few people but also emphasis on coming back ready to play after exams after the West Virginia game Calm like a jitterbug in the lane Tough turnaround Goes at the buzzer Thats me That is his shot too You know he loves that little turnaround jumper getting closer and closer to the basket Coming off a 10 assist game Heres an assist Cvin has 31 applause Hes 10 for 10 Didnt think hed miss that one Ashby knocks down the three Got in some foul trouble looking quiet but he could still stroke it Four for five from three for Chris Ashby to the grad student from Houston Texas Spillers his first shot his first points They went a little four round one basically and just let him be that post person Nice little bounce pass Got to get inside positions Able to finish Thats a nice play Try to get him going By the way for Kulvin its the first 30point game for Wake Forest since Hunter Salace against Stanford last January applause Last 35point game for the Deaks Tyrie Applebee against Carolina No one scored 40 since Randolph in the 95 tournament is Miles on his way to another historic day for the Digs Fear the Grand Rapids Michigan represent Um Miles Kovven having a special outof body experience here tonight I dont I dont want to see that pristine line spoiled No but if he goes 11 for 11 Im taking him out Hes there by himself KOVVIN STAYS PERFECT AND MAKES HISTORY Thats good Thats good Thats the most excited Ive ever been for a bucket that gave a team a 31point lead Somebody that Coach Forbes knows All right pull Hes done Hes done now Hes 11 for 11 33 points That Thats magical And he just got drilled Not going to be free throws Only the fourth team foul of the half Coven has six rebounds to his credit as well 24 They didnt get four more rebounds How about that All tens across the board or 11 11 10 boards I mean it it has looked like a video game at times tonight laughter like on the easy setting 7645 Miles again coming off the curl Not this time Perfection is over Hes 11 for 12 Youre in the record book That might have been the worst shot hes taken tonight Yeah thats I mean he deserved a heat check Yeah if anybody ever That might have been that might have been Look like the ball rolled up in his hand just a little bit Spillers secures the rebound and almost lose It does In fact itll be Queens ball And you know what would be amazing The Spillers could somehow find a way to get eight points in the next 14 minutes Got all five players double figures All five starters Yeah I dont think thats happened Hadnt happened this year It happened uh last year And one And one indeed Senior man whose brother Trey plays for the Charlotte Hornets will get to the line Yes Dan It happened in the ENT game last year Yeah I knew when I said that it didnt sound completely off And theres a nice drive using the left hand by man Very athletic player Like you mentioned his brother with the Hornets right now Man played down at McNe State for a little bit under Will So Ill tell you its fun to scroll through the record book and just see what you see and see what stands out And its all available on gosscom if fans that want to check it out Obviously normal fans probably dont do it as much as I do but uh wait a minute Oh look out Spillers missed it Missed the dunk with one hand Forbes with a little grimace on the Wake Forest bench You said as much as you do So you just assuming that all these records in the 1940s and stuff I saw the game and I you know I because I know about it sometime Is that what youre saying I look at notes and read stuff too I can read Look I I dont think Im being disrespectful to say that you dont bury your eyes in the record book as often as I do I dont I I would beg to differ that because youre not with me but four hours out of a day every other day or so So you dont know How do you think I Nothing We dont even spend that much time together I know but thats it I apologize for failing her but I But Im good That makes me freaky Im glad you didnt think that Wow studying when everybody else is you know out in the street See while youre out partying or something or traveling Im in there studying looking at games looking at the point is Im a bigger than you are Im not I dont know about that either And Im taking thats thats insulting nerves here laughter Yo Burman No good Rebound for Henry Oh you can tell its the holidays cant you laughter Tell its a 30point game Yes indeed Second chance opportunity How is that not a foul or a travel Gabriel stepped out of bounds See if you just wait long enough It wasnt a travel He stepped out of bounds But thats besides thats a dead Oh you know you you shouldnt tell me that one there You know how you know how I feel about that There have been 23 made threes in this game and only 15 turnovers for the two teams combined laughter All right Now the next goal the next score lines against Spillers double figures I guess right And get the brothers on the board Well the most Wake Forest record for threes in a game Craig Dawson had 11 in the double overtime game against Clemson February 02 Aens stays scoreless Oh my That would have been the ultimate heat check if he had thrown that in over the backboard of the buzzer Would have counted I dont care Now if youre if youre Queens you know great was ready for him to jump into your lap Mason to the basket cheering and hes the first bench player to score for Wake Forest tonight Ive talked a lot about him lately obviously Okay him on the board Good defensive effort What you want to see if youre Coach Forbes and staff No more miss dunks I would think Spillers lays it in Yeah What what you want to see now youre comfortable and Just just execution there Run the clock Get some people on the floor in a minute Do all the things because you got another game Deflect Yeah Well Im going to watch Dan bury his eyes in the record book during this break 1137 to go Whats the most hamburgers one can eat Family a big part of this transition His dad Roosevelt has a pair of Super Bowl rings and able to coach him up on the mindset and relate to the journey He said that and additionally the athleticism that just runs on his blood has been able to help him excel this season guys Thats a good way to put it The athleticism runs through his blood Yeah And its on display for everyone Hes got a sister thats a big time was a big time volleyball player at Purdue And of course you know about his dad So would not be surprised if his night is done but we shall see Second five on the floor except for Spillers is still out there Mason Marian Carr and Aikens join him Deacons by 32 Mason makes it 34 Nice Well the Miles Culvin Bonanza has overshadowed the Schwagger showdown And its hard to overshadow a Schwagger showdown I like how you say that Say it again I Ive said it correctly twice and I dont want to risk a third laughter time See thats why I pressing my luck I I understand I Hey no whammies Larson battling Marian Play good defense if youre awake Recognize clock for for Queens Watford recognizes and the foul goes against Marcus Marian I believe Thought Marian got the ball when he brought it through there on that drive and maybe there was a little bump at the end Im not 100 certain he was completely off balance went down but nevertheless Stan the only other uh record that Im eyeballing here particularly with Miles Coven on the bench assuming his night is done which is perhaps a foolardy assumption The most threes that Wake Forest has ever made in a game as a team is 19 That was the double overtime game at Clemson February 13th 2002 may remember January 2024 Deacons made 18 threes against a really bad Louisville team here and blew out the Cardinals Oh yeah that was that was in the Kenny Payne era Uh wakes at 15 made threes right now Can they get to 20 Id be surprised but you never know Spillers adds to his point production I like that Made the basket gets back taps up Akens Good pass So you need five more in 10 minutes roughly right Which going on the first half pace is no problem at all No but second half Yeah in your off Yeah in your offensive sets as opposed just cranking them up Clarks got a chance for a fourpoint play here for the Royals Cam Clark Well you know we say it all the time and its very much true True I mean its it is you got to protect the airborne shooter Cam Clark who struggled this year shooting from the three line only two of 14 and that was early in the season against Dane and Gardner web makes one So you know thats good for him cheering Transferred directly to Queens from Community College but you know where he was before that he was in Cleveland State Community College And just seeing Cleveland State gives Wake fans some PTSD laughter It was like watching the West Virginia game and seeing a Kevin Pit Snoggle memorial Oh man At the West Virginia Arena in Charleston cheering Marian going to the line for his eighth and ninth free throw tries of the season This will be a good game for for Marcus Marion Was initially in the starting lineup first game of the season kind of dinged up a little bit lost a few moments Theyve got a a regular rotation it looks like offensively He come in and score the basketball Im sorry what Thats the first Wake Forest missed free throw of the night I I just like to note I said it afterwards and not before Yeah I noticed Yeah I noted it but you did miss I was thinking about it and I dont need to look up the most free throws that Wake has ever made in a game without a miss cuz I was here for that 2005 when Wake beat the future national champion North Carolina Tar Hills and went I believe 32 of 32 from the line Terron Downey had a big day for the Deaks against Rashad Forgot about Terron Downey Wow Whos going down memory lane with names tonight Wake Forest Grace Ive forgotten about him Yeah Well now the the irony was that was a team that missed a lot of clutch free throws Yes Yes Um Downey missed one as well when he could have had a fourpoint play at a time in Tallahassee No Lawson was after that Ray Felton Ray Felton There we go Can company Sean leave it alone Akins will shoot two Yeah that 2005 season when obviously Wake and Carolina were both cooking They Deacons and and Tar Hills only met once that year and it was here and Wake won it I believe 95 to 82 but the game was closer than that in the atmosphere in this building and there have been some great atmospheres here both recently and down memory lane but that was a special special atmosphere here at the Joel You know you speaking it it makes you just think about some stuff And there have been some really great basketball games and here in the Joel and the Joel is is an old building to a lot of people but its relatively new on the ACC landscape You think about you know Cameron you know even even the Dean Dome you know as far as fact goes Little John man gets too Georgia Tech is remodeled by new name but you know still the thriller dome but a different cheering Isaac Carr is going to go hate to make that walk from the locker rooms and everything at Georgia Tech Alexander Memorial in the new pavilion now to the floor I mean it was like youre walking from here to Greensboro laughter like oh my god time One of the things that I was thinking about I was listening to Forbess coaches show and hes like you know we got a really good league Our leagues in a better place than it was last year I havent been able to watch everybody You know our league is so freaking big Yeah And its true You like when I came to Wake Forest there were nine teams in the ACC and you had that perfect double round robin where you played everybody twice home and home and you know you had a true conference regular season champ obviously and its just now Wake Forest will go the entire season without playing play Notre Dame unless they cross paths in the ACC tournament Get Duke and North Carolina only one time and thats on the road this year Yeah I mean its changed Its different The old days like you said I mean you know I I will still tell you Nothing better than those years with Randolph and some years before Randolph was going for an ACC tournament And I can remember and Im sure a lot of people listening today can remember the days of the ACC tournament where theres eight teams It was Thursday Friday Saturday and and and you know Friday Saturday teachers Friday Saturday Sunday night Yeah and the teachers would let you not maybe not let you out of school even in elementary rolled it in or the transistor radios or whatever you might had and you sat there and you listen to the ACC game and you pick teams and most of the kids in North Carolina growing up most of the kids didnt know anybody but you know Duke Carolina State and Wake but uh you know that was that was it was great growing up there we go Cooper Schwagger with his first bucket of the night Well his brother Carsons got three points Coopers going to the line after the break to try to match him Three for four so far this season Make it four for five from the strike And I was wrong Stan Miles Coven and the starters for Wake Forest are back out there again Its about timing Its about get getting you playing basketball 750 9357 I wonder how much longer theyll stay on the court Man tough shot Harris contested it well Wake has Longwood here on Wednesday night 700 and then the Sunday matinea against Vanderbilt Harris on the drive comes up short Beat Carson Swigger off the dribble but could not finish Hasnt been Jukes best shooting days Three for 11 Still got 12 points Man fouled by Blue But nobodys thought about it because of what weve seen out of Coven So its true Well its I mean look at this Wake as a team is shooting 62 Its a nice and even 31 for 50 You know Jukes got a disproportionate number of the misses although thats probably the guy that Steve Forbes is okay taking more shots cheering applause Uhoh The fans are starting to recognize that theres free chicken up for grabs here Because if man misses this next free throw cheering and applause its free chicken for everybody including Stan Dagger See if you hadnt said anything about that were not pulling for anybody but if theres something in it for us I mean come on You can buy your own chicken You get you get enough free chicken laughter Chicken and anything else is in the press room Under seven minutes we go Yeah laughter And then you wait for me to tell you what it was Then you go back and kiss Belaloo entry feed Spillers going to work Yeah were on a 10point watch for him Hes almost there Hes got eight And uh you know for so long Wake had a lot of points and only four guys that scored now All 10 players whove seen the floor have scored including Marian and Carr who each have one point a piece Theres three from the corner for Chris Ashby whos worked his way to 15 on five of nine threepoint shooting A sun preseason player of the year and he will see better games today Yes he is Yes he is Calm me gives a little okey do on Schwigger Hes like Ive been guarded by this body before in practice

already this year Austin P being one of them Jacksonville Well we we we talked about how theyre the preseason pick some uh they were third in the preseason coaches poll to be clear They were pick
