prepare the same way for every game This place was rocking on Tuesday and once again it will be rocking as the Cards win the tip and this young man here Brown Jr Coach Kelsey talks so highly about his skills Fivestar recruit comes in dishes off but has a great shot and McNeely right away He hadnt missed since we came here two days ago either Gman well consider this Rick that hes had 25 field goal attempts in on the season 21 of them have been from behind the ark I mean thats that is what he came here to do and gets off to a fabulous start Does it well well see if Ohio coming off their loss to St Mary out in California And when we talked to coach Bulls foul there and theyre going to be aggressive We also heard that from coach Kelsey but uh talking with Bulls earlier he made the comment that its been a tough week for them as far as injuries and then travel and everything going on Yeah Going out the West Coast back and then busting over here But I tell you Pavilles thats exactly what you want to do on a screen when the big guy shows dribble at him get a foul outside Great move there and to the basket The finish by Aiden Hathaway Well just a uh a fabulous dish right there Good confident offensive play Brown getting it into Hadley McNeely three again Good again Well you and I were here yesterday for practice and you made the comment to me that he I think he missed one shot Yeah one shot the whole time And its not like he took five all practice Katleski blocked there but the offensive rebound and now its back into the hands of the guards Conwell looking for Fu and goes off of the leg of an Ohio player So its headed back or off of the leg of Louisville player headed back to Ohio There we see Jeff BS back at his alma mater Visited with him before the game and uh you know just talked about bouncing back and hes hes really very high on his squad though cheering Sheldon with a nice dish inside Turn around and good finish there for Jean Simmons Javon a red shirt junior out of Columbus Ohio Well the good thing you like about the first two possessions very confident by Ohio attacking inside Um looking very confident in running their stuff Pat Kelsey yesterday we talked about being here for the shoot How many miles would you say that he walked on the court while that shoot was going on Yeah a good 20 At least 20 miles He never stopped Never stopped He was walking the whole time I dont know what to comment about us but the only time he stopped is when he came over to speak with us after practice was over That is right Michael Brown at the line and hell make the first one A 947 free throw shooter this season of the first three games You know the thing about Brown that is that was impressive in the in the Kentucky game he had 10 threepoint attempts and 11 free throw attempts Now you usually see one or the other You rarely see both of those together So hes got the complete game Yeah thats what coach Kelsey was saying about him A humble kid Uh works extremely hard and all the accolades that he has received as we see a nice dish there to come cant finish and Woolly goes up for the foul before the shot Conwell really active in that uh jumping the screen got the deflection and this is where Louisville really wants to play Both teams actually want to play out in transition Conwells going to go to the line Hes a 769 free throw shooter this year has already put 55 points up in the three games that they have played This is uh laughter the crowd sitting there is bringing back memories of the last minute of the Kentucky game Seven free throws in a row they missed How about you know Pat said yesterday he goes he looked at his staff he goes Did we just miss three free throws in a row and then four Yes Yeah that was number six and then seven Yeah thats thats a tough situation Had away over to the wing and that ones good for Paleki Yeah hes the hes the guy whos really hes he keys everything for this Bobcat team Conwell got the rebound and then looks as though somebody grabbed the arm and a foul there You know Rick I really think and this is saying at this point in the year I think if you can get Brown to settle for threepoint attempts thats what you want to do And they just lose Pavleski right there And uh you know great look at it Not a a terrific three for He was three of three against St Marys 0 of7 before that but makes the first two here Yeah Ill get back to Brown Not a great threepoint shooter right now I think hell get there but if youre going to have to choose something make him settle for the jump shot Ali Khalifa checks in for the Cards Checking in for Fu and Conwell makes both of his free throws Pedalki brings the ball up floor Coach BS said This kid here offense has to go through him Hes special and tried to make the pass there and Simmons wasnt looking for it So the turnover Hadley brings it up Gets stopped to Khalifa Both of their bigs are Louisvilles bigs are very good passers in their offense right there On QA to Codwell and a beautiful give and go Great cut Good hard cut always gets you a nice look at the basket JJ Kelly missing the iron on that shot and the crowds going to let him know about it How do we cant get that one to go Louisville back on offense easy pass over to Khalifa He cant finish Just too wide open right there And theyre going to call that one Thats the second time a big has gotten a foul showing on a screen like that Second time theyre being aggressive Trying to kick out Its McNeely whos been lights out here in the KFC Young Center Im the guy sitting next to your girl on the free throw line Louisvilles been there six times uh five points off of the charity strike Ohio hasnt been to the line yet Well and right now first four minutes of the game three turnovers for Ohio And thats thats something theyve really got to focus on Get positive possessions each time down the floor And you especially cant let those turnovers turn into points Paleki looking to get it to his big man Hathaway Looked at taking the three How do gets to that back door cut looks at the three gives to Evans Evans from the line doesnt go and the Cards will bring it down Yeah not a bad possession And thats you know nice long possession for Ohio Eats up a little bit of clock Didnt convert Nice little inside move by Woolly Cant get it to go And a foul on the rebound applause Boy Will Woolly Conwell strong inside I mean you know they like to get in draw contact Talked about getting to the free throw line here early Aiden Evans first foul for Aiden And now with Brown Jr sitting giving him a little bit of a breather Roots with the ball up top We saw him in a gold workout uniform yesterday Thats because of And there we I saw McNeely throw that up and I thought Oh my gosh if this one goes in this guy is definitely on fire But that one doesnt even hit iron Yeah he was close to the logo at midcourt cheering The steal of the bucket by Kobe Rogers Oh and that was that was just great quick hands by him Rogers coming in Havalki working hard trying to get an open shot Kicks to the outside That one doesnt hit the rim And those long threes that miss everything can often trigger a fast break Khalifa inside to McNeely behind the back Rogers with it Excuse me Roots with it now Khalifa to Roots Roots cant get it to go but fouled on his way to the bucket applause Coach Kelsey loved the aggressive move here Yeah he put him in and this is the thing You want to attack Well thats just thats great mantoman defense out 94 ft Terrific job by Kobe Rogers against Pavleski who is a terrific player as a senior Can I root at the line Hell shoot two Makes the first Thats the first free throw he shot this season And you know and Pat Kelsey we talked about the uh minutes played for the style that they play 30 minutes is about max that anybodys going to average this year just because of that aggressive nature Yeah How much they work and run defensively and that and thats even for Brown I think as the season goes along that number may tick up for him Pavleski all the way to the rim and that will stop the 80 run that Louisville was on Yeah A good sense that time of that run aggressively attacking the basket McNeely facing the rim that time in and out Funny you hear the crowd reaction like theyre stunned when he misses Mentioned roots in the gold uniform for practice Thats because of they have a point system in their practices and whoever has the most points either the most aggressive in practice or uh shots points everything It looks like theyre going to go one and one here Notice not one and one sorry 11 Kobe Rogers with the foul And thats Yeah I touched on it earlier Thats Paleki And that you know its its not that hard Its not easy to guard that him coming off that high screen but hes hes drawing a bunch of fouls on Louisville Paleki once again looks left comes up from the elbow Cant get that one to go Offensive rebound though Connors is going to take the three Its off the front of the rim Aiden Hathaway tried to tap that one back in It didnt go Conwell great move to the basket and scores Now just the crosser Talk about the strength and uh he can score three levels as well Really not a shot blocking presence out there for Ohio So attack the rim Hadley comes up with it but then trying to dish it off Cant get it to go And it does finally go but a foul Aiden Evans with the bucket and the and one coming up If this was a turnover and then there was just nobody back there for the pass I mean good hustle You like that and the the only you know the good the good news there they finish on the offensive rebound but Ohios missed a couple of easy shots inside Evans will go to the line cheering and that wont go Great pump fake and the basket Toby Rogers applause So Rogers will try for the gan one It really has been a concerted effort by Louisville to attack the paint in this game Now theyve taken a bunch of threes However theyve gotten also inside and theyve gotten to the free throw line and thats Pep Kelsey values those shots probably as highly as any the free throw line and at the rim Rogers is perfect from the free throw line this season And he stepped over the line Theres that fullcourt pressure again Coach Bulls not happy about that Kani just lost concentration Now watch this Step in out Thats a violation And you know how about Rogers what hes done in this game Gets the steal and he forces that turnover Paul ball back into the hands of the Cardinals and a foul under the basket Ivon Hadley was coming back in 17 That one goes against Kierani So will go to the line shooting one and one And off the back of the rim Simmons with the rebound Ohio trying to get into the paint and good strong defense there but a foul Foul Zubris Thats his second Zubris gets the foul Well the newest show in the iconic TV series Law and Order Toronto Criminal Intent is on the CW from the same team that brought you the original series This time in a new city and on a new network Law and Order Toronto Criminal Intent new episodes Wednesday at 87 Central right here on the CW Simmons is the widest body that the Bobcats have and uh making good use of it inside Matter of fact Pat or Jeff BS talked about playing with Gary Trent back in the day Connor tried to get some space Difficult to get it on Brown and cheering lost the ball there for Simmons and a quick turnover back into Connors hands cheering The Euro step for Connors but they say he was juggling the ball Neil tries to get the steal Great back door cut and Kir Kawani with the bucket He just kind of got lost in the baseline Thats a tough find Conwell for three Its good And thats the kind of look they want you know get it in rhythm Wide open look The penetration drawing everybody in Pavki tried to drive in falls to the floor Its not all McNeely from three How about Conwell as well He got into the game for him I mean hes been coach of the year in three different conferences So hes been a winner wherever he has gone And uh just you know the fan base reenergized here with his presence from last year the Kentucky win on Tuesday Fabulous start You mentioned energized The energy that Kelsey has is infectious I mean he is moving all the time in practice He has a upbeat tempo constantly as Haway takes the three from straight away It wont go Kelly tries to follow and a foul up for three Thats his second Ryan Conwell gets his second personal foul And you know right now theres the you know the the reach right there You just have to let that one go But uh a few too many second chance opportunities for the Bobcats If youre Pat Kelsey Kelly doesnt make the first go CW Sports Saturday continues next with more CW Courtside Saturday as Butler takes on SMU And then were going to head to the grid iron as North Carolina battles Wake Forest Lastly after dark its Louisiana Tech versus Washington State as he makes the second of two And that pass stolen by Simmons but he carries it out of bounds with him Coach Bellich on a little bit of a roll with North Carolina And uh see Andy Enfield has got going on down at SMU I was down there for the uh Baylor SMU game and what a exciting venue that is and there are their athletic department they are thrilled to be in the ACC really excited about this move and Brown threepointer falls short quick pass to Pavalki and an easy layup You see Brown looks make himself settle for a long three miss and that triggers a fast break Best of both worlds for Ohio Ohio back within nine Hadley the turnaround doesnt go but the follow by will go for right now I mean Louisville should not be taking threes Theyve had so much success in the paint I mean base your offense there and then build out Pavilki sent it back to Simmons and Simmons sends that one out Theres the look Thats that long three and he just overcommits trying to get the steal and nice pass And this is just the offense the size inside And I really like Fu Hes starting to get his legs underneath him over here Kase Prior gets the foul here Kase coming back after suffering a season ending tear to his ACL back November 29th so about a year ago Theyre at the battle for Atlantas championship And this is a Louisville team that will foul you And uh for Ohio this is you know great to get into the bonus this early in the first half against this team Hadway makes the first coming in a 50 free throw shooter Hes their vocal leader Uh out of Lafayette Georgia a 68 senior makes the second Nice little run by Ohio getting themselves back within 10 and uh just you know a token pressure that time just to take time off the clock Shoot Junior put it back up but couldnt make it go and the three on the way is good Wow knocks that one down And a late whistle there Yeah that was a technical on on Hadway after the whistle It looked like they got tangled up He was not happy And there was a signal before that technical to look at the play So itll be interested to see what the interplay was there officials today Jeff Bowling Yeah Jeff Balls having a conversation with Haway trying to get him settled down Previous play is under review I think they were looking to see it looked like the foul was called against Louisville going back the other way and there was contact and thats as a result thats what Hathaway was reacting to and then he had some words to say and Clare Aubrey didnt like it She right away teed him up Its really rare to see a player get a verbal a technical called on him by something they say and say you know say to the ref during a game Tim Clappery the uh lead official in this game his father John was the head of officials for the long time in the ACC Technicals on Hathaway and were still waiting to hear what the officials decide Were going to take a quick look here at what happened They Yeah they wanted to they wanted to check and see make sure who that foul was actually on and then whatever Hataway said it immediately got Aubreys attention So the technical foul counts as a personal foul Hes sitting with two right now Sheldons got one Kelly one and Hataway with two After review we have a flagrant foul on seven white We also have an unsporting technical foul on Green One So Case Prior is the foul for Louisville Multiple crimes on that play Yeah Yeah I mean you know it it had to be something if if youre So were looking at the foul You see there where Prior goes in and thats why Haway was upset but then he responds back and you just got the info there So each team is going to get well any the any anybody for Louisville can shoot the tech the two technicals Theyre going to shoot two technicals Ohios going to shoot two free throws and then it will be Ohios ball out of bounds underneath which is why it took that long for it to sort everything out So there were Yeah there was a lot going on in that play And so itll be Muel Brown Jr who goes to the line for the Cards And thats only his second miss of the year Makes that second one Seven turnovers already for Ohio Now its interesting that that Hadway he has to shoot because the the flagrant was on him and hes the one who got the technical So and after this little free throw shooting contest uh itll be Bobcat ball Is this where Hatway will turn around and say the ball doesnt lie cheering Making both of those He might have said something Im not sure exactly Thats what it was Hes got to be careful right now He cant say a word because once once that first technical blows it they tend to multiply and hes getting a talking to you right now I really hes got to be uh hes got to be on his best behavior for the rest of the game All right So after the free throw we have got 3120 Louisville leading And now will that light a fire for Ohio as very good defense here for the Cards keeping Sheldon away from the rim and they bank that one in York Cotter Yeah I dont know I dont know that that was intended And uh you know Jeff BS likes his team likes the way they shoot And that was a tough chance inside by Brown No foul And the three on the way again Doesnt go for Connors Mel Brown Jr sizing up the defense now and hell take the three from straight away Its good Yeah I I think hes right around 30 right now And I I do think that number is going to come up Itd be interesting to see his freshman year how his legs hold up and how that affects his shot but hes hes special Yeah Coach Kelsey said when we mentioned McNeely he said I dont know if hes the best shooter on the team He said I think Brown Jr might be one of the best That turnaround doesnt go And McNeely with a rebound He pushes it up cheering The three on the way from the wing Its no good And Ohio comes down with the ball And this Louisville will really hunt that three in transition too They are not afraid to pull up on the run Simmons looking to go to work on Khalifa Quick kick over to Connors Nice pass inside Hataway Cant get it to go But the foul late double team but really good swing of the basketball around the court and and Hadway hes going to come back to that left hand right there actually went right into the defense and thats what drew the foul that one on Muel Brown Jr So Hadway as we just saw him knock down two free throws back to the line Full cell changes about to take place for both teams Guys waiting to come in and really now with with those fouls that uh Ohio is going to be in the double bonus for the rest of the half So any fouls two free throws Kelsey said he wanted his team to be aggressive especially early on in the season Is he Are we stepping over the line here for aggression No I dont think so And what he wants is the mindset And uh he he talks specifically about his aha moment of power four basketball was Tennessee Well well come back to that We will talk more about that Were going to take a quick break Well be right back with more from Hook and Hold music work versus as were just above eight minutes remaining in the first half and it has been an interesting one Uh what we just were told there was that coach B said that there was a missed hook and hole and he challenged the play the the officials looked at it during the timeout They didnt see anything So Ohio will lose a timeout which you get that the one to burn anyway in the first half There was no hook and hold on the play by Green but they said that he doesnt lose his challenge So u So you know worth worth taking a risk Why not Okay And at the line Hannah will be shooting This was from the foul from Brown Jr But we were talking about physicality of Louisville and the and the number of fouls and he you know Pat Kelsey talked about his aha moment at the power four level was Tennessee and Rick Barnes and he said its like it was like SEC football out there and Rick Barnes philosophy is you know youre not you cant call all of them and and I think thats what that Kelsey is building towards with this program to be really physical back within nine for Ohio That was one of the things that coach Bull said he can play with any team in streaks And Woolly hits the three to put it back up to 12 So the threepoint shot has worked for Louisville in this first half And really nice balanced scoring by the Cardinals Up and down right now Conwell has 10 points Hes leading everybody Sheldon drives to the basket That one is tipped Peru got a finger on it They were trying to run the floor Rogers now up top Switching to a zone defense by Ohio right now Fu out of Germany Backing this one down and tries a little bunny doesnt go Good rebound by W Hell put it back in Yeah really got everybody compressed under the basket right now That was actually you know pretty good patience by Fu Nobody coming to double team so he just backed his way in off the dribble Ive been impressed with Pavitzki and how aggressive he will go And that one goes against Rogers This team so very unselfish They will make the extra pass to that threepoint shooter They have great spacing And here they are getting on the uh for the offensive rebound Will he finish that one on the other side He was offensive freshman of the year I I tell you what Pavleski has done a fabulous job of drawing fouls And if if youre Ohio right now for the rest of this half thats where you want to live at the free throw line Stop the clock get fouls score two points and go down and defend Mel Brown Jr comes back in And now a little fullcourt pressure from Ohio and theyre trying to make it difficult for the Cards Only two turnovers for Louisville so far in this game So a decent job of really good job taking care of the ball Rael Brown Jr They have talked a lot about Wow Offensive player of cheering the year Great ball movement there and whoop ends it with the jam Both of their bigs really good passers and that was just great interior passing Three on the way and it is good for AJ Sheldon Big answer right there McNeely saw Fu heading to the basket a little bit too much on that pass I think Fu expected to launch the three He wasnt expecting a return pass Roots great defense there Yeah you got to sit on his left hand cheering Great great transition offense there for Louisville and Ohio looking a little bit shocked right now Yeah this is this is one of those runs that theyve been susceptible to early in the season Great pass inside and the finish by Aiden Hathaway Yeah they theyve gotten some decent answers to those McNeely open three Good And now which teams going to get tired This has turned into a track meet down the floor Louisville now seven of 12 and three That is tough to overcome Yes it is And the kick back out to Pletki He sends it over Sheldon cant make the three but the offensive rebound the long offensive rebound comes back to the Bobcats Simmons loses the ball and itll go to the Cards Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands You know one of the things that really jumped out at me with the stats is uh Louisville 21 assist ratio as a team which is ridiculously good And theyre sitting here now nine assists only three turnovers They really take good care of the ball 14 points McNeely for three Its good Its threepoint basketball versus twopoint basketball Four for six for McNeely right now from beyond the arc And that three answered by number three Dork Connors coming back after not playing out at St Marys Probably feeling a little fresh after the trip Crew with the jam Assist to Godwell Thats you know pick one defend the three or defend that shot inside Hard to do with all the offensive weapons that Louisville has Simmons working hard underneath Cant get that one to go And late foul called there Coach Kelsey cant believe it Its 16 points The difference right now as Louisville ahead of Ohio Louisville averaging 19 fouls a game already 12 in this first half as we see Simmons back at the line Simmons honorable mention all MAC honors when he was at Toledo Simmons such a good player at Toledo Ohio wanted him because he had his best games when he was at Toledo playing against Ohio and misses the second Quick drive by Conwell and hell end up getting his rebound Pretty nice recovery defensively to stop the layup Three on the way from Conwell It doesnt go McNeely kicked it out and Mike Brown Jr with the three Yeah he and McNeely are seeing who can shoot from the farthest out so far And not going to give the edge to Brown in this game right Kablinsky tried to kick that one out He actually had an open basket if he would have just kept going Oh and lost the handle there for Brown Jr You said the furthest out Well how about this one Well and McNeely was the one who recycled the play He gets the tip out Khalifa sees a wideopen shot and uh two of four in this game from behind the ark Yeah already the team shooting over 60 from beyond the arc Three guys in double figures now for Louisville Conwell and McNeely Tight defense Now the drive by Kowani Kowani pulls up to shoot and hand check foul there Another foul on Louisville and Kanis going to go to the line But we mentioned it You look at the early trends offensively points threepoint attempts assists and then you look at fouls 243rd And Kelsey mentioned he wants to be aggressive Well theyre theyre definitely being aggressive when it comes to the fouls Well three games coming in uh almost 60 personal fouls So 20 a game youre looking at And um cheering you know I think when youre scoring you may be able to give up getting into the bonus a little bit early but I think as this team theyll learn to be aggressive with maybe not fouling quite as much Crowd taking a little breather here as Woolly drives in back into the paint Turn around Beautiful rightander Isolation on the right side of the floor that time and no double teaming help coming Boy really active with the hands cheering Conwell and then Brown Jr and the finish goes to Kobe Rogers Great job of keeping that play alive and then the look ahead in the layup cheering Minute 30 to play in the first half 11th 11th turnover for Ohio in the game Simmons for three And that was a little long Khifa hands OFF TO BROWN BROWN TRIES THE DUNK DOESNT GO Now theyre going to try to run Pavitzki for three Toe on the line Its good Theyre going to call it a three I saw the toe on the line Why not Rick You know youre one on three Fast break Pull up from deep Cwell for three to answer No Sheldon over Pavitzki And the pace picking up once again for Ohio Nice little floater there and Connors gets the bucket Good decision not to carry it all the way Saw size in front of him That floater such a a crucial shot to have Javon Hadley that oneonone game and the foul as he goes up Foul number 17 Thats his third team Ninth team foul for Ohio Yeah their their wings and guards are so good at at drawing contact inside and finishing Hadley makes the first of two Coming up next CWide Saturday continues as Butler battles highflying SMU in a nonconference showdown Butler versus SMU Thats coming up next only on the CW Boopy Miller back for SMU Big return for them Talked about him as player of the year A lot of talk in the ACC We saw Cameron Boozer last week Had a monster night last night 35 Great freshman A lot of great freshman in the NCC as we have Male Brown Jr here Under 10 seconds to play Connors little eightfooter goes and last shot by McNeely in it out at the end of the first half for a longer time and uh Good crew here today And Pavalki ball in hand once again to start the second half Well see what kind of change is made in the second half for both Ohio and Louisville Lets see what the foul situation is with Louisville too How they defend at least here early Good defense here by the Cards Under four seconds remaining on the shot clock Quick shot going to go up here by Simmons and in his hands So shot clock violation Youve got to have in that situation to Im going to put that on the guards Theyd have to know how much time is on the shot clock You put a you know they put him in a bad position Should have taken the long shot But um you know thats that thats definitely the point guard issue Long crosscourt pass to McNeely Hell get it to Hadley Hadleys going to try to do the twoman game and he goes up and makes it Well there was just a uh he you know he had Pavilki on him There was no double team help coming from anybody else Big size difference between the two Thats going to be an issue playing Louisville Who do you double off of if youre going to give help inside Kellys three is good First four minutes crucial for Ohio And a good move there by Pavitzki Its passed too far in front of him Hes able to save it Nice job The steal Yeah nice job of tracking it down Sheldon under the wing Three no good And the Cards bring it down This time its Conwell Hadley for three Its good You know theyve got a couple of guys who can take the ball out of the back court off the dribble and thats really going to help Brown take a little bit of the pressure off him and his ball handling responsibilities The three continuing to fall for the Cards Simmons working again this time on Fu And hell shoot over the top of it And thats what you know thats what they want him to do As I said he got put in a bad possession in that position in that one possession Mel Brown Jr working off of F Fu throws it up from three It doesnt go He made his only threepoint attempt on the year So hes coming back down Yeah And a foul off the ball Yeah So you know just theyre theyre letting him play oneonone inside couple of dribbles He was patient Good sound move Two fouls now on Mel Brown Jr Long three on the way from Hathaway and a long rebound to Hadley Hadley gets it to Brown and Brown able to corral it Bad pass though gets intercepted and Kelly contains it and the foul called I think Hadley took that one just to cut off the rush up the floor He saw there there were numbers He went he went for the gamble right there Knew it was either going to get a steal or a foul Two fouls on Hadley now Haway at the top of the key Jump step AJ Sheldon kicks it over to Pavitki for three Its good Well he is he is really solid with him with the ball Hes drawing some fouls coming off double teams Nice pass there from Brown to Prew and Prew lays it in And this is a relatively short Ohio team thats out there right now And hes a great presence Charge called on Simmons Thats one way to get to the rim lower the shoulder Brew flu Yeah thats you know that thats just a a nobrainer and a call right there But you know for him he is much better when he catches the ball inside as opposed to catching on the dribble Rogers going to bring it up this time Zip still 14 points 6652 Conwell his three is good Just wearing you down behind the arc And you know we talked yesterday Pat Kelsey has no number in mind and hate just doing what he wants to out on the floor but he does not have a specific number of threes that he wants to get up You know people have asked him that question Good look there intended for Roots He couldnt handle it Goes into the hands of Ohio Pavalletki has been all offense for the Bobcats Well and hes a guy too Whats impressive they really tried to lock in on him They knew that he was the guy in this game and hes still getting his numbers Hes got 17 points already Nice ball movement for the Cards as Brown throws it into Pu crew finishes and it is still 15 Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by the Progressive Keys to Progress program gifting cars to veterans in need And tonight here in Louisville its the 2025 Athletics Hall of Fame and they recognize Pton SA whos the assistant coach here for the Cards He was the captain on that 2013 national championship game for Louisville Pulling he was double shifting today So laughter hes assistant coach and then they had to pull him out there and he was introduced very you know received very warmly by the home fans here But uh Im sure you say can I get back to the huddle here I have things to tell the coach Im working Yeah Pavitzki working also now and he tries to work on that turnaround jumper and it will fall and thats that that was defended really well by Kobe Rogers Yeah he actually came up and kind of put his palms up in the air and says What I cant do any more than what I just did Woolly a little bit too strong and that one wont go Thought about letting that one go And were going to see another foul There it is And you know youre down youre chesting up contact youre not going for the pump fake at all You get a hand up Force him into a fadeaway and he touches every part of the rim and it goes in Thats just you know hitting beating beating pitching What I think is impressive Pavitzki is 62 175 lbs And that three is off just as quickly as I say it But he plays like hes a big man Bigger No he plays bigger Hes got hes got that attitude Hes got that toughness Kind of reminds me a little bit of John Stockton from years ago That that same kind of you look at him You may not pick him in the Y for a game but uh do so at your own peril right Yeah Hes shown McNeely resets for the three It doesnt go The follow dunk doesnt go and that one looks like its out on cards number replacing That was the best defense theyve gotten on McNeely on a threepoint shot Theyre finally letting Pavitzki have a breather Hes off the floor now Mentioned earlier hes averaging 34 12 minutes a game And another foul Well he played 18 minutes in the first half And uh Jeff BS gave him a twominute breather there And this one wont be very long You know that they may get him to the under 12 I dont know if hell be out that long Yeah Quick pass inside to Khalifa It wont go McNeely to Roots Back to McNeely and hell drive to THE BASKET AND WILL MAKE IT GO And the foul cheering McNeely above the rim And you know what His teammates were reacting more to that than any three hes made Theyre like Wow I didnt know he could go like that Thats to his off hand too Going in with the left Playing above the rim for McNeely Pat Kelseys favorite word That was elite Elite We heard elite a lot out of Pat Kelsey And that right there was elite from McNeely So Isaac McNeely now continuing to add to his point total Hes up to 15 And that one gets pushed ahead Connor is able to grab it Blocked though McNeely McNeely Roots all the way over to the corner McNeely for three But that one would have went this crowd would have went crazy And McNeely turned into a sevenfooter at one of the timeouts Hes playing like it He is blocked And now Kelly brings it down Hadway slows it down Kelly for three And thats good Yeah right now Ohio is really starting to feel it They look very fatigued out on the floor Roots for three Its off the back of the rim fight for the ball and looks like were going to have a foul We talked about McNeely playing like a sevenfooter Take a look at this Yeah I mean hes up right o almost over the rim Great timing on the play That that was that followed up with his threepoint effort down to the other end Case Prior with the foul Five rebounds to go with that block and 15 points Hes the leading scorer for the Cardinals right now And we mentioned Pavilleski wasnt going to be on the bench long Hes back in He got about a minute breather Yeah And thats Well hell get another one coming up here in another minute or so Pavitzki that one off the corner of the glass Three on the way for Connors No good Long rebound though Great pass underneath and he got hit in the faceel or Shelton Another foul Yeah he was trying to make the pass down low Caught the face This is the thing when this you know in in this day and age your your wing everybody on the perimeters got to hang in there for those long rebounds Claire Aubrey said Hold on one second I want to make sure everythings right Pavletki up top again They wanted to put 20 on the shot clock Little pocket pass there to Simmons but Simmons had through all over him And I think theyre calling that one out on Fu Nice job defending him sitting on that left hand Simmons He is he does not back down from playing a physical style inside He winds up on the floor Hes trailing the play Pavilleski missed his third shot And that three off the mark but F brings it down Great fake by Woolly Gets cheering his own rebound and one He had a corner shooter and he right there as a fake He got himself a look He also patting the rebound stat a little bit and getting the threepoint opportunity I think his shooting percentage is better than his rebounds though isnt it You want that You want that percentage to go up Well I mean you know its not a zero Its not a zero some game Youre going to lose something to gain something Thats right Will it make the and one and Prior will come back into the lineup See I Well shooting four of eight from the field despite that miss So hes 50 right there Hes got five rebounds So there you go pretty good at numbers Big pressure here for Louisville And with it Simmons tries to finish He cant And now Louisville running again Kell Brown Jr cant make the layup go but they foul on the play McNeely bothered that shot We will come back and itll be Brown Jr at the line as it is still a 16point advantage for Louisville Where am I going for the stay book now and save up to 25 Great ball movement Well I love when bigs pass to big Great interior passing Great finish right there We touched on it Two to one assist ratio on the year for Louisville 16 assists only eight turns tonight Start this afternoon Same thing Its been impressive the ball movement and the shooting still from threepoint land Theyre shooting 458 for the Cards And Ohio Bobcats 40 So impressive from behind the arc also anytime you can top that 40 mark Big stat for the second half though snorts that Ohio has not taken a free throw attempt in the half So thats thats been a big turnaround from the first half Mel Brown Jr at the line for two and hell make the first go applause 29 points against Kentucky on Tuesday and today hes got should be 13 I believe after that free throw And now Ohio back to work The difference 17 Just quick trapped again to get some time off the shot clock and then go back into a man Pavitzki the shortest guy driving for the basket there And their guards that was Willie The guards have been protecting the rim in this second half Mel kicks it back out and that swing is good for Conwell Think about Brown 65 Hes got great size He can see if he gets inside and hes so unselfish Connors misses the three but quick work by Ohio to get the rebound and the three on the way from the big man That one will not go for Aiden Evans Quick pass underneath to Hadley And thats that vision weve talked about with Mel Brown Jr Timeout called applause by Ohio cheering A 90 run for Louisville 8159 the advantage now You mentioned Ohio starting to look like they might be running out of gas Adrien Woolly with the again three blocks by Louisville all by the guards and then looking out in transition and Hadley Brown the terrific look inside It is really rare you find a freshman come in at the point guard position and make as good decisions as he does Yeah Muel Brown Jr has been everything that people have said about him And coach Kelsey said you know when you get a fivestar recruit a kid like this you know hes got talent but he says hes so humble and works so hard that he just he just loves the fact that hes got this young man thats running his offense now running his team Yeah And you know what his teammates they respect that too and respond to it instead of coming in here and uh you know saying Well you know every all the accolades I got in high school I should have you know you should respect me automatically Theyre going to call Prior on the foul And thatll be his third personal foul No in no uh sense of entitlement at all from him with Shelton Hell shoot the one So Sheldon will go to the line Shooting one and one and front end doesnt go and Prior gets the rebound Pass to Prior Good hands to grab it Puts it up No good And hell get to go to the free throw line on the floor Sheldon Second personal foul for Sheldon Prior attacking the basket again Doesnt go and a foul once again applause had a clear lane and this may be a good opportunity I think early in the season for him to get reps out on the floor and and just start to feel comfortable after coming back from that injury Prior to Lions shooting two prior coming through the transfer portal from South Florida And the first one doesnt go His dad Sean played basketball at Oregon State before he played professionally in France and Puerto Rico Fastest growing cable network in all of television Thats News Nation And Ohio rebounds the second miss Hataway all the way to the rim and slams it down And Prior and Haway are not happy with each other No And uh and Hadway we know is a little volatile in this game And Prior I think happy to oblige Yeah And there that shot by Hadley doesnt go Heres a look Got the step and uh just if he can get to that left hand he is very explosive and he was uh he was chirping a little bit on the way back The referees may be having a conversation with them again Little talk going on there Both players Well see two shots now from Kobe Rogers You know it was funny Peyton Sadley the assistant coach on Louisville stood up and Prior looked over and he and SA kind of tucked his left hand saying You got to guard it Make him go right He gets to that left Mhm You just saw what happened Hadley made the first of two and the second wont go 21 points the difference as were under 10 minutes to play And that little jumper good for JJ Kelly Prior looked like he was going to take the three Ohio would have loved that Brown three no good And the Bobcats bringing the ball up Pavalki ball in hand again and foul there as Simmons got the ball and right away went down after he had Woolly on him Third foul for Adrien Wooley prior coming out of the game But you know Pabloki the his conditioning has really impressed me I mean they have been relentless in trying to attack him and he still seems really fresh Simmons a 72 free throw shooter Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All States Youre in good hands cheering And Simmons makes the second So now its an 18point difference Excuse me 17point difference 65 82 and a kick there Shot clock resets to 20 Nine minutes to go and still a lot of fight in this Bobcat team Yeah you know if youre Louisville you cant lose your focus right now and thats a good way to keep it Conwell for three You get a direct pass in from an under out of bounds play for a three Pavalki right now 19 he and Conwell leading scorers 19 for Conwell for the Cardinals and hes had no fewer than three guys guarding him at different time I mean they were throwing all kinds of pressure and bodies at him Ziggurus was the foul as Pavalinski puts First one down Three fouls also on Zugurus cheering Zugus out of Greece as Pavleski finishes and well see a sub for Ohio Sheldon comes back in as does Aiden Evans Zugus has those three personal fouls in two minutes of playing time Well theyre being aggressive and theyve got 22 fouls already today In the first three games they were averaging 19 fouls They have surpassed that with 8 and 12 minutes to play And Conwell cant make the three fall Tough tough shot for the lefthander He had to turn back into the defender Hadway looking inside to Kelly Kelly finishes Boy that was almost a turnover and a couple of pass attempts but the good job to hang on and get get converted Conwell spin move got tipped cheering Zugar cant get that one to fall Conwell steps back for three Its off the front of the rim and then not able to handle it That was Hathaway Tried to grab it couldnt It was out on him Itll be Cards ball when we return A tough few opponents in the ACC but take a look at their nonconference schedule and what theyve got coming up after Tuesday We show the Kentucky game there with the win 9688 but youve got Arkansas you got Tennessee I mean youve got a a lot of good teams that these guys have got to take on And and then you look at the schedule too Rick Okay so they finish up December the 20th at home against Montana Then 10 day nine days later they start the ACC schedule They start the season out on the West Coast at Cal at Stanford and come home to play Duke Yeah So uh yeah that nonconference stretch in December and then the open to the ACC is going to show a lot about this team Preseason it was Duke number one Louisville number two as far as ACC Great pass underneath that one Blocked but maybe a little bit of hand on fruit Hell be going to the line to shoot too Well they make some great passes into the interior Big guys just have to be stronger with their finish inside Aiden Ellis with the foul there and Fu gets the first Later today CW football Saturday brings the action coast to coast First its Carolina as North Carolina battles Wake Forest and the second one good there for FU Then dont miss Louisiana Tech as they take on Washington State A lot of great grid iron action taking place still as we continue with this under 725 to play for Louisville here Been in control of this game from the onset but Ohio has failed to go away And to their credit Ohios main guys Oh would have had to have been 77 to get that one You need that guy from down in Florida to uh to maybe track that one down at 79 but uh WY might have got to that Yeah WBY could have gotten that I think But um you know there just theres theres so much Louisvilles got six guys averaging double figures on the season So just a lot of balance a lot of firepower out there Yeah you cant focus on one one player The only guys you can give a little latitude are their centers A great pass inside to threw and hell finish with the dunk And there you go And then you know you got to concentrate on outside Hes going to see a lot of clean looks in the low post That pick and roll working for Fu and Louisville Pavileki attacking the basket pulls up shoots from 8 ft It doesnt go Fu rushing now and up and under Cant get it to go but he gets the foul Drew pretty talented Yeah normally coaches dont like to see their bigs get the ball out that far on a fast break but not a bad handle F played in the BBL in Germany Out of Berlin Germany Well now with the NIL money that teams can be active in going to get guys who have played in the Pro Leagues over the young guys who played there over in Europe That one goes right along with local law enforcement in the CWs actionpacked unscripted series It gives viewers a raw unfiltered look into police departments across the US Police 247 Thursday at 87 central right here on the CW And hats off Second one goes Hats off to those brave men and women who are out there protecting us every day So Hataway has fouled out of the game That was the one who had fouled through there And thats where a technical foul really hurts you You know not for that Hes still in the game right now And hes not finished Sheldon dribbles back up Pass over to Kelly Kelly back into the hands of Pavalki Pavalki trying to get rid of it Sheldon drives jumps back doesnt go through with the board Yeah tired legs Fatigue is finally set in McNeely that ones long Kavalki thought about the three This ones tipped Sheldon able to grab it Pavalki looking for an opening See Sheldon for three Its good Sheldon for three AJ Sheldon only 61 but second on the team in rebounding So he does a lot for this club Muel Brown Jr easy layup Speaking of doing a lot for his ball club we saw him before the shootound He was out here probably 30 40 minutes prior to the rest of the team coming out He was working out and then coach said that after the shoot around he was going to come back out and shoot some more Pavitzki nice little runner there Well watching him yesterday specifically really working on his three trying to improve that range and get comfortable with that shot And this ones going to be before the shot Mel Brown Jr driving in and Sheldon gets the foul His second personal double bonus now for the rest of the game Brown hobbling a little bit had issues in the Kentucky game with cramps in the second half when this is another they play physical This has been another physical game for Muel Brown Jr the fastest growing cable network in all of television NewsNation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom Brown with 15 looking to make it 16 with that one Leading scorer today has been Pavitzki with 23 and he has put up big numbers against virtually everybody hes gone against And right there that would have been a great move by Roots as the ball keeps flying around and the foul finally called cheering So a lot of contact there and going to the ground was Muel Brown Jr and they havent slowed down at all I mean 95 points Theres still almost four minutes to play in this game Theyre going to break the century mark once again But I would say Ohio and especially Pavilki has really stepped up and said You know what You guys might be great You might be a phenomenal team this year but were not going to cower to you Were going to keep attacking you And thats what weve seen out of Pavitzki as hes getting ready to go to the line No I I think hes a a player of the year candidate based on what Ive seen here for for that And theyre going to be tough in their conference And you know its funny Jeff Bowls talk and this is for schools like in this situation He knows hes going to lose some good players every year but to keep his core intact has been really important and hes done that with this group Mhm Yeah Their starting lineup they had one freshman and everybody else was upper classman The big hit there down to the ground goes through and theyre going to call foul And those of you joining us for the second game of our ACC double header Butler at SMU well get you to Moody Coliseum after we conclude here in Louisville The tip off is at 206 pm Eastern time as Brew gets ready to go to the line Shoot two You mentioned double bonus So 611 245 knocking that free throw down Well and that just goes hand in hand and its been a quiet 13 points for him but hes been efficient at the rim But as with the fouling and the physical play I think Louisvilles going to play in some longer games this year Paleki he hasnt lost any steam gets it to Simmons Simmons spins rightander not able to go Funwell to Wally Wooley for three No good F with the rebound Hell kick it out Mel Brown Jr Good And you know thats exactly what FUR did against Kentucky in the latter part of that game Keep possessions alive recycle the play and get an open look Three minutes to play 24 points the difference And a little fall away there Good for Kani Kowani from Melbourne Australia Brown going to work and loses a handle Can he get it back No he doesnt And hes got it That was really good defense by Quiet Really good on Brown Kelly he stops at the free throw line and that ones a kick Brown Jr got his left foot on that one Yeah I think if youre Jeff Bowls for Ohio theres a lot of good things to take away from this game Youre going to be able to pick out some stuff in the in the game tape and be very positive about it Crowd letting them know Mel Brown Jr coming off the floor getting few words of encouragement from coach Kelsey and Pavalki had Rogers go right over the top of him and then when the whistle blew he was looking at the official like what his third at the line hell shoot two All right Mike Ham inside our CW studio Keep in mind SMU and Butler about to tip as you can see right now As soon as Ohio Louisville comes to a conclusion well get you to Dallas for the game action cheering after the free throws 8100 and Zugrus gets blocked going to the basket Sheldon and that was all Conwell cheering picking that one off up to Prior Prior back to Zugras Zugurus cant get that one to go Prior with the rebound long rebound cheering and they slow things down 13 seconds on the shot clock Conwell long three off the front of the rim Big rebound from Rogers Prior for three Its good cheering cheering applause Under a minute Pavalki took a deep breath before that long pass That shot goes long Simmons gets the ball stolen from him Getter Prior is hot Made his that was his first three of the year and hes hes one to another Hes standing outside the arc but this time its Conwell cheering applause 33 seconds to play And you can tell the game has taken its toll on some of these players Slower coming up the floor Pavalinski Ill drive in again and this time foul is called on Conwell Thats good Lets take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by the Progressive Keys to Progress program gifting cars to veterans in need And well give it to Conwell Yeah And its uh you know it could have gone a lot of different places but 22 points very efficient seven of 14 five of 10 from three six rebounds three assists Great overall stat line Do you want me to give the stat of his fouls He just got his four Hes still playing though Hes still Hes still out there Hes still out there He hadnt reached his quota And were seeing some new faces come in for Louisville Cole Sherman will come on Spencer Leg also out as well as Will Hanky cheering Pavitzki making that one Pavitki tying his careerhigh 28 points now for Pavitzki as he will take a seat And watch this one from the bench for the remainder of this one The crowd obviously wants Sherman or Leg or Hanky to take a shot but theyre not going to do it Once again our final score is 81
