for Clemson Porter up to double figures 106 points per game as AlabamaM comes away with the opening tip and we are underway So this is an AlabamaM team that wants to play with a lot of space Theyre skilled They can shoot the basketball but they really want to spread Clemson out offensively Heres Coron Davis Six to shoot A step back three and it clings off back iron Clemson the defensive rebound So when Clemson can get stops on defense thats what allows them to get into their transition game offensively Great opening possession defensively trying to get the ball inside But its a turnover on the post feed by RJ Godfrey So a possession a piece and now AlabamaM with it again So Clemson is going to bring some fullcourt pressure And this has been a staple so far this season for Clemson Theyve got a lot of depth on the perimeter Theyre going to keep rolling guards defensively at AlabamaM and try to make things hard offensively Contavious Doure breaks the pressure and gets it across midcourt Hes their leading scorer And we talked about Justin Porter in his weekend Dantavius uh finished up as the Bulldog Clash MVP just 12 days ago Really talented lefthanded guard Can score from anywhere on the floor Off the mark on the mid midrange there Tigers now with it Jake Wallen feeding Godfrey in the post Nifty left but it rolls off Got his own board Second chance for the Tigers Wallen to the rack with the foul Great job by Jake Wallen driving the basketball off of that skip pass from Dylan Hunter Played off of two feet off the rim I think its been one of the best things that Jake Wallen has done so far this year Has a great reputation as a catchand shoot guy but hes played really strong at the rim You saw that twofoot finish right there Finished through contact And now well get to the free throw line Wen the Utah transfer with one and only one chance It rolls off All right JD what do you got as keys to this one So AlabamaM is talented They got off to a tough start at Indiana a few weeks ago The Hooers all they did was make their first four threes for the Clemson Tigers Were going to talk about it more throughout the game Theyve got to be able to shoot the ball well from three Theyre averaging over nine made threes per game so far this year But as they make shots from the threepoint line it opens up that transition game the high low game that we saw on those first two possessions Thats a great example right there of RJ Godfrey running the floor First bucket a high percentage one for Godfrey and his second stent with the Clemson Tigers after a year at Georgia Theres an open look for three Kuran Davis A quick one and done Nick Davidson looking down low Wallen for three Got it And so weve seen it already Jake Wallen finishes at the rim on two feet Now able to knock down that open three Thats what allows Clemson to have that balance offensively That shot and make puts Wallen over 40 from distance on the season Doure up top of the circle the three and another defensive rebound for Clemson Tigers fortunate defensively right there Had a little bit of a mixup on that ball screen switch Pieces just unable to knock that three down Porter to Godfrey Quick release Porter a bit too strong and a foul on the rebound attempt will keep it with the Tigers And I think Nick Davidsons activity on the offensive glass right there is it started in Charleston for him Hes trying to continue to find his groove a little bit Has gotten off to a somewhat slow start offensively but his activity level the ball always finds energy You see him on the offensive glass right there It draws the foul and Clemson will get another possession out of it Off of the inbound Heres Godfrey against Een Under 10 to shoot for the Tigers one Hunter midrange cant get a roll and it goes to AlabamaM And so Darren we talked a lot about Clemson being able to play in transition This is one of the best things Dylan Hunter does Got the ball able to pitch it ahead to RJ Godfrey running at the rim Obviously a huge emotional day for RJ Godfrey this past Sunday playing against the University of Georgia where he transferred from His dad was an all one of the alltime great linebackers there for the Bulldogs He was just ecstatic He talked about it in the pregame Just wanted to find a way to win the game for Clemson But he played really well Nice take PJ E with the bucket for the Bulldogs Their first of the game Porter through the lane Dumps down low Pass outside Threes off the Mark Godfrey with the tip in and hes fouled So hell get a chance at three the hard way RJ Godfrey just picking up right where he left off this past weekend in Charleston Just active right there on the glass Got up high grabbed the offensive rebound able to put it back in and now well head to the free throw line This has been one of the best parts of his game that I dont think people talk enough about 75 from the free throw line so far this season Made some big free throws down the stretch for Clemson when he was here two years ago on that Elite 8 run as well And thats a significant jump compared to last year 61 in the one season at Georgia So he polishes off the threepoint play So Clemsons going to continue with that fullcourt pressure Theyre switching a lot of these handoffs especially one through three one through four Really challenging AlabamaM E the spin move Good defense Godfrey forces the miss The rebound creates transition here Porter niftily gets it over the outstretched arm of a defender Great job by Dylan Hunter He was looking at the rim Wanted to throw it to RJ Godfrey but pitched it ahead to Justin Porter and hes able to finish at the rim Heres Lou Hutchinson making just his second start of the season Triple covered by the end of it with that midrange shot Numbers for the Tigers and the floater is in Dylan Hunter for two more and a timeout on the floor Big time start for the Tigers They lead it by 12 He talked about that a lot in his opening press conference back this past spring Took Granling State to the NCAA tournament Won a game in Dayton just being around him and watching his energy the way that his guys love to play for him I have no doubt that coach Jackson will be able to get the uh Bulldogs to the NCAA tournament at some point Sammy Pus gives outside James Graham the third entered during the break So his first minutes of play and a traveling violation He turns it over to Clemson As you mentioned those transfers Kandavius Doure their leading scorer is among them Weve also seen Een Graham just now with the touch Lou Hutchinson started as well I mean its a big portion of the production so far this season on this Bulldogs team Coach Jackson talked about in the pregame even just practice is a little easier when you have that many guys that youve worked with before He described it as just the same group just a different address Freshman Chase Thompson with the bucket there for Clemson And its a 14point advantage Do your drives and a whistle foul It will stay here So these are some big early minutes for the Clemson freshman right now Zack Foster was outstanding on Sunday 11 points Ace Buckner Chase Thompson had some of those learning uh challenges in Charleston this past weekend against high level competition They want to get off to a good start here tonight Thompson forced the miss to the basket Buckner was charged with the personal foul his first obviously So this is something that you didnt really get to see Clemson do a lot this past weekend They got into a halfcourt set right there They wanted to get the ball to the elbow get some movement West Virginia the way they pressured didnt allow it The pace against Georgia you didnt really see a lot of set play So you see Clemson early trying to get into some half court execution Doer on the other end a step back no good So now Clemson with a quick regaining of possession Carter Welling from the top of the offense gets it for an open look Zack Foster buries the three Super talented freshman out of Atlanta Georgia Got off to a little bit of a slow start Missed his first nine threes this season but he has really played well of late as we said 11 big points this past Sunday against the Georgia Bulldogs Shooting better than 33 from three now on the season And its another AlabamaM miss accompanied by a Clemson rebound Welling to Butter Johnson the UAB transfer back for Welling Nice extra pass Butner free for the three and a tip out Good fight by the Bulldogs to get it back Now a break DOER OFF BALANCE GOT IT to go And thats what Ken Davius Doer does so well Hes so talented in the open floor especially when hes able to get to his left hand Hes driving this right here Gets it up on the rim Now Clemson saw a really good lefthanded scoreer this past Sunday And Jeremiah Wilkinson from Georgia And Darren I believe that whenever you can consistently play against talented lefthanded players it helps you because its just its different on the basketball But right there Doure able to get downhill get the ball on the glass and score it Hell head to the free throw line Somewhere hes been very successful so far this year 83 Cant collect there And thats a big miss for the Bulldogs every time they can get to the free throw line right now against Clemson Thats a win because their length is giving them problems in the half court Theres Thompson catching fire and it falls Big shot there by Chase Thompson Thats the second three that hes made so far this season Its just going to really help the freshmans confidence Second bucket for Chase Thompson Hes up to five points here for Clemson as they lead it by 18 So the Bulldogs theyve got five out around the perimeter right now Thats a big part of their offense They want to spread Clemson out Again Clemson just gets lost in that switch right there Doure just unable to knock it down from three Johnson dumps it block to block and an easy slam for Carter Welling as the result Yeah Carter Welling has been such a pleasant surprise for the Tigers The Utah Valley State transfer is off to a great start this season averaging almost 12 points per game And it will be Hol to look at the list When he hits 300 he will have been the 10th ACC coach to do it at the same school And the list is just incredible All the whos who in ACC basketball Mike Shesi Dean Smith uh Lefty Drael Its just an incredible list to think about Coach Brownell being on Another miss by the Bulldogs but this time an offensive rebound in a second A chance comes out of it Theyre just two of 14 from the field 14 so far in this game A look for three left short rebound and another look ahead for Clemson Andm has gotten some good looks Even that last three right there was an open look Just unable to knock it down Extra pass straightaway three buried by Hunter Really impressive the improvement that Dylan Hunter has made year after year Now hes shooting over 40 from three Really remarkable the work that hes put in behind the ark Clemson on a 202 run over the last five minutes or so Sammy Pieces trying to make something himself with the handle and its tipped out of bounds Itll stay with the Bulldogs AlabamaM now one of their last nine from the field And we talked about it Darren Theyve gotten some good looks Theyve forced Clemson to move around a little bit but the Tigers length has given them some problems G says finds Payton Daniels for the three Daniels is now a perfect or an even rather 50 from three this season Really good execution there by the Bulldogs underneath out of bounds Thats a screen the screener set Set that back screen Come off the screening action and Daniels able to get his feet set and knock it down Thats really good job by the Bulldogs executing there Foul off of the ball pieces charged with the personal Clemson now underneath their own hoop The inbound Hunter back for Porter through traffic angles it in with contact And you can see the physicality of AlabamaM Theyre challenging every catch Uh but Justin Porter just able to rip that catch it drive it downhill PJ E playing at the rim Tried to stay vertical there I thought he did Officials called the foul Thats the second time now Een has played vertical at the rim but the officials have blown the whistle Porter 71 from the stripe this season Gets it to rattle through So now Darren you just see it The Clemson Tigers theyve subbed a couple of times now but that ball pressure has just continued I think that this is when theyre at their best The big challenge for the Tigers and were going to talk about the upcoming schedule later is can they maintain that same ball pressure when its Alabama when its BYU I thought when they went to Georgetown a couple of weeks ago I thought that was one of the biggest things that they missed They werent able they were not able to pressure the Georgetown guards the same way they have other teams this year And I think they really paid for it And I think too not in the way that the coaching staff would like for them to be able to to do that pressure defensively Its become something of a staple for this Clemson basketball program especially during the last handful of years or so Saved from going out of bounds Dustin Porter finds it and bumped again on his way up to the hoop This time it falls off so hell have two at the line So my question is going to be Darren is that an assist when he saves that ball and flips it backwards like that Uh great job by Nick Davidson of just being able to keep that one alive So a very fast start for Clemson continues with a chance at a couple of free ones here The Tigers lost a lot from year to year Yeah they really did Darren But the thing at Clemson right now is is theres a standard Um you talk about the success over the last four years last three years And so I think so much of it the respect that people have for Brad Brownell and the staff they do a great job of evaluating players bringing in guys that fit their style their system and so you see it there You know seventh right now in the preseason poll but 12 of the last 15 years Clemson has exceeded their preseason expectation Thats going to be a challenge this year Well and I think it is the case that as time goes on you keep doing that the preseason expectation becomes greater and greater right Therefore it is more difficult to exceed that expectation For instance Brad Valers got a team this year that only returned 98 of the minutes played less than 10 of its minutes played from a season ago Yet youre picked to finish seventh in a very very good ACC Yeah I think its twopart I think its the respect that they have for Clemson and for Brad Brenell Also you and I have talked about it a lot You know the ACC is much much improved this year Uh and so itll be interesting to just see how the Tigers are able to continue as uh the season goes along The December schedule is incredibly challenging and then theyll get into ACC play as uh the calendar turns towards January Samuel Onu 0 for two trip at the free throw line for the red shirt junior from Malvin Pennsylvania And that allowed AlabamaM to get into a little bit of a threearter court pressure Theyre not trying to necessarily steal the basketball from Clemson They want them to use 8 to 10 seconds before they get into their offense to try to just slow Clemson down some Dylan Hunter finds a man in the corner but the heel was out of bounds for Justin Porter to turn it back over Thats a great example of Alabamasm AlabamaMs pressure pushing Clemson out Pushed him to the sideline and Justin Porter steps on the sideline Onu back to Doure Orders been giving him fits and fall away there falls for Doure for another two Contavius Doure is what we would call a tough shot maker Hes going to take a lot of really hard shots AlabamaMs going to need him to take some hard ones but hes a tough shot maker The other thing he does a great job of is getting fouled Taken away by Daniel Senior Transition and Porter all the way back baseline to baseline to deflect it out of bounds Great hustle right there by Justin Porter just in a full sprint to get that ball knocked away because AlabamaM scored last possession Got to stop on defense trying to put backtoback possessions together offensively AlabamaM wasnt they didnt have a player ready to inbound it Finally Daniels Yeah they tried to run that same screen the screener action just unable to get everybody on the same page right there in the same call Doure working against Hunter up top Onu the three thud and a rebound for Welling and Clemson Down to Godfrey Hump fake but it was swatted away Daniels got up there Great job by the Bulldogs in transition right there to knock that ball away and now get out on the other way strong Doure cant follow Tigers go right back to Godfrey and he gets it with the foul cheering He went one way with the fake against Onu and then spun and went straight up to get out of nowhere Right Theres theres development that takes place within this program Well and and of those four PJ Hall was a really highly recruited guy Um but all four of them continue to improve over the course of their career Now Clemson recruiting is is at a much higher level than it was 10 or 15 years ago But lets even talk about RJ Godfrey for a second Three points per game as a freshman 65 from the free throw line almost 12 points per game now double what he was scoring at the University of Georgia last year while shooting 75 from the free throw line Now Godfrey hit his lone free throw checks out The freshman Chase Thompson checks in Thats somebody theyd like to develop over the next few years And a nice move and bucket down low for AG and thats what the Bulldogs do well They got into that five out set right there Got to a side pick and roll Clemson unable to rotate in time to take away that score at the rim Johnson over to Thompson Heres Welling lost his handle and a foul called So RJ Godrey you mentioned his development We talked about earlier he left for a season and went to Georgia and of course theres the family ties there that had that magnetic pull But look when talking about this coaching staff and Brad Brownell he came back for a reason You have to imagine and its even something that he says there that he took for granted even for a couple of seasons and I thought it was a huge point even this past weekend Brad Brownell talked about it in the post game of the West Virginia game Clemson has one returner from last year Dylan Hunter Youve got to count RJ Godfrey as a second one even though he wasnt here last year But Brad Brenell talked about those two guys taking charge in the locker room after what was not a very good first half against West Virginia and bring it being able to bring the rest of those guys along 26point lead for the Tigers now Gabe Kincy drives squeaks a pass out to the perimeter and now they get to reset Doer through the lane gets the pass to the corner but a missed three Was a really nice move to find a teammate Yeah it was a missed three but an outstanding pass by Contavius Doer Thomas big step through the lane had it knocked off of his leg out of bounds This will go to the Bulldogs And you mentioned the big minutes Right now Chase Thompson obviously has played well in every game Dallas Thomas has not appeared in every game but has shown some really bright spots making some threes These are big moments for those young guys right now One dribble and the three is up and through for Payton Daniels senior Another make from beyond the arc Hes over 50 for the year And AlabamaM has started to find a rhythm now offensively Theyre able to execute getting Clemson moving side to side getting some open shots just now knocking them down Quick defensive rebound after a Clemson miss too That has not happened often in this first half Doer picked up by Thomas gets the screen splitting defenders finds the basket Contavius Doer is such a fun guard to watch to Johnson on the other end with the left Doure on that previous basket just able to make something out of nothing Just his ability to move the basketball with his eyes move the defense got to the rim able to score What do you think in swack play Thats going to do them a lot of favors later this season Here he is again Got in between three players in white and draws the foul as its called on Chase Thompson And we talked about it a little bit earlier just AlabamaM has now started to settle in get to that five out motion Thats a dribble handoff right there Clemsons got to be able to communicate how theyre going to guard that Big shot there by the Bulldogs to knock it down Miss short Clemson on the move Welling head of steam draws contact on the layup attempts Carter Welling has shown this season his ability to play from the top of the key Has driven the basketball very well from up there You saw it right there going to his left but has also been able to make some big threes Made two big threes late against West Virginia Eight points in about a 60sec span that helped the Tigers overcome a late deficit against West Virginia 60 free throw shooter on the season Gets a roll there Welling from Utah Valley Prior to that he spent a season at UC Irvine but at Utah Valley was the conference defensive player of the year So this production offensively is nice but arguably not even really what they need him to do most Yeah I think its been a pleasant surprise for the Clemson staff I think hes the transfer that early in the year probably adjusted the quickest Even we talked about West Virginia in that game this past Friday and how physical it was He did a really good job against the Mountaineer big men around the rim Doure forced to miss and the look ahead just ahead of Budda Johnson So yesterday was Thanksgiving JD and you know basketball season its tough to get players back to their families You often spend it with each other This was at the Brown Ls home The entire team spent Thanksgiving and had a nice big meal there Yeah it was one of my favorite parts of when I was still a coach and as a player you know just getting to do Thanksgiving together as a team with you see the family members there the children all those types of things Such a special time for a lot of players that are away from their family for the first time on a major holiday So you want to make it special for them feel like home away from home and the rumors that they got a little walk through in the driveway as they prepared for Alabama Eventually I was told as I entered the building today about this experience for the team and I heard they were giving coach Brownell some grief because when they had the idea to do the walkthrough they took some time for them to find a basketball that was usable Even when they found one it was like it was flat So they were like Coach youre youre the basket Youre the head basketball coach You have to have a usable ball somewhere in your home Theres part of me as a former coach that that doesnt surprise me You know when you get home you want to be able to put that down and just step away from it Um Coach Brownells family does such a good job with that and incredibly supportive wife And uh I was joking with her earlier in the tunnel that there were going to be 25 or 30 people showing up at her house again tomorrow Yeah she was quick to tell me that that would not be the case Gabe Kinsey is one of those gramling transfers that came with head coach Dante Jackson unable to hit the tail end And the other thing Darren that AlabamaM has done now Clemson with 17 fouls theyll be able to get to the free throw line as we finish up the half Godfrey bailed out Nice find Butter Johnson and the three falls Great shot there by Butter Johnson 11 points this past Sunday against Georgia The transfer from UAB had gotten off to a slow start so far this season offensively Big for him to be able to come back to Clemson and see that three go in the basket Dylan Hunter the assist for the Tigers He averages a couple per game Ky a long way from the hoop Five to shoot Step back Tries the three Way off on a miss The follow not there Godfrey the defensive board Couple of quick looks ahead Johnson Another three Ricochet Bulldogs will run the other way And a travel Gives it back to the Tigers Just three minutes left in the first half of action here at Clemson I have a feature on her coming up at halftime just in Porter with the three from the corner and Clemson continues to pile on now a 30point lead And I just want to finish up what you said there about Barbara Kennedy Dixon During my time at Clemson as a player she was in the athletic department as the senior womens athletic uh director She was always someone that you could walk through Jervy Hall and it didnt matter who you were as an athlete Always had a smile on her face Was just always a pleasure to be around Um she was such a blessing to the Clemson community Lost a battle to cancer just a couple of years ago but a great honor for her to finally go into the basketball hall of fame I think its a long biography JD I think my favorite is the bottom one She scored the first bucket in NCAA womens basketball tournament history in 1982 That is so cool Yeah Barbara did so many great things for Clemson and the basketball community Really remarkable But Johnson drops it in following the takeaway for the Tigers Its another large run in favor of Clemson 12 to one over the last four minutes and you minutes without a score for AlabamaM Yeah theyve missed their last four field goals and I think it speaks more to just the level of focus that Clemson came out with defensively Thats something that you worry about a little bit in games like this Youre coming off of a huge game against Georgia this past Sunday Get a couple of days off but Clemson has really responded on the defensive end Coron Davis gets a late clock bucket and some help up from his teammates Itll check out This looks to be just precautionary Great late shot clock drive by Karan Davis right there Didnt panic Put his head down played off of two feet and as Ive watched AlabamaM and preparing for this game and being around coach Jackson Im just incredibly impressed with his staff What hes been able to build they got off to a slow start at Indiana in the opener earlier this year Youll never see their staff panic You dont see any panic from their players Speaks to the culture that theyre building in Huntsville Quick release for Porter Skips the three over the cylinder but a tap out of bounds will keep it with Clemson So its going to go underneath out of bounds Weve got 20 seconds on the shot clock right here So look for Clemson to go quick here so that they can get a second offensive possession on the back end Hunter finds Godfrey nearby Wine into the lane and puts it up and through but an offensive foul negates the basket and gives it back to the Bulldogs Interesting right there Jake Wallen drove the basketball played off of two feet but really good defensive rotation there by AlabamaM You can challenge that call this year You can challenge the secondary defender but I think as you look at that replay were watching the Clemson bench I dont think youll see a challenge there Thats really good defense there by the Bulldogs 12 second difference between shot and game clocks So remember AlabamaM is in the bonus right here Theyve had some success when theyve been able to get to the rim but there they are in another ball screen situation Clemson gets confused They dont step up and theyre able to knock down the three Daniels fires away hits his third from distance Hes the teams leading scorer with nine Hunter drives pulls up defensive rebound taken away on the outlet pass Porter the three Got it And thatll send us into the half third as Clemson begins with possession Big first four minutes right here for AlabamaM You want to come out of the locker room get off to a good start stabilize this thing going into the last 20 minutes Good stop defensively RJ Godfrey with the miss for the Tigers Ron Davis and a whistle and a foul off the ball will go against Godfrey of the Tigers First team its a good job at PJ E just deep post position Drew that foul Een picked up two big fouls early in the half on Clemson dribble penetration Really hurt the Bulldogs offensively and their flow Kicked ball to stay with the Bulldogs Een had he looked good He had some moments in the first half 69 225 lbs One of those gramling transfers that came with their head coach Dante Jackson I think its the first thing that you notice when you watch AlabamaM is just their physicality their strength Even their guards theyre all big strong physical guys Thatll serve them really well as they get into conference play later in January Physical play by Koran Davis draws the foul Jake Leen commits his third personal second team foul for Clemson in the second half And thats exactly what head coach Dante Jackson wanted to see coming out of the locker room Got a defensive stop on one end able to get the ball to the rim on the other end And the Bulldogs will head to the free throw line Davis good on the first Hes 80 on the season And so the other thing that this is going to allow the Bulldogs to do theyve gone three quarter court pressure after free throws It just slows Clemson down a little bit Not necessarily trying to steal it Theyre up a little bit higher right now They certainly want to get Clemson out of rhythm I clear the pressure get it back to Porter Porter again lets it fly It clings off So backtoback stops right here to start the second half for AlabamaM Doer big crossover gets it to Een against Godfrey and theyll pull back the reigns Dozer on Godfrey floats it out and a foul offensively reverts possession to the Tigers Really physical there by the rim by RJ Godfrey and PJ E trying to get low low post position Een got the foul the possession before that time Godfrey able to draw the foul So thats three on E And I like what Coach Jacksons doing Let him play right here Uh see if he can play without fouling on the defensive end And thats a great job by Een staying vertical in the lane not fouling Godfrey turns it over Sammy Pis Davis drives up and under Tried to circus shot and its out of bounds to get it back to the Tigers You can see the emphasis that AlabamaM has coming out of the locker room to get the basketball to the rim Thats backtoback possessions where theyve drove the ball to the basket unable to finish right there but thats a really good drive Agnyang back into the contest for AlabamaM Tigers break the pressure pretty easily Order trying to pick and roll here Davidson out to the corner The three ball rattles offensive board Godfrey the spin A twohanded slam Its a great skip pass there by Nick Davidson I know that Budda Johnson didnt knock that down but took his time threw that with his left hand to create that shot for Butter Johnson RJ Godfrey able to clean it up on the offensive glass Godfrey with 10 points now The second Tiger into double figures And this is that five out motion that we talked about in the first half Its a its a ball screen continuity where one big is going to set it the other ones staying high but Clemson able to force the turnover and Dylan Hunter gets out in transition Chance at three for Hunter Maybe the best free throw shooter on this Clemson team 90 plus on the season We talked about RJ Godfrey He got the offensive rebound and just took his time right there You could feel what side Yang was on And then on the other end Dylan Hunter getting out in transition able to use his body and get to the rim and finish Dylan Hunter just watching his growth not just over four years but really over the past four weeks A lot of pressure coming in at the beginning of the season Only returner from last year I think he felt the weight of that to start the year Uh but really settled in in Charleston And its one of the things that Dylan Hunter always talks about He knows that his energy and his activity level is what makes him good Really got back to that in Charleston and it made the offensive part easier for him Hunter is really a testament to this Clemson program and the focus on development Four years with the program now numbers in basically every category just tick up a bit every single year PJ E finds the basket Yeah PJ E is such an important music part for AlabamaM He just gives them a threat to be able to score on the block or in that ball screen role that they really dont have otherwise So you see coach Jackson he picked up that third foul took him out when it was a defensive possession got him right back in the game and able to capitalize on it on the offensive end that time Any with the personal foul So Hunter now up to nine points per game And this is the thing coaches love right JD 2821 assist to turnover ratio on track to be the best in Clemson history Yeah he entered into the starting lineup last year for Clemson against Duke here at home Tigers went on to win that game and win the next eight in a row A big part of the late season He gets hurt in the first half against SMU in the ACC tournament Really impacted the Clemson offense on the offensive end because of that ball movement that you talked about Darren with a little give and go gets the layin for AlabamaM First bucket for the point guard Justin Porter pump fake Now the three a bit too strong Tap out and it stays with Clemson Theres that energy and activity that we just talked about Darren ball got knocked out by Godfrey Hunter runs it down Its going to result in another offensive possession for Clemson And Hunter fouled as he receives the pass Thatll keep it with the Tigers Its a 29point lead for the home team So much success And then two guys in Will Stevens and Harris Reynolds both that are top 150 players in the country And so weve talked a little bit about player development at Clemson Uh the improvement but they continue to recruit really high level players including Amari James plays at Wheeler High School one of the best high school programs in the state of Georgia Uh the Tigers just continue to add really talented players one of their top 100 recruits Now as a member of the team as a freshman number five in white there Zack Foster now into the game Yeah I think its one of the things Darren as you go into this last 16 minutes You know Brad Brownell wants to see those young guys play well Great hands there by Zack Foster to get him into transition But a Johnson angles it in Thats not the first tough bucket weve seen him make in transition And now the Bulldogs trying to push the tempo themselves Get a foul on the other end I love that by AlabamaM Ball goes in on a layup on one end Its something that coaches work on a ton Get the ball out quickly and get into transition But for Zack Foster and the Clemson Tigers it started with the deflection The long athletic freshman had his hands up got the deflection able to allow Budda Johnson to get into transition and finish at the rim Really good defense to offense possession for the Clemson Tigers First free throws for PJ E Seven of eight on the year Make it eight of nine from the free throw line Weve talked a lot about Een and his physicality at the rim being able to play But thats a really good job getting out in transition able to run catch it and play at the rim Six points pretty efficiently for Een now And another freshman Chase Thompson just checked in for the Tigers Theres Foster bringing it forward to run the offense Thompson catch and shoots Unable to knock it down but thats a great sign Chase Thompson really high level shooter out of the state of Minnesota Made the three earlier in the first half Just unable to knock it down there Amongst the trees Sammy Pieces got the shot up to get fouled AlabamaM has really challenged Clemson in their closeouts in the second half Theyve done a good job of being able to catch the basketball on a reversal Uh ripping it through playing downhill getting to the rim and now theyll head back to the free throw line Foul charge to Buddy Johnson Its his first And Sammy Pisces the senior from Paris France to the free throw line Its the first AlabamaM picked to finish sixth in the swack Thats a testament to Dante Jackson in the head coach as well because remember hes in his first year there coming from Grahamling who you see at number seven And I think it says that other coaches in the league know the players that came with him from Gramling knows that they can be successful I cant say enough positive things about AlabamaM and and having watched them today and just in their game preparation and even just the way theyve came out of the locker room here in the second 20 minutes They didnt go in wanting to be down 30 but theyve responded really well Just heads are high playing physical attacking the rim Really impressive by AlabamaM They get the deflection but Clemson regains possession over into the corner An open look for three rattles off for Foster Ace Buckner a long rebound Heres Welling firing away East the board And so we talked about those seven made threes in the first half Clemson has came out cold in the second half from three Just unable to knock one down Jesus got a little bit of space with the head fake against Welling Tight defense on the shooter Daniels E lost his handle Buckner through the lane with the left and in Its been the best thing that I think Ace Buckner has done so far this season is just his ability to finish at the basket The red shirt freshman out of Dallas Texas He plays with a strength in his upper body of just being able to go through contact just like right there didnt see a lot of time in the first half with a couple of quick personal fouls Sammy Pieces navigates to the lane and got that one to go through We talked about it a minute ago Darren AlabamaM is really challenging Clemson to guard the basketball Pieces able to get to the rim and score And Foster fouled So Ace Buckner off to an incredible start so far this season Had some really high level games to start the year You mentioned the foul trouble but thats a great give and go Just the movement for Clemson offensively able to get to the rim and and score that with his left hand Really impressive I think the next thing for Ace Buckner is is hes a better shooter than what he has showed so far this season from three Off to a slow start right there Uh two of 20 on the season Hes a good shooter Uh and I and I believe that hes going to knock shots down here for the Tigers over the course of the season Zack Foster with that make Still a perfect free throw percentage on the season for the Tigers Now 12 for 12 So much of it right here in this second half for the Tigers Ace Buckner Zack Foster Chase Thompson want to continue to help those freshman play well There was a little bit of a learning curve in Charleston against a big physical West Virginia uh against a fast athletic Georgia team but thats a great finish by Contavius Dixon Thats the second time weve seen that Darren able to get downhill to his strong hand to his left hand and just get the ball up on the backboard and score Hes going to head to the free throw line as well Really talented scorer Really going to have a great year in the swag this year for the Bulldogs Contavious Doure now with eight points a chance for nine And the 80 plus percent free throw shooter cant connect Hes slippery He really is Hes so good off the bounce Creative able to use his body He doesnt miss many free throws Weve seen him miss two tonight Hes been held in check all things considered by the Tigers Nice feed Welling to Thompson for the layin Thats that offensive execution that we talked about in the first half Tigers got it to the elbow able to play out of a split cut Chase Thompson caught it late and scored it at the rim Foster a little eager to try to force the steel Yeah this is a great job right here Really good passing there by Carter Welling Thats called a split cut This where two offensive players are going to come together One of them is going to cut to the basket One of thems going to pop out Really good passing there by Carter Willing to be able to find him at the rim for the finish Bulldogs get it to Doure He gets it back Seven to shoot Elbow jumper off the mark and Buckner fouled as he tried to lead the break Thatll go against Gabe Keny And thatll be six team fouls now on AlabamaM So 12 minutes to go Both teams already with six So coaching staffs are going to talk a lot about playing without fouling over these last 12 minutes I thought it was one of the biggest keys on Friday night for the Tigers against West Virginia The Mountaineers really started to struggle to make shots but Clemson continued to foul them Once Clemson was able to guard without fouling it allowed them to create some separation get some stops to fuel their offense Enyang commits his third personal Thats the number seventh foul So it means one and one Carter Welling four for four from the stripe so far tonight cheering and he gets his five One of several transfers on this Tigers roster again They had to replace 90 plus minutes from a season ago Yeah And all five of these guys you could even include RJ Godfrey as a sixth as a transfer have had really impactful moments so far this season But the one Im going to touch on is Nick Davidson Such a talented guy 15 points per game last year at Nevada Has just gotten into a little bit of a lull offensively for the Tigers Zero points so far tonight Clemsons going to want to get him going as the schedule gets harder in December Inyang playing with those three fouls Heres a step back and the three does not fall for Daniels Thompson Whoa Kicked ball Comes up and hits Doer in the face but hes all right The helm of the Clemson Tigers But the notable success comes in the more recent half of that since the 2017 2018 season How about this JD Only Duke Virginia and North Carolina have more ACC wins Yeah really impressive the job that Brad Bonnell and the staff has done You mentioned it longest tenure coach in the ACC Ton of success Able to beat North Carolina Duke and Kentucky in this building last year Cant say that at many places was a team last year for the Tigers that got ranked as high as number 10 in the country late in the year in March as the foul will result in a couple more free throws for Carter Welling Yeah just a tremendous year It had so many great things that happened uh just over the course of the season We mentioned the Kentucky win at home the Duke win at home able to follow that up just two days later with a win over North Carolina at home And so you can just really feel like the program is in a good place right now You even I look at those pictures from Thanksgiving and you just see the smiles on peoples faces Uh its truly a program and its a testament to the to the job not just coach Brownell but the entire coaching staff has done I think they do a really good job of bringing in guys that fit this culture and this offensive system This year for example this is going to have to be a group where different guys are going to have a different night And um youve got to be a player thats willing to give and sacrifice to do that Three into double figures for Clemson now Wellings two free throws get him to 10 points BJ Een bullying his way into the paint and getting the drop in too Really good job there by Een just getting downhill able to get to the rim Carter Welling played off of his feet scoring it at the basket by Een Great possession there by the Bulldogs out of that timeout Ace Buckner left to his own devices and hits the midrange floating Buckner got downhill on that side pick and roll able to get to that floater Really nice touch there by the freshman Second to make for Buckner Hes two of three from the field now Roer has to come get it for AlabamaM Shot clock winding down Splits defenders out for the catch and shoot three Graham off the mark Clemson has it Its good job by Butter Johnson right there Played him to his right Forced in back to that off hand The Bulldogs able to get another open three Just unable to knock it down And another chance at a threepoint play This time Foster goes up with contact and banks it through Yeah both Zack Foster and Ace Buckner have had their moments throughout the year so far when theyve scored the basketball really well This is two guys along with Chase Thompson that can really score the basketball But Zack Bolsters length uh just his ability to get out in transition to finish are really special Hes going to be a good player down the road for the Tigers Thats the fourth personal on Een who secures the rebound for the Bulldogs And even going back to Zack Foster there for just a second Darren 11 big points against Georgia on Sunday And I thought both the freshman guards struggled a little bit against West Virginia Just the physicality of it Uh to see Foster come out there settle down on that second day was really important The Tigers needed all 11 of those points Another three on the way Hutchinson cant connect and players get tangled up Een and Godfrey So RJ Godfrey will be called for the personal foul and thats continued all half Weve seen fouls called away from the basketball by both E and Godfrey just getting tangled up under the rim Those are two big strong physical guys That time the foul on Godfrey And Eens going to head back to the free throw line Seventh team foul for Clemson One and one for Een Hits and hell get a second Not just is Een a big strong athletic guy You You talk about his skill level Came into the game 87 from the free throw line seven of eight Uh good looking shot Going to be a really talented player for the Bulldogs in the swack this season This is his fourth free throw of the night Hes hit all four of them And I love what coach Jackson does Hes not worried about the score Es got four fouls The Bulldogs are much better with him on the floor offensively So theyve got a chance to sub him as the ball goes down to the defensive end Theyre going to do that Buckner the look ahead And heres Dallas Thomas in for the first time in this second half Thompson to Buckner The cross drives baseline Thomas double teamed Had it knocked away but a whistle and a foul And that goes against Graham Dallas Thomas is a red shirt freshman from Little Rock Arkansas Unbelievably talented just when you see his size and his length But thats where its been a struggle for him at times this year Its just whenever he puts the ball on the deck you can see that strength that hes continued to develop Kind of show up a little bit That ball gets knocked away Fortunate uh to get bailed out with a foul right there Thomas off the mark but he gets a second guaranteed Now double bonus territory and he notches his first point of the evening So you can see the Tigers are going to continue to pressure the basketball So much of the conversation in the huddle right now for Clemson is being able to do that without fouling and keeping AlabamaM off the free throw line Daniels pick and roll trying to feed Enyang down low and its knocked away That was a great look by Pton Daniels coming off to his left hand right there hitting Enyang at the rim I thought he had him for a layup Ace Buckner rotates over and knocks that basketball away but a great pass there by Daniels Daniels keeps it nearby Graham into the lane fouled and hits the shot Darren I love AlabamaMs size Just when you keep talking about it its just another guy with limp uh coming in being able to get the ball to the basket right there James Graham has started several games so far this season Able to catch it late in the shot clock Again no panic by the Bulldogs Gets to a spot able to score it and then knock down the free throw Great execution there by AlabamaM To your point Graham is 68 Lou Hutchinson 67 Weve talked a lot about Een 69 screaming And then the takeaway for Enyang 69 himself Great activity there by the Bulldogs Payton Daniels able to knock that basketball away Doer uses the screen gets it to Daniels Too strong Clemson gets it on the tap out Moving it up the floor Back to Foster Whips the pass Extra touch Thompson to Thomas in the three That is as good of an offensive possession as you will see this season And it included four freshman for Clemson Zack Foster just on the pitch ahead never even looked up threw the basketball and moved it Thats an amazing possession right there Really good offensively there by the Young Tigers Miss and a defensive board transition look Buckner long on the three The tap out Godfrey keeps it in the front court and Inyang with the touch foul at the perimeter Thats his fourth Its just a really incredible possession Darren we talk about Clemsons ball movement uh their assists per game made threes per game Thats a great possession right there to be able to move the basketball like that and and to see that pitch ahead from where you and I were sitting Zack Foster threw it and he never looked up the floor and then got it back on a back cut Just a great possession there by Clemson Good way to get the first made three of the second half for the Tigers Zack Foster with a one and two trip to the free throw line Graham stepped out at the baseline Good defense by Nick Davidson collapsing on him after coming into the game You can see the emphasis that Clemson has put on being able to play without fouling over these last eight minutes Zack Foster was involved in a ball screen showed his hands wanted to make sure he didnt foul and then Nick Nick Davidson there on the block playing without fouling Now Nick Davidson checks back in here late Um but its its a big couple of minutes right here Youd like to see the senior make a shot or two and just get some confidence offensively as Clemson continues scheduling wise next week Goes to him in the high post leaves it short collects it himself and is bumped by PJ E That should be number five on him as it is officially indicated his foul So his night is done Yeah its a tough break for PJ Esena Nick Davidson called it drove the ball lane line and was just able to corral that offensive rebound Got him on a shot fake and draw that fifth foul by PJ E But a really impressive night by PJ E He really impacts their offense just in his ability to play at the rim run the floor strong physical defender around the rim as well Hes got a team high 10 points at his time of exit Five rebounds for the Bulldogs as well And Davidson nails the first of two The red shirt senior for Mission Viejo All Mountain West Conference with Nevada And the thing that impressed me Darren even on Sunday as Nick Davidson works through it offensively is his nine rebounds Just his activity level Even tonight five rebounds again there on the offensive glass keeping that basketball alive Im a believer as a former coach that whenever youre active uh when youve got energy the offense will take care of itself And thats going to be the case for Nick Davidson as well James Graham good for three there Thats AlabamaMs first make from beyond the ark in the second half Welling one dribble falling away Little baby hook action Really good move by Carter Welling Just took his time got to his spot able to use that jump hook All 11 Tigers that have played tonight have now scored for Clemson Thats 12 for Welling on just three shots from the field Hes made a lot of hay at the free throw line Graham another three That one of the step back variety You can just see how this AlabamaM basketball team can score Uh you saw it this past week at the Bulldog Bash with wins over Lynen Wood and Charleston Southern Theyve got a bunch of different guys that can score the basketball Theyre in store for a really good season this year on the Hill And that last shot by Graham corrected to a twopointer as you see reflected in the score Justin Porter nice deceptive move unable to hit the shot Contavius Doer running the floor and bumps applause against his defender Defensive foul So Doer goes to the line Yeah really strong move to his right hand there by Contavius Doer Had Dylan Hunter backpedaling Just drop that shoulder Really high level scorers Darren They know how to get to the free throw line and Doer is no different able to draw that that foul and hell go back to the line Hunter gets a breather Just his first personal Doer good on the first Hell get a second Now nine points for Contavius Doer He averages just over 14 per game as the leading scoreer on the season for the Bulldogs And now hes into double figures to join PJ E Davidson cutting found by Welling and an easy jam for two Its a great set play Clemson has ran that action for years You used to see Ian Shefflin and PJ Hall in that twoman game for a dunk Really good pass there by Carter Welling to set Nick Davidson up at the rim Davidson left his feet on the pump fake from three Graham step into the lane and cant hit Scrappy rebound for Clemson Thomas thought about the three Davidson out for Thomas Open this time High rebound Two looks ahead Graham for the Bulldogs Rejected by Welling Heres Justin Porter stepping through the lane and receiving the foul AlabamaMs has been really good offensively at times during tonight but Graham had a drive right there We had a chance to kick that out for an open three But on the other end for the Tigers just really good offensive execution Carter Welling able to find Nick Davidson on that high low pass resulted in the dunk at the rim But Clemson does such a good job of turning their defense into offense We saw that block shot It allowed Clemson to get out in transition One of the best things that they do is throw that outlet pass I mean we saw that pass right there by Nick Davidson That was a 40ft outlet pass to start transition and to get Clemson out on the break First miss from the stripe for Foster or Porter tonight rather He gets the tail in Still a game high for Porter 14 points as he exits and Brad Brownell calls a timeout 35 points the lead for Clemson athletics that have been around for a long time Henrys one of those guys that uh makes Clemson athletics so special He he bleeds orange No question about that Former student athlete himself here at Clemson ACC champion in 1991 with the football team and has a son at Pendleton High School thats a really talented athlete as well Another long make for James Graham the third for AlabamaM there These are some tough shots hes gotten up and through Contested and I think thats one of the things that AlabamaM will take out of this just like the Indiana game earlier in the year High low Davidson off the mark on the first able to regain his composure and bank it in for two AlabamaM has made some difficult shots in November and so as they get into conference play later in the year uh theyre going to be well prepared and an offensive foul off the ball Thats AG Enyang That is number five for him So he step aside a week from Tuesday Really hard schedule coming up in December Uh and that graphic doesnt include a trip to Syracuse on uh December 31st So Brad Brownell and the rest of the team uh theyre going to learn a lot about themselves over the next 30 30 31 days Clemson feeding the post Trent Steinhower checked in during that break the freshman and hell immediately go to the free throw line You see how Clemson has fared in nonconference games so far this season pretty good tight victories over West Virginia and Georgia You mentioned earlier how tough they played at Georgetown coming up short Yeah the Georgetown game was a game they led uh in the second half going into the second half and uh just unable to finish it So again theyre going to play a really really good Alabama team in the ACC SEC challenge uh that gets underway this Tuesday just some incredible matchups as North Carolina and Kentucky get together plus so many others So Wednesday at Alabama uh and then a date with BYU and dynamic freshman AJ Debons up at Madison Square Garden Trent Steinhower with the jam and the basket for Clemson So now all 12 players who have seen action for the Tigers are in the scoring column A testament to just the depth and the skill level uh of this Clemson program that all 12 have been able to score tonight and only two in double figures yet 90 points here with two and a half to play I thought it was interesting this week Darren just in preparing for the game You study the top 25 scorers in the ACC right now theres not a single player from Clemson in that group Uh but as you just talk about it you know the six uh different guys that have led them in scoring so far this year And thats how this team is going to have to be successful Its going to be by committee Its going to have to be different guys every night Great to see this young freshman right here though Trent Steinhower Ive been really impressed with him Hes got a high high skill level Uh can really shoot the basketball Getting stronger finish uh finishing at the rim And you see him right there finishing it off with a dunk at the rim Double team briefly on Graham the wall Abdur Raman had it knocked away Reathered and hits the midrange at the baseline Ace Buckner battling through the lane but hes fouled on the floor and hell go to the free throw line Lou Hutchinson charged with the foul Gives us a second to take a look at the day in Clemson Athletics Womens basketball with a victory in the Bahamas over Western Carolina and volleyball Their first win against Florida State since 2011 That was 20 consecutive matches They were unable to topple the Seinals Congrats to Clemson volleyball Yeah huge win for volleyball as they finish their season And then theres a football game tomorrow I heard its not in Clemson its in Colia but uh big football game in the state of South Carolina tomorrow as the Tigers and the Gamecocks get together at noon What do you think of that one You got a any clue Any any grasp on that one Man the hard thing this season uh you dont really know Uh but youre excited The Tigers have had success at Williams Bryce Stadium and so were hopeful One minute remaining in the game Under a minute to play here at Little John Coliseum Ace Buckner Got underneath the bucket with nowhere to go with it Yeah thats a clip that hes going to see on film tomorrow that if he plays on two feet hes got Steinhower right there for a dunk Had a couple possessions like that this past weekend in Charleston Uh the red shirt freshman leaving his feet at the rim with nowhere to go with the basketball Ram pulls again for three Clemson with the rebound Lot of valuable moments and minutes for the youngsters in this Clemson rotation tonight Yeah a lot of really valuable minutes also for AlabamaM Im just impressed at their level of execution particularly in the second half Theres Steinhower again fouled on his way up So the freshman goes to the free throw line And again you just see the talent that Zack Foster has that pass right there Steinhower rolls to the basket He looks off uh the defense and that help defender and able to deliver the ball to the rim Really good job by Zack Foster getting the ball to uh Steinhower at the rim You talk about the competitiveness for AlabamaM They went into the locker room at halftime down 30 Clemsons only outscored them by five in this second half Theyve been really competitive They really have Very impressed by Dante Jackson and what his staff is building there at AlabamaM Hutchinson drives and Graham dribbles out the clock to close this one out The Clemson Tigers with their seventh victory of the season They remain undefeated at home
