games in leading the nation in scoring at over 23 points per game Duke one of seven remaining unbeaten teams They are 110 They are 4 and 0 against ranked opponents The Red Raiders are 8 and3 0 and3 cheering against ranked opponents on the season And wed like to welcome those of you just joining us We are one possession into this game Dan Shman Jay Bilis Duke and Texas Tech A good defensive play by the Blue Devils to force a turnover at one end but then Cameron Dezer gives it back at the other end And Lewan Watts coming off the game of his life earlier this week banks it in to give the Red Raiders the early lead As we check the Duke starting lineup Nicholas Jimemenz starting his fourth consecutive game Obviously Cameron Boozer demanding so much attention the leading scoreer in the nation And one of the things Texas Tech is going to have to do against Cameron Boozer Theyre going to have to make him guard on the defensive end Open misses the three and down with a rebound is watch We mentioned the game of his life 36 against Northern Colorado on Tuesday and hes got the first two baskets in this one That 36 was on 12 of 13 from the floor And one thing you have to watch out with with Lean Watts hes got a great shot fake and he uses it He cheering can shoot the three Hes a good passer as well Texas Tech depleted in the front court A number of injuries topping is really their only true size and shot blocker But a good defensive play by Watts Texas Tech wanted to come out aggressive on the defensive end and they have and Christian Anderson buries a three And what a start for Grant McCaslins team cheering Right out of the gates less than two minutes in Red Raider fans are on their feet here in New York Heres Caleb Foster on the drive Cant finish cheering it Watch the rebound And rebounding going to be a big factor in this game Texas Tech an excellent offensive rebounding team because of JT Toppen There are those shot fakes from Watts And he lays it in with the left And how about a nine to nothing start and John Sh needs a timeout 216 in Communicative defensive team but theyve been in gaps Theyve been alert Theyve communicated early Theyve allowed 90 or more points in each of their last two games and almost all of the focus from Maslin has been at the defensive end as Nicholas Jmena knocks down a three to get the Blue Devils on the board Jamemena coming off a game against Lipkcom where he did not score Hes been starting the le last several games when he took over for Domar Boozer doesnt buy the fakes and knocks it away GBA thought about it and he is shooting the three every now and again this year Jamemena with a fake drive and a lay in and hes gone all five for Duke A really good shot fake by Jamea out of the left corner Got Brian Tyrie Bryan off the floor and off balance then drove it with the right hand Really smart play by the freshman at the point for the Red Raiders with the ball Christian Anderson one of the best point guards in the country but they harassed him out near midcourt and he turns it over They just blitzed him off the ball screen made him back up but a terrific shot fake and right around Tyrie Bryan to get all the way to the rim When Duke keeps its floor spacing its really hard to help on those kind of drives when the ball moves Duke this year has been a very good offensive team and a sensational defensive team Isaiah Evans misses the three Texas Tech better at the offensive end so far this season than at the defensive end In off the bench for the Red Raiders freshman Jaylen Petty out of Seattle Broke his nose a couple of weeks ago Thats why hes got that mask on And a foul on him as Watts drew the foul on his way to the rim John Shier in his fourth year as the head coach at his alma mater and led him into the final four last year The fastest ACC coach ever to get to 100 victories Only took him 122 games Vic Bubis had been the fastest the coach at Duke in the 1960s I actually thought that Bill Guthridge had been the fastest He was right up there but not as many as Bubis had How about JT Toppin He is going to have to work really hard to get the shots that he wants in this game tonight They use him in a lot of screen roll situations and hes a great roller He and Christian Anderson work a lot together in pick and roll situations but you know that JT Toppin wants to get back to that left hand at every opportunity Swings it into the corner A wide open Foster cant get it to go Its amazing how many opportunities Cameron Boozer opens up for his teammates Hes the leading assist guy for Duke Now hes switched off on Christian Anderson Anderson averaging seven and a half assists per game Fourth in the nation Petty slivers into the paint I dont know if that was a pass or a shot but it worked out fine for Topic Thats a Derek Wittenberg assist Whittenberg still insists that that was a pass to Lorenzo Charles Eightpoint lead Texas Tech Fumbled away by Evans Duke was plagued by turnovers in the first half of their game against Lipkcom a few days ago before they recovered to put him away in the second half Anderson tipped away by Malik Brown One of the best defensive players in the nation Good pass Watts open in and out Booze the rebound Well you get two on the ball and Christian Anderson passes out of it so effectively Boozer guarded by Toppin and a foul One of the huge keys for the Red Raiders is to keep Tophin out of foul trouble tonight The more he guards Boozer the tougher that is going to be Jays going to break for ranked teams Another thing that Boozer does well is get to the line and shoots them pretty well 79 And theres a look at that foul that he drew Yeah you can have an arm bar in the back of a postman but once they face up you got to take it off And Boozer just really intelligently just went right into that arm to draw a cheap foul and get two free throws out of And fouls on top It are a huge key to this game because of the injuries that we alluded to Texas Tech is really really thin up front with Luke Bamboo Marielle Aquinuk and Josiah Mosley All of whom would figure into the front court rotation All of them out with injuries Eddie know And Brown down with a rebound for the Blue Devils Anytime Boozer switches Duke switches one through four They need to to really go ball screen on him and put him in a position to have to guard And Grant McCaslin is really getting into his team right now But the defensive end and this has been his frustration is their defense recently his third season as the head coach in love took him to the Elite 8 last year before they lost a close game to the eventual national champions the Florida Gator wide open three and Dom Sar who has been struggling this season no longer a starter for this Duke team but still a player with a lot of upside he knocks down a long jumper well anytime Boozer gets double teamed and he did right there Duke wants to pass out of it but how you beat a double team is pass out of it twice and thats what they did to get it to Sard Sard very active defensively as well Open three for Donovan Atwell wont go He is a really good threepoint shooter Texas Tech as a team shoots the three well Kayen Boozer will not finish it but he does draw the foul and will head to the line Well one thing you cant do against Texas Tech is let Donovan Atwell get a catch and shoot The lefty has made 35 threes on the season and hes only made 41 field goals but 35 of them are threes You got to make him put the ball on the deck So Kaden Boozer at the line cheering Twin brother of Cameron 19 minutes per game for Kaden Boozer averaging about six six points almost four assists per game Some games Caleb Foster plays more some Kayen Boozer plays more Its a pretty tight nineman rotation that John Sher has and theyll play Foster and and Kaden Boozer play some minutes together and that allows Caleb Foster to operate more as a scorer which is more his natural position So Duke has gotten back into it after the Red Raiders bolted out to a nine to nothing lead to start the game This is Anderson his second year in the program And again seven and a half assists per game and he can score it as well Misses that three Sar down with a rebound Those are shots that he normally makes Hes an excellent contested jump shooter He averages you were saying averages close to eight assists a game but also 19 points Saw on the drive Boozer got a finger on it but back comes Toppin Texas Tech is going to have to gang rebound on the defensive end in this game Duke has much better rebounding numbers on the season than the Red Raiders do And to make sense Duke has great positional size Everybody who plays at least 64 once again loves to back his man down And he does it again Well especially when he has a size advantage had 21 against Illinois Had a terrific game against LSU with a double double 15 points 10 rebounds He can play Hes got a lot of game He can pass out of the post as well The big guys on both teams good passes Theres Boozer finding Saw and way short on the corner three Knocked away by Brown As we mentioned one of the best defenders in college basketball at any position Brown with the offensive rebound Hayden Boozer misses a three and Watts leads him the other way Boy Malik Brown has amazing hands Toppin draws the foul to take us to the under 12 media timeout Jay broke down Cameron Deoozer for you Hell do the same to JT Toppin Lost both of those games This is a a young guy who was not even a starter cheering in high school He didnt even play varsity until his junior year Just kind of a a late uh it took him a while to kind of grow into his body and gather in that coordination Im still working on it by the way Im 58 But he goes to New Mexico for a year Then comes last year And what does he do Hes the Big 12 player of the year a season ago A consensus second team allAmerican and just a guy who can help you win games Jay so many different ways Well the one area thats his kryptonite right now is free throw shooting He shoots under 50 from the foul line That means you just cant allow him layups or dunks You have to foul him and make him earn it from the free throw line And Texas Tech not a great free throw shooting team overall They dont get there often and they dont make them as often as they should when they get there Just under 67 as a team on the season Foster back in there for Duke Evans has returned as well Some tough matchups Boozer on the bench right now Foster for three and he is having a nice bounceback year in this his junior season after last year was a struggle for him through much of the year Made the biggest bucket in the Breerland Center against Michigan State when Duke won that game against the Spartans That three he hit was huge Anderson steps back now has Patrick Gumba the second on him Topin inside lays it in He is so quick off the floor Once JT Toppin catches the ball he is going to get to that left hand no matter what It is amazing when you watch game after game of the Red Raiders how hard they work sometimes to get him to use the right hand and how skilled he is at getting back to the right shoulder using the left hand Heres a mismatch in the post Gumba up and in Thats going to be so difficult for Lean Watts to have to guard Theyre not sending a double And you know that Patrick Dumba is going to go after him at every opportunity Watch gives you everything he has but he is still undersized to play the fourman Again because of the injuries they just dont have many options up front will put up the three Not close And here come the Blue Devils Not a very good offensive possession right there for Texas Tech But Watson is going to have to front Gumbbo when he gets down in the post But its hard to front him for that long cuz he can move you up the lane They can just throw over the top Harris keeps it in bounds again Gumba and watch with the shot clock AT 10 DARREN HARRIS KNOCKS down to three and Duke has its first lead of the night And Grant McCaslin wants a timeout It was about some of the things that have to improve Its not a lock lack of talent Its about some of the attention to detail that has to improve in his mind at the defensive end Well I dont think Graham McCasslin is worried about Texas Techs ability to score but theyve got to get stops to be an elite team Top this time up and in with the right Well you dont send a double at him Hes a difficult matchup in a back down Hes so athletic and that motor has never stops revving topping on Booer right now Vanena and put five points in the first two three minutes of the game but he misses that three So far the Texas Tech Guards have done a nice job of helping the big guys out on the glass Theyre sending all five to the defensive glass We have only seen six players on the floor in this game for Texas Tech And is it possible Jay as we get another look at the last topping bucket is it possible that they will only use six guys tonight They only use six against Arkansas Theyve done it before I think it depends on how the game goes with regard to fouls And you certainly dont want to see anybody twist an ankle or anything but you always have to be concerned about that But yeah you could see him go with six Top end with a screen and a rescreen Watts with a shot fake Boozer doesnt bite Shot clock at five Anderson Boozer the rebound Boozer so hard to move because his low base is so strong His dad Carlos is here in attendance watching his sons play Cameron and Kaden And theres Camboozer banking it in So skilled in the post as well Hes got an amazing feel for the defense with his back to the basket He can feel where you are and hes got counter moves to go with his goto moves cheering Watching Topin knocked away by Gumba and JT Toppin just picked up his second foul Well I thought Gunga fouled Topa and going over the top to knock that ball away as that timeout was beginning And it wasnt to address any of his players It was to talk to one of the officials about hey you got to keep an eye on this He had my guy wrapped up and now he picked up his third right there Unless they say he grabbed him but its their its the the only option they have is to call that a flagrant one Yeah So thats two shots and the ball for Texas Tech I think that I think its what happened with both arms but especially that angle really shows what happened with the the left arm of Patrick Gumba cheering So the biggest part of this is obviously that theres no third foul anymore on top And now you got to believe that Grant McCaslin said to him Hey man meet you on the court Be really really careful the next 746 Yeah really smart by Grant McCaslin to appeal that for that very reason just to get that foul taken off was reward enough because if JT Toppen would have to sit with three fouls that really limits Texas Techs ability to win this game So two in the ball So one of two for Topa to tie it up and the Red Raiders will inbound it in a tie game with 745 to go here in the first half And really Duke now when they have the ball have to take every opportunity to go right at JT Toppin to pick up that third And Lewan Watts skillfully draws a foul on Darren Harris Hey we got a pair of great games for you tomorrow on ESPN at 1 Eastern Itll be NC State and Miss in Greensboro North Carolina Then at three Cincinnati and Clemson in Greenville South Carolina Both games also streaming on the ESPN app top and guarded by Boozer Anderson misses a three Hes the guy that really has to get going for Texas Tech He can put up points in a hurry Christian Anderson Heres a guy John Sh would love to see get going on a consistent basis Isaiah Evans He is scoreless tonight A nice pass from Boozer Crosscourt to Sar for his second three of the game Had a technical foul on Sar I believe Dame Sar might have celebrated a little bit too enthusiastically and just got teed up He must have said something to Atwell on the way down or the bench So two free throws for Atwell and John Sher obviously upset with Domar just for taking away the momentum of that three and it cost him a couple of points Cameron Boozer the best passer on this team Star with a catch and shoot and Sense say was to the bench I thought it might have been to Atwell but he said something to the Texas Tech bench He was actually the closest to head coach Grant McCaslin when he turned and said something Dont know if it was in his direction specifically Watts Foster in transition spinning puts it up and draws a foul Caleb Foster smart there going up up up against Jaylen Petty Hes got a size advantage Pettys only 61 wearing that mask after breaking his nose a couple weeks ago in practice But people tend to forget I mean Caleb Fosters 65 Hes got positional size as a point guard cheering The longest tenur player in the Duke Program He is a junior And as we get a look now at Leon her a sophomore from Dallas who comes into the game Petty sits after picking up his second So her becomes the seventh player in the game Couple of misses by Foster Everybodys reaching and grabbing for it And another Texas Tech foul This one is on Atwell Well you really have to block out Cameron Boozer in that second slot Hes so difficult because hes so strong in his lower body Difficult to pinch in on him to keep him from wedging you further in and going up over the top and grabbing an offensive rebound 17 fouls So one and one for Patrick Gunga II who has taken a big leap forward here in his sophomore season Getting a lot more minutes a lot more of an opportunity but he has earned it His scoring is three times what it was a season ago Hes leading the Duke team in block shots And I thought he was spectacular in that game against Florida He had 11 points five rebounds five assists and five blocks against that massive Gator front line Right now Dante Sar just face guarding Christian Anderson with his size Red Raiders started hot led nine to nothing now down by three Anderson creating space bounces it into top end and good defense by Gumba Having that size on Christian Anderson made a difference Payeyton Boozer crosses over lays it in applause He looks so comfortable in transition doesnt he When Texas Tech does not score its been their transition defense thats hurt them a bit Around and out on the three attempt there by Toppin a 20 threepoint shooter on the season Camboozer with the left and Toppin comes up with a loose ball cheering Watts flying down the court in transition Got stuck under the rim He was looking more for the foul than the score That was a body seeking attempt John Sh hollering out of play Payeyton to Cameron Boozer in the corner Saw got another one His third three of the game This is the best that Damesar has played this season He looks so confident cheering applause Watts trying to get around Cambooer kicks it out cheering Her off the glass and good Leon her averaging 10 minutes per game three points per game Banks one in A much needed bucket for the Red Raiders Grant Mccas was telling us today at the shootound that hes got good scoring instincts Boy Ill tell you Gumba is getting really physical initiating contact with Topin on his way down the court Kicks it out to Kaden Boozer who knocks down a three Duke is catching Texas Tech in rotation and taking advantage of the Red Raiders with that extra pass cheering Watts wants to go oneonone with Saw Wants to back him down Watch the shot gets it to go Hes got all kinds of game down in the post He transferred in from Washington State cheering Averaged about 14 and seven there but loves those back downs Again coming off a 36point game against Northern Colorado on Tuesday Sar a pass for Young and a foul called on the Red Raiders Number two on Atwell Atwell hasnt made a field goal yet Hes a great threepoint shooter 42 on the season Texas Tech makes 11 threes per game Jay And theyre one for nine from threepoint range tonight Well D they havent taken some they havent taken as good a threes as they usually do And Donovan Atwell his his best shots are catch and shoot threes And Duke hasnt allowed him to catch and shoot Theyre making him put it on the deck Gamba a 72 free throw shooter misses the front end of a one and one Dante Sar is about 68 And that size on Christian Anderson is impactful Sar a foul here and itll be Anderson at the line when we come back Foul on Dame Sar on the last possession But Dan to your point about Cameron Boozer I mean Dukes got seven assists in this game Six of them are from Boozer and Gungba Their playm their best playmakers are their big guys which is unusual Anderson one of two Just the third alltime meeting between these two programs Duke has won each of the previous two seven years ago to the day in this building They beat as Boozer spins and is bowed And Duke also victorious in the 2022 Sweet 16 against Texas Tech Hey tomorrow night on ESPN its a double header in the Bay Area Womens Classic from the Chase Center in San Francisco Italy Oregon and Stanford at 6 Eastern than number 19 USC Impal at 830 Eastern You can see the games on ESPN or also on the ESPN app And that foul that whistle that was indisputably number three on JT Toppin Well Duke was smart with Toppin guarding Cameron Boozer They just went to Boozer at the elbow for an isolation and he faced up and just spun right into JT Toppen to pick up that third foul That was a huge call So now theyre quote unquote big guys are Lewan Watts a 66 forward and Leon her a 64 wing Those are the two guys playing in the bottom two slots on the free throw One of those guys is going to have to guard Camboozer on the offensive end What Texas Tech needs to do is play five out spread the floor Watts driving on Boozer Lost it Got it back Lays it in There is no back down in him Well theres that shot fake Got Cameron Boozer into the air Thought he could have picked up a foul there Watch the high score in the game with a dozen Boozer gets his own miss Up and in And one Theres just no way at that size youre going to be able to stop Cameron Boozer As soon as he caught the ball just use that strength to bully his way to the basket 68 and strong against 64 just isnt going to work for Texas Tech And its not just the initial shot Hes so quick to get his own miss And you got to believe every trip down the floory picks up a foul Every trip down the floor for Duke for the last 313 of this half with Toppin on the bench that balls going inside the Boozer No question If they draw two defenders then you just kick it out and Dukes been excellent knocking down threes off relocation Eightpoint lead Duke corner at the line One and one for him biggest impact he had in a game this year Played 18 minutes off the bench against Wyoming a couple of weeks ago Four points four rebounds This is a team Texas Tech was ranked 10th in the nation preseason But again the multiple injuries they have in the front court have really changed the course of their season to a certain extent and they hope to get these guys back once they get into conference play But Jake conference play in the Big 12 this year is going to be a bear And Texas Tech has played a really good schedule They lost at Illinois in a really close game Also lost against Arkansas in a really close game Horners trying to front this girl to the back And another foul So hell make him earn it on the line But that balls going into Boozer every time down When youre trying to front when youre just 64 what you really have to do is put great pressure on the ball If you can get the passer to turn his back you can make it really difficult But thats asking a lot for a 64 wing even as strong as Leon her is to guard Cameron Boozer 64 215 trying to guard 69 250 bell Sevenpoint lead for Duke 302 to go here in the half What if her is going to stay on Boozer Hes really got to get lower and use leverage Thats the best he can do And Im not sure fronting is the right answer So maybe if you stay behind and try to push him off the lane youve got more of a chance Anderson gets the switch Brown on him now Back to Watts cheering driving on Kaden Boozer 10 to shoot Anderson cant get a shot off over Brown and turns it over Brown knocked it away from him His hands are amazing Boozer underneath to Brown who lays it into the other end applause But this is a really important 220 stretch for Texas Tech They got to stay in this one Theres been a 19point swing in this game The Red Raiders led nine nothing and now Dukes up by 10 Watch Not this time applause And without topping in there zero offensive rebound opportunities Kaden Boozer Evans puts up the three And a good job by her to hold off Brown and come down with the rebound But Brown almost got a hand on that one cheering Anderson the drive Lost it Knocked away from behind Was that Brown again Might have been Anderson inside and hell head to the line cheering Whether its a missed shot or a miscue Duke is getting the ball down court quickly I mean it may not be a fast break layup but it is really putting a lot of pressure on the Texas Tech transition defense So at the line Darren Harris he is the ninth man in what is a nineman rotation for the Blue Devils but he has already played more minutes this year cheering than he played all of last season Shoots the ball well coming off a good game against Lipkcom Again a game that Duke trailed even early in the second half He had 11 points two assists two steals off the bench in that one Where Harris has really improved is on the defensive end from last year to this Hes excellent in catch and shoot situations So youve got to make him bounce it but hes much more confident out on the floor You can see it And that lead is now up to a dozen the biggest of the night for the Blue Devils Boy Malik Brown makes it hard just to get a catch in the scoring area Got to be so worried about his hands As it was said at practice today the Texas Tech practice hes got the best hands in the country Cant let him knock it away from you Watts lays it in with the left and he is doing everything he can to keep his team in the game when he gets a switch Dawan Watts his eyes just get bigger Wow thats an interesting call Well I thought that might have gone on Atlas Its an offensive foul on Cam Boozer cheering Thats interesting cheering Well if they can get a score and a stop given that they played without top in the last few minutes Brent McCaslin might feel okay about things heading into halftime That would definitely stop the bleeding Anderson cant get by Kaden Boozer Good defense Atwell inside Horner reverses it up and in over Boozer What a great recovery by Leoner He has given them some energetic much needed minutes off the bench Shot clock turned off Duke can hold I think you got to let Cam Boozer touch it cheering Here it is Do they double Here it comes And Cam finds Kaden Boozer to Boozer for the bucket Anderson leaves it short and the first half comes to a close with Camboozer kind of taking over late after Christian Anderson has got to get going He only had four points one of four from the field in the first half Its kind of amazing given that they only made one three Top picked up three fouls Anderson was unable to get shots on that They were only down 10 But now it is 13 after Caleb Foster buries a three to open the second half You know for Texas Tech thats just too easy You know Christian Anderson didnt rotate back out with a sense of urgency to really get pressure on that shot or at least make Caleb Foster think about putting the ball on the deck Grant McCaslin has made a change in his starting five here in the second half as Watts lays it in Hes got a game high 16 Tyrie Bryan started the game played just over three minutes did not come back in And Leon her who checked in later on in the first half is a starter here in the second half and he is on Boozer right now Jame is open The assist to Evans and now nine made threes for Duke Duke is just making the extra pass to JT Toppen had to get out to the wing and then just a quick swing to Jimena in the corner for an easy catch and shoot Watts will step back missed the long range jumper tipped by Toppin Duke ball cheering Duke playing out of the post The quick skip and the extra one Its not just the first pass its the second pass that really burns Texas Tech on the rotation Gets them into scramble mode Red Raiders would love to get healthy in time for conference play As we mentioned the Big 12 is so so strong this year A layin for Booer and he is getting anything he wants to down to the post right now Well its such its such a dilemma Dan If you go down and double him he passes it back out and Dukes going to get an open three You keep him oneonone in the post Hes going against Leon Horner at 64 he just walks him into the middle lane drop step and gets to that right hand and not only makes the bucket but picks up the foul Given the injuries and the personnel that they have there are really very few answers right now for Texas Tech at the defensive end in terms of dealing with Boozer Well normally theyd have Luke Vanboy a 611 sophomore who transferred in from VCU was an excellent defender all defensive team in the Atlantic 10 one of the top shot blockers in the country last year They also would have some size with Mario Aquinto a 611 red shirt freshman and another player we mentioned earlier on Josiah Bosley a transfer from Villanova He has yet to play this season all of them out with injuries and again hopefully they will get at least a couple of them back before too long because in the Big 12 theyre going to have to deal with Arizona and Houston and Iowa State and BYU and Kansas and others Evans misses the three Gumba is fouled Is it topping It is No I dont know I think I thought it was I think its Watts Well then theyre going to get lucky cuz he he was from the back side Yeah I agree with you But I think the foul went on Watts And as it is its his third Offensively Texas Tech needs more of what they just did which was that slot pick and roll applause Another foul This ones her Thats four right Yeah Leon her who hasnt played that many minutes just picked up his fourth They immediately doubled Patrick Dunbo when he caught the ball But it wasnt just the double team to get it out of his hands They were swiping at him Duna right back to Foster Too strong off the glass Can they get Anderson going at the offensive end Top end oneonone with the Gumba Atwell short on the three Rebound Evans cheering into Boozer for the easy two They dont have an answer down there Well Christian Anderson was trying to front him and Duke intelligently got it to the right angle They got it to Gumba up top for the dump down and Duke starting to pull away now up by 16 When Cameron Boozers in the post hes always open You just have to get the ball to the right angle topping held by Gumba and draws the foul You got Anderson fronting and they just got it to the right angle He held his position They throw it right over the top Really smart by Caleb Foster to relocate the ball to Gumba for that high low look If you had to pick one thing about Camboozer that separates him at the offensive end from all of the other great big guys around the country what would it be His passing He Hes a big time passer cheering He can see over a double team He never seems to panic when a double team comes to him And then Duke doesnt just take the shot off his pass So he probably gets a lot of hockey assists he passes back out So hes leading the team this Duke team in assists at about four per game And I think hes leading him in assists tonight as well He had five assists in that first half But hes responsible for more assists than that because when he passes it out you know that leads to a second pass that will lead to an open shot And then you have thought about it Atwell on him Brown back into the game for the Blue Devils Was his usual outstanding defensive self in the first half Amenu with the fake and the drive Blocked from behind but its tipped right to Brown who banks it in applause And Malik Brown even though hes not a big time scorer and hes only averaging about six points per game does take a lot of shots Hes shooting about 75 from the field but hes such a valuable piece because of his defensive versatility and really defensive brilliance A much needed three there for Donovan Atwell and the Red Raiders Well Nick Kmenya turned his head when the ball went inside Just kicked back out and he couldnt recover Couldnt find Atwell for that catch and shoot And then you open on the wing Rebound Watts Watts has played every second of the game Atwell and Anderson have as well Three Texas Tech players have been in the game for its entirety Well you cant back down Malik Brown cuz he knocks the ball away from you He knocked it away from Wats there And a kick ball thatll reset the shot clock to 20 and take us to the first immediate timeout of the second by a point Carolinas only lost once this year Louisvilles got a very good team Virginia under Ryan ODM is ranked right now What are your thoughts on the differences or the improvements maybe in the ACC from last year to this year Vastly improved I mean last year was I think everyone would agree in the ACC office A down year for the league Not so much this year One of the better leagues in the country this year Well Ill tell you Watts gets a for effort all the time And he knocks down another little jump hook He is following up on that 36point outing Hes got 20 already tonight What a pass cheering They play on and Cam Boozer will finish again Just a beautiful pocket pass right in the middle of the floor That puts both Watson and Tophin in a really bad spot I think Tophin picked up the foul there applause He did And its number four And Grant McCaslin is going to make the move with 1509 to go Toppin is going to have to come out of this game And when Tophen picked up his second foul it one of the things I think it really did was take the starch out of his offensive rebounder Dukes done a great job on the defensive glass not allowing a lot of second shot opportunities And JT Topman one of the best offensive rebounders in the country averages almost five offensive rebounds a game In this one I think hes only got one Watch picks up his dribble finds Atwell Anderson with Sar on him Sar a very good defender lots of length Shot clocks down to two And Anderson never is able to get it off over Malik Brown And Malik Brown switched off on him He got that kind of size and the ability to move feet great hands and Christian Anderson just couldnt see the basket Boy you ask anybody in the Duke program about Malik Brown He offers so much more value than the numbers would indicate Hamboozer to a cutting soul Thats a travel When Sar has been on Christian Anderson with his length and athleticism hes really made things difficult on the Texas Tech guard I mean averaging 19 points a game he hasnt been able to get anything in this one Sar a freshman from Italy who has previous pro experience in Spain Anderson with Cam Boozer switching on to him A little push there by Anderson to create the space and knock it down That little step back really the only space hes been able to create in the first 27 minutes of this game Sar has hit three of them already tonight Not this time And watch the rebound Thats a heck of a box out by Lean Watts on Malik Brown Watts chosen preseason is the Big 12 newcomer of the year Theres a foul by Darren Harris Christian Anderson when he got the switch and got Boozer on him he did give a push off there but that just little stop and step back move helped him create that space with the momentum of Boozer going toward the baseline Now Boozer is going to get a breather Hell head to the bench Patrick Gunga the second back in for Duke From a physical standpoint you dont get much of a break when youre Texas Tech when a guy like Dumba comes back into the game Corner three will go Its a 102 run right now for Texas Tech And theyve got it down to single digits And now theyve got IT DOWN BUT NOT FOR LONG Bounds takes it away You always have to be aware of where Malik Brown is Seems like hes not in the play just knocks it away from Lewan Watts and turns a disadvantage into an advantage and a potential threepoint play His defensive prowess I dont think can be overstated And all the momentum was heading towards Texas Tech A 102 run down to single digits Not only do they give it up and does Duke score its also the fourth foul on Watts So hes got four Toppinss got four and Dukes up by 12 portion of the season for the sport as a whole because of all of those matchups that youre talking about Well can Texas Tech rally again Had it down to nine Watts picked up his fourth foul and Watts has gone to the bench right now So theres no Topin and theres no Watts Nolan Groves is into the game for the first time as Brown erases that one Texas Tech wants a goal and the official on our side of the court Chance Moore blew the whistle and says thats a basket It looked to me like it hit the backboard Yeah me too So a successful challenge Take the basket off the board The reason I laughed is Chuck came over and said Hey I havent had a chance to say hello to you guys yet tonight So take the basket off the board And because uh it was clear possession for Patrick Gumba it is going to remain Duke ball They will not go to the arrow in terms of judging possession So 6351 with 1253 to go But Dukes had some nice contributions from its bench in this game Dame Sar has come in done a good job Darren Harris Kayen Boozer Eight of the nine Blue Devils who have played have scored The only one who hasnt is Isaiah Evans a starter who is their second leading scoreer on the season And thats been one of the questions asked about this Duke team at times this year Jay as good as they are do they have that you know goto number two guy behind Cam Boozer And can they be a great great team if they dont know who their night inout number two guy is Well a good way to play is have the goto guy be the open man and thats the way theyve been through most of the season Rose is fouled on the play Bull Mania rolls on on Monday afternoon Itll be Washington State and Utah State meeting on the blue turf for the famous Idaho Potato Bowl Tune in to ESPN Monday at 2 Eastern I wonder if there were residual payments to like Richie Saunders family at BYU considering his greatgrandfather invented the tater tot We owe the family as a whole a huge debt of gratitude for inventing the tater tot And heres a huge play for Christian Anderson with three and a chance for four just off that screen and drop coverage Something we showed a little bit earlier from some of the prior games that Texas Tech has played And instead of getting a side contest you just cant foul an excellent jump shooter like Christian Anderson and give him an opportunity like this Just put late pressure on the shot And Boozer back in Brown to the bench And in some ways it doesnt feel like it but its only an eightpoint game with a lot of time left to go And theyre doing this without Topin and without Watts And the key question is when do you bring Tophin back but Dukes going to go to Camboozer Hes got Groves on him Groves another perimeter guy a wing a freshman from Long Lake Minnesota The Gatorade player of the year in Minnesota last year in high school Rebound for Anderson And its her underneath I believe of Texas Tech who got called for the foul Got tangled up with Gumba And her saying Look he grabbed me Yeah So Toppin and Watts J have both come back in Each of them has four fouls Boy the Duke big guys have drawn a ton of fouls in this game Cam Boozer has drawn seven Dungas drawn six Dumbba with a lob in for Boozer Too far under the basket but Kaden Boozer is open in the corner Gunbo fouled and thats going to be number five on Watts Well they are running out of players Well that was a heck of a catch by Cam Boozer before he passed it out to Kaden in the corner Thats not much of a foul there That Thats an odd call there on Lan Watts Well he had a terrific game 20 points Thats awfully early to be fouling out of a game So three injured players and two players who have fouled out This is the group theyre going to have to finish with And remember Toppins got four This is the guy here with the ball in his hands Christian Anderson has to take over Still just an eightpoint game Anderson toppin throws open and an airball on the corner three Shot clock does not reset as the Red Raiders get it back sixpoint game I would doubt at any point even in practice Grant McCaslin has had this group of five on the floor at the same time I cant imagine either Hamzer going in top and good help by Anderson and its a hell ball and the possession arrow will give it to Tech cheering Petty coming off that ball screen Guna in drop coverage He just pulls right up and knocks down the midrange jumper And then when Boozer turns his back turns a terrific job by Christian Anderson of coming down and tying up that ball And it looks like they were the officials were going to give the ball to Duke that nobody had noticed the possession arrow was headed Texas Texway until Grant McCaslin started yelling at everybody Red ball red ball And then they corrected A bucket and a foul for Tophin And the Red Raiders are right back in it cheering operating out of the screen roll on the right side cheering Whenever you get JT Toppin in the middle of the floor he is so difficult to contain on that role Opens up to the ball Now he is not a great free throw shooter Shoots under 50 on the season cheering So free throw blockouts become a big deal Dumbba hits the floor hard The ball is loose The Red Raiders have it Top itll kick it out Groves misses it but another offensive rebound this time by Anderson Boy what an effort being put forth right now given everything they are dealing with by Tech Teddy No Followed by Anderson And its a twopoint game cheering How about the grit of Texas Tech It is a 205 Get pressure on the ball Just take try to take away the vision of the passer Otherwise Dukes going to be looking to get the ball inside to Cameron Boozer at every opportunity Still 10 minutes to go here in this one This is a game where Im not sure Isaiah Evans even music scored in this game He has not And again he is the second leading scorer for Duke on the season at better than 12 a game Hes only attempted three shots Groves is on Boozer Theyre keeping top away from him Hes on Brown Evans now has scored Just a little fade screen and then a rescreen to bring Evans back to the ball and he turned the corner Anderson gets a couple of the screens short on the three Evans the rebound fouled by Groves Those are the kind of fouls that Texas Tech cant pick up applause and give Groves credit for playing hard and going after the ball but fouling there puts an 87 free throw shooter at the line One and one for Isaiah Evans Come on cheering This is the front end as Boozer and Tophin both went crashing to the court Texas Tech dodged one right there Anderson again around a couple of screens Toppin surrounded in the paint He just couldnt get it up over the rim enough to knock it down And its still a fourpoint game Well Malik Brown did a really good job of keeping his body between Toppin and the basket Just make him make a tough one over Duke fans now making the noise Probably about 34 Duke fans here at the Garden tonight Evans puts it on the deck again scoops it up and draws another foul And I think its Groves again Evans after the la that last time out Duke ran something for him off that fade screen rescreen action for him to get his first bucket but hes been much more aggressive since that last time out cheering This one knocks down the first applause Tough box out assignment for Nolan Groves having to go against Malik Brown cuz you got to have two guys pinching on Cameron Boozer on the opposite side made them both The lead is six for the Blue Devils cheering applause Four guards and topping on the floor for the Red Raiders Petty finds his seat Couldnt finish it Do you think at any point today Nolan Groves thought he would be covering Cambuza for several minutes on end in this game Only in a nightmare he had last night Extra pass from Foster to Jimea Good close out by Anderson Shot clock at four Foster Yes Oh thats a big bucket by Caleb Foster applause throws the screen to try to free up Anderson into the paint steps back and hits Boy hes crafty Hes so good at getting a defender on his hip and unbelievably patient off pick and roll situations cheering keeping them within striking range Down by six 7 and 12 to go Boozer long drives into the paint and a chance for three Well Tophin was there and he picked that one up Seven points four steals and a block And then Dame Sar most of his damage was done in the first half He has nine points and Darren Harris put up five off the bench Thats really good bench production The four steals a season high for Malik Brown Cam Boozer at the line and completes the threepoint play This ball pressure by Foster on Anderson Now Brown switches onto him That last foul before the break ride the way was on Donovan Atwell of Texas Tech Anderson now trying to shake Kmenya Now Boozer he has seen four different defenders in this possession Toppin surrounded and turns it over Toppin hesitated and Duke swarm to the ball with active hands Be patient in the offensive end The menu wont force into Boozer kick to Foster wide open and Boozer took it away from Tophin to lay it in But Tophin had that ball in his hands and Boozer just took it away from him And that is not the kind of thing that happens to JT Toppin very often All of a sudden its an 112 run for Duke again after Texas Tech had gotten within two Anderson with a long three Thats what Texas Tech needs is for Christian Anderson to just go crazy here Hes got a green light and he can take advantage of it Hes up to 17 Theres that action with Evans setting a ball screen for Boozer A steal by Anderson Oh and Booer gets back to take it away And good defense there by Groves Didnt foul Brown and bothered him enough Anderson again Backto back threes for Christian Anderson whos now got 20 What a turn around Looked like Duke had a layup then they give up a three cheering 16 of Andersons 20 here in the second half Foster spins back to Camboozer Amen And Texas Tech has it again Boy some of these guys have to be exhausted Again Anderson and Atwell have played every second and Toppin has not missed all that much And its been rugged tough basketball because hes been seeing a lot of different defenders tonight Evans the switch on to Anderson with a shot clock inside 10 Now they got to switch with Boozer on Anderson Balls loose Shot clock at three got it on the rim Tin lays it in and its a threepoint game cheering How did Anderson get that shot off cheering This is pretty remarkable stuff again given who is not playing right now for Texas Tech How thin they are and Anderson has keyed with Gunga and Boozer on the floor at the same time So expect Duke to go inside where their big guys have drawn fouls and theyve also been able to pass the ball out of the post Playing a 65 freshman in Nolan Groves who does not play very much And not only is he playing big minutes hes guarding Camboozer every time down the floor Harris forces up a three Anderson trying to corral it in top and will We got to get the ball in Andersons hands here Inside four minutes in a onepossession game Toppin cant get by Gunga Petty with Gunga on him Does he want to drive him in to top it Too strong off the glass Gumba the rebound Couldnt really corral it with that left hand when he made a difficult catch Kayen Boozer puts it up and in Really smart attack by Kaden Boozer in transition Grant McCaslin not very happy with Jaylen Petty after that last decision that he made on the offensive end This is where Texas Tech wants the ball with Christian Anderson making decisions Young switches on to him Deep three Got it cheering And its a twopoint game What a second half for Christian Anderson He can go off on you and hes proving it in the second half Boy right now Duke probably fearing him more than Topp in the way that this game has developed 245 to go Five on the shot clock Foster splitting into the paint and they do not get it off applause cheering Well Christian Anderson has been taking advantage of switches Hes got Patrick Gumba on him Gumbas giving him a little bit of space but still a great contest on a deep three And Luan Watts who fouled out with over 11 minutes to go in regulation with 20 points is loving it from the bench Now 19 in the second half for Anderson They can tie or take the lead ON THIS THEYLL TIE IT Topin from Anderson cheering And somehow this game is not enough at 76 This is pretty remarkable stuff J Boozer fouled Either Groves or Petty reaching in Itll be Petty to send Boozer to the line Another big play by Anderson this time finding Toppin You spend a little bit too much time on the ball Patrick Gumba in that drop coverage and that middle screen roll with Christian Anderson and JT Toppin so difficult to deal with Another missed free throw this time by Boozer as Gumba sits and Brown returns Thats got to be 10 or 11 misses that Dukes have Thats 11 Ive got him at 15 for 26 on the night Just 58 One of two onepoint game with just over two minutes to go in regulation again It starts with Anderson Not a bad matchup for Duke with Malik Brown on Anderson And Grant McCaslin could feel nothing was happening Nothing good was going looking for the lead on this trip Toppin trying to back down Boozer Easier said than done TOUGH TURN AROUND BOY maybe not what he thought he wanted to do but he knocks it down and the Red Raiders have the lead We are just seeing big time play after big time play 120 to go Evans has it knocked away Anderson in transition cheering Duke ran the same play cheering Oh heres JT Toppin first backing down Boozer loses the ball a bit and then what a terrific turnaround jumper with the left hand And how about this finish by Christian Anderson How do you get that ball to go That touched every bit of the rim and he completes the threepoint play Theyve gone from 17 down to up by four here in the second half You got to go to Cam Boozer here They isolate him on the elbow He kicks it out The three Ken Boozer from the corner and its a onepoint game He just has the ability to make the right play Anderson spins out of harms way We are into the final minute of regulation here in New York The Red Raiders with the ball and a onepoint lead Theyre not going to bring top enough to set the screen cuz being hes being guarded by Malik Brown Anderson almost loses his footing Now he does and its Duke basketball He slipped not once but twice He says it was deflected out of bounds but it is Duke Ball with 30 seconds to go Just couldnt corral it tried to get it to Groves And it all may come down to this here with the game clock and the shot clock virtually bang on Camboozer screaming and a foul is called It will be Groves his third went back to the same action of getting him the ball on the elbow so he could just drive to his right against the smaller Nolan Groves Almost got that to go Two shots for Boozer Each team with one timeout remaining This is where a free throw blockout is a huge play Boozer now eight for13 from the line in this game and Grant McCaslin is going to use his last time out right here with 183 to go Great position to have a chance to steal this one Boozer missed the first then the timeout now the second free throw Got that one to tie it up Shot clock turned off No timeouts for the Red Raiders Looking to win it right here Foster guarding Anderson Down to 8 seconds Anderson trying to drive it And the foul is called on Foster with 34 to go Foster was really leaning in to Christian Anderson Hes really getting into his body and Andersons smart enough to go up with that shot Not sure whether this is going to be called a shooting foul but it should be Hey whatever the discussion was is over quickly 34 to go Anderson shoots about 75 from the foul line Boy now theyre doing a little dance in the lane Topping and Boozer going back and forth Whos on which side Who do I block out One and one here coming for Anderson cheering Takes it Duke does have one timeout remaining One of two tipped Evans has it And a timeout called with 19 to go And itll be Caleb Foster whos going to inbound it for Duke Im a little surprised that Texas Techs not putting pressure on this pass Theyve got two players in the vicinity of Evans right now Feeling that he is the most likely the guy that John Sh has drawn up a play for And JT Toppin Oh and now were being told by Chancer one of the officials the clock started late So not only is there no extra time its down to 16 Here we go cheering Foster gets it in Boozer puts it on and TEXAS TECH WINS IT cheering The Red Raiders come up with one of the most remarkable victories cheering for any program this season as they beat Duke 8281 here at the Garden Grant McCaslin told us at shootound today with all the injuries the difficulties the lack of size he said We are a no excuse program No excuses Holy cow What a win by Texas Tech Not even sure Boozer got the shot off What a fabulous win by the Red Raiders Fabulous One to celebrate one to send him home for the holidays in an unbelievable move They overcame so many things in this game here tonight in New York And now Grant McCaslin can finally let the emotion come out You can see the joy on his face What an incredible win for the Red Raiders tonight Their first win over a ranked team this season Their first win over a top five team since 2022
