Bessar to tip it off against Sam Yiglu Yiglu is a goodlook player if you havent seen him Was recruited in fact by North Carolina and decided to come to SMU The Tarheelss control the opening tip And with the basketball Ken Evans a transfer from Colorado State Besar and Wilson the two primary scorers for the Tarheels And Boopy Miller an instant takeaway cheering lays it off for Washington There you are We talked about transition especially off the turnover out front I thought Evans were really surveying things Boopy Miller with the quick hands cheering Tremble just back after missing almost a month with a broken right forearm Returned against Ohio State in that onepoint win the double team on Wilson and he traveled and its not just the fact its a double team its the big double team but theres the look Boopy Miller just keeping his eyes on the basketball and they really transition well Good finish down at the other end for Cory Washington Hey you pointed out already this transition game for SMU The Mustangs average 91 points per game 15th best in the country second best in the ACC in a Carolina takeaway Wilson just took off too far away from the basket that time Washington for three and Wilson with a rebound cheering This is a both teams would like to play at pace so theyre going to fall into that very comfortably Little give and go there and a miss The follow by Wilson Carolinas first bucket Yeah Basar is very mobile can shoot the three gets to the basket does a lot of screen roll getting into the rim The only game Carolina lost this year against Michigan State They were leading that game and then Bessar went out in foul trouble and Michigan State took advantage went on a 186 run and never looked back and they had some size also and also very physical Tomo teams as usual Treble into the lane jump stop and off the glass He pumped takes so many times everybody left him and the guy with the ball is usually pretty important You want to try and stay with him The guard spent three seasons at Arizona and boy has he blossomed into the one of the best big men in all of America through the first nearly two months of the season And if I tell you if you could totally can put some pressure on him defensively get him out of the game like what happened to Michigan State thatd be huge for SMU going coast to coast Shigolu with a rejection and bumped out of bounds Itll belong to the Mustangs Foul on Bessar And thats a cheap foul One you dont want having uh you know your big guy pick up and Yukatulu Thats thats an area that he needed to improve on from last year Tom that rim protection And hed had a great reaction on that play But for Vasar to pick up that foul in that situation thats a waste of a foul 42 Carolina early on here in Dallas Texas with a rebound up with a left hand Cant get the roll and knocked out of bound by Vesar Itll belong to SMU And you can see Vesar had to lay off that initial shot He really couldnt be as aggressive defensively not wanting to pick up that second 17minute mark Mustangs hit their first shot Theyve gone 0 for five since Davis 55 years young a native of Burke Virginia and now his fifth year at North Carolina They reached the first four in Dayton Ohio last year beat San Diego State and then eliminated in the official opening round by Old Miss 7164 I toldu I tell you hes got a chance Well and they should be feeding him all the time here early on Theres not much Bizar can do defensively Thats an automatic get him with two balls two feet in the paint Evans coming off his best game as a Tar Hell hit five threepointers in the route of Florida State And that will be a bump on Giron Pierre Jr Theres the look And thats a great post feed And as a as a big guy when you can catch with both feet in the paint area thats just a huge advantage He had Bizar and his back just went to work forced shot there and theres been a whole lot of that of late from Luca Bogots He is really struggling Thats a tough way to break out Think about breaking out to the rim He is some kind of fun to watch Loopy Miller two years at Central Michigan one year at Wake and now his second year at SMU And he is the undisputed leader along with this guy right here BJ Edwards of this SMU team Edwards a reigning ACC player of the week coming off his second double double of the year Kicks it to Miller Bang And thats a part of the game that really is expanded for Bookie Miller 42 from three cheering 70 run for the Mustangs Heres the quickest the quickness we talked undefeated beating a Wilt Chamberlain Kansas team in triple overtime But you went toetotoe with Dean He recruited you to come to North Carolina Yes he did And uh when I chose Duke he as actually wrote me a very heartfelt letter congratulating me and saying looking forward to competing against me It was unbelievable class by him Oh yeah All the way Sar crosscourt This has not been a good threepoint shooting North Carolina team Three second violation Thats one thing teams I would assume Mike Chaminsky are going to start packing it in and forcing the Tar Heels to beat them from downtown Yeah And thats you know they addressed the height issue Weve talked about that but their threepoint shooting a little sluggish this year Slow to get off you know especially like Wilson and you know those Im going to play off of them and make them beat me over the top Iu working on Basar and he couldnt finish around the basket They said hes been much better Well and and hes getting great looks Uh just a little bit of a rush that time Interesting Caleb Wilson out of the game here early on Well Wilson for as much production as he has had averaging 20 points and 11 rebounds he only plays 30 minutes a game I say only 30 There are a number of players for both teams that are playing in excess of 32 34 Well especially SMU theyre their starting five are going to play the bulk of the minutes in this game Looked like Stevenson got bumped in the face but he got the rebound and was able to clear it out of there as he is checked in for Wilson rejected by Jaden Tunes a freshman out of Amarillo Texas And at the other end its another freshman Yeah this team has got theyve got a lot of veteran presence and theyve also got five young guys five freshman a really highly touted freshman class cheering Another takeaway And here comes BJ Edwards AND HOW ABOUT THAT THE ALIOOP TO Pierre Jr And you know what was great about that He knew he couldnt dunk He didnt go for the highlight So he just got the two points Smart cheering play An 110 run for SMU cheering They trail this game four2 and now lead 134 Smothering defense by the Mustangs cheering in the corner and needing that one Carolina Thats Derek Dixon the freshman out of Vienna Virginia Good movement around against that zone You got a nice look down in the corner Neither one of these teams goes particularly long on that bench Shorter steal for SMU Chuns a long three Not going to be there And quickly at the other end and laying it at home is Jiren Stevenson transfer from Alabama and an offensive foul will go against Miller How about Stevenson He laid the ball in and then draws a charge Well and Stevenson has had an impact on this game since hes come in And uh heres the the look ahead and very good running the floor Took a spill right then but then just getting right back into the play Didnt get a good look at that tumble but it looked like Miller just tried to back into him But for for right now Stevenson and Wilson may be a better combination than Basar and Wilson just because of that early foul Stevenson is a former North Carolina high school player of the year He played for his father Jared in Pittsboro North Carolina Elected to go to Alabama for two years and now his first year at UNC Jonathan Powell the former Ohio Division One player of the year Shot clock violation on the air ball Just had to chuck it up here was Dixon Uh and thats that was his responsibility It looked like he was not aware of the shot clock that time Point guards got to have that awareness After the 11 nothing run its a five nothing swing for North Carolina Into the game Germaine ONeal Jr Yes His father played 18 years in the NBA and he is coming off a monster game and 21 points in 20 minutes against Cal State Fullerton Yeah but Pierre Jr is stepping up and this I mean you know we talked about Boopy Miller but Pierre just under 19 points a game So hes a big time offensive weapon Foul underneath 159 SMU in front Mustangs Look at the ACC in bowl games after both SMU and Wake Forest won their games last night Big 10 the only conference better Of course the ACC with Miami left The Big 10 as Oregon and Indiana left For the SEC one team left Interesting SEC with all the hype and all the talk about that league Yep 4 and N and two and seven when theyre not playing another SEC team So good You know just uh hoping Miami can finish the deal Well they had to run that Showing those highlights against the Buckeyes Yeah I know that hurt you It did My son is a student at Indiana so fired up for him Yes sir Washington hits one of two fullcourt pressure for the first time by North Carolina Stevenson doing a nice job on the front of that press and a timeout Great job by North Carolina Didnt look like SMU was ready for that Well without Boofy Miller on the floor there they they looked very unsure who was going to handle the ball against that pressure Next week CW Courtside Saturday back with another double header Boston College heads to Louisville to try and take down the Cardinals Cardinals lost last night out at Stanford Yep And then you and I will be in Charlottesville to see the Cardinal take on number 21 Virginia Our double header next week starts at noon Eastern 9 Pacific only on the CW How about Ryan ODM coming in in Virginia and you know the the unbelievable Hall of Fame run that Tony Bennett had and Ryan stepped right in and made his presence felt They lost that killer game to their rival Virginia Tech uh last weekend but Virginia bouncing back in a big way over NC State earlier today You were talking about SMU without Miller and he plays 35 36 minutes a game so theyre theyre not used to not having him out on the floor Well BJ Edwards is not a point guard but hes handling the basketball now Working on the much taller Stevenson and draws a foul DJ Edwards will head to the free throw line You know its funny and when they say combo guard I always say the guys a scorer who will pass if somebodys open but a combo guard is hes looking to score the ball first Some very good free throw shooting team Kickoff 26 with the NXT New Years Evil on the CW Superstars of NXT collide in a night built for action Thats Tuesday right here on the CW 72 free throw shooter is BJ Edwards and he missed the second one of the better free throw shooting teams in the country Yeah as a team a whopping 77 still out there One foul and Caleb Wilson has checked back into the game for North Carolina Shot clock at five Treble will pull up for the jumper and drain it You know we talked to Hubert Davis before the game and uh hes he says Seth Treble has worked his way back in seamlessly And you know what with his injury he was able to work out a lot through that healing process So it wasnt like a lower extremity injury where your conditioning goes Look out if this guy heats up Geron Pierre Jr Hes a reigning Conference USA player of the year from Jacksonville State He averaged 22 a game cheering Wilson in trouble Great feed on the cut to the basket by Jonathan Powell Great basket cut and good pass Good vision out of the double team inside Juns second try from three How about that big fella First two threepoint tries of the season in this game Well he I dont know if Andy Anfield had a few anxious moments while that one was in the air but oh my how sweet was that by William Wilson in the hang time Yeah and you just he really kind of shot that on the way down Just incredible athleticism Three at the other end Boy things heating up Thats Cory Washington 47 now SMU from behind the arc also doing well and points off turnovers early in this game cheering Treble big strong body came up short and then tipped it in Thats where hes at his best if he can get into the lane area and draws contact and finish through contact Very strong James in the lane Lost a handle with the jump hook from the freshman Jaden Tombs five off the bench and thats just a couple points below his average boy But you know what we talk about the maybe the lack of size for SMU if he can get going in in the ACC regular season Huge lift Well he was a huge recruit Fourth ranked recruiting class in the country Bessar cant finish and Edwards able to come out with a basketball 2719 Thats a you know thats a shot that you know when a guy is rolling and and seeing a big basket you dont mind if youre a coach Sigatou checks back in for SMU Bovots returns for the Tarheels Bogavots a guy who when Trimble went out really stepped in and and played very very well Has struggled over his last three or four games Yeah In fact hes had game totals of two points two points 15 and then shut out in the last game the win over Florida State Pal had to hurry a three with a shot clock down to four This zone by SMU has been very effective against North Carolina in the half court Sam Walters number four checks in A transfer from Michigan Edwards pulls up not there And out of bounds it belongs to North Carolina Quiet start for Caleb Wilson Hes been limited to four so far in this one It by getting the ball inside and then finding guys out on the perimeter spotting up Miller in the corner that time Good look there And Yukatulo is helping out by keeping that presence inside a little bit And uh you know looks like North Carolina has challenged SMU to take those shots and theyve stepped up screaming Yeah The combination of Wilson and Messar have combined for six points and so far seven rebounds And of course youre talking about a duo that accounts for 45 of North Carolina scoring and 48 of its rebounding Well and I think you know there are a lot of eyes on Wilson when he gets the ball and theres a lot of help defensively but for Vizar and Yugato its been pretty straight up inside I think that Vizar hes got an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive in this stretch of the game Boabots thats a big one for him He needed that from a confidence standpoint Only shooting 31 from three Hubert Davis continues to say were a good shooting team they just havent done it yet and hes convinced that as the season goes on guys like Ian Evans Bogabots those two in particular will shoot it better Well I would I have yet to meet a coach Tom that says Boy my my team is average to poor shooting We really struggle Yeah we laughter want to be that positive voice in their ear Yeah Whens the last time you heard we cant score We cant Were terrible Yeah Awful They got a mismatch somewhere And up with a shot clock not realizing where it was And Carolina back the other way trailing by six Wilson working on Waters Hang time Oh my from Caleb Wilson You know thats as much as you can do defensively against him and he just beats you with a better shot The fade away How about that at the other end by Miller Well you can tell time him on the floor is such a marked difference in SMU and how they execute I mean heres a look I mean Walters right now hes coming off a very tough ankle injury getting back into shape But I mean thats as good as you can do And then you get Yigato coming in for the help and he still hits the shot Three buckets for Wilson out of Atlanta Georgia Went 22 and 16 Oh and by the way he had six assists two blocks First Tarheel freshman ever to lead the team in all four categories in a game Thats effort Theyve had some pretty good freshman through the years in Chapel Hill One of the records they beat was by Phil Ford Yep Um number 23 wasnt bad as a freshman there either So theyve had a lot a lot of good ones but this guy right here is going to break all of the freshman records Good Lord willing He stays healthy And thats a travel second one of those Wilson saying he was fouled before the travel They gave him a clear out on the left hand side Look at here Tom and he just got he got hung up He picked up his dribble He tried to get him too much real estate that time That was another sound Theyre theyre playing him pretty well defensively Sixth turnover already for North Carolina And you see six points off the turnovers for the Mustang Miller pulls up got the screen and its off the mark Sixpoint game with 550 to go until halftime Carolina really big out on the floor on that front line now with Stevenson back in the game And he promptly must have heard you Jiren Stevenson drains a three And you know what And you challenge him I mean shooting 16 from three on the year So you know go ahead make a couple and then well well change up a little bit Hes been terrific And that was a guy that Hubert Davis told us before the game He said I am really really high on Jiren Stevenson We asked him Is there a guy you know not named Wilson who dunks it home and he leads a nation in doing that And a timeout by Andy Enfield cheering Carolinas drawing within one They were down nine just a moment ago A 102 North Carolina run with 518 to go until halftime And after the Wilson bucket its a onepoint game Like to remind you tomorrow CW womens basketball returns Cal goes to Raleigh to take on ACC Heavyweight NC State CW womens hoops tomorrow 2 Eastern 1 Central 11 Pacific Well this is an interesting lineup that North Carolina has Probably the biggest one that they can put out on the floor and uh you know Boavox is that was kind of an oops lob that play It looked like more he lost it than anything else But when you got Caleb Wilson on the other end of it hes going to clean up a lot Things evened up there Tom And I tell you what its been a clean fairly clean game Only four free throws combined shot in this first half So were at the closing in on the fiveminute mark until halftime Not a game we figured Up and down Chance of a highscoring game and its a onepoint game Pierre Jr working on Stevenson Nice defense on that play Tremble kicks it out Visar can shoot it from there Carolina with a lead Yeah thats his thing You have to identify him as a trailer He just walked right into that wide open three He is better than a 50 free threepoint shooter And yes hes a sevenfooter Trying to answer and able to do so is cheering Pierre That is a guy knowing where his teammate is spotting up I mean Miller made that one arm whip pass from about 35 ft away Dear Washington And theres the cheering rebound by Yigolu I tell you if youre a defender thats youre breathing a sigh of relief if you get him to settle for that jump shot So a timeout on the floor just under four minutes Tom we talked about it how it seems like hes music you know having an so so game and but they have played him well defensively and he has made some unbelievable shots against that and I think thats the best you can hope for against a player of that caliber is to make him work for his points There you see the season numbers Unbelievable And you know what you know for all that weve said but by the end of the by the end of the afternoon hes going to be closer above those numbers Yep Lori Washington to the free throw line Talk about SMU how good the Mustangs have been from the free throw line 77 is 18 yet just one for three at the stripe today This you know this is a team that in in this day and age they dont get a ton of production from the threepoint line but in this game five of 10 its its been very friendly for them By the way a moment ago that was the freshman rarely used freshman BJ Davis Ray who came off the bench to hit that three He wears number nine for the Mustangs is in the game right now And how about Stevenson and what hes done off the bench Well with Vizar with the two fouls he is his production has been so valuable in this first half Outstanding He leads the Tar Heels with nine and he averages six points per game How about that crossover by Pierre and he draws a foul in the paint But now all of a sudden Stevenson has just picked up his second foul And is Hubert Davis going to stay with him I think that Hubert thought that foul should have been called on Jaden Young rather than Stevenson Hes going to Zaden High is going to come off the bench Hes the last uh big body they have to resort to on the bench Niggaoo kicks it out to Washington Thats off the mark And North Carolina the rebound Tarheelss lead by one with under three to go Trimble just so savvy first two years as a backup Whistle away from the ball Not sure why Stevenson with those two fouls will lead Well Washington for SMU went over I dont know what happened if he had a a cramp or whatever on his leg but he immediately walked over to the bench Yeah Hes now down at that at the end of the bench medical folks taking a look at him Shot clock at three Wilson by himself has it rejected Shot clock at 13 for the Tarheels Sierra Jr nice job stepping in I tell you what Yugato thats not a position hes used to defending did a nice job of staying in front of Wilson in and out SMU with a chance to recapture the lead The Mustangs have led most of this half and they have the lead Uh thats an all or nothing play for Wilson Either you get the steal or the uh what you saw as the result cheering cheering Ogabox with a shot clock down to 11 Hes going to let it fly and not going to go But the offensive rebound to Trimble And right off the bench and right into the scoring column goes Zaden High the sophomore out of San Antonio Texas Stevenson and high the stars of the first half for North Carolina No kidding We have rarely called Besars name in this half He has five Pierre Jr and too strong Wilson rips away the rebound and he leads a break Three on three Treble bumped in the paint and Edwards with a rebound Four on four coming the other way and Edwards to the glass with a left hand and that is one thing that North Carolina had taken away from a stretch for a stretch They kept SMU out of the open floor but cheering his own guy was like a pulling guard setting a screen on that play on the run Down to 41 seconds cheering until halftime Shot clock at 11 Looking for Wilson And you can book it Its going up Nope Going to swing it to Tremble for three Bang for Treble A rare threepointer for the senior from Wisconsin Only his fifth of the year Of course hes only playing in his sixth game North Carolina by two A final try Miller thought about going to the basket Gets a screen now Will go TO THE BASKET HOW ABOUT BOFY Miller at the buzzer and we are in a 39 all the fair Great start by SNU Carolina comes back in and welcome to the first game of the ACC for the Mustangs Good stuff Stay tuned for our halftime show presented by Subaru love Its what makes Subaru Subaru have some of the highlights from this one Well recap our earlier game Clemson and Pit saddle up though Maybe catch your breath cuz this could be a great finish in Dallas Texas Satar heels and second halfar had five first half points to go along with four rebounds Wilson had eight and five boards But the big story was off the bench for North Carolina led by Jiren Stevensons nine the leading scoreer of the game for North Carolina and and thats what you frankly in course of 18 games youre going to need production like that guys to step up had some foul issues and he really filled in admirably going right to Yigolu tried to and that was deflected by Wilson and thatll be a reach in foul thatll go against Kayen Evans Uh the defense on the with Jigato its interesting They got Wilson playing him and then Basar coming in as a big double team Say Washington was in the active shooting there So hell go to the line where hes one of two 86 on the year And how about that He has missed two out of three An 86 free throw shooter on the season And uh you know but thats again a big key for North Carolina limiting the amount of you dont want you know SMU at the line 20 25 times during the course of the game Andy Enfield in his second season as SMUs head coach They had an excellent first year in the Atlantic Coast Conference Won 24 games while losing 11 Finished in a fourway tie for second got beat in the second round of the Atlanta Coast Conference tournament by Clemson Normally a bad decision by Basar that time and then he compounds it He picks up his third foul on the other end Tom heres the look I mean uh you know this youve got to be smart and youre not going to get this block Just let it go Oh I youre trying to atone for the mistake on the other end but you just compounded Well number three and no move to the bench At least not yet by Hubert Davis We are not even Washington has missed his third free throw in five attempts in the game Thats your fault I think you were the one who brought it up I did I jinxed a field goal kicker at the Snoop Pole so may as well get the free throw shooters too Crowd wanted a walk on both Bogabots and on Evans Shot clock down to one Having to fire up a three And how about that tremble Hes a leading scoreer for the Tarheels His second three He has 10 A really good defensive stand for about 29 12 seconds by SMU North Carolina has made some tough shots in tough situations Tied at 42 and breaking the tie on the long ball is Washington You just got to stay off the free throw line Its a tougher shot Well he was the one who went over to the bench and at the end of that first half I dont know if he had cramps It looks like hes gotten things solved physically Washington a transfer from Witchah State where he had nine double doubles a season ago averaged 14 a game And theres a takeaway for the Mustangs trying to add to a threepoint lead And thats a silly pass right there by Edwards Evans for three And were tied at 45 his first three of the game after hitting five against Florida State Hes a guy who doesnt get to the free throw line much but if he can step up in ACC play and be a reliable threepoint shooter its going to be a big way Its going to open up things inside Miller Little fade away Boy how sweet is his game There are some guys making some tough shots in this game Miller now has 11 cheering Yattoo whistled for the foul Look at that I mean you talk about defensively and then you know Wilson stays down doesnt go for the fake Its a hand up on the shot makes him take a tough fadeaway jump shot I mean thats everything you want to do when he makes play for now Bogabox will go to the free throw line where he is just hit on 52 young man cheering from Mont Denegro Played the last two years in whats called the Adriatic Basketball Association Hes made 12 starts average riding around 25 minutes per game Season three of CW sits series returns this month Hes a cop Shes a cop But together music unstoppable wild cards Monday January 26th 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW You know what I I think that Bogots is a guy that if he can get to the line like this and make free throws and get some sort of rhythm itll help his jump shot out cheering should tie it up Yep Hit them both This is where Trimble is is so valuable He can step up and guard Miller Pick him up full court Well they better find somebody to start shadowing Cory Washington Thats his third three of the game and and a you know a decent threepoint shooter at 36 coming in But uh change your game plan here a little bit defensively Treble Hes hit a couple of them in the game and Yugatu rips away the rebound off the side of the backboard Thats a forced three there by Miller Didnt have to And Carolina back the other way trailing by three Visar has just been out of sorts this afternoon Not playing like he has up to this point in the season Been a quiet day for BJ Edwards until now Thats his first three of the afternoon But the guy has five assists and three rebounds So doing it another way is Wilson draws a foul He realized he needed to get the basketball start in the ACC I think coach had some eggnog dumped on him last night in celebration Um but yeah I mean last year ACC championship game in football A matter of fact that was on the same day as their very first ACC basketball game against Virginia last year I remember a lot of people were they came to the game here was an early afternoon game and then got on planes and went to Charlotte to see that game cheering You know and talking to people here in this athletic they are so thrilled to be a part of the ACC Caleb Wilson his first two free throw attempts hits one of two Its a fivepoint lead for SMU Long way to go in this one 1540 Washington back in the game Lets see if he can pick up his production again in the second half Really nice pump Boy is he exciting to watch And the thing you know six foot probably being generous with him but the way he can get things off inside the pump fake that time got everybody flying Should be noted Thats Stevensons third Well I you know I think if youre Cuber Davis that youre willing to go with him for an extended period of time with the three minutes You want to try to save Var for as long as you can with his three But its just been its been tough for Vasar to get in any kind of rhythm today Hes been in and out of the game Hes had foul issues and hes looked out of sorts a little 13 points for Bloopy Miller and the lead swells to seven for SMU SMU is at their best when theyve got five guys in double figures Thatll be goalending against Tombs Give the bucket to Caleb Wilson You know what You dont mind that Um I mean just to you know just to say all right Im in here You know that that shot was probably going in anyway but Jaden Tombs he had some nice minutes in the first half as well Sure did Jims came off the bench had five made his first threepointer of the year Very highly recruited player For that one and Stevenson a rebound Pretty good job by Trimble who was giving away size and kept tombs out of the lane Well theyre giving the ball to Wilson Hell kick it out to Dixon for a threepoint try and off the back iron I thought Wilson gave it up a little quickly that time There were no double teams coming He had a little more time to operate Oh boy Ankles Ankles is right Then the dagger behind it Man hes fun to watch Brown lit up over there when he got Wilson going to his backside and then knocks it in Check this out Well and its been Caleb Wilson has been doing this to other people and its just I mean hes so quick He can he can stop and start as fast as anybody Ive seen young man out of Chicago two years at Central Michigan University then a season at Wake and now backto back years as a leading scoreer for SMU The head fake as hes checked back into the games Wilson is out Yeah this is going to be a very short rest period I think for Wilson maybe to get him under the 12minute media timeout You know that guy Germaine ONeal Juniors father 18 years in the NBA sixtime allstar big man but he was more of a he was a stretch four before they you know he was he made that transition and uh that position a thing Our distinguished director Lonnie Dale covered a lot of games with him in it Nice feed into tunes from Igatulo I I tell you the international bigs are pretty good Really good passers especially out of the double team cheering With a three Yeah maybe that gets him settled in He hit a three in the first half Need him to catch fire Hes got eight points And then at the other end Edwards misses And Stevenson another rebound Stevenson having an excellent game And that guy is a leader There might be other guys that score more but he is the undisputed leader of this North Carolina team cheering Well and the thing you know maybe with Hubert Davids is finding for Stevenson now to get a threeman rotation with Wilson and Basar and and him cuz hes giving Wilson a little bit of a blow right now Story right now for SMU is Boopy Miller cheering Hes got 19 to lead all scorers on just 10 shots I mean its been so very efficient in this game Slick pass and going to the free throw line Stevenson digs it on the feed Thats a lost start That bounce pass isnt it Heres the look And just late getting out getting over that screen He you know hes just seeing a big basket right now He doesnt need a lot of space to get his shot off Just a huge get for Andy Enfield last year when they got him in the portal from Wake Forest Andys Andy and has ACC roots Um was on Leonard Hamilton staff at Florida State for a while Then Florida GF Coast and the world changed for Andy Enfield Yes it did in 2011 when he took Florida GF Coast to the Sweet 16 Left to go to the University of Southern California seven times 20 win seasons five trips to the tournament but then decided to leave there to come here when they joined the Atlantic Coast Conference a year ago Trying to get Msar number four Yiglu just muscled his way in And thats an offensive foul Yep And thats a good call too And I actually he dribbled himself into that foul He had it he had something right here You see that that left arm you know they right there that hook and that clear out It you throw that thing three times the referees going to be forced to blow the whistle And theyre going to go to the bench SMU It will be Sam Walters to replace Gigatu whos talking that whistle over with one of the officials If that was in the European Cup and those two playing that probably wouldnt have been called but a little tighter officiating here in the NCAA cheering All right Carolina down by six Closest theyve been in a while Edwards getting after it fighting there with Dixon And the possession arrow will give the ball to North Carolina And theyre asking to get the floor wiped down here Well you still got Wilson sitting over there What are you thinking offensively here Yeah I mean its its a its kind of a mixed m you know bag out there offensively and he slipped right where they were wiping it up but uh Stevenson may be a guy you get some touches with Dixon into the paint the lob for Visar Hes able to corral it in traffic and hell go to the free throw line I think they got Walters on the foul I think So a timeout on the floor 1152 to go This one getting tight Theyve done a nice job defensively on him And the thing for SMU North Carolinas kept them out of the open court but theyve been much better in the half court execution Visar first trip to the free throw line Hell shoot two Arizona transfer Its amazing We were asking Hubert Davis did you expect this And he said Yeah I did He said Uh and youd never know that based on the numbers at Arizona He said But I Ive been very impressed with his leadership Got a boat Well and you know I saw the skill set that he had He knew that he was a good fit here And uh and I tell you playing alongside a guy like Caleb Wilson really helps your game out a lot Youre talking about a guy averaging almost a double double He averaged eight points and four rebounds over 66 games at Arizona Walters can shoot it but thats his first try today And off the mark at the other end short That might have been a little bit of a quick jump shot by Jonathan Powell BJ Edwards defended Now a switch Thats a really nice little stutter step there by Edwards Well its more open with Igato out of the game There are more driving lanes and just a night he got his he got his defender to stand up straight TRIMBLE GOT IT TO GO off the glass Walters a foul and the senior will head to the free throw line Heres the look on the other end First a little stop and go And thats again a tough cover for Stevenson And then we talked about Trimble and how he likes to get in and draw contact and play inside Terrific finish with that injured left arm But I tell you what you know its plays like that that get you over the hurdle mentally from an injury that you so youre like All right I can just react now I can stop thinking about this thing It was a broken forearm for Tremble Occurred during practice back in November He came back against Ohio State in a thriller music They won by one point He had 17 points And since then hes been in double figures every single game Its his 108th game as a North Carolina Tarheel Rare indeed in this day and age Little fadeaway Are you kidding me I mean are you kidding me Is Why is anybody other than number two shooting for SMU right now All right Wilson back down there Theyll need him down the stretch They need this guy too Short by Var Had a good look at it too cheering That is such a slick backto back trips Well two out of three trips by Edwards No he really uses his body well Doesnt didnt have to elevate much on those last two shots but cheering able to get himself some room to score Under 10 to go and SMU with an eightpoint lead cheering cheering Shot clock at three BOGAVOTS BANG answers the bell Wow Shot clock on their back That possession looked like it was going nowhere Big confidence builder for him Second three of the game Bogots has eight He was shut out 0 for five from the field in the win against Florida State Lets see what how North Carolina does defensively with this big lineup this big front line in there Forced three right there by Geron Pierre but he hustles back at the other end The thing about it I mean youve got lengths for North Carolina but Stevenson and Wilson both can guard out on the perimeter You know theyve got some length and theyve got size but they can stay with guys Its interesting that with the size advantage SMU has the most points in the paint in this game so far today But the story so far has been the senior from Shy Town Boopy lighting it up in every way Well I you know Im going to say one thing Im going to hold judgment on numbers until halfway through the league season when teams are playing each other You know you got to take into account unbalanced schedules and you know whos whos playing who in the nonconference That being said SMU has a lot of offensive firepower no doubt Oh boy How about the block there And a foul is called on the play Or is it No its just going to be its just going to be out of bounds I got you Theres the actually it works out to North Carolinas advantage SMU had with the jump ball SMU had the arrow Steven is has gone cold after an outstanding first half offensively for North Carolina but theyll be leaning on Wilson and Vasar That was a hold right there by Vasar on the jersey of Yigulu and got away with it Tremble goes coast to coast Hes bumped by Miller and will go to the free throw line Boy Vasar grabbed a hold of Yigatlos jersey and nobody saw it Yeah And well its its a lot tougher to referee inside Bodies inside for the referees You dont see you dont get a lot of clean looks Yeah But theres uh thatd be a pass interference in football most of the time But that being said those are shots IOs had some good looks at the basket that he hasnt knocked down in this game cheering Okay heres been the money man in his second half for North Carolina Has been troubled Hes got 14 points seven in the first half and another seven through the first 11 minutes of the second stanza Well and the other good thing North Carolina has another team foul for SMU Its Carolinas in the double bonus going forward They only have three team fouls So again you know decent job of defending without fouling Fourpoint game See neither team has been particularly good in the strike Edwards forced that and then a save underneath the basket Well done here by Pierre BOOPY THE ALLEYOOP cheering cheering Pierre not a junior on that play We could be looking at a double double for Boopy Miller points assists in this game Offensive foul against Wilson and he knew it cheering This is like they used to flip him up there The Gman of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance Progressive offers 247 protection when you bundle auto home and motorcycles Learn more at progressivecom And Boopy Miller Tom has been incredible shooting threes getting into the rim stealing the ball getting out into the open floor and oh yes hes got eight assists That one in the last lob play Having said all that were under eight North Carolina very much within striking distance and theyve actually and and North Carolina has done a good job coming out of timeouts and uh carving into the lead a little bit Carolina with four players on the floor in double figures and another just a bucket away Wilson has 11 threepoint try Thats been the story of this game so far Thats 11 threepointers for SMU Yeah And Cory Washington has been money in that game Nine shots 18 points Thats about as I mean their efficiency rating offensively is incredible And theres a travel cheering picked up his dribble and had no one to get it to surrounded by Yiglu The only saving grace about that is its a dead ball turnover and it doesnt hurt you in transition You can get back and set yourself defensively But that being said we talked about SMU being better in the half court in this second half And you just wonder as Mike brought up a little while ago is Miller oh my good This has just been a clinic in every way conceivable shot made possible by Boofy Miller 283 the Mustangs going back to last year if they put up 75 or more And then at the other end a big answer by who else Seth Treble Hes having a game As you said I mean that that is not the strongest part of his game but uh here this afternoon seeing a big basket from three They tremble almost singlehandedly is keeping him in it Every time they need a big basket he gets it Pierre steps back short and right into the hands of Washington and hell go to the free throw line I Ill tell you what Tom I mean SMU has done as good a job on Caleb Wilson as Ive seen a team do this year He has been really quiet in the second half Lar has just picked up his fourth foul and hes been quiet too Yeah I mean youre talking about 45 of North Carolina scoring 407 of their field goals made and 48 of their rebound Well its been its been the bench that has really stepped up for North Carolina under these circumstances Olio Washington transferred from Witchah State second team all AAC player a year ago and he hits them both music Hes got 20 Millers got 23 cheering And now its a 10point lead with 605 left North Carolina work to do but plenty of time Wilson nearly gave it away Got it to Stevenson on a bounce pass and off the glass And actually his inability to handle that first pass helped him The fumble he was able to get to the other side of the rim and convert cheering They got a mismatch now as Miller goes into the lane kicks it into the corner for BJ Edwards Thats 12 of 24 from threepoint land for the Mustangs That covers a lot of sins And uh cheering and theyve been great finds too A lot of them been out of you know drives into the paint area and then kick outs cheering applause Seth forcing that one and an 11point lead with 505 to go SMU hanging in there on the boards with North Carolina as well applause Miller puffed as he tried to take it to the basket but still not will he say its a shooting foul It is So Miller headed to the strike where hes two of two and is a 92 free throw shooter Miller last season led SMU in scoring assist and steals Hes doing the same again this season but even better in every category Yeah it was interesting Yeah Basars coming into the game I saw him get up then go back to the bench and uh Hubert Dave was going to take a little bit of a gamble with him got a vote you know right for this possession anyway Maybe try to get uh cheering you know going down the other end Yigulo Yugato a touch cheering that just a giveaway foul and thatll be the 10th So now it will be the double bonus the rest of the way for North Carolina And look with 450 left to play that can get you some points and get you closer in a hurry Well and and more importantly slowing the game down making it a little bit more ugly Treble one of two at the line 78 on the year cheering It really it really shows the work that hes put in during this time when he was injured I remember going to games up there and seeing him in the you know before anybody else got to the gym going through workouts cheering Hes just a really good player who as you mentioned through his four seasons at North Carolina backup valuable sixman his sophomore year a starter last year on a guard dominated team Washington again and again Nothing but the bottom of the net Thats five threepointers for Cory Washington His worst shooting has come from the free throw line Thats the only place hes been a liability An outstanding cheering Rebel will go to the free throw line And Washington cant believe hes whistled for a foul but he is Yeah Washington is five of seven He has two misses from three He is four of seven from the line But thats his fourth personal foul as well So you know that thats going to be a a number we need to look at as well going down the stretch And its going to be who whos going to pick up the fifth foul first Boy Treble now has missed three of five from the line Carolina needing these points with a clock stopped trailing by 15 Well 10 of 16 now from the free throw line on the road Its a lot of points to leave out on the floor SMU 86 North Carolina 72 Fullcourt pressure by the Heels and Miller blows right through that Its a a oneman press breaker Now uh SMU will be shooting oneon ones Now the freshman James will check back in Sure Theyre going to start doing some Yep Offense for defense Yep Get Washington out of there and hes headed for the bench Hell be right back in But interesting you know you take a threepoint shooter out and you bring in Tombs a big body to play on the defensive end of the floor Thats about the only thing thats gone wrong for Miller today I mean the ball came over to Jinsky when he threw it out of bounds and much like his Duke case he never gave it back to anybody for the stay And it been the play all right Its been the threepoint play of SMU and 14 of 20 or Im sorry 13 of 25 on the game Just outstanding Its been a variety of guys who have stepped up Theyve had four or five different guys knock down threes Mr Washington primary among them 34 not bad on the year but 52s going to win a lot of games Yeah And overall in the game SMU is shooting 58 North Carolina had held opponents on the year to 36 shooting and bass Thats good ball movement right there You get to the freshman again against the press Ball didnt hit the floor very much and uh this has just been an impressive still a bunch of time to go but it impressive showing for SMU cheering Down to 310 left and SMU enjoying a 14point lead and the crowd finally appreciating what their team is doing Theyve been a little quiet this afternoon but a lot of North Carolina fans here Yeah in the state of Texas they dont get to see their Tarheels much And of course the students are out of school as they are in virtually every school Many universities across the country come back day after tomorrow returning from Christmas break And normally and plus you had SMU play a bowl game last night so that was you know taking attention away And normally for a road team its a good opportunity to play a team when their students are on break so you dont have to face that part of the crowd All right we got a timeout on the floor 253 to go A lot of the families and friends of some of the players is challenging the out of bounds ruling on the floor of uh Wests ball All right so we have our first challenge of the game For those of you wondering about that basically it works the same Challenge is a word more familiar used in football where on a play like this Uh on a play where a balls knocked out of bounds could be a goalend could be a charge inside the lane youre allowed to basically appeal the call So this was a call on the floor Last touch by North Carolina Thats a ruling on the floor Carolina challenging that You have to have a timeout to do it And thats going to be upheld It looked like Trimble was the last one to get a finger on that right there Its a little tough That music first angle was a better look at it So you you have to have a timeout and basically if you win the appeal or win the challenge was unsuccessful Seven was the last one touch the ball Yep So now you lose a timeout and you lose the ability to challenge again If you win your challenge you keep the timeout and you keep your ability to challenge again later in the game Well and and I think the end result of that is that games have been a lot quicker You you dont see teams theyre not using that in the first half You know youre going to sit on it and wait for now That means North Carolina has one timeout remaining over the final 253 This is a veteran Mustangs team Theyve got leadership that returns from last year and guys like Edwards and Miller and Yigolu as there is Boofy Miller yet again Well and you hit that Thats an important point Uh you talk to coaches and if they can keep the core of their team together from year to year thats a huge bonus And those three that you listed were the art of this ball club from last year So you fill in around them cheering And theres a three by Stevenson 13point game How about Caleb Wilson 11 points three in the second half He has been very very quiet You know and and sort of to expound on what you were just saying a minute ago And look nobody knows for sure what Caleb Wilson is going to do at the end of the year You can talk about the one and done and go on and on I say let him enjoy his freshman year and worry about but just the point to back up what youre saying is you know if the SAR and Wilson are the two best players on this Carolina team and then you have the senior in Treble there is a chance chance that you know if youre Huber Davis youre looking ahead next year and you might not have many of the three you know youre not going to have Treble well and but to that point neither of those two bigs were here last year you know so to so to incorporate them right out of the shoot Yeah I mean its tough cheering in this day and age with the transfer portal and guys who come in and cheering the freshman that weve seen around the nation especially here in the ACC fouled on the arm Good call Yugato got it Well and and the thing too that you really have to change the way you judge coaches and the job they do I mean its not like you can build a program and keep the wheel turning all the time So they you know the athletic director and those people have to look at it a little bit differently as well Just saw 90 plus points Ho hoham That is nothing new Averaging 91 a game 15th best in the a NCAA second best in the ACC They may theyre theyre legitimately going to look at a hundred in this game which SMU has already done incidentally four times this season Yeah But against the number 12 team in the country Weve seen some of the great comebacks in basketball college basketball history delivered by North Carolina teams through the years one of the few turnovers theyve gotten off that press and Wilson gets in the scoring column Theres just been nothing on the back end of it though once as SMU is able to get past the front court Trimble hangs in the air was looking for a foul Claims he was hacked on the arm there And now cheering with 115 to go the celebration begins in Dallas Texas Pretty good night afternoon for this athletic program cheering and applause Well look in the short tenure of Andy Enfield this is without a doubt as tombs going to fire up the three and knock it down to get him to 97 This is the biggest win Enfield has had so far Oh no question No question Just a really good game plan against the big guys up front We were concerned about maybe a lack of depth there for SMU but uh Basar Wilson have been neutralized And you know you look at some of the other players in this game You know we talked so much about Miller and hes been incredible Fact is a top 38 player nationally He played high school just down the road with Germaine ONeal Jr Well and the thing you like about him his size Hes you know 240 Hes got a Hes got a an older body uh not not a a thin freshman coming in music Well North Carolina did not lose a single game in the month of December Their only loss was at the end of November just after Thanksgiving against Michigan State And SMU had to ramp it up They played like every they played way played a football schedule They played once a week for the whole month of December Well this is a terrific momentum builder Well this is a team that had its chances in a lot of big games last year Had a good team They won 24 games Got to the NIT and Miller lost time track of time or couldnt get a shot off once Wilson picked him up But you know look uh they got to the second round of the NIT got beat here at home against Oklahoma State thought for a while they had a shot at the NCAA and now this game it doesnt put them in a tournament by any mean We got a lot of basketball to go but its a nice first step Well and uh but it looks awfully good sitting there on the resume as far as January is concerned Its been a long time and frankly they were 19 and five last year where Poopy Miller gets hurt and thats where the things thats where they slid some and never really regained NCA tournament cons consideration But this signature win for Indie Enfield cheering And take a look at that You got to go back to 2022 the last time the SMU Mustangs beat an AP ranked team And North Carolina came into this game ranked number 12 in the country So SMU goes to 12 and2 North Carolina 132 SMU 10 in the ACC North Carolina 1 and one in the Atlanta Coast Toppers Yeah And really u a a great game plan and a defensive job against one of the best players in the country and Cale Caleb Wilson really kept him down and and frankly the the points that he did score Tom were very very tough Yeah he came in averaging 20 points and 11 rebounds He had 13 points and seven rebounds Loopy Miller going to join us on the other side of this timeout SMU a big win today
