mate in Moila by Donles has to stay out of foul trouble tonight And we are underway in Atlanta Syracuse starts with the basketball The Orange this is their first true road game all the way on January 6th Syracuse the last team in all of Division 1 basketball to play their last road game And they get it started with an alleyoop to William Kyle What we see right there is a difference with a guy like Mohamed Cel out there He has elite rim protection Marshi does not provide that above the rim And we know William Kai is an elite athlete and he can go up and touch the top of the square as he did on that one Thats what we just told you about True road game Now they were tested in Vegas with three neutral sight games and then played Drexel in Philadelphia which should be a road game but was technically a neutral sight Take a look at the Yellow Jacket starting lineup You mentioned it Randolph without the star freshman Moila Thats a big loss in the front court Payton Marshall getting the start instead Marshall has it here Working against William Kyle 4 seconds to shoot Marshall with the muscle and that rims in Syracuse running the floor and they turn it over where they tried to hurry it up to William Kyle in transition and going a little too quickly there Again great patience by Marshall You can see the Orange are going to go oneonone in the post First play of the game He didnt expect Marshall to get the ball inside and showing you the game plan for the Yellow Jackets Syracuse was off over the weekend Georgia Tech beat Boston College as Boy Reeves goes back into three Heres JJ Starling Leaves it off for Freeman Donnie Freeman misfires J I expect the guards to benefit the most from Donnie Freeman being back I mean Lamar Washington before he took the three Offensive foul and thats a turnover Lamar Washington has got to take that St George goes under the ball screen Marshalls just trying to roll Washington in many ways was brought in to be the Nate George replacement George a twoyear cheering starter at Georgia Tech Led the ACC in assists a year ago and then departed the Yellow Jackets for Syracuse You know he started hearing about Nate George and what he did here for the Yellow Jackets Nate Kings launches a three off the mark Syracuse still looking for their offensive rhythm on the road early Trying to squeeze it to Dongo Pinballs around Marshall ends up with it and hammers it home for two Starling quick three in transition Syracuse definitely trying to get the offense going in transition before Georgia Tech can get set Johno cleans up the spill for two Jay both teams struggle running so theyre trying to beat a set defense and try to get as many points in transition as they possibly can Syracuse quick on the offensive end of the floor taking shots And here on the other end of the floor Syracuse just a step slow Payton Marshall off to a really strong start of his activity and by dongle Thats what he does The lead athlete that can get up and down the floor and clean up the glass I think you expect to see both teams mixing some zone as well with the struggles from threepoint line GEORGE CONNECTS ON a three Georgia Tech fans know how dangerous the former Yellow Jacket can be Good to see that first three ball go in These are a couple of streaky teams from behind the threepoint line and really good front line scoring Which guard can step up and start knocking down threes Georgia Tech goes back inside with Payton Marshall Hes got four of the Jacket six early Passes out of the double team Finds Dongo 3 seconds to shoot Lamar Washington got it off in time but didnt hit it screaming Donnie Freeman open for three Nothing but the bottom of the net for Donnie Freeman Jay one of the things to watch is when Donnie Freeman rebounds he pushes it in transition He had that ability and sometimes Georgia Tech gets caught in cross matchups You saw that happen on that previous possession wide open in attack mode Left it off for Dongo who ties it at eight Thats going to be an outstanding match up to watch all by George against Lamar Washington Freeman going inside this time He can beat you everywhere but misses there Yeah I think I think he needs to turn and face up Hes giving up a few pounds with Bongo I think turn face him in the post Be a post driver Dongo oneonone with Freeman Good defense by Donnie Freeman to poke it free George finds Freeman in the corner Kings lines up the three and hits it Nate Kings puts the Cuse up three Syracuses desperate need of Nate King to get going shot 44 from three last year Committed a slow start here Great look getting the first three to go down music Timeout Georgia Tech Syracuse on a 92 run and the Orange up three early Georgia Tech get things going here The penetration and the movement music by Dog of finding space in the rim Nate King knocking down a three ball Sykes was so eyes for the orange Shes got a great music start here tonight music Now Moila where its hurt him Jay is that they their defenses ahead of their offenses right now Both teams are really outstanding defenses holding opponents to 38 39 respectively The problem is with the players in and out of the lineup They dont have an offensive identity and its a tough find that in conference play And both feel like this is a game they should win and have to have in early January and yet only one will Both teams want to play meaningful games in March To do that you have to win games like this in January Dongo nice spin move by Dongo Put Syracuse through the spin cycle for two I think for Georgia Tech thats a great sign And if theyre going to allow Bongo to play oneonone again we talked about him being a preseason second team performer He has the ability to be the best player on the floor And if Georgia Tech wants to win this game I think he has to be the best player Nate Kings turn around misses it One thing you want to see if youre watching the Orange is when guys penetrate are they penetrating to score Are they penetrating to create for another another teammate Ball will stay with the Yellow Jackets 16 seconds to shoot All 10 points for Georgia Tech tonight Have come in the paint Number 12 Archer said he wanted to go to his bench early as Anthony comes into the game and feels he has that advantage They have a deeper bench and he wants to use it early Yeah He told us pregame he feels they have real depth as Reeds miss this is a logo three but its finding what are the best five when you have all that depth available to you foul on the drive Tyler Betsy drew it thats the strength of Syracuse team you look at all five players on the floor now theyre playing with Donnie Freeman at the five all five guys can attack you off the dribble So what it does to you spacing wise you got to help and you got to rotate but more importantly you got to guard the basketball and keep it out of the paint Syracuse started the game 0 for three from three but theyve made their last three triples Freeman has one of them This time into the paint The righty floater doesnt fall Jon cheering Maf couldnt break free had to give the ball up This is what pressure does to you A lot of dribbling not a lot of passing Alive in the sevenfooter throws it down Cole Kiraak Kurowak great job on the screen and roll Damon startmire told us we talked about not having Mo Cely He said Hey Kurowak will be a guy he loves He said his ability to play on the perimeter dribble handoffs passing ability at the threepoint line is something that he welcomes to this lineup Nate George passes it off for Freeman And now Nate Kings going to the corner and Anthony a three and his foot was on the line before he attempted the triple Thats a turnover Chaz Kellys been giving the Yellow Jackets some really good minutes coming off the bench and last three games he hasnt missed from behind the threepoint line here Great job turning a corner freezing Donnie Freeman and throwing a lob to Curac Youre nervous coming into a game that Shakes like getting the alley dunk start Theyve gotten good production from the bench at the big man spot with Cila unavailable due to that ankle sprain Payton Marshall at Kurowak have been terrific Missed the fade away Syracuse has been looking to run in transition Off Georgia Tech misses this time forced to slow it down cheering Sadique White into the game coming off the bench for the first time hands it off for Kenne Anthony who buries it from three Great patience there I thought thats the difference between the turnover in that shot That time Ken Anthony just caught it Not thinking about anything Let it go Was ready to shoot on that baseline three Not quite ready yet Stepped out of bounds Donnie Freeman showing his defensibility Ripped it away Anthony has it coaching staff FREEMAN IN ATTACK MODE Hammers it home Donnie Freeman on a rack attack Donnie Freeman comes down asking for a sub He hadnt been out yet His ability to attack off the bounce at that center spot Huge advantage for the Orange Syracuse on the road Theyve strung together defensive stops which has helped their offense and theyve got a fourpoint lead in the first half You see the importance of having that Donnie Freeman on the floor helps with the spacing but that time no hesitation Kenne Anthony Anthony laces up the three ball And heres Donnie Freeman showing you why the Orange were missing their number one option Expected uniforms music battled it out Carmelo Anthony against Chris Bosch in the dome It was rocking that night Melo went for 24 and 11 Got the win Chris Bosch though he got a sweet dunk Put it on a poster that lefty signature onehanded jam The leading scorer though was music Jerry McNamera laughter Love that throwback And now Carmemelllo obviously his son highly touted freshman Cayenne Anthony knocked down a three earlier in this half How have you assessed Cayenne Anthony as he transition to college basketball playing for his fathers alma mater Uh I I think its one of those you always put pressure on yourself living up to your dad and particularly for him does a great job of doing that Hes learning how to turn his motor on and play hard at all times Once he does that when his natural ability comes out I think you got a heck of a player in your hands You went through that You were coaching your son Brandon at Wake Forest where your numbers hanging in the rafters You know what thats like It is And you just tell him you asked me earlier about did you add more pressure coming to your dads group Hes Carmelos son No matter where he goes I think he made the right choice has it here Finds JJ Stling 8 seconds to shoot Starling good feed but a great recovery to knock it away from Sadique White Do both of these teams hang their hat on the defensive side of the ball as Fleming flies to the rim and is fouled The points are going to be at a premium because they bring the defensive effort consistently both sides And you got to see that that foul is with Kayen Anthony Hes got to put his body in front and take the charge there He gets there in plenty of time but hes a little late rotating over and he wy reads is not late on that rotation in the ear Hes there Got to stick your body in front taking charge Something hell be hell hell be shown in the film room Jai Fleming steps to the line Another very talented freshman on the court tonight from Marietta Georgia I think a star model really likes this freshman like he has a chance to take a jump knowing his freshman year they expect his numbers to improve throughout conference play Well the last time that David Statomire had a freshman that he felt really good about and handed the keys to the offense to it was Nate George and he proved him right Yeah hes unafraid of that It gives your guys confidence when the coach just hands you the ball and let you go Started two years for the Yellow Jackets before transferring to Syracuse Anthony missed the layup Reeves rips it away Jaden Mustaf right down the lane Rejected at the rim Nate King said no Starling looking to go coast to coast Hes fouled Both teams know theyre playing against elite defenses are really trying to push tempo and attack the rim They dont want to face a set defense here And Jaden Mustaf does a great job getting to the rim And Nate King says No get that out of here Just great timing on the block not allowing us to use the rim for protection Syracuse no stranger to a block They lead the ACC second in the nation with seven blocks per game Saturday weve got a terrific slate for you Wake Forest with North Carolina and then the premiere of the 1993 National Championship winning North Carolina team Never seen footage interviews players coaches You dont want to miss it Saturday after a terrific slate of basketball which finishes with weight at UNC right here on ACC Network Pull up Pop Washington drills William Kai got to do a better job of calling out that screen He got Nick King nailed on that screen from Bobby Dong And both guys went with the roller Lamar Washington made him pay Sadique White hes adjusting to a new role You know he started the last nine games with Freeman out of the lineup and now coming off the bench today As happy as Syracuse is to have Donnie Freeman back and hes a difference maker his return is huge Everybody does have to adjust to a new role with him in the lineup Everyones going to have to sacrifice on the offensive end of the floor because I think Donnie Freeman becomes a focal point but itll benefit the guards from a scoring perspective because it frees those guys up and allows them to attack mid matches But Sidi White for him his minutes may be limited so hes got to JJ Stling OH LIFTOFF IN ATLANTA Threw it down onehanded Washington from the same spot this time Missed it Stland gets it up the court in a hurry Syracuse they have been attacking in transition that time Cant convert with Anthony Take another look at this JJ Stling rim rocker I mean look at the reject there And Lamar Washington made a business decision Talk about not sacrificing your body He tried to jump out of the photo Well Starling coming off that disappointing fourpoint performance against Clemson last time out Offensive rebound and a foul called Thats another former Yeller Jacket Suare the red shirt sophomore coming back to Atlanta And Jay thats his strength and what he provides to this team Rim protection one of the better shot blockers on the Orange but he is going to the offensive glass every time Suare not facing the same amount of hostility that Nate George has in his return to Atlanta as a logo three Misfires but it falls to Kayen Anthony backs it out Anthony right DOWN THE LANE COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL Cayenne Anthony You need him in attack mode Dont think about it I thought he should have shot the three on the offensive rebound continue to attack Hes a natural scorer The physicality in this game will come as he physically matures Nothing to think about when you get the opportunity Continue to attack Kayen Anthony with a chance here for an one The one surprises on this team as we going to talk about is the struggling from the free throw line And I wasnt going to mention it I am cuz Kayen Anthony you got to say too 59 from the free throw line for him is he knocks down the first is knows he has to be better than that Its just a confidence thing with a lot of these guys Well to say foul shooting has been problematic for the Orange this season has been an understatement Second worst in all of college basketball under 61 Anthony makes that one to complete the threepoint play They are three for three here tonight Dongo through traffic and rims out no good Offensive rebound a foul called and that looked like all ball It looked like it was a clean shot for us but Christian said there was a lot of contact low and theres a lot of length and size on the wings with this group and foul suare coming in low Yeah Sadique White did get all ball but the foul was against Suare And it sends Jaden Mustaf to the line the sophomore He misses And Jay we talked about Syracuse not being a great free throw shooting team The Yellow Jackets shoot 69 themselves So as this game get tight when we get down the stretch free throw shooting will be critical And we mentioned how both these teams are really talented defensively Well if points are at a premium if you can get them at the foul line thatll go a long way Right now the perimeter players from the Orange are sharing the basketball Theyre moving it Its not sticking If they CONTINUE THAT LOOK OUT BIG TIME JAM Sadique White Its his turn to rock the rim Theres been some great dunks in this first half The problem is these guards get downhill You got to help them rotate Theyre doing a great job of holding the big on the screen and roll Weak side for the Yellow Jackets got to come over and tag And thats where Georgia Techs missing their starting center the freshman Moa cheering Theyve been hurt at the rim on both sides of the ball Thats what you want to do Just get off of here Just keep the ball moving You dont want to have to attack every time with the ball screen Shot clock down to 10 Heres Ken Anthony Been a good first half for him Finds Starling Step back three missed him Now Georgia Tech pushing in transition and a Sadique White flying in to reject that You said it earlier Randolph Neither one of these teams want to play in a half court set Defensive dominating so far this season at Syracuse A sixpoint lead Its always a block party win Orange is in town He averaged seven a game They already here with four and its leading to some miscross matchups for the Yellow Jackets Their inability to stay in front of the basketball are giving up layups and lobs right now Strong first half so far for the Orange Yeah the Syracuse front court is terrorizing Georgia Tech And for good reason The Yellow Jackets do not have Moila available Hes missing his second straight game with an ankle sprain Theres Cila Hes been terrific in his freshman season And you know we we talked about it It is going to be difficult for Georgia Tech to navigate it because its not like they have a very deep and experienced front court to turn to The good thing about Syracuse it allows Georgia Tech to play small So theyre going to be able to play with Vongo at the five which theyre doing right now And that can free him up and put guards around him to allow him to play in space Syracuse a fourpoint lead under seven minutes left in this first half Nate Kings right to the rim for two Jay as I said we talked about Donnie Freeman is so much in the open Its really going to benefit the guards having him back Its going to allow all of these guys space and so far tonight all the guards are having their moments here in the first half Good pass from Washington to find Don Go I think when youre defending Lamar Washington in ball screens you got to make him a scorer Hes getting it at me and the fine guys Really got to make him look to put the ball to the basket Suare commits the foul So itll be Georgia Tech ball underneath their own hoop Dongo checks out He wont be on the bench for long He wont be This puts a lot of pressure on Reeve to get going Hes got to be the guy with this particular lineup on the court Reeves been quiet in this first half Georgia Techs leading scorer Washington misfires from three trying to cut the lead in half but its Syracuse ball But the Orange went up by Dongo out the lineup Lets see if the Orange can apply a lot of pressure to the paint Anthony step back three Got it Kai Anthony delivers Syracuse their largest lead of the night Stay in attack mode Kay and Anthony had Anthony stay in attack mode Miss layup there from the freshman sevenfooter Kiraak This is what I mean Jay when with the Donnie Freeman as I shout him out for being able to push the tempo he turns it over But they had Georgia Tech in a cross match up there but they were able to take care of the basketball Washington right into traffic That is a jump ball And the possession arrow stays with Georgia Tech Kayen Anthony there uses the ball screen plays with a level of physicality bumps Washington gets it to the step back after here This is an active hands and active feet You got to know when you drive the paint against the orange theyre coming to block shots You got to drive the pass to get a yellow jacket But Georgia Tech has had a clear game plan to go inside against the Orange They have yet to connect on a three Theyve only shot four of them in this first half I think both teams could benefit from that Drive the pass Great look from three And thats the first one of the night as we were just talking about it And it belongs to Jane and Mustaf Jaden Mustafs not known for his great threepoint shooter but when you take the right looks you tend to knock him down This three from Tyler Betsy hesitated before he finally pulled the trigger Had a foul on the floor Betsy had to commit it against Reeves who had a step on him Although that was really good defense on the other end by the Yellow Jackets there Help on the drive Put it they put doubt in the minds of the perimeter players of Syracuse How to pass it when to pass it You see Kani steps off Hes had himself a really good first half here And a foul called for a loose ball Syracuse is saying it should be an intentional foul because they would have had a breakaway layup I think its the right call here Its clear layup Kiraak doesnt grow Throw the flag Thats passing laughter Kiraak had no choice but to hold William Kyle there That sends Syracuse into the bonus So William Kyle is shooting and he has been struggling from the foul line really throughout his career 49 from the free throw line this season We mentioned the team struggles at under 61 Jay you just got to hope he makes one Thats really the way you look at it when he gets to the free throw line The common foul is under review for a potential flagrant one foul So the common foul you just heard will be looked at to see if theyll upgrade it here with five minutes left of the first half Syracuse a sixpoint lead If he lets him go thats minimum a twoonone fast break to William Carol and Donnie Freeman I think its a dunk and he knows it Well the way Syracuse has been dunking in this first half more than likely it would have been Yeah there was numbers there Be interesting to see how the officials see this Its wasnt quite in front of him yet He held him early Its just a matter of when they the common foul is confirmed and the officials say theres not enough there to upgrade it So itll stay a common foul You know for as good a defensive team as the Orange have been this season you know holding opponents under an average of 65 points per game best since the 2017 2018 season The offense has lagged behind the defense Its interesting Randolph tonight Its felt like theyve used the defense to ignite the offense in that transition game Well what its done is again now you got another guy back right And its a important guy Its your lead score We talked about him in the opening Donnie Freeman And what he does is it allows now youre able to switch Youre able to do things before Theres not a lot of perimeter shooting on that front line He spaces it a little bit and the guards benefit the most from that Opens up the paint for these guys and allow them to get downhill and attack Youve seen Donnie Freeman play the five spot Now you put him at the five he gets to attack you off the bounce The orange put a lot of pressure on your defense when they put him inside because now theres multiple guys that can play in the pick and roll including Freeman Opens the space up right now They look really good here in first half Yellow Jackers are right here as well So Donnie Freeman steps to the line for a one and one Well Freemans return will certainly help those free throw numbers because laughter in the last five minutes of games Freeman is a perfect 10 for 10 That is where they missed him Yeah And this is a team that is 11 and three instead of 9 and five If they shot Yes the ball better at the free throw line would have won against Houston and Hopstro Anyone outside of Freeman and Nate George taking free throws youre holding your breath for the Orange But so far here tonight theyve been rock solid from free throw line Ball on the floor Ripped away How about the hustle from William Kyle Syracuse been good in transition Looking for another three Rattles in and out He was halfway down but didnt drop Its not what you want to see if youre a Yellow Jackets fan Is Bongo on the floor grabbing his ankle David Satommire already with a depleted front court with Moila unavailable with an ankle sprain and Dongo is the Yellow Jackets best player getting looked at by medical personnel right now just dealing with nag and injuries hes missed four games we talked about Freeman Ban out and probably dongles missed four games this year as well as Hes trying to round himself into basketball shape So lets see what happened here Was on that scramble for the ball between William Kyle and by Dango Watch William Kyle hit his right knee there on the ground Now while Dongo continues to receive treatment well step aside Georgia Tech trailing by eight here at home against Syracuse and already without the talented freshman Moila tonight and then by Dongo right before we stepped aside appeared to injure his right knee Well get you an update as soon as we have one Georgia Tech not with many options in the front court when you lose Dongo and Cila the arguably the two most consistent players that David Stoutmire has had all season It takes away the lineup in a sense that now they got to play with Wy Reeves who starts at the three Hell slot to the four You take away his length on the perimeter as a wing defender and an attack from that spot Reeves has it here This is the layup Hell get two at the line Was fouled and couldnt finish it I think he surprised himself there Reeves is a really good athlete there Someone saved a dunk on the deflection and the foul but hes the guy go out We talked about Mohamed Cer being out and lets not forget Kawasi Reeves is the leading scoreer for the Yellow Jackets He just has more on his plate right now Hes been playing unbelievable in the month of December here in early January averaging nearly 20 points a game had 16 points in the win against Boston College but very impressively had 23 points at Duke New Years Eve We were there at Cameron Indor And very impressed by Reeves that night Hes had to shoulder a lot of the offense below Get downhill Let Washington be the player that gets everybody else going He needs to start attacking early and often in the shot clock Syracuse has been in control of this first half a sixpoint lead but they havent truly separated Still a twopossession game as Georgia Tech plays without two starters in the front court Freeman trying to hustle that home Gathers his own miss that cleans it up for two Tech tried to go with his own zone Expect both teams to go a little more zone than he did earlier in the game And Yellow Jack did a good job of making a miss but didnt rebound the basketball That rims out for Washington No good Kate George his return to Atlanta Lefty layup Spins in Hes used to getting a good bounce here at Georgia Tech Twoyear starter for the Yellow Jackets before transferred to Syracuse Foul off the ball William Kyle and Payton Marshall pleading their cases Great job here attacking the defendant Lamar Washington retreats to the paint throws off his balance there Great lefty lay by Nate George And here I think William Cal has a gripe there Nate Marshall just came down and ran right into him He picks up his second foul Were in a critical time here for Georgia Tech right now And Fleming good look Knocks him down off the out of bounds Great job by the freshman Hes fearless when he comes in the game Georgia Techs going to go to the zone try to slow the tempo and pace of this game down Freeman he can be a zone buster Find Stling Comes up empty on the three Heres Marshall He started this game with backto back baskets but scoreless sets goes up strong but called for the offensive foul Too much contact from Payton Marshall And thats his third foul Start cant be happy with that call I thought the contact on the first move was okay I didnt think he tried to do anything the second time but he throws that chicken wing out with that left arm there When you see that elbow once its extended its automatic I thought if Marshall was just patient he had a obvious size advantage against Freeman So no dongo no Cila Now Marshall with three fouls What a take the up and under to get Kiraak in the air and Nate George cashes in for two Starting to see what the orange can be on the offensive end of the floor Fleming lost it right when he went to the rim Ricochets off Syracuse So stay Georgia Tech basketball Dont try to do too much Allow the ball to move Continue to attack but just drive to make a play for someone else here Well you mentioned it Randolph A critical two minutes and change here ahead of halftime Danger zone for Georgia Tech playing without Dongo right now Kiraak hes fouled Great baseline out of bounds execution there Good slip by Kiraak And that is the third foul against William Kyle whos been an excellent rim protector this season for Syracuse averaging three blocks per game He went for the block there and the risk did not pay off Kyle has to come out with those three fouls In comes Ibrahim Suare the former Yellow Jacket Hasnt made a free throw all year long He needs to make one here Missed them both Struck Georgia Tech team from the free throw line Offensive rebound secured and then immediately rejected Three orange uniforms in on that block but Washington steals it back again Lamar Washington tried to do it himself Rejected by the rim on that miss And now Starling slows things down with two minutes left of this first half missed opportunity there for the Yellow Jackets making the effort play Hes just unable to finish This game has turned very physical in the later stages of the first half Another off ball foul trying to run Freeman in a post Theres just no matchup for him now We talked about Georgia Tech has decisions to make You saw Davis starter go to the zone when he goes man Right now he has four guards on the floor Difficult task trying to match up with Donnie Freeman cheering After a nineame absence Freeman returned against Clemson on New Years Eve 18 points nine rebounds He did not start that game He started tonight If Syracuse is going to get to meaningful games in March you have to think itll be on the shoulders of Freeman He is a differencemaker He is Like I talked about its not just his ability to score and rebound to provide opportunities for the guards like that No box out and an easy layup for Nate Kings Jazz Kelly just fires He had made his last five threepoint attempts The Yellow Jackets desperate for an offensive spark Both these teams turning up the tempo in transition The guy Fleming step back three Missed it Halftime cant come fast enough for the yellow jacket Those last two possessions are not good offensively You want to play fast but they need to take the right shots right now Those are quick shots Thats going to lead out the transition opportunities for Syracuse if they continue to take those shots Freeman lines up the three Couldnt connect And another foul And every loose ball whether its a rebound or a scramble feels like a foul is coming Very physical between these two right now both teams in the double bonus Then foul against Suare That is his third Syracuse I think is settling too much Even Freeman he missed those free throws And this is concerned when games get tight when you do that But continue to run your offense Space the floor Get down here with your guards Youve done a really good job of getting lobbs and dumps and your guards getting in the paint So its been a very strong first half offensively for Syracuse Theres not been many games you can say that this season Thats what we talked about Thats the impact of Freeman Uh again weve lamented that But these guards are they just need to step Its too much talent to have these offensive struggles Lets just call it what it is I mean to be the worst free throw shooting team Freeman are there or not Shouldnt happen Confidence issue with these guys Its a weird thing This team has been elite defensively and I dont say that like unlikely holding opponents to 39 from the field Its been in the offensive end where they struggle Great pass from Nate George to find Cen Anthony Anthony has 11 through this first half Again he just find ways to score He just turns his motor on Just play The ball will find him Dont worry about your numbers or percentages Just take shots and stay aggressive Breeze left it for Kiraak Splits two and misses Plenty of time here to add to this 12point lead for the Orange The ball screen with Freeman George draws contact Hell get two at the line because Syracuse with the double bonus The Yellow Jackets faithful They have let Nate George hear it throughout this first half Been very consistent with the Bluebirds in this homecoming to a twoyear starter for Damon Stoutmire It was funny We talked to Yellow Jackets head coach David Stoutmire and he said I still root for him except tonight Its a different looking orange team weve seen here in the first half Yeah Most points in a first half scored this season by Syracuse I think this is what you should come to expect for conference play with Freeman back in the lineup With Freeman back in the lineup this team is its just too much talent When you see the talent it makes you scratch your head Why are they struggling But I think Freeman comes back opens it up for these guards It provides front line scoring And I think Ken Anthony is another big part of that too Hes just a naturally gifted scorer that you dont have to run plays for Hes already scoring off catches shoot threes back door cuts Hes a double pick scoreer coming from the bench Three seconds for Georgia Tech Fleming I dont think he got it off in time but he missed it anyway Syracuse offensive fireworks in Atlanta Their first true road game most points in a first half this season a 4430 lead as Clemson nine in the first half against Georgia Tech And that is a season high 44 points in a half of basketball for the Orange 14point lead in a game that they feel like they need to win to ignite a January run here in conference play And its tough to win true road games in conference But Syracuse if they play like they in the first half going to be very difficult for Georgia Tech to come back even with Dongo back in the lineup As you can see there the first possession they go right at Bongo to test that knee He picks up his second foul going with Donnie Freeman in the post A three for Nate Kings Misfired Whats the recipe for a Yellow Jackets comeback Randolph Just continue to move the basketball by Dons out there but hes moving a little gingerely They go right to him Passes out of the double team Somebodys open Fleming into the lane Misses the layup by Dango there to clean it up for two Great ball movement there Good defense Its better offense Stling down the court in a hurry picking up right where they left off in the first half The Orange a clear game plan Do not let Georgia Tech set up their half court game You know both really good defensive teams You can see Syracuse is just doing a better job of pushing tempo here as Fleming gets to the rim and Mike Dongle gets inside and cleans it up Doesnt look to be hobbling but just not moving as quick and explosive as he usually looks Second cheering conference game of the season for Syracuse You know for any golf fans out there Ive got this analogy January is like moving day Saturday in a 4day golf tournament If you want to put yourself in a position to make a run on Sunday youve got to do it on Saturday And for ACC basketball that means if you want meaningful games in March you got to take care of business in January And so far the Orange have done that tonight in Atlanta Both teams have dug themselves and not necessarily a hole but they hadnt given themselves any leeway So as they get into conference play its important to get off to a good start When you have the expectations of the Orange and the talent that they have you got to get off a good start Along the Dango backto back baskets for Vango He came out of this game injured 2125 Georgia Tech trail The Orange separated without him there Yellow Jackets look a lot better with number 11 on the court that they do and you can see there in that position he didnt catch and dunk it Hes gritting it out for team showing you his level of toughness Pull up pop rims off no good Offensive rebound finds Kings and hes fouled Dongo rolled up on him and commits his third foul Be start What do you do He picks up his third foul Thats two quick ones here He only had one in the first half As you can see the assistants running up to him letting him know Maybe hell try to run some zone to protect him As we talked about it in the first half Series went on a 100 run with him being out Freeman goes right at Dongo again Its an and one and Dongo just picked up his fourth Now you got to take him out Great job by the Orange Theyve gone right at him here at the start of the second half by Dongo has picked up three fouls here early in the second half And foul trouble continues to haunt by Dongo and the Yellow Jackets He has to understand how important he is to this team Theyre not going to go very far without him in the lineup and he cant allow foul trouble to take him out of these games Well credit Syracuse and Donnie Freeman They they just attacked And a lot of thats because Donnie Freeman is back As we talked about hes going to He does that and puts so much pressure on you Another turnover Syracuse defense picking up right where they left off They give it right back Scoop to the hoop It rims out No good And it falls to Freeman Shovels it ahead to Kings Right now you sense the Orange just feel like theyre ready for an offensive explosion Well theyve gotten it so far and Donnie Freeman there again in perfect position to cash in for two Wheres the offense going to come from for the Yellow Jackets I think right now its all hands on deck They got to move the basketball but when it settles down I think its got to be Washington making a play And another foul call and it goes against Marshall and and the front court just continues to pile fouls That is his fourth Theyre trying hes trying just to play with a level of physicality and hes asking the officials like what did I do And watch him Hes just rolling Its that right arm hes hooking You see the right hand grab and the hook Its the right call So Marshall with four fouls Dongo with four fouls And Dongo by the way he picked up three of those four fouls in a minute 27 second span Its been the biggest issue with his career so far He was just struggling with foul trouble Donnie Freeman gets into the paint Through contact no call but counted for two cant switch a guard on Just too much length as he gets closer to the rim and starts setting screens and he switches And again if you stay home then the guards are going to free get freed up and theyre going to be able to get downhill and punish him Freeman has 15 He is starting to feast in Atlanta A welcome sight for Syracuse fans who missed him in his nineame absence FREEMAN ALL ALONE HELL MAKE IT PAY Donnie Freeman Hes got 18 and Syracuse is up 20 on the road music You wonder why we talked about him in the opening and hes showing you why Taking the contact there finishing in the paint Oh I can do a little bit more to finish in the paint I can knock down threes Orange running away Syracuse up 20 The Orange on a nine nothing run right now And Freeman has ignited this offense which through stretches of this season has really struggled Hes ignited them He has as we talked about it just creates matchups and when hes in ball screens actions again weve seen guard switch on him and hes just too athletic too much length for those guys and cheering when you put traditional bigs on him he just spaces the floor the orange force a turnover here George tiptoes to keep it in bounds theyre going to rule this an over and back but I dont think either team had possession I think the official Well this should be Syracuse basketball It should unless they say that from William Kyle was enough to justify possession but I dont think he had control Well there would have been a turnover there at the end when they George kind of steps out but I agree with you I didnt think there was a clear possession One of the few mistakes offensively that the Orange made this happen Lacy Reeds got to get going Georgia Techs leading scorer whos been quiet Thatll be a goend William Kyle didnt catch it in time Yeah Reeves only six points tonight And with Bango suffering an injury in the first half coming back into the second half and picking up three fouls in a minute and 27 seconds They need Reeds And the Orange is a difficult team to pressure because they have three guys on the floor that can start their offense I mean JJ starting starts as as an off guard but he has played point guard in his career Just multiple handlers Trying to pressure these guys into mistakes Its not easy Starling pull up jumper Rimmed in and out No good Offensive rebound Freeman through contact Stay Syracuse balls out A Freeman has stolen the headlines 18 points Just his second game back from injury and the Orange up 18 Have on the road tonight They will go into pit with tons of confidence An 18point lead The schedule does set up Randolph that Syracuse could go on a run here Not to look ahead Still 1541 remaining in the second half But at Florida State at BC Virginia Tech the next five for the Orange Well the talent of Syracuse jumps out at you when you see it See the potential you see the depth with the addition of healthy Freeman You just see it all coming together Were all witnessing right now The key is now can they find offensive consistency on a regular basis so far here in first five minutes of the second half They have continued on from a strong first half The way Georgia Tech has fouled in this game they might not have her front court left at the end of it Kiraak just picked up his third Dongo and Marshall already on the bench with four fouls Kings down the lane goes right at Kiraak and a called foul on the Freeman tip in that goes against Kesi Reeves But thats the issue regarding this Syracuse group is everyone has to guard the basketball now and they put so much pressure on you William Cal is such an elite athlete at the rim Your bigs cant help up against him because they throw the lob over the top And after that all the other four players now with Donnie Freeman back in the lineup have the ability to beat you off the bounce and draw fouls And thats what theyre great at And to use your golf analogy earlier theyre shooting free throws Well thats like putting man They dont have to shoot They dont have a free throw yet right Theyre making putts Theyre making free throws right now And that is a major jump within itself Yeah Second worst free throw shooting team in all of college basketball coming into the night But theyve already improved that with how they have shot it from the line 10 of 14 I think having him back Hes shooting a high quality shooting 8 of the year Talk about Donnie Freeman Kelly step back in offensive rebound finds the freshman for two Kiraak Its been tough sledding inside for Georgia Tech tonight Depleted in the front court but they got two there How can you string together some stops if youre the Yellow Jackets Bring some life back into this game with Syracuse up 18 Great time putting your arms The basketball is moving Something they hadnt done A lot of dribbling and try driving the score Right now theyre driving the pass like that And Freeman finishes inside again He has 22 Jay this can be a really difficult team to match up with Now if theyre going to play unselfish and move the basketball like that we know theyre going to compete defensively Hangs in from a unique angle Cam Prem the junior and Georgia Tech will take it anyway they can get it tonight They need him to get going Came in with the reputation of his shooters Slow time adjusting lost some confidence not making shots See that one goes off the glass Sterling pulls it out 10 seconds on the shot clock That rims down No good Offensive rebound William Kyle just ripped it down and cashed in for two Good luck as a guard trying to box him out on the re the offensive glass So much length for Syracuse that it has hurt the Yellow Jackets tonight as Reeves drains the three and a Georgia Techs going to come back Its going to be through 14 reads It has to Thats a blown assignment there Hes the one guy you cannot allow to get free As we talked about shooting 48 it over and back Adrian Andre not happy about it Oh hes not He shouldnt be again Youve gotten this lead Move the ball Those are the mistakes they made before You lose Reeds here and Nate Kings make that mistake trying to go over screen But here Nate George got to get off it No need to pound the air out of the basketball right now You guys have found something Just continue to move it Right back to Reeves trying to get him hot Lamar Washington finds Fleming for a three Missed him This is what we talked about the death Now Anthony comes in and James Suare comes in and Tyler Metsy as well who has the ball here No good Offensive rebound keeps the possession alive SUARE SPLITS TWO RIMS IN Count it Plus the foul The former Yellow Jacket stings Georgia Tech there This is what they expected from second group comes in now Suare attacks the glass They forget to guard him He reminds these guys okay well I can put it down and go score Takes the contact and gets the roll Syracuse is starting to pull away in this game And its see how good they look cant convert the and one opportunity Washington on a mismatch Interesting that he decides to go inside on Suare instead of pulling him out and trying to blow by him Well getting in the paint is just right Hes not comfortable doing that He lost his handle attacking Suare on the on the drive and picks up his fourth foul Washington to the line But now with the size on the court for Georgia Tech theyre going to have to go small And you see Damon Stardomire is trying to get Bongo in the game And with this current lineup for Syracuse Bongo has an extinct size advantage inside Well Dongo playing with four fouls with 1212 remaining in this game But Damon Stammire probably looks at it You cant let Syracuse continue to separate here with Dongo on the bench And Jay with this lineup thats on the floor hes the biggest player on the floor So hoping he can take advantage of it but hes still hobbling a little bit Hes got a sleeve on that right leg Doesnt have this explosive quick jump ability Ky Anthony rejected on his way to the rim Cam Craft turn around gets it to go Cam Craft two for two off the bench Cam Craft continue to attack Great job there driving playing off two feet spinning and shooting at midrange Swing to the corner finds Betsy Got it Tyler Betsy a big three Great drive there Great Syracuse attacks the rim to pass to someone else Just opens up so much for their offense What a terrific feed and Georgia Tech finding their rhythm offensively now Can they string together some stops here with a little more than 11 minutes left The only concerns you got to have if youre Auts a lot now The game is speed quick You know patience being quick Theyre not guarding the way they did early in the game Nate George at the line when we come back Facing his former team twoyear starter for Georgia music Tech transferred to Adrien Autry at Syracuse at his homecoming The Orange in control of this one 6549 Did and in his return to Atlanta Been pretty good Nine points five assists and has two free throws coming Hes still finding his way for the Orange Trying to find his role as you see the talent Theres so many handlers He doesnt have to dominate the ball He was so good in music that Georgia Tech uniform and right now still trying to figure things out how to balance when to attack and I think coach Ary wanted him probably attacking a little more early now with Donnie Freeman back and everything that they have maybe a little bit more facilitating in the future I know transfers are so normal now in 2026 college basketball but its still odd to see the inconference transfer as frequent as we have And you thinking about it for Syracuse youre going to see a former Orange Quadir Copeland when they face NC State in Raleigh and its just become part of the game I know when you played in this conference that was not ever going to happen No you sat out two years back then and now its Thanks for reminding me of how old I am Jay I mean how much the rules have changed but I know youre my guy Sorry Thats okay Earlier uh this year we had Dr Jay on a broadcast When he played college basketball dunking was not allowed Im not that old laughter Good thing dunking is not outlawed because thats uh been quite entertaining today Syracuse has had a lot of highlight reel throwd downs although not that time Starling was looking to allow lob for Freeman Couldnt connect Blue stop down the lane going coast to coast He draws the foul JJ Sting had an opportunity there Problem is he drove the pass and turned it over Great job by Jad Mustaf there getting there attacking the rim I think George had nothing he could do but foul there the layup cheering Georgia Tech has made five of their last seven shots They try and breathe some life into what has been a lopsided game for Syracuse Its interesting Georgia Tech has been very strong defensively throughout this season but they just cant seem to straight up enough stops to cut into this orange advantage They got to do things like getting their pressure here when they forced Syracuse to miss shots Theyve allowed a couple of offensive rebounds that created just difficult opportunities for them just to consistently get back 8 seconds to shoot Nate Kings with it Three seconds on the shot clock Kings in trouble and its another turnover Thats just a reminder how good this Yellow Jacket defense can be at times there We talked so much about Syracuse Again both teams hold opponents to 38 39 respectively And the problem with the yellow jackets is that theyve lost We talked about Mo Cely big time brim protector and by Dongos had so much foul trouble here Hes been in relegated ineffectiveness as far as an athleticism with his knee being Washington rightly commits the foul and comes out George checks back in Come on Come on Come on Remes He has yet to get going Dono fouled Is he trying to follow it Theres no quitting this yellow jacket group Theyre going to continue to fight The personality of that coach there David startmire Reed comes off that pin down and takes a shot I dont mind that at all Great job by Mago getting to the rim trying to put some points on the board for the Yellow Jackets Well a hallmark of this Georgia Tech team under Damon Statmire here in year three now is they have gotten better as the seasons have gone along and we thought it was trending that way again They played Duke really tough They lose by six at Cameron or come back and beat Boston College and tonight was viewed as a pivotal game with Syracuse in their own building and just havent been able to keep it close and cut into this lead enough to make it uncomfortable for the Hey its been the injury bug I mean last year no one had more injuries than the Yellow Jackets in their team And then you start off this year you got Bongo missing four games He got banged up tonight Youre missing CIA Its just hard to have any continuity early in the season when you got guys in and out of the lineup particularly star players George does well with draw contact and hell head to the line for two touchdown number 14 I dont know what start can do to fix that You just got to be hopeful you guys can get healthy and theres a reason why It just takes time to get your guys in sync and get them together And hes just been battling those injuries Well theres really nothing you can do when you have star players go down And Syracuse fans know that Look Donnie Freeman just came back from missing nine games He was that last year remember He got injured a year ago He didnt finish his freshman game and and Syracuse fans dont necessarily want to hear it but its true I mean you take an all ACC player off the court for nine games We see his impact here So you question what he means to this team you see it here Tonight again hes going against a preseason second and hes had his way Freeman has 22 points tonight to lead the Orange George knocks down both from the line Hes now got 13 Georgia Tech with four players with four fouls We still have more than 9 minutes left in this game Go and not a deep edge Scoop to the hoop Good take from Washington Its difficult to come back when youre more of a half court defense and you dont look to exting your pressure You dont have a lot of depth creating a turnover here Fouronone Dango all alone Got to give Bono credit He is clearly not 100 after going down injury to the first half but you said it He is battling trying to breathe life into a comeback effort here Timeout Syracuse as the Yellow Jackets take the lead down to 14 Well step early in ACC play Just the second conference game for Syracuse as they were off over the weekend Two teams desperate for a win as everybody in the ACC jockeying for position in the conference right now Syracuse has been excellent offensively tonight 69 points already Looking for more here William Kyle flying in and a foul called Kelly Jazz Kelly called for the push Yeah thats on the guards there Vango rotates over to protect the rim Its on your guards to get in there and bow to William Kyle And again I dont expect a guard I trust me to stop William Kyle I would have fouled as well I would have grabbed his jersey He just put my hand up So cant be mad at your guards there Kyle under 50 from the free throw line One of the more unique shooting strokes youve ever seen at the stripe I mean you say unique I I I call it difficult laughter Youre just hoping he makes one Thats all that thats unique isnt the word Id use But hey thats what you want You want one out of every Hey if it goes in I dont care what it looks like right Not when youre in the orange I mean hes the one thats okay if he shoots 50 Its everyone else that needs to be better He if you play as hard as he does and defend and protect the rim the way he does you dont need to make free throws That just rolls off the rim No good for Dongo Freeman too shy of a careerhigh in just his second game back after a ninegame absence Calling for the ball here These are possessions you dont want to see for the Orange A lot of dribbling not a lot of body and not a lot of ball movement and a miss Although Kyle stays with it keeps the possession alive Spins in Couldnt finish it Lobango on a mismatch going against his former teammate Nate George Hell be at the line for two when we come back Syracuse Matt Park yesterday announced as the state of New York sports caster of the year Does a terrific job being the voice of the Orange And in addition to that hes been a fantastic mentor to Syracuse students through the years Like me Im an Orange alum And I am one of hundreds he has helped throughout the year And Randolph you know the importance of a great coach early in your career I do But if he was your coach man he needs a raise We had to go over and give him more money He didnt tolerate you I Ive had to put up with you in a couple of broadcasts I couldnt imagine teaching you the craft the patience that you must have taken My gosh I can tell you this I was a lot worse both on the air and off the air back then So I I have mellowed considerably if you can believe it Georgia Tech not going away Syracuse has been in control but you have to give the Yellow Jackets credit particularly by Dongo playing with four fouls playing in this second half after he came out with an apparent right knee injury the first and hes up to 17 points and 11 of them have come after the injury cheering Theyre actually shooting 57 here in the second half The problem is they havent been able to get any stops Well that has to frustrate David Satomire because defense is what that theyve hung their hat on all season long Off to the rim Dongo doing it all by Dongo You never know He went down with that knee injury Transition three way off the mark from Cam Craft That would have cut it to 10 Its an elite defensive play there by Don stops the penetration and takes away the lob play George they go for the lob again and Georgia Tech was defending the lob a lot better now Now they say it stays Syracuse basketball cheering These last two possessions thats off Jaden Mustaf These last two defensive possessions they have been more of what Georgia Tech has defended like all year long But theyre starting to score there Thats just a great physical play there Youre right Bust off did touch in last and then got tangled up with his former teammate Suare Must physicality at the force allows him to play but hes given up a lot of length to Donnie Freeman Freeman Spin move rejected by Dongo Says no Washington down the court misses the layup Oh Pongo is showing why hes an all ACC player He is I mean hes just showing you why we were so high on him And again what would this game have looked like had he not picked up three fouls in a minute and 32 seconds Hes that good of a player on both ends of the court He showed you there elevating on one leg off the vertical sending that out of there Miscommunication on the inbounds Chaz Kelly there to recover it Kelly leads it off for Dongo and hell go back to the line to shoot two Everything going through by Dongo right now in this comeback effort for the Yellow Jackets Abraham Suare fouls off fouls And now William Cow comes back in the game cheering Me and JJ Stling hes been hes another guy thats have to figure out a way to put his imprint on this game It hasnt been his night They have needed him to score but he needs to be a little bit more aggressive and help closing this game He like Bong like by Dongo is a preseason second team Well Dongo is willing Georgia Tech in this second half 12 of his points have come since halftime and Syracuse has led throughout Theyve led for more than 28 minutes of this game by as many as 20 but that lead is down to 12 with a little more than 6 minutes remaining And from the orange I continue to attack him He has four fouls He cannot commit his fifth foul Youre allowing him to be a weak side defender as he just showed you there He can come over and block shots I would put him in the action Shot clock down to five Starling has to hurry down the lane Easy layup Must have heard us talking about him there Hes been a highlight real performer at times Spills out to Mustaf He draws contact Two coming to David Stoutmire saw him frustrated there because it was a good opportunity to get the and one Yeah hes talking about his guys on the defensive end of the floor Hes wanting his guys to challenge there You got to get over You cant give up uncontested layups Hes disappointed in his guys there He sees the battle on the offensive end of the floor but theyve got to find a way to get stops if they want to get back in this game A game of huge importance for both teams as they try and jockey for position early in ACC play Syracuse has led throughout but the Yellow Jackets refuse to go away Free throw shooting has hurt Georgia Tech tonight Eight misses Usually its Syracuses free throw struggles that get talked about We talked about it Its Georgia Tech is not a good free throw shooting team themselves Theyre just not as bad as the Orange Freeman stripped on his way to the rim Heres Dongo giving Georgia Tech everything hes got after the injury in the first half And Washington an easy layup Georgia Tech thought they won the ball back Lamar Washington how about the hustle They award the ball to Syracuse but Washington has cut this lead down to 11 with 507 left I agree with Washington there I thought after the layup watch this inbound pass here Little sloppiness here on the inbound And does that touch George I thought it was off Nate Georges hand I wouldnt be surprised if Dismar challenges this On the floor a Syracuse ball Georgia Tech has called a timeout for a coachs challenge So Damon Stoutmier does use his coachs challenge If he loses it he will lose a timeout So Georgia Tech will be down to one and he loses the ability to challenge the rest of the game I think its worth it Jay One I do think its Georgia Techs basketball from what I saw live but the other thing is now his team has momentum He gets to coach these guys up and kind of let them know hey we got to continue to defend him We got to rebound offensively Just continue to attack here as we watching Brown play Just a casual inbound play there Its tough because the ball is out of frame and you need indisputable evidence to overturn So unless theres a better look I We were just coming from the other This aint going to be able to see see it goes off Washington and then George Yes I thought Washington touched it but I think it was off Nate Georges hand That last angle was the best angle Yeah theyre further away from us but thats what it look like Weve zoomed it in for you Right there Right there The coachs challenge is successful Syracuse was last to touch the ball Georgia Tech will retain their 30 secondond timeout and have one additional challenge of the ball with 20 seconds to go in the front court So now if you can cash in on the coachs challenge giving you the ball back and cut this lead to single digits with five minutes to play and despite all the challenges the Yellow Jackets have had tonight youd be right in it Well they battled back in the second half Theyre starting to score the basketball They struggle scoring earlier Now when they score it its allowing them to set their defense keep the orange in half court and they stop sharing the basketball and they begin to struggle Washington doesnt get the flow of the ball but the hustle again cheering leads to two free throws Mustaf never gave up on that possession And now an opportunity to cut the lead to single digits the last time Georgia Tech was trailing by less than 10 329 left in the first half Theyre just playing harder right now So far here in this second half they dug themselves in a hole and right now Georgia Tech is starting to be a more physical team Theyre playing harder They have struggled from the free throw line though Seven of 12 in this second half Big make there to cut it to 10 And again we know Syracuse has shot the ball poorly all year from the free throw line Can you make this a closer game and put pressure on them so their free throws matter Syracuse led by as many as 20 in this second half That goal is down to nine with under five minutes to play cheering Nate George at his homecoming to face his former team in Atlanta Passes off cheering George wants it back Kyle finds Freeman instead Shot clock already down to 10 Starling that rims out No good on the layup cheering Its not a good possession there Not a lot of ball movement Great defense again Washington denying a reversal Reeds a three Missed it Kings turns it over Syracuse leaving the door open here And Reeves gets the goalend And the Syracuse lead is down to seven cheering Were going to find out a lot about Syracuse here in the next 4 minutes and 12 seconds They reverted back to the things that created issues earlier in the year A lot of selfish play in a sense of theyre not body movement not no ball movement Syracuse with 10 second half turnovers four in the last four minutes Theyve shot one for their last seven Its allowed a 143 Georgia Tech run Buckle up for the final four minutes A herculean comeback by Georgia Tech Theyve cut it from 20 to7 Starling rejected JJ Starling went to the rim again Backto back possessions Hes come up empty Great defensive possession there by Jay Gustaf again had a couple of blocks at the rim Washington go in trouble Passes out of the DOUBLE TEAM DOUBLE GO for two cheering Jackets on a nine nothing run Talk about toughness Georgia Tech is showing you their toughness here cheering Time out Adrien Autry Georgia Tech through foul trouble through a 20point deficit in music the second half Have refused to go away and its a fivepoint game Georgia Tech right back in it music Jackets with all the momentum right now here at home 315 to play and what was once a Syracuse 20point lead is down to five That was Techs largest deficit of the season Zunong on the back of Bongo theyve responded brilliantly Syracuse is putting the ball in JJ Stings hands and again theyre expecting him to make plays for him Nate Kings on this drive kicks it out Nate George facing his former team in trouble PUTS IT UP NO GOOD Swatted out of bounds So itll stay Syracuse ball under three minutes to play at a fresh shot clock Tried to run a goal screen clear out for Nate Kings to drive with his left hand Really good defense there Paying attention to the scout report by Wayy Reeves Not allowing him to get to his strong hand forcing him back to his health Syracuse in a threeminute scoring drought They have missed their last four shots They have four turnovers during that stretch as well Its allowed a nine nothing run for Georgia Tech in those last three minutes cheering Plenty of time here with this possession Balls got to move George floats it to Donnie Freeman Freeman spins free and draws the foul Donnie Freeman will get two at the line a chance to extend this fivepoint lead and tie a careerhigh if he makes it both And thats just what happens He sets the screen on George and they switch And thats the added element of why we saw the offensive explosion earlier Theyve struggled Theyre not getting back to their actions And there again post up Washington Jay Mustav comes over tries to block the shot and commits the foul cheering Big free throws here And Freeman misses it We mentioned it a few times tonight Syracuse under 61 from the free throw line this season One of the worst in all of college basketball It has cost them two games already this season Raymond makes that one Still a two possession game though Orange up six You got to get stopped here now You see them fall back in the two3 zone First time weve seen Syracuse in their zone here Watch Way Reeves at that right wing Washington missed Mustaf on the block Jump ball had the possession arrow with Georgia Tech So itll stay Yellow Jackets ball 222 to play Only six seconds on the shot clock Lets see if Syracuse stays in that two3 zone or do they go man David Satires team struggled against the zone against Duke on New Years Eve They missed the first 10 shots they took against the Blue Devil zone So not a huge surprise to see Syracuse go into it here Thought theyd go to a lot earlier Reed to three No good Channel for the ball Starling battling for it cheering and wins it The officials have awarded the ball to Syra Very difficult call Lets see if Georgia Tech can cash in on the extra possession Washington trying to get a twoman game Washington and B Step back three off the mark and the rebound called in by William Kyle and Syracuse whos been pushing it all night Slows things down Begging for the finish line here on the road up six cheering Biden almost spaced in the corner here Theyre trying to run attack him in the post Hes the only rim protector there So if theyre going to space Donnie Freeman he can lift Mike away from the rim FREEMAN IN ATTACK MODE SHINS IT OUT A CAREERHIGH FOR DONNIE FREEMAN And hes got the Orange up eight Reeves Georgia Tech has to hurry here THEY GIVE IT AWAY Sterling fouled And with a minute and 12 seconds Syracuse regaining the momentum Red off your way to a critical moment of that game and going to the two3 zone there causing problems with the Yellow Jackets who got us to play fast but great drive there by Dongs been hanging in the paint Great job by Donnie Freeman sliding to the top there catching by Dongo when the close out drives by finishes These two stars have battled all night long I mean how many times can we say what a difference maker Donnie Freeman not only has been tonight but will be this season for Syracuse He is And again its theyve had moments that theyve got to clean up But theyve shown you for about 30 minutes of what they could be and then in their most needed times theyve given the ball Well theyve run action to find Donnie Freeman And again hes just such a matchup problem and hes delivering Startling one of two from the line Yellow Jackets down nine Time not on their side They need a three and they get it Akai Fleming the freshman delivers and its a twop possession game with 105 remaining Both teams are still trying and both guys one shy of a double double And we talked about Vongo how important he was to the Yellow Jackets once he got dinged up Where were they going to look He comes back in this game and he completely flipped it Got the Yellow Jackets back in it Each team with one timeout get a minute left Syracuse has led throughout this game but it has gotten uncomfortable late Freeman has a mismatch inside of inside the court Shot clock down to seven Day George against his former team He wants the shot here and he lost the ball Thats a turnover Some great defense there Great help outside in the gap Gracy Reed sticking his hand in there creating this deflection knocking it off of Nate George No doubt about that I think George knows thats not a good time for a turnover George six turnovers in his homecoming Georgia Tech still alive in this game Eight points quickly though They go to Dongo Rejected William Kyle Biggest block of the night And Georgia Tech has the foul here They do And Syracuse with the double bonus So they will get two at the line here Nate George opportunity at the line Theyll close this out William Cal just an elite athlete here Stops the ball and rotates over to block the shot Defense is about multiple efforts there He Thats what you want to put on tape guys Thats what it takes to win And thats definitely what it takes to win on the road Seven blocks tonight for the Orange That one the biggest of the bunch Nate George connects on the first Oh this is certainly who you want at the foul line if youre Syracuse George has been the most consistent this season in a year that free throws have been very problematic Gets cheering them both Need a quick score here Be a Yellow Jack Doesnt have to be a three but its got to be fast The last thing you wanted to do the yellow Syracuse commit a foul there and stop the clock 19 sends Washington to the to the line for a one and one Well still to come on ACC Network well get you there as soon as were done in Atlanta NC State in Boston College the second game of our Tuesday night ACC double header Washington a chance to make this a twopossession game again The lefthanded point guard for Portland Bet You got to get Kyle out of the game Crow shooting now Put your best free throw shooters in More importantly get your guards in Got to handle this pressure Not a lot of time left So you got got to try to get a 5second count Maybe a quick trap but youre going to have to foul They get it into George Thats not who you want to foul But with time not on the Yellow Jacket side theyre forced to foul George Now Syracuse are in their offensive defensive substitution patterns here late in the game I mean if youre a team play at Syracuse wouldnt you put three guys on Nate George let anybody else beat you at the foul line Well you can take the inbounder I think and take the inbound and deny him and force other guys in But I would foul JJ Stone I would foul everyone else but Im not going to let Nate James mean Nate George close me out Oh he is a perfect nine for nine from the foul line facing his former team And Syracuse is hoping that they can hang on to this road win and that can ignite a January run with a favorable schedule Those are winnable games Theyre tough games I I think these are those are the teams that a lot of them theyre picked to compete against and youre going to find out a lot about Syracuse Theyve dug themselves in a little bit of a hole I dont think its too deep but they got a chance to play themselves out of it here and it starts here This is a really impressive road win that they can hang on here the last 15 seconds Reeves a desperation three goes begging Syracuse has it One more foul but that will do it Wasnt pretty but it was they were tested for 30 minutes of this game Syracuse looked really good Had a stretch there where they didnt play as hard as they usually play So the offense clearly much much improved with Donnie Freeman on the floor It is And youre starting to see the flashes of Ken Anthony coming along when they can get JJ Stling going I think you can see the orange take off cheering Freeman 26 points nine rebounds three blocks Syracuse in a game they felt like they needed to win on the road They get it done in Atlanta 8272 the final Big time win for the Orange
