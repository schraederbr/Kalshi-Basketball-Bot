first put it back The ball just didnt music go in the basket Hes building something special in New Britain Tip goes to Aiden Shaw gives it back to the point guard who we just talked about Chase Forte has been very strong so far 32 minutes 13 points a game for Boston College One and one The close loss on the road to FAU to begin the season and then the win over the Citadel 7647 Hastings cheering exclamation point fella from Florida bringing sunshine to start the game Jaden Hastings red shirt sophomore but Zor Grant likes to talk about hes in his third year now And theres that defense you talked about with Forte out front Hes blocked but a foul applause Youll see ball screen pick and roll Nice dime Hastings with the exclamation point And then this is what youre talking about with the defensive forte I mean this is what he does He steals it like a used car Just dont scout report Dont dribble near him Hes going to take the ball Hes that good Its like an analogy in a of a cornerback in football You just dont throw the ball into his area Jace Forte who came in as a transfer from South Dakota He was the Summit League defensive player of the year last year Started his career at UNCC Asheville then G Coast State Northwestern State and then last year with South Dakota Had a very nice year and now hes here with Boston College Something else about Hastings game is really exceptional He gets to the free throw line as well as anybody in basketball Now his Achilles heel hes only making 65 of those Look for him to improve music on that this year Chestnut Hill So heres Central Connecticut first real chance on the offensive end Max Frasier gives off for Jay Rogers is back healthy this year And Darren Smith Jr was a preeason allNEC selection Missed on the shot from the outside Boston College basketball I think Smith was a little surprised by the length of Hastings on that shot You know thats kind of what Patrick Sers told us before the game right This is a little bit different than what theyve seen so far Athletic Boston College team See how they match up Central Connecticut was here two seasons ago Donald Han Jrs leading scoreer finds Fred Payne and Missouri transfer Shaw gives it up for Forte Back inside for Shaw Three on the timer Shaw going to work at his foul applause Good defense by Central Connecticut Just a little too much body at the end of that Well see it on the replay Actually got him with the hands Automatic You know point of emphasis sorry Point of emphasis when two hands are on the def on the offensive player its an automatic foul Sean makes a free throw One of Central Connecticuts key things the last couple of years they dont foul John Theyve been so good Last year they committed the second fewest fouls just 113 per game which was the second fewest in the country last year Well already theyve sent Boston College to the line a couple of times Patrick S emphasized that in our conversation with him beforehand and Im surprised by that foul because two hands is a common mistake and usually guys know that thats automatic foul Frasier should know better actually better than college player played previously at Sienna So Boston College off to a six nothing start Theyve made all four of their free throws so far and that applause and cheering one is out of bounds It stays here and Patrick Cer says we really work hard in practice on you know arms up not fouling He really you know you and I were talking about it off air Hes done a wonderful job with this program He loves the identity of the program I mentioned the shooting numbers Central Connecticut did not shoot great against Quinnipic last time out Theres a loose ball with just two on the timer Held ball will keep possession here with just 23 seconds remaining on the shot clock Just two 3 minutes into the game Hastings presence is immense defensively right there had to take that jump Hes a thirdyear player Jaden Hastings who averaged 15 minutes a game last season So he had just a little over two to shoot for Central Rogers got a chance Its blocked by Forte and the EAGLES ARE THREE ON HASTINGS cheering Patrick C is not going to wait for the immediate timeout part Hes going to take one to settle the troops What a start for Boston College Hastings with a couple of dunks and the Eagles an 80 start here against Central Connecticut Starts with the block You get the block you get rewarded Grun out there Exclamation point dunk Hastings left dart 8 nothing Boston College with the lead over Central Connecticut Both shots from the floor have been dunked by Jaden Hastings and a couple of free throws as well And you know youve seen it on the defensive side for Boston College creating turnovers Their their length is really special You and I have chatted off air for two days getting ready for this broadcast How I really believe BCs defense will make a difference in ACC play this year That is inside with just three on the timer and Jaden Mott the sophomore throws it down for Centrals first points Great ball reversal Coaches love when you come out of a timeout you draw something up and it works Great timeout by Patrick Sers and got great execution Forte looking for help 12 to shoot for Boston College Eagles who are averaging 77 points a game over their first two games Heres Payne on the drive right TO THE BUCKET IN HASTINGS IS ALL over the rim today Have a day Jaden Hastings Earlier in the week I spoke to Mike Kelly whos the assistant director of basketball at IMG They said they love Hastings Great kid Hes a worker We see it so far James Jones falling away No good on the shot but the rebound is off BC It goes to Mott Sequence here for Central Connecticut Three ball good A corner three from Darren Smith Jr the sophomore from down the road in Springfield Central Connecticuts only got two shots on balance to dunk off the timeout and Jaden and Darren Smith rather they both baskets Other than that def BCs defense has caused them trouble Heres Han from the corner to answer short on the three Smith has another rebound Coach Ellis has to be happy with the way his team has responded after his timeout Rogers kicks three ball Spinelli is good Gabe Spinelli the senior from right here in Watertown Mass His dad was the interim head coach at BC Im sure that that young man has made jumpers in this forum before as a youngster coming to practice You went to Watertown High School just down the road Heres Fred Payne for three And that is in and out And it finds Jaden Mana the rebound Central could take the lead Little six nothing run here over the last 32 seconds And on the drive Spinelli gives it off looking for Jones Red Payne finds it though for Boston College He goes the other way with Forte Heres Donald Han for three That was short as well Another rebound for Jaden Mop Boy hes pulled a couple of rebounds so far but then miscommunication Its out of bounds and itll be Boston College basketball when we come back So a good start early for the music Eagles thanks to Hastings following up a couple Hes altered three shots already in the first 55 minutes of the game Great motor great teammate He sits for now Thats a deep three that rattles out from Caleb Stiger off the setup from Bowden Capi Transfer from Butler whos the other big on this Boston College roster Cap key played very well against Florida Atlantic and did not play I believe first to Citadel 17 points against Florida Atlantic Limited in game number two Here is Rogers from the elbow Lefthanded shot is good for Jay Rogers Hes kind of the X factor might be too strong a word but hes the guy that Patrick Sers says you know hes been around for a long time Hes been hurt the last two years but if we can get him going he has a chance to be a really big factor Coach S called him a grown man an adult on the court was his quote Donald Han for his first two for Boston College Big hoop for Donald Han Stops the 80 Central Connecticut run Centrals made their last three shots from the floor Four for seven to begin today and a twopoint game early in the first half Spinelli hit a three Here is Rogers in the starting lineup today after he came off the bench against Quinnipic and theres a foul underneath against Capi You bring up a good point about the starting lineup Coach Sers told us that last year he started the same lineup for 32 games Thats unheard of Just even an angle role or somebody you know food poisoning common things And this year hes going to change his lineup every game in the nonconference schedule just to find the right lineup Sign of a great coach when you can make adjustments Elo Sanchez did a good job to find that in traffic His shot is no good Here is Forte back on the run for Boston College Forte driving right hand a little bit short and a rebound for Nico Ashley The grad student came in from Elizabeth Town Tennessee A wide open underneath with Capy Comes over the block Daniel James Great block coming a long way Capy making up for the missed assignment Now here is Forte Little dish inside for Shaw One of the many transfers joining Eagles is Shaw Boston College is certainly getting to the rim in this game Central trying to answer from three No good for Melo Sanchez And Steer has a rebound The Blue Devils have success but theyve gotten ball reversals to take away the length of BC Here is Stiger for three Trying again No good that time Fire on the rebound Surprised the Blue Devils have been in manto man all game played a lot of zone like Gabe Spanelli may have gotten bumped or something The officials called time and might might have turned off Yep Look at this block by Capi He came a long way Mr Assist just getting it done Shaw exclamation point All happens because of Chase Forte Kavkys second block this year He has eight rebounds in each of his first two games Marco Rodanovich is in for Boston College for the first time As is Luca Taves making his season debut the sophomore from Tokyo whos banged up the first couple of games First foul goes against Steer Quick in the game Quick foul can really knock down the threepoint shot Oh Grant called him special the way he can shoot the ball Thats what both teams you said it off the top of the show who can make shots Its not there that time from Nico Ashley So Central is two for six from behind the arc Boston College 0 for five to start It is a 1410 Boston College music lead over Central Connecticut had a ton of points in that first sequence We had none music in the second out of that game But you know theres a lot of reasons to believe there theres more athleticism here more talent here and itll be interesting to see what this Eagles team can do And I think theyre really connected defensively especially early which is hard to do in this generation of college basketball when every year youre resembling a new club He was really enthusiastic in our conversation today Theres Rodanovich on the drive He has been aggressive in all three games of his Eagles career The freshman from Montenegro Big time drive not a big time finish Hell his if they win his teammates will make fun of him on the film If they lose not so much Here is Jaden Ma outside in a fourpoint game So again really neither team has scored here in a little while Really good start offensively both ways Now Central has not scored in three minutes Does that change now It does not Danny Shonda had the rebound but its immediately taken away by Nico Ashley Fresh timer here for Central Connecticut Elijah Parker in there now as well And a whistle away from the ball I dont know if the shot clock didnt reset but youre taught from your very first time in basketball keep the ball up when you rebound Uh guilty that time was Tammy Shondaanda of not doing that It looked like they it reset to 20 It should have reset to 30 So they adjust the timer to 25 correct because it goes to 30 on a change of possession 20 on an offensive rebound Good job Barton Jacobe Williams grad student from Jacksonville in there And thats KFKY who got a piece of it for BC Fred Payne on the run to the trailers Shondaanda And heres Luca Tes Fred Payne spots up for three Little bit strong Rebound finds its way down to Rodonovich but they call a foul on the rebound attempt against Shondaa So itll be Central Connecticut ball Shand coaching staff might have to have a little chat Little slow to start here Youll see great steel on your monitor right there Cap Each team with three fouls in the early going Eagles already going a little bit deeper down their bench today than we saw in their first home game on Thursday against the Citadel Kathy does a great job on the ball screen being active Couple of years at Butler someone that Earl Grant recruited out of high school so very familiar and was extremely excited to get him here to Boston College this year That is the shot clock violation and neither team has scored in more than 2 and 12 minutes Thats what we were chatting about the improved Eagles defense that time and Shundai getting a quick substitution Just not his best effort to start Coach Grant Mr Positive Hell get him back in there Here is Shaw Straight on three Little bit strong and a rebound for Parker You know the thing that has that Taves being back in is so important is that Payne does not have to be the backup point guard Correct He can kind of play on that wing We already saw the threepoint attempt Heres another one for Central And would you put lids on the rim when you came today I must And they were all going in You know like batting practice hitter Well everybody the ball is going in the shoot around Im a witness Heres Taves There it is Great sign Back in the lineup And like you said thatll take a lot of pressure off Fort Tay having a twoheaded monster at the point guard position Jaden Mott for three That is strong Aiden Shaw has the rebound for Boston College Sevenpoint lead for BC Nine minutes to go here in the first half And TA looks TA looks very comfortable and confident out there Heres Shaw Right hand Just rolls off but he realized it Taps his own rebound out for Taves and the dish is taken away Central Connecticut good job defensively with their hands getting deflections Darren Smith is no good from three central now which started okay back there but they turn it over and score at the rim with Elijah Parker Second time the Eagles have turnovers in the back court in the past two minutes Coach Grant cant be pleased by that It ends a seven nothing run It was a seven nothing run over nearly 6 minutes of team time but it was indeed a seven nothing run that is thrown away though knocked out off of Central So possession stays here and a bunch of subs about to come Eric you know what you do when youre not happy and your team turns the ball over carelessly You know what you do You put Chase Forte back in the game to solve that problem But very impressed by Tals minutes So Forte back in along with Donald Tan and Jaden Hastings out with Kapky and Taves Here is Donald Tan pull up is really welldefended That is James Jones the sophomore playing for his hometown team in New Britain Under eight minutes to go in the first half Still a fivepoint game and Spinelli walks into one and is off the mark from three Spinelli was confident shooting that He started to run back Like weve said hes made a more than his fair share of jumpers in this building Central is just one of its last 10 from the floor The Eagles are just one for their last seven Make it one for their last eight And you mentioned Jones Hes fearless Thats why hes such a great rebounder 12 rebounds in that first road game against Quinnipic Five of them on the offensive boards The sophomore from New Britain who averaged just a little over 11 minutes a game last year Spanelli is good from three Six points for Gabe Spanelli After the slow start Coach Cers has to be pleased his punch with his teams performance Now remember against the Citadel Forte thought about the three The Eagles had a a moment where they struggled a little bit from the floor Now that was at the very beginning of the game They started 0 for9 then they sort of figured it out here They started okay then started a little bit Now they get one back with Forte at the rim He has four I believe it was a 319 run to finish the half to really change the whole complexion of the game Eagles picking up full court trying to get the mojo back Here is Darren Smith against a double team Smith still manages to score Five points for Darren Smith Thats a very mature move You saw when he did what we call the exploration dribble He didnt rush He felt the defender and effortlessly made the turnaround jump shot Very mature Impressed by Smith Donalds hand catch was a little bit to his left Still managed to get it and find Forte Straight on three is no good Hand is only one of four so far Eagles are one for nine from behind the arc Central is now three for 13 but still hanging in a twopoint game with neither team maximizing from the floor so far And the Eagles are getting good shots their threes Theyre in rhythm in the con the confines of the offense Just cant get them to drop Shaw spinning Shaw inside and that doesnt go Pretty good left hand there Just needs to finish instead of going to George Ger and finger rolling the uh Michael Jordan dunk perhaps Eagles who had a bunch of dunks early in this game That pass inside and that was something It didnt work And here is Forte on the run for BC into the corner for Ham His three ball is no good But an offensive rebound for Hastings AND NOW FRED PAYNE IS good again Two threes both that time in rhythm Best time to shoot a three is an offensive rebound Eagles got the offensive rebound and dished it out You would love to see Fred Paynes shot pick up a little bit Just two for 11 from three to start the year He makes that one And BCs lead is back up to five Under 5 minutes to go here in the first half and thats taken away Hastings got a little bit of an awkward hit on the other side Hes immediately calling for the bench Still down at the other end Its blocked by Frasier BC going four on five right now And now they blow the whistle with BC still holding possession and Hastings down for Boston College We will check on that on the shot He looks fine and ready to get back in for Coach Grant So its a fivepoint game again We saw a lot of offense the first four minutes We have not seen as much since And to the corner Fred Payne for three Made one earlier What a rebound by Shaw Great rebound from the high post position Gives another chance And Capy for three Shaw nearly got another He helped get it to paid Well the Eagles are 0 for three on that trip Eagles need to gather themselves on the offensive rebound instead tipping going up strong DC with another offensive rebound Thats six of them And Shaw nearly had another rebound here but its out of bounds off of him And itll stay here when we come back 345 remaining in the first Still Boston College by five music Youre in the gym making free throws making threes all the time Gabe has proven that hes used to shooting here Has six points so far on the evening as well as a bloody jersey So leave it all on the court And father also was a standout at Beu right down Commonwealth Avenue Well Gabe is two for three from the floor The rest of the team is five for 19 to start AND A BLOCK FROM FORTE Forte doing Forte things with the defense Hey look theres being a good defensive player We know hes that but having that identity of yourself as a player fits so well in everything that Earl Grant is looking for out of his program Its really been a perfect fit so far early in the season Coach Grant was chatting how much he loves having point guards and hes been spoiled by having point guards for long periods of time and he believes Chad is that for him Theres the block from Forte So four points You saw the two free throws early See his numbers so far Again the Summit League defensive player of the year last year McDonald hand will music inbound for Boston College So theyre theyre doing it on the defensive end just cant score Its about finding the offense Patrick Sers would tell you the same thing for his troops Forte keeps that going And heres the zone for the first time We talked about this off air Eagles were preparing for this Captain kicks for hand Donald Han Jr is no good To tell you the truth partner the way Eagles are shooting Im surprised Patrick Cells didnt go to the zone quicker Yeah Heres the layup at the other end Its no good from Jay Rogers And that the outlet for Fred Payne trying to run the floor with Shaw with a double team there And it is taken away by Darren Smith Smith hard hit in New Britain Hes just a player Rogers on the run Finds Finanelli 22 to shoot A spin inside Its knocked away by Fred Payne out of bounds It will stay here Maybe its the ice underneath the court I mean I dont know what to say This This is the steal from Smith Just takes the ball away Two hands taking the ball away So BC has not scored in the last 223 Central has not scored in the last 348 You see one of their last nine from the floor that its not back to Its not back court because you didnt have possession The rule is you have to have possession Heres Finelli Kicks for Jay Rogers Little drive Got space Rogers is no good The thousands of officials in the building dont understand the laughter rule but the officials got that one correct Partner Donald Hand against Spinelli now and still looking to get going offensively He falls away and he scores So you know the other night I thought it was interesting because you know you could tell early on similar to this Donald Han music did not have his agame but he still worked his way into 18 points and that felt important for a guy whos going to be relied upon as heavily as he is this year Thats a foul on the threepoint attempt by Asamoto Great point on your part And good scorers dont need to shoot well to score or impact the game In hand I think with Forte will let things happen more naturally for him And snorts yes with hands uh struggling to score Its why we have a very close game so far in Chespan Hill That was just the fourth foul It goes against Jason Asamotto just into the game The sophomore from Lynn Massachusetts whos back home after playing a year at Baylor Heres Hand who was the ACC most improved player award winner last year Was up 11 points per game year over year And that was you know when Earl Grant talked about the offseason and navigating this new world of college athletics as we talked about point one was retaining Donalds hand TA checked back into the game Sanchez two for three at the line Melo not cooperating If they would have missed two free throws in a row the crowd would have got free shake shack Yeah thats right Free burgers got it last week Asamot for three That is no good Kathkys there for an offensive rebound and then lost it going to Central So the Eagles are guilty of bringing the ball down too quickly and letting Central Connecticut affect their offensive rebound Offensive rebounds have been all Eagles They just havent converted Look for Coach Grant to make that adjustment Point of emphasis at halftime Eagles have six offensive rebounds so far yet to score except for one on Hastings dunk Thats one for five Threepointer Sanchez Thats good Melo Sanchez has five and Central is within two Thats what Sanchez does Shot over 40 D2 Hawaii Pacific Coach Sers chatted with us before the game that thats what he needs him to do 107 to go in the half Asam to answer He got it Jason Oamotto good threepoint shooter in his own right You see back up to a fivepoint game James Jones finds Smith on the drive and the bucket and the foul Smith is fearless Was a heck of a pass I believe it was Frasier that made the pass Going to see this is the three the last possession from Sanchez Nothing but nylon like its a natural And then heres the pass It was James Jones who dished it off and it was a nice play by Jones going for the traditional threepoint play One possession game Foul goes against Luca Taves And it is once again a twopoint game Neither team shooting the ball overly well Thats a big time answer though for Boston College They heard Fred Payne heard you He says No Eric I can make this shot Thats his second threepointer of the game matching his season total so far So back to five as now all of a sudden weve traded threepoint possessions here Central Connecticut Im Patrick Cells Im staying in that zone till the Eagles prove they can hit from the outside Inside Frasier fouled and Frasier with 15 on the timer 233 to go in the half Hand was late there Good call by the officials Nice pass by Central get the ball into the paint music First foul goes against Donald Hand Its the sixth foul on Boston College in the half Max Frasier 0 for two from the line to start the season cheering Crowds hungry partner They want those free hamburgers No cheering Thats one as Spanelli comes back in along with Elijah Parker Central is three for five from the foul line to start this game Lets see if Central picks up full court The last shot of the half So Max Frasier with his first point Coach Grant choosing not to use his loser to use it Timeout coach So Taves in 20 seconds to go in the half The Eagles are up by four on Central Connecticut Austin College 33 from the floor Central 32 They have one more foul They have one more foul to give Thatll hurt their fouls per game ratio but they have it Smart play Just take them out of the rhythm And I Is that the fifth That is or the six by Thats the fifth foul on Central Connecticut It is the second Look for them to do that again Partner on Elijah Parker There it is There it is The other foul As you saw there coming up at the half our ACC Network studio crew gives you a preview of this 2025 2026 season Well have highlights and stats as well That one on Spinelli So now BC moves with seven on the timer here at the end of the half Its Fred Pay in the hot hand right now Too strong from three Two seconds to go and a Heave is closer than the experts thought there from free throws Yeah they got to the foul line during that opening sequence four times We music said Hey Central Connecticut never foul us Theyre already there four times So that was it over the course of that first half So 30 to 26 as we restart here Second half from Kanti Starting lineup back on the floor and its Donald Tan for three No good Rebound though Fred Payne with a good efforts He has eight which ties his season high Payne played well at the end of the first half Picking right up where he left off Hastings kept the ball alive though That motor is strong Partner Its been a different guy every game for Boston College so far And thats a credit to their depth Coach Brandt in the last game after Sidel and pressor said he feels hes got eight starters The rules only allow him to start five Thats right Close quote Jay Rogers six to shoot for Central Connecticut working against Forte Got him up in the air That is out of bounds It will stay here but just half a second remaining on the shot clock Well this will be an interesting one Uh5 just need a tip Hastings you see on the replay kept that alive so Payne could get the easy deuce Jacobe Williams will inbound Got to get it out I do not think they got that off They did not Again that five thats got to be to the rim and a tip And he had a step or just catch and straight up Good job for the effort on Central Connecticut Eagles use a little false action into the horn set Fred Paynes got the hot hand right now Thats 11 for Fred Payne First to the double figures Great play by the Eagles right there Payne is hot They ran a false action which is just to Central asleep double corn horn set which is two ball screen two screens up high Pay knocking it down Jay Rogers hoisting in the alleyoop Good find Max Frasier on the other end of it He has three Frasier sneaking behind the Eagles defense Great finds by Rogers What was coachs quote Hes an adult on the court Jay Rogers the senior he missed 55 consecutive games after he went down in December of 23 Theres Shaw with another for Boston College made by play was made by Hastings His pass I might add Hastings active to start the second half the same way he started the game So Jaden Hastings six points four rebounds two assists today That twopointer is no good from Jacobe Williams So you and I are just sitting here so we could have all the answers My recommendation for the Eagles is keep Hastings on the court Hes been solid so far and Boston College has built the lead back to nine 72 start to the second half for BC Donald Han from the elbow Hand is good again That mature exploration dribble defender just bounced off him Hands weight room activity paying off for him right there McDonald hand has six Theres Smith at the rim and he gets the friendly roll 10 points for Darren Smith Darren Smiths going to be a handful in the NEC First time zone of the second half for Central Darren Smith NEC all rookie team last year Fred Payne Nice catch to keep it going And a head fake over to Hand driving with 10 on the timer Donald Tan cant get the friendly roll Hastings got a piece Eagles tap it out Forte is short Those are the quick ones we were chatting about or I was chatting about Seen a couple of those possession where the Eagles got a few offensive rebounds Couldnt get anything to go And theres the rebound James Jones Thats why to Smith Smith for three No Tap back by Jones No Frasier No Frasier No Frasier Yes Down goes Frasier partner Frasier doing his impersonation with Moses Malone panning the offensive rebounding stats But all happened by Jones Keep the ball alive Thats why hes averaging 95 rebounds Very impressed by the Blue Devils Coach Sers has to be pleased So that was what that was three chances on one end for BC Didnt go Five on the other end for Central That is blocked by Frasier That is out of bounds And that is our timeout and then the crowd here today Pleasure to be with you Appreciate you joining us here on this Veterans Day Tuesday I wear out my text on Veterans Day partner All my friends and family that have served I hit them with a little text to thank them as you should Thank you 3932 is our score Austin College the lead over Central Connecticut And Jay Rogers finds James Jones whos short from three So you know the threepoint shot Central Connecticut four of 17 Boston College 5 for 21 though they have made a few more here in this second half Forte that is one of them Assist by Payne Good ball reversal by the Eagles Eagles picking up full court Payne playing with a little bit more confidence today 11 points three assists three rebounds for the Boston College red shirt sophomore I didnt want to talk all over your partner but that would be a headache for me if Forte laughter if Forte was guarding me bringing the ball up the court That was Spinelli whos the one tasked with it I would have a headache You see look at that nice hand Excuse me Pay looked away set him up Nice pass for three And the foul called on the pass Aiden Shaw could call He held him Easy one foul on Shaw And you cant foul your big guy out in the middle of the court like that where everybody could see I mean the ref the ref doesnt even charge for that one It was so easy to call It was so easy that Coach Grant didnt even argue Yeah that thats when you know right Theres a cross music pass and ITS SANCHEZ WHO is good Sanchez interesting story I mean you mentioned a little bit Started at Hawaii Pacific He was seventh in division 2 in threepoint percentage at 46 as a freshman Went to Arkansas Hes kind of banged up in the summer missed the beginning of the year and he just never really got in the rotation Comes here now to Central Connecticut trying to find a new home as a senior Donald Han on the other end Thats no good But your guy Hastings with a rebound Hastings is a beast if youre allowed to say that on the air I know he just did He is gobbling up rebounds And Melo Sanchez had nothing to do but foul him And youll see Sanchez right here Coach Sers chatted with us before the game He expects him to have a big season Hes got a lot to his game as you mentioned just last year Wasnt in the rotation because of his injury Then youll see Hastings just gobbling a rebound Sanchez I just got to foul him to prevent the poster dunk Can you speak to that a little bit as a coach Right I think sometimes fans might hear well hes out at the beginning of the season but why does that affect the whole year But when youre going into a new place and you miss that training camp that early season stuff that that really puts you behind the ball great Yes it does So you never catch up as everybodys getting in shape And think about your routine You have your routine right like players get comfortable The word they use is trust So you you trust the rotation you trust the lineup and if Sanchez is not 100 Then he tries to come back too quick cuz he sees these guys are ahead of him and its just trickled down and it didnt end well But in with the portal he just goes and finds another home That is off the hands of Sanchez out of bounds Boston College gets it back So were going to get a text right now from Melos family because ever since we compliment him and hes fouled hes turned it over Sorry Melo We still think youre going to have a great year in the NEC for coach Sers He has eight points today Boston College has the ball back Up by nine Heres Forte Thats a three and that is no good Hastings nearly had another rebound but its eventually pulled down by Jade Mott Hastings got away with the foul Jaden Mott is 100 correct Spinelli wild shot Mott comes flying in Actually got a chance at it Couldnt finish at the rim and Fred Payne on the run The euro and the foul Correct me if Im wrong partner These free throws would be the Eagles largest lead of the evening I believe Square it They led by 11 earlier in this second half They have a chance to get back there Good start here to the second Heres Payne on the drive Hes music played very well Payne since the midway point of the first half And thats what the Eagles need Shoot the ball extremely efficiently in the first couple of games right Four for 18 from the floor two of 11 for three to start Averaged seven points a game last year Played 30 He had been a pretty good you know his numbers would look better He went a little bit cold from behind the arc at the end of last season He missed his last 14 threes Otherwise he would have been over 40 for the year But I think the big thing which we talked about a little bit earlier as Luca Taves come back and we saw him a little bit in the first half Payne can kind of play more of his natural spot rather than having to be the backup one Correct He could be a catch and shoot guy He missed the free throw there which was the first Eagles miss of the game But hes got a lot to him This Mr Payne nice pass inside Hastings better defense though But Ill actually call the foul on Hastings Little late but accurate Crowds not happy Youll see on the replay Going to the rack You see what happens when you jump in the restricted circle and your body doesnt go straight up Its an automatic foul Its a point of emphasis Thats what officials are sharing with Hastings right now on the court Its Its actually an easy call and thats because of the restricted circle And the crowd theyre happy They should be happy to get a chance for more hamburgers And that is no good from Jaden Mott Jaden Mott who started his career at Northern Illinois last year 29 games averaged about 11 minutes a game before coming here as a sophomore native of Oklahoma Jaden Mott could be very popular in Chestnut Hill if he misses this free throw cheering cheering He got it And the greatest thing about that the players just think theyre boo They dont understand a promotion Its wonderful So he concentrates better Reverse psychology if you will Boston College retains 45 to 36 the lead Its taken away Elijah Parker couldnt finish though What a good defensive stand by Forte Redonovich finds it around Four Blue Devils on the rebound Should have numbers here Forte on the run trying to find the trailer Its Rodonovich Couldnt finish Now Central did a pretty good job getting back there And the threepointer from Sanchez is good I mean it was oneon four down here and they managed to get back and there was never the trailer that you mentioned Bookmark that missed layup three Fivepoint swing That was a big time moment potentially Difference between 11 points and a sixpoint game Blue Devils staying in his zone Reddanovich bobbled the handle a touch so couldnt take the three Instead he finds Fred Payne Rebound to Hastings and out of bounds applause If Hastings was more involved in passing hed be on his way to a triple double He got another rebound right there And then the foul goes against Mott Thats his second Hastings up to eight points seven rebounds couple of assists as well Eagles retain possession Aki comes back in for Hastings for now Got a chance and kicks Extra pass Rodonovich short Great possession by the Eagles Did an extra pass the other way on the run out Parker cant hit Nice defense there by Rodonovich Centrals doing a really good job getting back Felt like there was a few times the Eagles had a chance to run They hadnt been able to Kathy does score there His first two points of the game And to your point partner Patrick S said to us transition defense is going to be a key for his club Well when I asked him what he has to do to win which I ask every coach he he gave me the high roll Its tall order He said 12 to shoot for Central They are hanging tough here today Parker drives against a double team and Elijah Parker has the new careerhigh More points for Parker in 8 minutes Local product played at Holy Cross High School in Waterberry and for the legendary Jerry Quinn at St Thomas Moore also in Connecticut Another 1600 points in high school Three time all state selection Heres Forte driving Forte at the rim He scores Its like sneaky smooth And there he is Mr Defense getting a steal So important to this Eagles team Taken back away but it ends up finding Payne whos blocked by Ashley Forte has it now And Forte strong Pay a rebound It goes to Shaw frantic sequence inside Shot cant hit Those are the ones those offensive rebounds the Eagles need to gather and either go back up strong or kick it out Thats haunted them all evening I mean you know if you want to put a stat on it 12 offensive rebounds for Boston College Just nine second chance points Thank you for supporting my point We make a great team SANCHEZ IS GOOD Melo Sanchez coming to life in the second half So thats another fivepoint swing partner to cut it to five Coach Grant not waiting for the media timeout Fast forward a year Its been what more than a full year since hes really been in the flow of playing every day Thats an adjustment as well and hes done a really nice job so far today Donald Han big one for BC if they can have it Its not there And Max Frasier finds a rebound We talked about this early when coach Sers called timeout Coach Grant called timeout Drew up a good play Hand just couldnt knock down the shot Heres Rogers against Capki ROGERS LEFT ROGERS GOOD WOW He was very confident on that one They got the ball to the middle of the court and felt like they had a mismatch with Kapi and he went right at music him This is a threepoint basketball game with 925 remaining in the second half from Kanti Donald Hans gives it off from Fortech with 14 to shoot for Boston College Eagles are just two of their last 11 from the floor Hand with a big time shot Cool hand Mr Payne Mr Hand getting it done Donald Hand again we we talked about it last game too Kind of willing his way point production wise is up to nine points in todays game just four of 13 from the floor That was his first three in eight tries Sanchez driving the lane is fouled So what happened on that Connecticut Sanchez leading the way with 14 for Central Connecticut Fred Pay with 12 for Boston College See what chess match is happening now Each coach coming out after timeout Eagles in manto man 10 to shoot music for Central Connecticut Its Max Frasier who kicks for Smith Extra pass Smith moving and he scores Its nicely done Darren Smith has 12 Great job with the shot fake going inside the threepoint line Totally under control Central Connecticut once again within four 5248 on a day where neither team has shot the ball great Central is up to 38 for the game Boston College just 33 Tap key to his left is blocked by Frasier Carrick after the timeout Blue Devils came in manto man And Frasier now at the other end ditches it off for Jones Skips around for Sanchez Hes got another MELO SANCHEZ WITH 17 cheering I know one thing You do not want to leave that young man open screaming It is a onepoint game Hand on the drive Donald Ham THROWS UP A WILD SHOT THAT GOES IN How about that Veteran getting it done English off the backboard Something 11 points for Donald Han BC once again leads by three Centrals made five shots in a row from the floor Hands worked very hard for every one of his points Frziers got a mismatch inside He takes advantage of it cheering Eagles have no answer for the Blue Devils defensively the past five minutes Six for their last six from the floor Donald Han trying to heat up on the Boston College side A onepoint game It is TAKEN AWAY BY JAY ROGERS Sanchez on the run ROGERS A LOB AND FRASIER GETS IT TO GO CENTRAL CONNECTICUT LEADS First lead of the game for the Blue Devils cheering Energized group from New Britain 630 left and the Blue Devils lead by one Where does Boston College go to find their offense with 10 to shoot Forte step back three is no good Shaw got a piece of the rebound but its finds its way to Jones on the run and Jones cant finish at the rim Eagles need to have the ball move Its been sticking and there is an offensive foul They were out of sorts that whole sequence just like you said Capy is called for the foul Two sequences in a row partner Even the sequence before that led led to the run out the first two minutes of the half His team has responded well Well its another late test early in the season here for Boston College with under six minutes to go A onepoint lead for Central Connecticut This by the way is the first lead of the game for Central Connecticut Comes right here with 543 to go James Jones eight to shoot Comes inside knocked away BC ball Great defense by hand like having Hastings back in the game Good adjustment by Coach Grant at the last time out Hastings just impacts winning Youll see right here Replay Youre going to see good defense by hand I mean weve weve called his name so many times tonight Shaw inside for Forte Had a little space trying to find an outlet Comes around for Donald It is no good from three Big offensive rebound for Payne held ball Possession goes to Central Connecticut That was a better possession for the Eagles cuz they got the ball It was reversed cuz the guard was inside in Forte but inside outside ball reversal action They got an offensive rebound out of it as well Just couldnt get it to convert Theres the offensive rebound that you talked about and then the held ball Right And that was the second offensive rebound Eric So good possession by the Eagles Just got didnt get rewarded with the hoop Eagles put a bit of pressure on They have not scored in almost two and a half minutes Parker the freshman A chance for Frasier and a skip pass over for Smith with eight to shoot Smith falling away Smith cant hit But what a rebound by Parker Wave off the shot Foul is on the floor Parkers going to get rewarded his effort Drew the foul He came a long way for that Good defense by Shaw here on Smith Tough shot She made him hitch Then you see the rebound attempt by Parker Just a great play The foul goes against Chase Forte Just his first foul Interesting Forts out Taves is in Under five minutes to go Still a onepoint lead Hastings backs off Nearly taken away Sanchez finds it Always looking for a behind the back pass Couldnt complete it Brent Kane is wide open and Boston College has the lead back Thats why coaches tell you to have your hands up Sanchez was trying to do a highlight reel It reversed him Nice steal by the Eagles Can Central answer now in a onepoint game Frasier didnt know it was coming Hastings cheering takes it away and then a foul is called on Frasier Hastings just impacts winning Dont take that young man out Coach Grant Hes getting it done So lets watch these two sequences in a row See hands up Who is that man Hastings like Michael Parsons on a blitz partner You cant throw the ball over him I mean the the thing about that play for Sanchez and you get what hes doing You got a really good look at it And then heres the other takeaway by Hastings the the guy was open behind him so hes trying to get that ball out so quickly but he goes behind the back with it And as you said when you have someone as big as Hastings 69 in the way he makes that play And I think its Sanchez defense with a late shot clock Mhm But Im hes my hero so far I love the way Sanchez is playing in this game 18 to shoot 405 to go Boston College by one against Central Connecticut Heres Luca Taves Finds Donald Hand Did not have the catch And its Parker who takes it away Parker is fouled Good And these are Mr Parkers first collegiate free throws Big ones Freshman from Waterberry Connecticut ties the basketball game with 351 to go He played just five minutes against Quinnipic in the last game He is playing massive minutes right now One of two at the foul line We have a tie game with 345 to go here in the second half Its Fred Payne for Hastings Donald Han for three No good Donald Hand is one of 10 from behind the arc tonight If youre a coach you tell your team theres seven possessions left You need to win three on offense and three on defense for the victory Central playing for the lead again Parker its knocked away by Aiden Shaw Parker got it right back 10 to shoot Smith hand off Jones deep into the timer Jones to work JONES FALLING AWAY JONES GIVES CENTRAL THE LEAD Big time possession taking a shot clock all the way down now to six possessions left Twopoint lead Taves drives kicks for hand foot on the line shot no good Again all game its the quick shots Look for the Blue Devils take another long possession taking it all the way down like they did last possession to isolate where they believe is a mismatch 232 to go and a timeout called by Patrick Cardards Central Connecticut has good FIU team and this case theyve gone not cold theyve gone ice cold defensively Some of it as we talked about all game at Nauseium Its a little shooting a little too quick Some of it is Centrals great defense Jay Rogers against Luca Taves Rogers from the elbow was short with one on the timer Good design but it doesnt go and and thats what Centrals doing Just isolate in the middle of the floor late in the possession Taves again out there in a big moment as the point guard Donald Han skip pass for Fred Payne Hes been the hot hand today for BC and Payne cheering scores and the foul Wow that was the finish of the game That was a big time finish by Mr Payne Not to be denied We talk about the ball reversal There it is Payne just going repelling players Surprised he didnt pose with his fist Thats weight room shot right there Determination And he makes the free throw What a great game for Fred Payne 17 points is one shy of a careerhigh And Boston College has the lead back by one with under two minutes to go That play by Payne couldnt have come at a more opportune time for the Eagles cheering Central has answered every time late in this game Can they do it again Well we know what theyre going to do Theyre going to isolate in the middle of the court Partner Rogers driving against Taves Has to give it up Frasier against Hastings No good But an offensive rebound SMITH HE CANT FINISH OH I thought he had a lane but he waited and BC got there defensively Coach look Coach Cell is imploring his team to play five and guard the possession And an offensive foul CENTRAL HAS IT BACK WITH 115 LEFT Moving screen on Aiden Shaw I believe is what the call was Wow In this second half 17 for the game to lead Central Kane has 17 to lead Boston College So 110 to go BC up by one Central Connecticut with the ball Its Sanchez on it now Here is James Jones against Donald defensively Final minute from Ki forum Rogers cheering against TA TA getting the big minutes late at point guard Heres a drive Its Jones WHAT A MOVE BUT HASTINGS BLOCKED HIM Who is that man What a difference Hastings has made since hes reentered the game in the second half As you mentioned partner very interesting that Chase Forte has not seen the court in the last four minutes And theyve gone with Taves right now Theres the block from Jaden Hastings cheering 34 on the shot clock Rogers the inbounder Threepointer was much too strong but an offensive rebound Smith HE HAD A CHANCE BUT cant hit Excellent defense by Boston College 15 seconds essentially between a game and a shot clock Look for the Eagles to have a long possession So they give Sanchez a chance It was well off And the second time Darren Smith actually does get an offensive rebound of the Eagles preventive finish by one with 42 seconds Coach Cos has a foul to give Lets see how they do it Coach Grant calls timeout to make sure everybodys aware of the situation So all of a sudden after all of that good offense from Central Connecticut they are now one for their last nine from the floor down between Payne Hastings and Shaw Another five for Boston College and Luca Taves in his first game of the year is the one running the point late 70 to shoot inside Hastings The action you can see it but the foul was called before the shot Thats the one to give You see nobodys even arguing on on Central That was the one to give He saw the action Good action by Coach Grans club off the ball screen Given what hes done now is hes revealed what the Eagles play was out of that timeout We did roll reversal You stepped over me I was going to get to that part Yes thats exactly what he did Coach Grant will have a second play set up here Theyve loaded their best out of bounds under play Taves inbounds for Hastings Reset to 20 BC by one Thats 10second difference game and shot clock Heres hand Double hitand is no good Rebound Central 17 seconds remaining And a timeout by Central Connecticut Elo Sanchez will inbound 134 to go Central Connecticut is down by one Theyre one of their last nine from the floor Frasier against Hastings 6 seconds Smith on the drive SMITH TO THE BUCKET SMITH SCORES WITH 32 TO GO BC will play out HAM GOT TO GET IT OFF HAM FOR IN NO GOOD CENTRAL CONNECTICUT HAS COME TO KANTI AND STUNNED Mos College
