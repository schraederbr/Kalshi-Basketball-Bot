with a little basketball and Mac and I count it our pleasure to carry you through this journey We are ready to tip Queens freshly minted into division one It became official in July and now they tangle with UVA First possession to the hoops Both teams trying to bounce back from a loss Virginia That first set back coming to close out the Greenbryer this past weekend at the hands of Butler Ditter FROM DOWNTOWN RIGHT AWAY PICKING UP WHERE he left off in that tournament Theres no question this guy is one of the best in the country You mentioned Ashby Heres the surrounding cast for Queens A starting five for the Royals You highlight Watford there too Player of the year out of the Palmetto State is a big part of what they do Its Parker taking the first look and he draws contact underneath Yeah Queens wants to get up and down the floor also They they want a big number of possessions Theyd like to get between 70 and 80 offensive possessions and their offense is very unique All based on reads whatever the defense does you do something different Well what did coach Grant Leonard tell us The one thing we have to make sure of is Virginia doesnt have 48 to 50 second chances We want to make sure we make it one and done on some of those trips down the floor One was enough that time around First point for Queens coming from the charity stripe and belongs to Parker cheering from the Georgia Southern transfer Long arm You got to look at Grant Leonard there You notice very festive head coach of the Queens Royals Yeah there theres some background to that turkey sweater and well get into that later on Turkey sweater will give way to the Christmas sweater soon enough but hell be easy to spot inside JPJ this afternoon You see Queens play good defense but but really trying to get in those gaps and stop dribble penetration Good movement for the Whos Thomas will try it from where Ditter was successful This ones off the mark Battling to put it back There were those second and third chances but Queens still comes away with the basketball You see a lot of open middle for Queens Nobody in the lane allowing back cuts and drives Virginia does something very similar Cleared away to the hoose Identical starting five for UVA coach Yeah same ones Holland Thomas at the guards Lewis at that small forward and Ditter and of course the man in the middle grew low And plenty of size in the interior for this Virginia squad Lot of work being done for the perimeter though And heres more of it How about Virginia First couple of buckets coming from threepoint land Lewis this time around Yeah Ryan ODM has almost an embarrassment of riches when it comes to people who can score the basketball Well this team that is taking a lot more threes the threepoint attempts up cheering from the pace and style a season ago Who would have dreamed we would be talking about a Virginia basketball team with 80 plus per contest Both these teams come in averaging 80 plus So you can expect it to be up and down the floor at times today Yeah the players have adjusted quickly Im not sure about the fans yet Well they got used to watching a certain brand and served them well but um Ill be pleased with what theyve seen from this team through the first six contests Yeah And and and we joke but it it really is an adjustment to to what constitutes good basketball And you can play good basketball a lot of different ways cheering Theres the first year head coach of the Cavaliers You know he at one time in the division 2 ranks was in the conference from whence Queens came So theres familiarity between these two head coaches as well Sure Lenor Ryan and Queens and the I think it was SIAC Coach Leonard was an assistant at that point in time Hes been with the the Queens program quite a while And Ryan ODM whos been a winner at every stop along the way You know the basketball pedigree his father one of the best to do it in the ACC all time From the corner another three Its Sam Lewis again What a start for Virginia from beyond the arc Yeah Queens went to the 131 zone One place thats really vulnerable is in the corners and Lewis made them pay again Well you know the task when you enter a building like this in these early season nonconference contests for a team like Queens its the need to hang around possessions like this will help Nice put back from man and hes an emerging player coach Yeah the transfer from McNe State Of course his brother plays right in town for the Charlotte Hornets Yeah the Queen City connection is there Lets look back at the Virginia possession a moment ago The second of the Lewis threes Yeah good ball movement out of a trap quick ball reversal inside out All the things you want in a wideopen threepoint shot right there in one possession Yeah and the sharing of the basketball something youve talked a lot about You see Grunlo do a very nice job there on the kick out This is a very unselfish team as all of Brian ODMs teams have been Nice stop and pop just over the top from Malikite Thomas who gets in the score Queens wants to go fast but Virginias defense has been very solid in the half court Gave up that offensive rebound that last time though A little out of control here and its gathered up by Lewis whos always looking to push Well ran into too many of those Queens defenders there cheering All good The Ritter right where he needed to be Solid turnaround You know sometimes you can run out of the double team Thats fine But you cannot leave the best player on the floor unguarded The Ritter the thing you notice about him across the first handful of games a guy who can score from anywhere coach You really can so talented strong mature and and all that unselfish despite the fact that hes averaging 17 and a half points a game Such a huge part of what Virginias been able to do in this opening sprint of the new campaign Ashby player of the year tried to dump it off Coach told you coming in hes the a selection cheering for the preseason player of the year This is the other thing Virginia has done very well Yet another block effective showing you on both ends of the floor how good he can be Yeah thats back of the board Quick start for the Whos much of it from be intentionally held back simply to provide a spark when he enters and two on the floor grabs everybodys attention inside JPJ Yeah and starting is one thing but the minutes you play is is the main thing And and he is earning more minutes all the time number two in the ACC in scoring among those who are not starting Mallerie on the floor Virginia off to a quick start from beyond the ark Three out of five while Queens is 0 for four Now Queens has put a couple back in but uh four second chance points but Virginia hadnt missed enough to have many second shot opportunities so far Handful of new faces for Virginia alongside Mallerie who takes it down the left side Now back out top He goes with it Three working well for Der Everyone else for that matter right now He started it and he has the latest Yeah And Mallalerie made that play driving into the lane flattening out the defense and found the best player at the top of the key wide open Four out of six now from three This is textbook stuff Dribble to the lane see the defense flatten out and they cant get back in time to contest the shot from Der Well Mallerie right into the game Mallerie right into the book in terms of an assist there Coach you talked about how well they share the basketball You love the way he distributes it Yeah and and again he just fits the style of play Hes outstanding at picking up fullourt pressure in the basketball He can penetrate and create for others but if you leave him open hell knock down that three himself A reset for Queens Five gone and a doubledigit lead already in effect for UVA Jay Brilliant now for Queens coming off a big game 16 and seven against Ferman Led the way against the Ferman Paladins in that contest in Greenville South Carolina Here is Der and he cheering again just beautiful sharing of the basketball Lewis could have taken that all the way saw Ditter running hard and hit that seam pass for a perfect layup Boy working in unison this Virginia squad out to an 185 sprint to begin things Talked about the efficiency There you see it Parker just able to get that beyond the attempted block No foul call and the Hooser back up the floor with it Mallerie with quick pace somehow cleared the basketball out of there that gets caught Change coming in the fast break Not a lot of room there but a really nice pass And Ditter certainly knows how to finish And plenty of credit to Lewis Plenty of credit to the way this team has started with everyone a contributor to this point Here comes Queens Yeah Der does all those other things too runs the floor goes to the offensive glass can guard multiple positions Wellrounded player experience beyond his years in terms of his classification because of all the international experience he brings to the table Yeah thats thats a whole different level of freshman right there Yes it is cheering traveling violation that will stand as a turnover When it comes to straight turnovers coach this a Queens team their last couple of times out really limiting the turnovers He was very proud of the way his team protected the basketball of late Yeah and coach Leonard said that was going to be big here this afternoon and it will be as the game goes on Now we referenced that sweater He told us his wife challenged his holiday spirit at one point He had to go out start gathering up the Christmas sweaters for use and now hes added Thanksgiving to the equation White tries a three and thatll rim out But he said from here the rest of the way going to be Christmas sweaters following this Thanksgiving weekend So thats quite the answer to your wifes saying you didnt have a good holiday commitment Well and its caught on there in Charlotte because people are now sending him sweaters Exactly And the staff is involved too Hell have a couple of games where everyone will be wearing one of those holiday sweaters but its become the trademark for Grant Leonard a handful of seasons in and hes overseen the lift to division one and they did it the right way coach Kind of incrementally working their way into the division one rank Done Outstanding Of course last year got to play in postseason and this year like you mentioned at the top picked to win the AON in their first year of NCAA eligibility speaks to whats being built there in Charlotte North Carolina Three to shoot cheering Corner had been kind to Virginia to this point That connects with the rim and preserves the possession Yeah the offensive rebound is something theyve done better than anybody in the country Down to four again This time the rebound away to the Royals Theyll try a corner three SAME RESULT HERE YOU SAID IT JAM was a guy who really came in provided quite the energy they needed in a sprint back from behind against a Ferman team that this Queen squad came up short against the last time out Yeah missed some time early but uh but had the big game against Ferman It shoots nearly 50 from long range Its another of those guys not always in the starting unit but much like we talked about with Mallerie for Virginia when hes on the floor a difference maker Jamreel he might be getting in that starting unit if hes playing so well gathered up but the pesky hands speaking of Mallerie make the difference Yeah blocking shots on the Enso and Gruno have both been outstanding Valerie will try one Hand in his face Doesnt matter cheering Yeah thats what I mean Really good skills You watch him shoot the basketball Hes amazing Of course he scored like a million points over at Stab right nearby Less than a mile away cheering for a journey His story is being written Hell try one How about it Nine with backtoback games at least carrying over from his last time out Okay the Canadian giving coach Leonard a big lift of Ontario a guy who played in all 35 of them last season for Queens And to believe that wont be the case again And heres Mallerie slicing through Tillis gives it back Mallers direction cheering Well how about this shot WONT COME AWAY with a fruitful possession but Virginia getting everybody involved Heres Ashby Havent heard a lot from him so far Tried to change it with a three Wont go Virginias done a good job of locating Ashby and hes got no open looks as a result No points thus far for the team leader Wholesale changes standing by Three Cavaliers a couple of Royals waiting to come in And boy the three proving kind on both ends of the floor here And thats one of the main weapons for Queens as well as you can see the use of Larson there Yeah they love the three Gus Larson stepping out All their bigs can step away from the basket and shoot Well training them from one end of the floor to the other And a guy you like a whole bunch Oh Deon Tillis is so skilled A winner from Cal Irvine I think hes going to have a big impact Has missed some early in the season with a little procedure but uh is just out getting his game legs back under him Perfect touch on the other end as the teams trade buckets for now Cavaliers built that early advantage find themselves still out front but only by eight now Inside single digits all of the sudden tried another long one Not a good look created a little space Mallerie got a bad matchup right there with Yav Burman Whistle before it worked its way to Burman Well go to break on the foul call How about the three ball Yeah it its such a great equalizer You see Mallalerie on one end On the other end the big guy steps out Larson Back and forth music we go partner 25 Yeah normally thats a fouryear probation period They waved the last year for them so theyre eligible this year but were able to play in postseason last year in the CBI and they were a really traditionally good division 2 program and they have just taken that and built on it and coach Leonard is a a big big part of why theyre where theyre at today being picked to win the ASON in their very first year of eligibility Spent some time in the South Atlantic Conference and in Conference Carolina during their time in the Division 2 ranks But you said a team coming in as the favorite in their first fully available postseason wise campaign All that experience in the ASON tournament making it the last couple of years and certainly the postseason experience as you said coach tremendously valuable Thomas slows it up Why not Rims out Battle for it and itll be the Royals Queens has done a nice job of getting back against that fast break somewhat out of control there but Jarrell maintained possession cheering Well a timeout on the floor will take it as well Virginia still out front in the first half music music talking about from the fans perspective Now weve established that while we werent there in 1906 the first ever game played a different basketball game back then Yeah I was young back then 30 points total scored by Virginia in a win over the Charlottesville YMCA So certainly the game has changed and the pace Virginias playing has changed Its to the liking of fans so far at a five in one start Take away by Queens What have you been impressed with by the Royals so far Well they get back Uh theyre theyre battling on the boards Um but also that was the very first turnover for Virginia coming with just over seven and a half remaining And Cavaliers answer with a basket to extend the lead a bit here Had the body language going on that time He was trying to will that thing in like a golfer correcting a slice Whatever it takes Closing in on seven minutes and the lead just crawling back to double digits here Theres Watford one talented freshman on this roster and hes going to get a chance for an and one Yeah player of the year high school player of the year from Lancaster South Carolina He was on a state championship team that lost just one game all season You see his skills here Yeah the quickness Uh Ditters a good defender on the perimeter but uh he wasnt quick enough to stay in front of Watford that time Watford had 14 the last time out on Sunday in that game against Ferman in his home state and he scored 13 of those 14 in the second half So cheering heated up down the stretch that go round Yeah Kind of about a 21 assist to turnover ratio and big long 65 point guard Oh and you get immediate playing time in that true freshman campaign Hell grab some attention around the Aon and beyond Now they are not letting Virginia run off and hide just yet coach No uh battling on defense Theyre athletic They got size and they have they have a winning tradition in this program like weve mentioned Burman a foul collected out top Mallerie back in as Mallerie comes back into the contest Youre right Little bit of a breather coming for Talon Boy Mallerie he doesnt have to find a gear when he hits the floor Hes already in it right Yeah hes wide open all the time And that time he was wide open for a three Works out immediate impact working back into rhythm And now Virginia theyve matched that total from that first ever contest back in 1906 30 on the board for the Whos and theyre up 11 trying to find some type of window and it was denied by Der attempted to go through all the big guys inside and it rolls right off the rim Mallerie somehow gathers that up Havent heard much from Thomas today Second leading scoreer for the Cavs The Ritter using his length but he found the front of the iron Theres Lewis He had a couple of big threes in the early going Speaking of Thomas ball in his hands Five to shoot as he windmills through there and draws contact again baseline drive kicking it back out Spot up and D Ritter with the assist Usually its the other way around And that was Mallerie with the bucket seconds after he came back in to the contest a moment ago Thomas to the line You see his point total leading the way Still looking for some here Reminder the third annual ACC SEC mens basketball music challenge happening next week Tuesdays double header Oklahoma Wake Forest Thats at 7 Then Georgia Florida State And Wednesday BC host LSU followed by Mississippi State Georgia Tech Both those games on the ACC network You can also stream them on the ESPN app Think theres going to be some good matchups Of course last year SEC dominated the challenge 142 I can almost guarantee you thats not going to be anywhere close to what it was a year ago Well you think about what the SEC became at tournament time last year And of course Florida in the end claiming the title for the Southeastern Conference ACC looking to make some waves Perhaps a statement next week Going to be a lot of fun when those teams tangle The three was going down at will early Been a little tougher of late Tell you what Virginia threw the ball ahead to Lewis and that was some great defense by Chris Ashby talked about his shooting ability but full court with a guy coming at you full speed he was able to seal him off and stay in front of him and make Virginia take a a longer shot later in the possession 20 to work with as they inbound Cavaliers still 42 from beyond the arc Well try and raise that They will Bruno taking care of that piece of business What a weapon Take the other team center away from the basket They generally are not good defenders out there and Gruno with a couple of threes here in the first half 45 from beyond the arc for Virginia in real time And how about holding Queens to 30 in that department right now 30 from beyond the arc One of the differences in this game is Virginia tries to pull away cheering Plenty of energy down the right side And theres Thomas He can shoot but he can score more than shoot He knows how to get it in the basket Virginia out Four for 11 but nine for 20 You wonder why they take twice as many threes as twos tonight You factor in the one free throw there to get to Virginias total at this point Largest lead of the game at 17 Well as a result of a 90 run over the last 2 and 12 minutes Virginia having built this advantage after Queens had kept it inside single digits a good portion of this first half Yeah and theyve done a nice job with that on the defensive end The block some shots gave one gave one shot up only and no uh none of those second shots that Queens was getting early in the game Throwing a couple turnovers and you got a 17point lead Four and change remaining in the opening half And that rolled right off the leg of Jabril Now theyre going to say actually the whistle and a foul there So it looked like he lost it initially but they are going to whistle Thomas for the foul Yeah And speaking of turnovers Queens has done a pretty good job They only have six and Virginia only has the one still 16 minutes into the sec into the first half Well and speaking of one that is foul number one on Thomas And nobody for Virginia has gathered more than one at this point Good news for the Whos trying to make something happen Yeah Mallalerie with really good defense forced Ashby to take a bad shot Chabriel with his first miss from long range Well size wins out on the rebound and then theres too much on the backside of that as Parkers whistle for one So nobody for Virginia with with more than one whistle against them so far Barker not in that category He picks up his second for Queens Lewis going to get a breather here Virginia with a little bigger lineup now Derritter and Grunlow And now Tillis comes in at the three at 67 How do you like this combination I like it a lot A lot of matchup issues right here Plenty of window for Tillis Why not Hell join the threepoint party See why I like that lineup Always uh cheering like it a little better when it ends up on a trip like that Virginia runs it out to 3919 now up by 20 Theres a nice little screen to screener right there Sill with the wideopen look at the top Taken right away from Burman or he slammed on the brakes and they worked it all the way around the top of the key and eventually its Ditter taking it inside and drawing contact Yeah and thats a great example of the diversity of Ditter skills They make the extra pass Hes wide open shot fake and get it all the way to the rim drawing the contact You see where hes had a little bit of contact a little bit of Greenbryer damage there You see on his right eye comes with the territory He leads the way in this one 10 points looking for 11 but itll have to be on the shot forth standing when you talk about what the potential playoff scenarios hold So much to still be decided And uh some of that will be decided right here Well talk about that later on Sure will Well get there Its a big big weekend for the Commonwealth cheering Clash Speaking of bigs how about the work in the interior against Grunlow again who waits and puts it back Yeah eight points now Couple threes now a stick back Hes blocked a couple on the other end despite the trip to the charity stripe a moment ago Ditter with 10 Bruno Low with eight That duo has been impressive 18 of Virginias 41 Yeah this is a really good basketball team Still trying to find their way Theyre still learning a lot about themselves what combinations work And I think that the Greenbryer event I think gave them a lot of perspective Uh got a win and a loss Theyd rather had two wins but I think they learned a lot over there in Lewisburg The way they battled back in the Northwestern contest the exact result they want didnt quite end up that way with Butler ended up in some foul trouble and other things but they were battle tested and what the staff tell us they learned so much about who they are and its in those experiences they build for the future Yeah and and that that game went sort of just like uh they had in mind The the depth and in intensity wore the other team down eventually and they pull it out at the end We appreciate Griff Aldridge spending a little time with us pregame giving us some insight into whats going on with this team Always nice to get the perspective of the coaching staff particularly a bounceback moment like this Well tomorrow morning 1000 am Eastern ACC Huddle Crew Theyll be back here on the ACC Network and the allnew ESPN app OHill the location where you can find them And coach uh great deal of anticipation surrounding the prime time matchup here in the Commonwealth tomorrow night Yeah like we said a whole lot to be decided Whos of course looking to to work their way into ACC championship opportunity That doesnt even touch on the bragging rights that are on the line each time the Whos and the Hokes get together 214 remaining in this opening half Ditter I think gets his second foul May have to take a seat Looks like Well theyre going to send Hall to the scorers table Yeah And hell call for him And now the hooks go with the the Cavaliers You got got me thinking that Commonwealth clash on football The Cavs now go with a a smaller lineup with Tillis at the four and three guards out there with Tillis and Ano Nothing but the twine as Larson drops that one through Hell have another As Joe Dean used to say when the AD at LSU did a bunch of television on back in the early SEC days string music There it is Couldnt duplicate it So just the one on the front end takes Queens to the 20 threshold 131 zone gave Virginia a different look in their second turnover BOY HOW smooth was man down the lane that time and he lays it in and hell go to the line for more Now Maller with the foul down low on Enzo was trying to get the block up high and man with the opportunity for a threepoint play Talked about the Charlotte connection with his brother Trey is on the Hornets Hes coming off a 14point effort is Nir the last time out Mallerie will take a seat couple there just talked a moment ago about how the the fouls were spread out equally for Virginia and all of a sudden a couple picked up here and there Mallerie joining Ditter on the bench for the last couple minutes Not happy with that foul About 40 ft from the basket Well inside the final two minutes Watford picking up one here now music Theyre going to send Isaiah Henry another good looking freshman local product out of Charlotte North Carolina Henry working his way in there for Watford Its wide at the line Henry was a big time scorer in high school Gabriel I really like his game cheering Its like a great big two guard at 69 Has it in his hands once more Leaves through Still trying A relentless effort from Jabbr And now cheering Larson is going to earn the whistle Ball down low Anyo got that shot blocker in there He might defer to him bell He ends up going against Hall of first there and a couple coming for Larson Larsons actually shooting better from three than he is from the free throw line but he looked good on that one Larson drops in his fifth point of the contest started a pin ended up cheering ended up a cow and eventually Queens Theyre well traveled this day Found Charlotte to be his current home Minute 22 to play in the opening half Little matchup zone has confused Virginia here for a moment worked out for the Royals Back to back turnovers Good job to slice through Theres man again but couple of possessions of late where he has been really impressive Yeah he averages 14 and over six We hadnt seen much of that today but you see the talent Well certainly passes the eye test We talked about the pedigree basketballwise of his family pulls them a little closer here inside the final minute Another one of those corner threes And while it did not go down side of the backboard therell be a chance to get them another way Oh thats my golden rule Cant foul the jump shooter Its going to end up giving Tillis a major opportunity Here we were praising man and he goes and commits a bad foul right there from one end of the floor to the other How it can change and heres Tillis now with chance to really adjust things Yeah he shot 82 last season at Cal Irvine from the free throw line Of course 40 from the threepoint line too Good on the first Cavaliers with Gertrude standing by you saw ready to come into the contest Vert one of the few returnes on this team into the contest in place of Malik Thomas Now good on all three till its true from the charity strike takes the lead back to 20 cheering Shot clock down to seven an offensive board And man a little more time to work with than he thought maybe but it was the bounce back so far so good for UVA Coaching staff telling us that this week you could see right away in Tuesday practice that there was a fire in this team Theyll try to carry that over into the second half Yeah they they love the competitiveness they came out with on Tuesday after a day off on Monday Thomas see tried to get it started here in the second half but it rims out Nice execution He got a wideopen shot at the top Thomas with five He is two of six to this point in the contest Size has really bothered Queen down low Swagger How about that Swagger from beyond the arc Now heres a kid with some ACC connections Hes got a brother who is playing at Wake Forest They were at Valpo together a year ago He now at Queens in the state of North Carolina his brother at Wake in the ACC Yeah not not a big factor in that first half but but you describe him as a stretch four Thats what he does to step out and shoot that three and a first basket for Carson Swagger applause And who else for the answer right there Test the Ritter says Okay take away the three Ill get it to the rim and play through contact Love this guys game Not his first points of the contest The guy of course who led the way in that first half for UVA Derritter already sitting at 14 as he goes to the line Of course think about it Derritter getting it started from downtown and now doing good work from the interior here showing you his tremendous versatility 22 and a freshman right Yeah and the the free throw line has been the one thing that that has befuddled him so far Shooting about in the mid60s but uh boy its really picking at him to to find fault with that with the way hes done everything else Yeah youre right Two of five from there today but so much of the rest of his game true Heres a look at the freshman Jordan Watford puts that back The South Carolina player of the year who took his talents across the state line to Queens Malik Thomas has not really gotten going Two for six from the field You look back at those two trips down the floor theyre two very different freshman in college basketball right Both giving you a window into what they bring to the table Yeah Yeah Ditter with a a ton and years of international experience And then Watford coming straight out of Lancaster South Carolina Well just a little bit of touch needed there by Grunlow to finish it The two bigs get it done for UVA Yeah that they combined for 20 points and eight rebounds in that first half Everybody tangled up just below that Cavaliers logo Watford down the bottom of the Savers Yeah Hall does so many little things Some show up in the stat sheet like this assist but some dont He just has a I think coach Aldridge described it as a calming effect on this team Go back to Virginia Doubledigit assists in the first half and building on that already here Oh yeah Yeah That and thats who Ryan Om is and who his teams always will be His former team with a big win today with a victory over the instate rival Virginia Tech Hokes A solid win Uh led from start to finish The VCU Rams did And he led to some championship glory something that hes experienced at most of the stops along the way You know we should mention as Mauy of course comes back in here and that always grabs your attention You know Charlotte not a bad location for Ryan ODM right The connection there It was in Charlotte that he got that 16 over1 that Virginia fans may not want to think too much about initially Yeah weve avoided bringing that up but Im going to put a POSITIVE SPIN ON IT for you Theres a positive spin on it You know Virginia used the motivation from that moment to win the national championship and enjoy it for a couple of seasons the very next year And theyre still enjoying it here in Charlottesville as they should As they should That served as a catalyst for what was Virginias high water mark in the history of the program And Ryan ODM now wearing the right colors whose fans would tell you when it comes to what hes done with Virginia in the first six games of his tenure Going on seven here and leading at 5034 in early second half action down underneath Of course that bring that up because that happened you know in the Queen City So much ACC basketball connections to Queens And a lot of folks may have been wondering where did the Royals come from Right out of Charlotte to Charlottesville Youve got Queens youve got Davidson youve got Charlotte the 49ers youve got the Hornets and of course many NCAA games there Now much to enjoy including that one we referenced which will always stand as a positive ultimate outcome for UVA in the end How about this feed And Ditter gathers it up beautifully to provide the touch at the end Yeah another nice assist cheering Hermans a guy that has not gotten going for Queens solid player returnee Well there he is You know hes a guy Tel Aviv Talk about international experience Hes been on all the U teams the Israeli U teams over the way Another guy with plenty of international experience he brings to the table Back up the floor as Virginia answered quickly And in Burmans hands again hell try it from distance cheering Okay Burman averages 14 and four kind of plays like a big point forward cheering Just enough touch there Sprinllo swats it away Burman trying to find a shooting window And how about this Rainbows one home at the horn All we had to do was mention him to get going Huh Burman suddenly heating up making his presence known inside JPJ Hes the leading scorer right around 15 per game coming in experienced young sophomore Mentioned he was on those Israeli teams under 14 16 18 and 20 His experience Mallerie lost the handle but Ditter was right there Now whistle and a foul Heres that most recent threepoint basket for Queens Out and got under good pressure Shot clock going down Burman Bang Something special from a guy that was limited to six points no rebounds although he did have three assists his last time out Trying to become a factor here in the second half Seat a breather for Nir Man How about this from the corner Good execution on the baseline Out of bounds Shot it in rhythm Did Jakari White Well five of the last five for Virginia as they run their total to 57 Making the trips down the floor count or the whos right now Ashby still cant get it going Tillis pulling down an impressive board Just enough contact as Lewis trying to put it on the floor music Back to Charlottesville after the break Virginia up 5739 26 points eight rebounds four for four from beyond the arc Theyve done a little bit of everything You think they have a chance to be all freshman ACC Well and how good has that international connection that pipeline been This is the talent around the Atlantic Coast Conference in that vein Yeah so many good freshman but uh its hard to picture many playing better than these two And of course freshman takes on a whole different meaning when you add the international experience into it And Ditter seems to be cruising toward making that five with 20 plus the way things have gone for him so far Hes off the floor right now Grunlos still very much there And its Mallerie who drives the baseline Well back out but hell take it Mallerie seemed to have one thing in mind Yeah what great recognition though I Ive got a big guy on me What should I do Take it to the rim Big guy takes it back Mallerie will try three Score from within Just as good from without Final points in 6 seconds Is that good Mallerie what did we say Spark lift Whatever turn analogy you want to use that he provides for Virginia Take that snapshot of it What a sequence for Mallerie And they found him a long way away from here right had to go a long way Just about a mile Heres man cheering White the rebound Yeah Mallerie with the blockout White was the beneficiary of the rebound You know Jakari White is the other guy alongside Mallerie whose praises were singing in terms of bench scoring that really finds himself up there on the doorstep of of double digits in that department cheering Boy relentless effort from Gibbre Yeah hes so good I tell you what it would be hard to keep him out of that lineup for coach Leonard going very far was the leading scoreer the last time out against Ferman and he has eight here in Charlottesville Beautiful stroke from St Louis Had a couple of those in the first half that come to mind but boy that was a thing of beauty Oh yeah the Toledo transfer is a really fine score applause A rare turnover there and substitutions coming The Ritters coming in among others Heres that steal and the three from Mallerie right after the May bucket a moment ago Take us to break here coach Chance Mallerie one of four alums from St Ans Battlefield inside John Paul Jones Arena this afternoon We mentioned what a distant journey it was for him to wear the colors of the Hoos How about this camera work They aint seen anything like that And less than a mile away they music found a player this talented Committed early decommitted and then as soon as coach Ryan ODM got the job recommitted And Queens were a representative St Ans in this one as well Coach Sure do Three for the Cavs See them on your screen and a big day for that group from right here out of Charlottesville And boy what an addition the Charlottesville kid has been for this Virginia team And go back to that basket steel threepointer just a moment ago Just a window in to what hes been for UVA Yeah and theyve got theyve got a freshman here playing a lot uh a freshman playing a lot at uh St Joes and another freshman at Queens How about Ditter just works his defender down and drops it through Im running out of adjectives Multitalented diverse skills The numbers experienced despite being a freshman Hes right on the doorstep of 20 again 18 points for Derritter cheering The most amazing thing when you talk about Derritter is how many different locations from which he seems comfortable with the basketball from a scoring standpoint Yeah really anywhere And defensively very diverse too He can he can get down and and guard a perimeter player He can block shots at the rim and certainly physically he can battle a big guy on the block Now you see him talking with his head coach there Ryan ODM called him over momentarily as he was patrolling the perimeter that time after the foul call Going to have to give way with Cam Clark Ashby working his way off as well as one and one in effect Heres Tillis going to the line now Chance to get to double figures here off the bench Virginia number two in the league in bench points and 11 knocks the first one down I think that um may go up too because Tillis is just getting into game shape Yeah What is it about Tillis that impresses you so much coach and then well go from there to this entire bench for Virginia They have so much to offer The depth is incredible Yeah his his versatility is is really impressive I mean you come off the bench with a Jakari White and Devin Tillis who was a really good scoreer at UNCC Irvine a a real winner a leader kind of a guy Chance Mallerie weve talked uh on and on about So I mean we havent even gotten down to Elijah Gertrude and Carrer with a lot screaming of skill on this bench Very pleased with the depth that has been exhibited by this group Obviously Mallerie getting so many of the headlines that surrounding cast you mentioned Tremendous Heres a shot FROM THE CORNER AND HOW ABOUT THE job of just going straight down with it for White Talk about tickling the twine a moment ago That was his truest shot as weve seen And it was somewhat contested Yeah W White kicked it out and then Lewis you know saw him step back in bounds and got it to him in the corner Again more unselfish play Its almost like they heard you on Q when youre talking about so many different individuals that are making their mark for this team They showed you the diversity of that end Another kick from Mallerie This time Lewis he was comfortable right there just inside the elbow Kept that head up under control on balance Virginia stretching it out now A 120 run over the last 2 and 12 minutes of 7441 Things beginning to go according to plan You know Queens wont go quietly Swinger another of his threes Couple of big baskets from beyond the arc today Today the Cavaliers 20 to five over the last near five minutes of action And this is another one of those stretches where all the shots are going down Three of the last three Thatll make it four of four Theyve got a chance for more coming as Ditter has an and one opportunity ahead of him Yeah And thats from the left corner all the way to the rim over a 69 guy and through the contact That is a basketball play meal Right Well theyve got all the the pieces of the mill When you kind of begin to break it down every part of the meal is there And as you saw on those sweaters it starts with the turkey Turkey definitely the main course and that would be test You got to have some dressing like Malik Thomas like you need a leading scoreer and then Johan Grunllo well you you got to start with the turkey Lets just let that sit just a moment I cant be rushing dinner Yeah You got Nutter who is already sitting here with 21 the latest of his 20 point performances But you compliment him with the dressing Who would that be That be Malik Thomas You you got to have dressing like you need a big scoreer and that is Malik Thomas But the dressing doesnt work quite as well unless you got the gravy You got to have turkey and dressing and cover it with gravy Literally over the top of the turkey and dressing and that would be Johan Grumlo Literally over the top again living up to it today when you consider what hes done in a onetwo tandem with your aforementioned turkey Now you move on beyond kind of the turkey and dressing and gravy and you get to the sweet stuff I know thats always some of our favorite parts Well a couple things but uh to start with the sweet potato casserole becoming a goto side dish you becoming that goto side dish for sure Coming off the bench All right Thanksgivings not Thanksgiving without finishing it up with that pumpkin pie And and and what is everyones favorite Pumpkin pie right So who is everyones favorite out here Im going with Chance Mallerie Often everybodys favorite and certainly right here in Charlottesville Yeah the hometown kit leaven again in this one Hes had some of the highlight moments along the way And you select Mallalerie for the pumpkin pie So Virginia as documented there every piece of the Thanksgiving feasting on coach sweet potato casserole and end up with the pumpkin pie and Chase Mallerie Well looking like its trending more and more as they close in on that 80 point threshold again cheering like another one thats going to go the right way for the Whos a moment however for Nir Man reminding everybody hes in the building with Queens man with the slam got going late in the first half and we hadnt heard much from him but we heard that loud in career Remember hes part of that man family making its mark on Charlotte North Carolina He and Queens closing in on 50 But the the threshold for Virginia was 80 Thats what the staff told us right You look at that 80 point threshold you begin to think if they can get there things are going to go well Thats been the case through the first six Next bucket will put Virginia on top of that 80 point threshold Just so many offensive skills out there Lets go back and take a look just a moment ago at the job man did to finish this Yeah Lewis late on the chase and man with the emphatic finish Really impressive impressive play by Nir and Man kind of quietly now Hes placed himself in the mid teens 14 points for man including a moment ago right on his scoring average 139 Hes number four in the ASON in free throw percentage number two in the ASON in free throw attempts And thats why he gets to the free throw line He goes strong to the rim If you missed it when we talked about it earlier that sweater an answer to coach Grant Leonards wifes challenge that he wasnt festive enough Now that was related to Christmas He started by wearing Christmas sweaters It is now extended for the first time into the Thanksgiving holiday And we give him credit He wears it well Yeah And there are some other holidays but they dont fall during basketball season Mike Independence Day or whatever Well this is a great sports weekend You got the Commonwealth Clash coming up tomorrow So many of those football rivalries being decided as we speak Um just a lot of fun You you broke down the Virginia the full meal that Virginia provides from a Thanksgiving standpoint It really is As you talk about what Virginias been able to do through these first six plus games now it really is the wellrounded nature of this team that has made it tremendously successful You look at it as a team thats got an opportunity to make a deep deep look this year Its a feast and could be a buffet If everything comes together for this team you know they were telling us prior to the game coach look at this How about Burman Burman has had his moments in this second half Theres another as he has a second three Yeah dont remember anything he did in the first half but second half hes hes come to play and hes a big contributor Thought the staff made a great point in talking with us prior to the game about this Virginia team and its true of a lot of teams around the country You dont have when youre putting together a new nucleus that experience of what happened a year ago or some of the down times thats being built as you speak for this Virginia squad Theyll only get stronger as it happens Yeah exactly These things are happening organically now but they didnt have that coming in And thats the challenge for all these new rosters with so many new players The Queens team with a number of players back here kind of make their mark on the Ace Sun this year Theres a piece of the puzzle that you talked about a moment ago coach Becoming a goto side dish Absolutely What an addition Nearly came away with a block there Maybe a piece And here is that latest moment from Onenso Pump fake music cuz he can shoot the three but he can also get to the rim in a hurry Anso with the flush music match up What a weekend to be on grounds here in Charlottesville Kid from Charlottesville Mallerie with it He goes back to work for UVA And thats touched and out of bounds off of Queens Gs done a lot of impressive things 22 assist on 29 field goals will make Ryan ODM and his coaching staff very happy And of course they theyve slowed down the the threepoint barrage from the first half but still shooting almost 50 from beyond the arc You think about the Commonwealth Clash the history of these athletic programs You see coach ODM there you got to remember his history Hes a guy who learned how to play basketball on the floor at UHaul his dad an assistant to coach Holland and he literally learned the game on the floor right here on grounds Yeah what a staff Dave ODM Craig Little Pay Jim Larenega and on and on was part of that Ralph Samson era that so many hearken back to and you know his coaching pedigree as good as they come when you talk about Dave ODM for a dad and cheering the background thats there How about this swatted away Defense having its moments to go alongside this offensive explosion Coach Dave ODM one of the few guys ACC and SEC coach of the year along the way Just impressive background Heres that block again Leaving your man coming across A lot of times you dont block the guy your garden shot you block someone elses shot Cavaliers have accumulated seven of those in the contest today Seven blocks for UVA Another strength of coach ODMs screaming team You talk about Dave Odum I met Dave Odum when he was the coach at Durham High School We signed three of his players way back in the day Really a nice move My man again Well you know he left here to take the Wake job 89 to01 Had some of the great players in the history of the sport Threetime ACC coach of the year two turnney titles in the Atlantic Coast Conference the 95 sweep of the regular season and the Turney and then won it again in 96 And of course finished up at South Carolina ACC and SEC coach of the year as we mentioned one of the best to ever do it And Ryan ODM following right in his footsteps And coach ODM told us once Dave ODM that is He said you know hes got a lot of the basketball stuff in there that hopefully we imparted to him but he said hes got the personality of his mom which is a good thing He said I wasnt able to stay even kill over there but he stays even kill over there And you see that in Ryan ODM and his team has really responded coach Yeah no question I think Dave is right about Lynn too No doubt about it One of the great families in college basketball And I know Virginia fans happy to have Ryan ODM on that sideline looking for what would be a sixth win in the first seven contests Now five and a half away from it What has impressed you from Virginia so far in this one today Well we hit it from the top and I mentioned it just a minute ago The the sharing of the basketball 22 assist 29 field goals That thats a great ratio And u and the and the fact that you share the basketball but you also have people who can put the ball in the basket So I mean they can go 10 deep with legitimate people cheering a threat to score 20 or more Isaiah Henry knocks one down and gives us a chance to tell you the third annual ACC SEC womens basketball challenge Also coming up Wednesday Auburn squaring off against Syracuse Thats 5 Eastern And then Thursday night SMU Arkansas Thats at 7 on the ACC Network and the ESPN app big uh week of college basketball here Of course yesterday national champs went down to to TCU North Carolina fell that Michigan State team having their say Duke had their hands full with Arkansas last night It uh has been an impressive college basketball week already and the week to come with the ACC SEC challenges going to be even more special and Thomas hard to the floor But back up to his feet everybody catch a breath And just how enjoyable will those ACC SEC games be Look at this lineup Love it Yeah that you want to see the best go headtohead and and were going to see a lot of good contest Uh gosh national championships against Duke rematched back there and North Carolina Kentucky two of the literal blueb bloodoods Louisville and Arkansas Uh saw a little bit of that last night Cals got a good group out there And goodness gracious how good is Louisville off to such a good start Virginia and Texas will be good And well wait against uh the youngster Steven Pearl and all those games loaded up for you on the ESPN family of networks Of course Duke answering back last night Chicago that ended up being major moment Found an interesting note out of that game Undefeated to Thanksgiving I think each of the last eight or nine NCAA champions undefeated to Thanksgiving Thats something to keep an eye on as we go through the remainder of the college basketball season Of course Florida trying to defend their title in the ACC looking to snatch it back from one of those you just saw on your screen Burman fighting for it and coming away out of the frey with the basketball is Lewis Under four and a half to play Virginia having held Queens at arms length in this second half But this a Queens team going to make its mark on the A Sun as theyre the preseason favorites in that league New to D1 A Virginia team no doubt in a position to do so in the Atlantic Coast Conference Heres a foul underneath Burman was trying to get his hands on the basketball and hell depart Gabriel coming back in hisstead Yeah even even with the big lead here just four minutes left in the game Everybody from Virginia touched the ball on that possession Of course Grunlow had to get it himself They didnt throw it to him but but all five of them touched the ball on that possession Thats impressive All well that ends well for Bruno Hell knock down the free throw to begin it Were talking ACC just a moment ago Whats impressed you so far as you look around the league coach Well I I think the league is much improved U you know particularly on the mens side Uh NC States gotten off to a good start even though they had a couple losses lately Louisville looks really good Obviously Boozer and uh Caleb Wilson has Tobacco Road talking West uh Wake Forest missed out on a couple big chances to win big games but then came back and won one with Calvin off the bench the leading scorer off the bench in the league Made a gamewinning shot And uh uh I I think the league is going to be good Virginia Tech got off to a good start Theyve hit theyve hit a little bit of a lull now Of course they played the last two games without uh one of their better players Toby Lau Uh but uh again I I think I think the uh the mens side has has greatly improved and Im really interested in the SEC ACC challenge Now for a long time the ACC considered best basketball league in the country and there wasnt a lot of discussion but with the headlines the SEC snatched away a year ago that that makes this ACC SEC challenge all the more impressive Well speaking of impressive the threepoint shooting in this one for Virginia falls in that category White has the latest and the whos have posted 90 Yeah And all and all these things are cyclical You know fans act like okay the SEC is the very best or the ACC is the very best All these things go in cyclist Uh even even as uh young as you are youve seen cyclists go through the through the all the sports Here a moment ago you were accusing me of being there for the 1906 contest Now you go that way Going to be a lot of fun thats for sure with whats ahead Things going well for Virginia thus far on Thanksgiving music weekend music Cavaliers came in averaging in the mid80s They will eclipse 90 in this the seventh game of the new college basketball season for Virginia Parker to the line on the back side Look at that 90 point total cheering Going to raise the overall average coach for a team thats scoring it a lot differently shall we say than in recent years Yeah a lot differently a lot more And u just a just a totally different style of play And um you know all these things uh the pack line and uh the mover blocker under Tony Bennett that was an acquired taste And of course when you win a national championship everything tastes pretty good Y continuing the Thanksgiving theme there is one hanging in the rafters they will treasure for all time as a result of that It uh it is certainly a different style now and Virginia playing it well through the first seven Six in double figures today as well for UVA Thats always something you watch I think the fans are going to enjoy this team I think theyre going to enjoy this style of play and uh this teams going to get better and better We talked about that they didnt have many points coming back from last year All this is new and and like coach Griff Aldridge said we didnt have any experiences to draw upon where you could say remember back when and their remember back when is the 4th of November when they started this thing And uh I think thats going to serve them well going forward Youre going to see improvement of this team Great basketball is not being played There have been some great games There have been some great performances but consistently great basketball is not being played But as you get into January and February youre going to see some teams separate themselves Virginia certainly one of those teams capable of doing so You saw a snapshot of that coaching staff over there still looking for every small turn of the knob every small angle to try to make sure this team improves to its highest capability Two and change remain He mentioned six in double figures led by Ditter with 21 in this one And heres Mallerie Hes one of those looking for more but it rims out trying to block out Gruno down low Virginias going to maintain possession on the baseline Oh theyre going to go to the free throw line Bruno with 11 and eight so far Going back to the free throw line Brunow with 11 Mallerie with 11 A lot of guys with 11 cheering also true for White and Tillis And then of course the 15 for Lewis and the 21 I mentioned for Derritter Those the six for the Whos in double figures this afternoon Ronlo good from the charity strike and he will give way into the contest for UVA now chance to provide some playing time a little deeper on that Virginia bench Bandy transfer and local native Watfords going to be a good player for this Queens team Just getting going isnt he Yeah he really is You can see Flash is a brilliance and gosh 65 very athletic Hes right there with eight Hes looking to become the third in double figures for Queens Man with 18 Burman with 10 something else to cheer about as we come down the stretch here with just over 90 to play and well over 90 on the scoreboard Killis now with 13 A nice shot from the corner Mentioned the ACC connection from Swagger Hes got a brother at Wake We talked about it a moment ago Coach Dave ODMs name hangs in the Raptors but this one trending toward the latest win for coach Ryan ODM somewhat remarkable to look at it when you think about all the extended basketball history of Virginia that he was the first to go 50 to start his career as the new head coach Yeah thats thats pretty amazing Of course in connection with the Wake uh deal sad to see Rodney Rogers passing away at age 54 Boy what teams he was on great players coached against him a couple times once in the NCAA against Coach ODM Yeah those uh all our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to Rodney Rogers family and friends Another of those guys left his mark on the ACC and beyond Good move to the basket there Watford you know hes taken advantage of every minute inside JPJ here these last seconds Changed hands found the opening got it over the rim got to that double figure mark for you Lang well theyll enjoy this if he can finish Just a little short Henry a little too strong and put cheering back was turned aside Virginia running that block total a little higher And look who got this one Owen Odum off the bench So many of those blocks coming from the expected the usual suspects but in this case Owen ODM coming away with the block inside the final minute Eight of those for Virginia if youre trying to keep tally in the blocks department today Yeah the bench was up in support of that block Carrer there filling up your screen You know the threepoint shooting we documented earlier one of the trademarks of this team Well youre kind of closing in on double digit blocks today A reminder that thats becoming one of the main weapons for Virginia as well Nations leader Offensive rebounds block shots These are new to the Virginia faithful They come with the pace of play Thats a different wrinkle moving forward All works out to the tune of what looks to be a 9469 final With the shot clock off Virginia will dribble it out Impressive bounce back after the long setback thus far of the Ryan ODM era His team comes away with a big victory over Queen Sizable victory that is on the scoreboard Yeah you just never know how a teams going to respond
