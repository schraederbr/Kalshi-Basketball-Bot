against Oklahoma and he should be Normally Wake Forest is a team that manufactures points on the offensive glass and also off of turnovers Lets see if they can get it going up and down tonight Adam Flory throws it in the air and were underway here in Charleston West Virginia 10000 plus on hand here tonight Not too many seats left in this one And its going to be the Mountaineers that have the first possession of tonights game And heres Huff Messi on the three but its knocked out by Wake Forest Well and thats why Honor Huff made 131 threes last year Look he shoots almost 42 from threepoint land This is a young man that is not shy for Ross Hodgej And Ross Hodgej has complete confidence at number three in gold tonight Honor Huff There he is Eagle Staff cheering and screaming gets it back here This is Trac Eagle Staff to the corner for Brennan Laurent and thats going to be a travel Wake Forest really physical defensively in the first half court set Theyre bristling from that loss to Oklahoma just earlier this week Time now for tonights starting lineups brought to you by Sky Scanner And what is the strength of this starting five for Wake Forest Wake Forest is a go They average over 82 points a game They want to get up and down They want to get points off turnovers They want to score early in a possession Omaha Belaloo missing a three badly And here comes Eagle staff the other way for West Virginia And how about the starting five and the strength of the Mountaineers here tonight The Mountaineers are wo They want to turn this into a dog fight just like that Oba inside They want to get second chance points They want to do down and dirty They want to get gritty with their defensive transition and play half court They are a low and Wake Forest is a go missing on the three Miles Coven here for Wake Forest Mountaineers in a hurry Heres Huff trying to dump it inside Back out Floyd Its a three and thats off And West Virginia Theyre going to try to work through OB a lot Number 55 in gold Hes a large man among a lot of large men That dude is big You talked about him at the start but how great has Juke Harris been Number two in black for Wake Forest Most improved player in the country Keep your eye on number two He has the ball right there Juke Harris Hes added layers to his game Hes a multidimensional offensive weapon Pass got deflected He got it back Theres five to shoot Takes it in and hes blocked by Obia And the shot clock is going to expire Somethings got to give Theres Steve Forbes Hes a go He wants Wake Forest to get up and down at 825 points per game Ross Hodgej is a wo and they slow the game down and they defend you They grind you into pulp at the end of a game 566 points per game Who will win this battle of wills tonight between the ACC and the Big 12 Its up to Hart for three Another miss and the rebound by Wake Forest whos Trayvon Spillers and its intercepted Laurant cheering great job getting back on D Thats this team early in this game Advantage West Virginia Its at their pace Their defensive transition has been perfect Foul inside and its Harlon Oiohigh to the free throw line for two Well you and I spent a lot of time with this guy Ross Hodgej back last year with North Texas What a job he did And now to come here and he has an identity right He has what he wants to do with his team He can recruit to that identity Its hard nose Its defense Its been pretty phenomenal what hes done He recruits winners He did it in North Texas and hes doing it in West Virginia Now Honor Huff for example winning the NIT championship which you saw right from this seat by the way is the playbyplay voice of the NIT for ESPN He wants winners he recruits winners and they win with him They trust him They believe in him He is the defensive Yoda of college basketball Well and when you talked about it and the players recognize that you know you can get to where you want to go and you look good when the team looks good right When you win and youre not just in it for yourself and you have to be a team oriented player to play for him cuz its defense Its about clamping down Yeah you there has to be a high level of trust and a high level of belief and thats what this program is built on right now These West Virginia fans are going to love the Ross Hodge way Both teams right now are combined 0 for six from threepoint range And that changes as Juke Harris knocks down the three Yeah NBA Look he only shot 30 from three a year ago Now almost 37 from behind the ark Hes improved his game through hard work two times a day every day throughout the offseason Grew up 40 minutes away from Wake Forest in Salsbury North Carolina You talk about improvement He had about six points a game on average last year Hes up to almost 20 this season Back to Huff Shot clock at five Jasper Floyd Two to shoot Fumbles it around And thats a shot clock violation So each teams had one so far here tonight Yeah For Wake Forest the story has been about the improvement of Juke Harris Look over the summer he came into the workout facility two times every day in the morning and in the evening And he lifted in between And it snorts was an everyday thing He credits all of his improvement to his work ethic in the offseason Hes made himself into a guy that NBA scouts are salivating over right now Hes at 67 He can handle it He can pass it He can shoot it He can drive it And he can defend Nate Cal Nice has it here for Wake Forest Hes dealing with a broken nose You see him wearing the mask here Demon cheering Deakons inside Lauren on the D and alters the shot Thats on McCov and this ball goes out of bounds and its back to Wake Forest Sometimes Wake Forest forgets who their best player is Juke Harris was wide open on that last possession Youve got to give number two the ball in black when he has the opportunity at any time especially unguarded I love your question When we talk to players all the time tell me one thing about you that nobody knows What was it that Juke was telling us about He plays Minecraft all the time Oh and he hits and hes fouled Plays Fortnite all the time Three times he plays Fortnite before before the game Apparently it paid off message for you tonight We pray for laughter for you David during this holiday season We pray for tears of joy because of the memories that you build together And we

reasons So well said Mark Those are some of the families and the people that need your support And its exactly why we do this to the V Foundation 100 of your donations go directly to cancer research And thats the kicker Mike Help Jim Balvano said It may not help me but it might help somebody else someday Never give up Jim Balvano 100 vorgdonate here at VWeek on ESPN West Virginia closes the gap to one Its six to five as we played almost 5 minutes here in this first half inside on the miss Spillers a whistle and a foul Were going the other way and thats on Harris Mark and thats going to be his second and that is huge Yeah the most improved player in the country and one of the best players in the country And now Steve Forbes is going to watch 20 points per game sit down on the bench for a large majority of the first half That is a tough tough break for Wake Forest against a team that can flat out guard Now the best score for Wake Forest is on the bench Mark that That completely changes things here 15 minutes to go in this first half and well see when they may bring Harris back in but for right now hes out And here is Chance Moore driving and scoring for the Mountaineers and they have the lead Yeah Chance Moore is so athletic to transfer from St Bon Adventure and you know when you get a Mark Schmidt coach player hes going to be really fundamentally sound and understand how to play the game Thursday 17 points and six of eight from the field Another foul here This going to be on Jenkins Amir Jenkins is first Yeah Chance Moore is a guy Hes a runner He brings energy to this team At 66 210 lbs He has a good basketball IQ And he never goes sideways Mike He always goes north south Hes always in attack mode Heres Cal Me Yeah Cal M is got to get up and down Hes got to get into the paint Three ball Its off by Marcus Marian Offensive rebound and back to Cal Me He messes on the three and the threepoint shooting not happening right now here for both teams really early on But even more important than that Mike Blake Force is not getting second shots Theyve been limited to one shot The two threes that have gone down has been by Juke Harris but hes out of the game And now the floating runner by Cal for two critical for Nate Calmise to get into those gaps against this stingy defense two foot jump stop and make plays that time The shot looked for him also to distribute in that situation Well hes doing an incredible job with that Hes got 49 assists this season and only 14 turnovers Unselfish high basketball IQ Nate Calmise number one in black Cant miss him with the face mask Laurent up top for Huff Its a three Thats no good And the rebound Cal Me but it got knocked from behind by Huff as he gets it back to Laurate for three And Cal Me on the run here for the Demon Deakons The uglier it gets the better it is for West Virginia Nice Oh what a feed inside And thats Cooper Schweagger for the two Yeah from Mai Mason Hes a big physical wing that can see over smaller defenders at 65 Mai Mason with the assist Schwigger the transfer from Palpo Jenkins and a wideopen look for Chance Moore Misses on the three West Virginia is 0 for seven from threepoint range and a travel on Laurian Watch Cooper Schwer number 13 He rolls to the dead space Look right there He rolls to the open area and just sits down and waits for the basketball And Mai Mason with his head up can see him Look a lot of big guys roll because the offense says to roll to this spot You got to roll to the open space and thats what Schwigger did All right so Wake Forest on top 10 to seven here coming up on 12 minutes to play in the first half Although their top player is out of the game here early on Okay so far they shared the ball very well and theyre probing those gaps of the West Virginia defense Heres Sebastian Akins Shot clock again Its down to five and a corner three thats off by Mason and rebounded here by Moore A great defensive possession by West Virginia Wake Forest was content to just pass it along the perimeter West Virginia here is three of 10 from the field They go inside Oh basket in the foul cheering and its put down by Jackson Fields Jackson Fields just attacks the rim as hard as he can takes the contact finishes at 68 He brings intangibles off the bench Hes a guy that had a thumb injury but has come back to hes got active body active hands and there you saw the pogo feet Marcus Marian on the foul First West Virginia field goal in the last two minutes and were tied at 10 If Wake Forest is going to settle for passing the ball around the perimeter theyve got to put the ball on the floor some and get into a gap and force a second defender to pick them up Otherwise they will play right into the West Virginia good position defense This where you expect this game to be here right now Weve had 20 total points in 8 minutes Thats why thats what West Virginia expected it to be The three ball up and good by Mason Mason has had an assist and now a threepoint shot Really came off shot ready All right so Wake Forest is three of eight from threepoint range and West Virginia is now 0 for eight but they get the offensive rebound Floyd Jasper Floyd bounces it inside They go out to the wing and a wide open fields for three Thats no good Cant seem to get it going from beyond the arc And Laurian is dominating the offensive glass And an offensive rebound that time by Thomas That doesnt go Another one This is by Fields Fouled And hell have two when we come back And Bob Huggins as they went to the Sweet 16 of the NCA tournament one of the great competitors in the history not just West Virginia but college basketball Deshawn Butler the winningest mens basketball player in the history of West Virginia I didnt even mention Rod Thorne Hot Rod Hunley So many great historic players came from the Mountaineers Thats pretty cool Video credit by the way courtesy of Mark Adams Nice job that you shot Also got to give a ton of credit to our producer Jeff Graham who has shot a bunch of stuff as well The lights that we saw uh from the Dirty Birds Thats right Is that crazy 25 million lights Thats a lot of lights Thats a lot of dirty birds laughter Its a onepoint game here tonight and were just getting started Nine minutes in Little fullcourt pressure to change things up from West Virginia Heres Mai Mason You know for Wake Forest its not necessarily what they run in their half court steps is can they get second chance points off the offensive glass Love the dribble penetration here in the movement Well done by Wake Forest Lou works his way in and theres going to be a foul called Boy the offensive activity and aggression from Wake Forest on that possession was winning formula for Steve Forbes That was active It was aggressive It was smart Third team foul on West Virginia The first on Trac Eagle staff And heres Belaloo Transfer out of Iowa State second year with Wake Forest but was dealing with a lot of injuries last year and defensively does a lot of things that are not seen on the stat sheet Can shoot the three and you know hes a former fivestar recruit Yeah McDonalds AllAmerican Yeah Now hes 100 He really brings energy to Steve Forbes in the Demon Deakons cheering Brings defense Hes a physical defender Can guard multiple positions Youre going to have to keep an eye on this guy as the season progresses cuz hes just getting back to form I know we talk a lot about Juke Harris whos averaging about 20 points a game but hes on the bench right now with two personal fouls Yeah Blue had nine points He was three for four against Porter Moser in Oklahoma in that losing effort 10 and a half to go here in the first half Wake Forest by three Heres Huff Mountaineers still looking for their first threepointer of the night Go inside Morant loves this mid post area right there Almost coughed it up Just did cough it up Well we saw him way back first at FAU before he went to North Texas and now followed Ross Hodgej here to West Virginia Hes part of Dusty Maz final four team and Brendan Laurant number zero for West Virginia He likes the ball in the midrange area He likes to play with his back to the basket Hes very very athletic But credit Wake Forest theyre very well prepared for that that mid post area and attacking Laurent And theyre doing it with the guy that you just saw there on the bench Thats Juke Harris whos got two personal fouls Has to watch from the sidelines right now They got Miles Kovven up off the bench Hell check in at the next whistle Heres Akens Wilder and he gets it to go Sebastian Aikens up and under When he gets in the lane thats when Wake Forest is good And they were really good right there Double team coming down and the kick out here to Laurent And hes in trouble and its going to get ripped away by Mason Boy the double team in the post has been deadly for Wake Forest Theyve shut down the West Virginia offense completely That is now seven West Virginia turnovers And Wake Forest capitalizes with Spillers and Ross Hodgej takes a timeout And so far theyre plus nine on points off turnovers tonight They are And theyre out to the sevenpoint lead Coming out of the timeout what does West Virginia do here West Virginias got to settle down Theyve got to take better care of the ball especially when they get in the post and they see the double team coming from Wake Forest Theyve got to make quicker decisions Theres the double team right there See the extra bounce That doesnt help you Thats not high percentage Huff air balling to three Theres a foul on the rebound though I think theyre going to get bailed out as the Demon Deacons are called for the ticket And its Belaloo that picks up his second West Virginia now knows that Wake Forest is going to double down on the post and even in the mid post Every time a post band turns his back back theres going to be another black jersey that comes right to him You need AI decisions down there You got to make them quick Are you proficient with that yet Are you using Im getting pretty good Im getting pretty good through all that stuff I wont say which one I dont want to give away all my secrets here Moore gets it taken away And on the run no but a foul as that is Kovven and he heads to the line here But Mike see how turnovers and bad shots lead to breakouts with black jerseys I mean this team really knows how to transition from defense to offense And there you saw it Miles Kovven has played so well over the last five games Double digit scorer for this team Catch and shoot guy Really athletic understands how to play his role And right there we saw him in the open court just jet to the rim Those are one of that was one of the points of emphasis that youre going to be watching tonight Right Defensive transitioning Yeah And there But the thing is theres no defensive transition for a turnover cheering Youre dead And right now Wake Forest is taking advantage of every fullcourt opportunity theyve had cheering Watch the black jerseys If it enters in the paint to a gold jersey watch the second black jersey come to the double Mason Mason picks up a foul When we talked to Ross Hajj about this season so far and his team that you know comes in doing pretty well and they had a loss to Clemson by three and a loss to Xavier by 10 He said that game was one that he thought ahead of time we got to look out for this one because they were able to stretch the floor with fours and fives that were shooting threepointers and stuff like that What about in a game like this where this team wants to go up and down the floor and what happens if you get down big early now what for a team that kind of packs it in You got to dig in deeper on this end and right now theres the deeper right there as the as the official makes the call and Ross Hodgej doesnt like it and he could challenge it if he wants to and he is going to do that All right All right So here it is again Looked like he got it before the ball got to the backboard It looked like the ball was on an upward trajectory in real time That might have hit the backboard first Lets look at it again See if it hits the backboard first Now cant tell from that angle You have to have a call on the court first And they did And they called it a goalend applause And Ross Hodgej wants to challenge it So a coachs challenge Yep Youve got to have a timeout to be able to do that which he obviously I dont think you make the challenge until you have a designated assistant coach who advises you to challenge versus you make that emotional decision immediately because right now Ross Hodge lost a timeout and he lost a challenge for later in the game Correct Hes out of challenges for the rest of the game and he had already called a timeout earlier when Wake Forest is on a run So now hes down to two timeouts left for the rest of the game And thats of course a bang bang play and emotions of course you know come out but thats how good I would say these officials are I mean they made the call in real time and they were right as soon as it hit the backboard you cant touch it and they did and the goalend was upheld I think all teams are working through managing the challenge rule and what is the timing of it and what is the process of it As you see again the offensive glass work by West Virginia that nothing comes of it because youve got to make a smart and calculated decision versus an emotional decision in the moment And I think thats where management process timing all come into that decision Thats a great point Mark You think about it its still very early in the first half Yep You lost a timeout and youre out of challenges for the rest of the game Could be a factor Laurian inside and he is fouled and hell head to the line here Mike early on Ive been impressed with the physicality and toughness of Wake Forest interior defense against Oklahoma They they were not as physical as they are tonight Two shots for Lauren here Its a huge day in sports today What about tomorrow Weve got more mens basketball coming your way in Missouri and Kansas This rivalry going back a long long time Thats a 100 right here on the deuce And then Georgetown and North Carolina at 500 Thats tomorrow on ESPN Yeah the border war Remember Missouri won the border award last year that gave Dennis Gates a signature win last season Missous Mark Mitchell at 69 a senior over 18 points a game and hes a Kansas City kid You think this game means a little bit to him Now Kansas hoping to get back freshman fenom on Darren Peterson too with that hamstring strain Yeah I hope he gets back in the lineup Yep More on that rivalry here I mean look at this 273rd meeting between Missouri and Kansas coming up Can you tell we have some Kansas City guys in the truck today Thats right We do When we talk about this game the whole second half ladies and gentlemen crews doing a great job as always tonight Jeff Graham our producer Kevin Shank our director Great wingspan defense There we go Cal Nice hands it off for Coven cheering I like the way Cal Nice runs the offense He probes He sees Well done by Cal Nice kick outer for three Its no good Offensive rebound Spillers Stays with it cheering and takes it right in Puts it in Trayvon Spillers just never gave up on that play He is the heartbeat of this team And there you saw the extra effort on the offensive glass and never gave up on the play Super high motor Hes second on the team in scoring behind Juke Harris who by the way is still out of this game with two personal fouls And he went out at the 15minute mark and Wake Forest leads by eight Its amazing what Wake Forest has done without a 20point score per game Another miss from threepoint range Laurant 0 for 11 now from three for West Virginia Now Wake Forest has been the physically tougher team Theyve been the grittiest team in this game in the first half Once again Spiller same thing Mark a little farther out Doesnt go And a fight for the offensive rebound again Coven Yesile Heads up Thats a 6040 ball that should have gone to West Virginia but somehow someway Miles Kovven comes up with That is a want to thing and Wake Forest simply wants it more West Virginia has 11 offensive rebounds five for Wake Forest but its about converting and the Demon Deacons are the one that are doing that Up by 10 they lose the handle here as Huff lost it ahead of the pack here for Spillers Spillers Trayvon Spillers was a high school wide receiver that was recruited at the division one level I think that kid could play football right now My goodness You think Wake Forest had a bad taste in their mouth from that loss to Oklahoma four days ago Theyve come out here with a different attitude I watched that game over and over again against Oklahoma This team has fire in their belly today A nice runner there by Lori West Virginia needed something Back down to a 10point game West Virginias got 10 turnovers and Wake Forest has 13 points off of those 10 turnovers thus far Thats how they win That one clanged off the rim by Spillers And here come the Mountaineers with Huff for three Final first of the night The number one threepoint man by volume for the Chattanooga Mox one year ago 1031 made cheering He can light it up And here comes Charleston West Virginia cheering Its a steal with Jenkins Back to Huff for two in a row cheering cheering Well that changes fast Well be back Honor Huff of West Virginia He is electric He is an elite shooter He worked with his dad who would not let him shoot threes until he was strong enough As a kid it frustrated him cheering But his dad gave him the confidence When youre strong enough let it fly And Ross Hodgej believes in him your honor Your honor Two in a row Great stuff Mark To the tune of an eight nothing run here for West Virginia as theyre right back in it cheering And a steal No way Thats off that time off the rip to the right You know what Im letting him shoot it whenever he wants to Hes earned the right Ross Hodgej didnt even flinch The relationship that Hajj has with Huff and his players they want to come play for him The gap 8 nothing run in the last 125 Oh because Vonor Huff and guess whos back in the game Juke Harris right there gets the first shot coming off the bench Got to be really careful about using him now And you think Ross Hodgej doesnt see it You think that West Virginia isnt going to try to isolate him and attack him right now Id go right at number two in black except hes coming out of the game right now He came in for one possession Yeah theres your offensive defensive substitution early There are a lot of good things going How about Iowa State hammering number one Purdue today The Cyclones were 11 for 23 from the threepoint line Big win for the Big 12 over the number one team in the Yeah that was very surprising Yeah very surprising that score Heres Huff Relocates for three Its good Hes hit three of his last four Sizzling OH THE BLOCK INSIDE Fields and West Virginia can take the lead Floyd and thats blocked the other way as Spellellers in company inside but they get it back and now its blocked by Kulvin and Wake Forest with Akens Count it Well a little chaos here in Charleston West Virginia Balls flying around like crazy Well thats what its all about in this state right Blue collar hard working here Youre seeing it tonight in this game Yeah the score is indicative of West Virginias pace right now But give a lot of credit to Westford to Wake Forest They have played with a lot of good Huff again and hes fouled Well they have to respect his ability now from the threepoint line and getting a little bit too close there and getting him on the arm of Sebastian Akins who picks up the foul And Honor Huff can tie this thing at the free throw line Boy Honor Huff knows how to read defenses Why This kid was a college level reader in middle school He is a really smart young man High basketball IQ And I love the fact that his dad worked him out Never let him shoot a three until he was strong enough to shoot a three His dad legally changed his name to live endless How about that for an attitude Live endless Thats pretty good 24th annual womens Jimmy B Classic coming your way You were talking about these teams How about on the womens side Number 12 Iowa number 10 Iowa State on Wednesday at 700 on ESPN Instate rivalry Two music teams with goddy records Iowa and Iowa State Last year that game was won by Iowa 7569 Iowa State wants revenge at cheering home And we are tied at 29 here And Wake Forest has played better for a large majority of this half but the last five minutes its been all energy from West Virginia Its a 142 run for West Virginia in the last 240 and ticking Tough one by Harris One shot Huff keeps it in Watch for number three in gold Hes the focal point guy Hes hot getting the ball Floyd for Thomas Huff was open bounces it inside and a block by Spillers on the offering that time by Ugosuk and Huff was wide open Defender left him West Virginia didnt recognize it So they take Harris out again Mark trying to preserve Yep his time to not pick up that third personal foul here in the first half Here comes Huff from NBA range And that one rims out and its tracked down by Fields as many of these misses have been tonight by West Virginia That is now their 14th offensive rebound in this game Huff again Another relocation And hes missed the last couple rebound by Spillers Yeah But keep shooting Thats my advice Yep Memphis Can they settle down Can they get in the gaps when theyre in attack mode Theyre good They zone for the jump shot there Great block off Excellent by the freshman DJ Thomas Mark Huff is three of 10 All his shots have come from threepoint range Hes got 12 points to lead all scorers in this game Yeah And you know what I say keep shooting it son Number three in gold Where is he Hes got it And Wake Forest putting big defenders on him all the time Heres Floyd for three and thats good cheering First lead for the Mountaineers since it was 76 and its pretty short lived as Schwagger knocks down a three on the other side Swiggers hit big two big threes in this half He understands his role Hes a shot ready big guy Hes got five points No one has more than six for Wake Forest in scoring Look out inside Easy two by Thomas Complete total defensive breakdown by Wake Spillers the other way This game You know its the fastest slow game Ive ever called laughter Exactly cheering Final five seconds Floyd Jasper Floyd and a whistle and a jump ball is called a tie up here And its going to be Wake Forest possession mark with 13 remaining Yeah watch for spillers here Number 25 in black Watch for spillers to the rim Im a little surprised Juke Harris doesnt come in for this possession Watch for the long pass to Spillers number 25 Here it is Throws it in and you Spillers and makes the pass and THE THREE IS OUT AND ITS GOOD by Cal Nice Lets see if they count it They said no but theyre going to go look at it Hunter Huff hes got 12 points on three of 10 from threepoint range Three of three at the foul line And on the other side the top scorer is Spillers Wake Force at eight Trayvon Spillers was huge especially because Juke Harris was out of the game in foul trouble Now number two is back in And what does West Virginia do What a shot They pounded inside to Obie Mountaineers by two to start this second half I thought Wake Forest having you know Juke Harris on the bench for most of that first half their top score They did a good job to weather the storm as Belaloo knocks down a three and theyre back in front Yeah Omaha Belaloo the energy giver gives some energy early in this half Harrison only played seven minutes in that first frame mark He had six points Theres that double team Lets see if West Virginia handles it better They do Gloria is fouled Wake Forest to number six The chess game begins Now West Virginia knows that Wake Forest is going to send a second defender toward their post guy either Laurian or Oba whenever he catches the basketball in that mid or low post range So what are they doing Theyre moving out away from the basket Theyre creating a passing angle and dragging another defender with him Coven was called for the foul for Wake Forest Following down is Obi Oh he loses it And here comes Kovven the other way and he is fouled and Jasper Floyd got him Yeah Obioa tried to do too much on one end and Wake Forest was more than happy to make him pay on the opposite end This game being played in Charleston West Virginia here tonight two and a half hours away from Morgantown where West Virginia here in Charleston by the way 74 and 22 all time But the last they played the last time they played here in Charleston 2016 And these fans look they appreciate this This arena is filled tonight You know its been interesting Mike to to watch Steve Forbes and how successful he has been at Wake Forest Look this is a guy in junior college at Northwest Florida that went 626 626 goes to Wake Forest They finished in the top half and finished in fourth place in the ACC last year Theyve had backtoback 13 win seasons at Wake Forest Not exactly the blue blood of Duke or North Carolina Steve Forbes has done an amazing job at Wake Forest No they have I mean that schools no joke too by the way No its not You know we were looking at some of the numbers earlier and we talked to them about this as this ball is knocked away here Demon Deakons have a Cal Me on the play They are third over the last five years Theyre third in the ACC in nonconference wins Theyre fourth in the ACC in overall wins And theyre tied for fourth in the nation in home wins Thats Wake Forest and what theyve done under Steve Forest Yeah And you thought the world was ending because Oklahoma won at Wake Forest the other night You thought the walls were crumbling down around Wake Forest Look this guy has done an unbelievable job at Wake Forest Once upon a time this this basketball program was not relevant Its very relevant under Steve Forbes Harris step back three knocks it down Wow thatll look good Yeah wow is the right term NBA remember Juke Harris cheering most improved player in America number two in black applause sophomore Laurant blocked there by Spillers whos had a really nice game

19 or taking 11 of the 19 I should say Ros Hodge going a little fullcourt pressure here He wants to get some of those positive juices flowing like we saw the last seven minutes of the first half Jasper Floyd trying to get it going with the tip right there Largest lead for Wake Forest tonight has been 12 at 27 to 15 Jasper Floyd the transfer from North Texas came with Ross Hodgej from North Texas We had such a successful run Jasper Floyd the real leader of this team number one in gold defending the ball right now Yeah Floyd and Laurent both from North Texas with Hodgej once again Same spot Same result Juke Harris Timeout Going to save lives Just asking Dont need to answer But its really cool I love it I love it back in Charleston here for this matchup And its been an 11 nothing run over the last three minutes for Wake Forest prompting the timeout by West Virginia Theyve only got one timeout left for the rest of the game Down by nine Heres Huff Floating runner No And rebounded by Harris Theyre more than happy to run Huff off the line and make him shoot a contested two screaming Boy Wake Forest now with Duke Harris in the game Its another great offensive threat that West Virginia has to extend defensively to guard Theyre in the midst Black is hard to guard Mhm Theyre in the midst of their largest run of the game here 11 nothing run Make it 13 nothing on the throw down by Spillers Yeah Nate Calise gets downhill Number one in black Just went around the defense went right to the rim drew the defender and Trayvon Spillers is athletic Hes got 10 points Two behind his teammate Harris for the team high Back inside DJ Thomas and that runners good Thomas And we talked about the stat mark and how big it is Points off turnovers tonight 206 in favor of Wake Forest Thats how Wake Forest wins Harris misses on the three A little short but tipped around and Spiller has just been all over the place tonight Grabs the rebound screaming An Omaha Belaloo went right over the back for that Got his fingertips on it Okay the wingspan of the bigs for Wake Forest is underrated These guys can defend They can get deflections Spurs misses on the three Theres a foul and a rebound And its going to be on Huff who kind of backed his way in laughter I want James Madison and Koulain I want them both in the college football playoffs We got to get you on the comm Duke in the ACC championship game Its all going to shake out Mike Okay Against Virginia tonight Back to basketball and inside its Miles Culvin that scores for Wake Forest and five minutes into this second half They have extended the advantage now 4938 Yeah Miles Kovven and Trayvon Spillers who by the way played wide receiver in high school speaking of football Yeah he has been that wide receiver and hes received a lot of great passes Number 25 in black Hes been the story of this game We cant even talk about Juke Harris Hes really really good But Trayvon Spillers the Robin to the Batman has been the best

response to that laughter cheering I heard crickets Its not crickets in here tonight And its been a lively crowd of over 10000 and theyre getting a little restless right now Theyre trying to pick this team up cheering West Virginia made a great run at the end of the first half but its been all Wake Forest here to start the second half Spillers bounces it here for Harris Takes it in Takes a lot of contact and no call Ball knocked out of bounds and its going to West Virginia cheering Yeah gold jerseys collapsed Look he gains a lot Theres a lot of contact right there Theres a ton of contact right there And that is a foul that was uncalled Yeah I I I can understand I think initially you thought he might have went straight up there but then came down Thats right Yeah he was in his cylinder until both arms came down and just destroyed the shooter and Drew Harris Been a well officiated game tonight That was a bad play Yep Heres Huff over to Jenkins And Jenkins was getting pushed there in the back and they got the foul there on Isaac Carr the freshman who was in for like a couple of seconds earlier in the first half to throw that length of the floor pass at the end of the half and now hes back in here Namir Jenkins number two in gold for West Virginia Look every time he gets contact that that flowing hair just cheering rotates backward violently And right there we got an illegal screen Looks like yeah speaking of that the emphatic call too as well as Laurette picks up the ticket for West Virginia But Ill tell you what I I give Juke Harris a lot of credit on that last play What did he do Mark He just got right back up and went down the other end of the court Never said a word Right And and scouts see that Correct They see whos coachable whos energetic whos mature and Juke Harris fills all of those boxes He does Spillers misses the runner Rebound by Eagle Staff Yeah I like Drew Harris a lot I think hes definitely an NBA guy You and I spent some time with him earlier today Shoot around Now heres a steal Oh Cal Nese to keep it in and Harriss pass is knocked out by Huff But that was a heck of a play there by number one Nate Cal Nice Yeah Nate Cal Hes been the conductor of this basketball team Look he needs to get in the lane for Wake Forest to be really good And hes gotten in the lane all week long with that broken nose He just had surgery on it last week I think it was on Wednesday And thats a a form fitting mask that hes worn for the last couple of games But he hes fearless He gets in lane He just makes plays Washington State transfer Heres Schwagger looking for the cutter Not there Back to Harris Throws himself to the hoop and he scores it and hes fouled How about that powerful move by the future NBA talent Yeah this is a guy that worked twice a day every day morning for hours lifting in the afternoon hours in the evening time and time again And thats where he gained his confidence through his hard work You and I when we talk to these players you always ask that question Tell us something about you that nobody knows We talked about that earlier I always ask him about hey what do you want to do or what do you like to do outside of basketball Uh you know hobbies interests and he was like man my life revolves around basketball And I mean he told us the everything hes doing to try to get to that next level Someday wants to open up a car dealership Hes got a pretty nice 2025 Mercedes I asked if I could drive it He gave me permission Next time Yep Thats his thing after basketball Jenkins Oh nice little up fake there Puts it up off to the right though and the rebound pulled in by Harris Harris starting to exert his will on this game Lets see if they get him a touch right now Five rebounds for Harris to go along with 12 points and a foul here on West Virginia Mike Steve Forbes was really disappointed with the Wake Forest effort against Oklahoma before he got to the locker room Guess who took care of that locker room and the messaging of the lack of effort It was Juke Harris This guy is the leader of this basketball team and he knew when to step up because their effort was give Oklahoma and Porter Moser a lot of credit but Steve Forbes said I was disappointed how we played but he talked about it the next game the next day because Juke Harris took care of it in real time in the Demon defens locker room Thats leadership Updating his numbers Hes got 15 points here nine in the second half Remember he had those two personal fouls early that he got in the first five minutes of the game and then was kind of put in sporadically in the first half to get him some some opportunities but not enough to try to pick up that third personal foul Lets see what West Virginia does here on offense now down by 12 Oh nice play there inside but sticking with it is Chance Moore after he was blocked initially by Belaloo Yeah this team needs a lot more of a physical chance more here in the second half to make a run Now a 10point lead for Wake Forest cheering Heres Belaloo Harris 15 and five here tonight This is a luxury late shot clock when you give it to whats going to be your allAmerican all ACC guy Juke Harris corner Schwiger four to shoot Schwigger up and under but too strong and fights to get it back Its going to be a jump and its going to stay with Wake Forest when we come back 1140 to go in the second half You know having a good competitive pitching career He was a sports information director for a year at Southern Arkansas University He was a junior college baseball coach at Iowa Southwestern Community College a a baseball coach and then finds his way into basketball finally fulltime Was an assistant at Witchah State with Greg Marshall during those great great years with Fred Van Vleet and Ron Baker and those guys at Northwest Florida Junior College He ends up going 62 and six there He goes to East Tennessee State builds that into a championship level program in the Southern Conference and then finds his way to Wake Forest where hes had just tremendous success What a coach Steve Forbes is Well and this could be a real special year for this team as well too You got a guy like Harris whos been playing solid and now has it here as he puts it up and is fouled up by 10 Theyre six and three on the season And teams or people say to him its like Hey youre a couple points away from you know only having one loss Well hes also also a couple points away from the other way You know you got to finish those games off and theyve been right in it this year except for one game Yeah They lost to Michigan by one in overtime 8584 And Michigan is uber talented They end up losing to Texas Tech Grant McCaslin who was the old boss for Ross Hodgej 8483 They beat Memphis on a last second shot Mhm And then they lost to Oklahoma but that one wasnt close and they werent happy about it Theyre theyre playing very well tonight Foul was on Fields for West Virginia Thats a 12point lead here for Wake Forest It ties their largest lead of the night Their largest run has been 13 nothing West Virginias been on an 11 nothing run at one point this game as well That got them back into it So theyre capable again and theyre going to have to get on one of those runs here now at 1046 to go But if you were to do a meter of the of the energy level of both teams throughout this game Wake Forest has been the energy giver 70 of this game They have brought energy consistently for at least 70 of this game Theyve dictated play They have second foul Mason by the way for Wake Forest Here goes Moore chance more on the runner and he was fouled So now were seeing a lot more whistles and were also seeing guys take it to the rim harder and every time the clock can stop when youre down 12 Thats good news for West Virginia The foul was on Spillers mark and that was his first foul of the night So I mean it just shows you again what number 25 has done for Wade Forest uh within the framework of the team and the offense and the defense I mean thats his first foul Hes got 10 points four boards Hes really affected this game here tonight Yeah And defensively hes got some block shots as well right But Chance Moore with the transfer from St John Venture He has shown ability to get hot and get rolling and score in bunches Thats what West Virginia needs to buckle down here get some turnovers get in the open court a little bit and get some easy baskets get some energy cheering Speaking of energy trying to get this crowd involved again here tonight as well That was deflected West Virginia look they play defense in a way where you have to have offensive patience And I think Wake Forest has had good offensive patience and now theyve got a goto guy like Juke Harris Thats a great defensive set for the Mountaineers Great defense And more on the drive is fouled Thats West Virginia ball right there Right You clamp down defensively and then essentially got a shot clock violation as that one was clanged off the backboard And then you go down the other way and you make this happen Thats how West Virginia wins And Chance Moore is starting to to feel the energy return to the guys in gold right now Hes leading the way by attacking the basket All right Tomorrow our featured mens college basketball matchups Were going to get things started 100 Eastern noon central Thats on ESPN 2 The rivalry of Missouri and Kansas And then Georgetown and North Carolina comes your way at 5 on ESPN Georgetown versus North Carolina Maybe the most historic game in NCA history as Michael Jordan in the Superdome in 1982 hit the jump shot to beat Patrick Euings Georgetown and John Thompsons Georgetown team with Dean Smith at the helm for the for the Tar Hills A rematch of that game cheering Ninepoint game Akens Shot clock again Down to four Akins He puts up the three but he got a good look and he missed it And an offensive rebound by Mason Boy that is a will breaker right there West Virginia selling out every half court defensive possession Valiant time Spillers on the feed from Akens It all started with the offensive rebound Perfect defense by West Virginia but they couldnt block off They werent tough enough to limit Blake Force to one shot Thats probably going to be one for the film room right Mark with Ross High Hes like Guys we played such great defense all the way up to the end of the shot clock and then we didnt get the rebound And speaking of rebounds its more and he is not going to be denied on that one Yeah Chance Moore saying Jump on my shoulders I will carry you to the promised land number 13 bringing it here in the second half Two subs set to check in for Wake Forest at the next whistle Morriss got 11 points Were coming up on eight and a half to play in the game Its still a ninepoint lead for the Demon Deakons Harris how do you stop that finish Boy you talk about the work in the weight room he did Look he has changed his body and he has more growth to come That is a hell of a finish Harris with six points in the first half 13 in this second half and they continue to keep West Virginia at bay West Virginia plays great defense gives up the offensive rebound they become ball ccentric and Spillers goes right to the rim And then Juke Harris look at the bump right here That is strength That is athleticism That is talent Juke Harris incredible game And hes right at his average And you can see how he averages 19 points a game Hes got 19 tonight and he sat down on the bench for a large majority of the first half He only played seven minutes Hed have 30 right now if he played during that part of the game Played seven minutes of the first half This is a big stat here with the rebounding advantage mark Offensive boards 16 10 in West Virginias favor but they havent been able to convert as much Defensive rebounds 17 to seven but its its not paying equating to offense for sure Yeah And I really like what Nate Calmese has done in conducting this offense and getting the ball to Spillers getting the ball to Harris Bad pass right there Turnover opportunity for West Virginia 14 points a game over last year Theyre very efficient with those two to say the least Wake Forest shooting 48 from the field in this game West Virginia 37 Mountaineers have it down 11 Heres Huff Got it has got him going in the first half remember with those backto back threes Can he heat it up again Hes got some microwave cheering in his game Hes got 14 Crown trying to get into it on the drive and the kick Heres Harris again Got free for three and he nails it Every team needs a sit down and shut up guy when the crowds starting to get into a little bit And Juke Harris is that guy thatll make those shots on the road and tell everybody just sit down right now Ive got this under control Number two in black is special Number two in gold Got to keep an eye on him Hes got four personal fouls Thats air Jenkins Back to Huff Long three Wow Here we go But now this defense has to make a stand Wake Forest their spacing has been exceptional They have spread this gold jerseys out Theyve beaten them off the triple made them chase the ball instead cheering of needing the ball Can they do it again Five threes tonight Four of them belong to Huff who gets the ball of the steel Big possession right here Floyd almost a travel Heres Moore and hes fouled and its Spillers thats get that gets called for it cheering Oh the flow of this game Look Gold jerseys have to chase the ball and Juke Harris is shot ready on that play as the crowd was starting to get into it And honor Huff weve seen the microwave of his game He just knocked down a two Now he bangs a three Gets the crowd going in it Now Chance Moore at the at the line for two can cut this thing to seven Huff is four of 12 from threepoint range The rest of the team is one for eight and they need all they can get here at the line 15 of 21 now at the stripe Five of eight in the second half You know Mike I think at halftime Steve Forbes really emphasized look you got to spread these guys out We have to have shooters ready to shoot Weve got to have ball handlers ready to get into creases And I think Wor has done a really good job of that of spreading and making way making West Virginia chase them cheering Crowd rises cheering again This is Count Mace Bounces it for Spillers Six minutes to go in the game cheering Both teams three for their last three on the runner Coven No Offensive board Belaloo Couldnt get it to go And there is a shot clock violation cheering applause Normally when West Virginia has a big possession they like Laurent number zero in gold to get the ball in the medium post and go oneonone They also like Chance Moore attacking the rim Theres more Laurians down there as well Morant takes it in as you called it Mark And its knocked out of bounds Still West Virginia possession Yeah those two bigs Laurian and Moore both like to catch the ball at the elbow They both like to attack off the dribble And the positive derivative of that is that you get to the free throw line Mhm Its in the huff guarded by Harris How about this right now cheering cheering Hang on tight everyone Cal Nice up top for Culvin And he got it stolen for the moment by Huff but he got it back Now heres Harris for three Thats in and out Offensive rebound Cal Nice Timeout Mountaineer possession Five minutes left in this one here tonight And its Jasper Floyd that controls it Hes caught a double team Gets it out to Jenkins Thats a three And thats off to the right And its rebounded by Cal Me That was way off Now you make him play a little defense Calm me has been always attacking Well done Well executed Spillers again Calm me always has his heads up He always sees the angles for the passes 14 for Spillers on seven of 12 from the field Excellent night for him tonight Jenkins back out for Huff now on the drive on the kick Moore misses the three Kovven the rebound for a high quality shot Just didnt go down cheering I love Nate Cal and how he runs this offense He conducts like its an orchestra He knows where everybody is He knows who his best players are and he gets it to them and he cuts so well without the ball Its back to Culvin Eight to shoot Were under four minutes to go in the game Timeout coming at the next whistle Calmise inside Spillers Wow From Calise again How good is Nate Calse finding his two best players No look Outstanding Hes got his head on a swivel Hes got eyes behind his head even with the mask on So after they got it down to five its a sixth nothing run His huff is fouled and hes going to shoot free throws when we come back Nate Kalise has been the story of this half because he always has his head up He always looks for his best players and one of his two best players is Trayvon Spillers Trayvon Spillers tonight Theyre up by 11 with 331 to go I still expect a run from West Virginia but Wake Forest has done all of the the tough bluecollar work boot type of of things to win this game right now Yeah Forbes has got to be happy with his effort on this on this team right now but they still have 331 to go to try to close this out What about on the other side You know Ross Hodgej very well Spent a lot of time with him What do you think hes thinking about right now over there Fullourt pressure force turnovers right now And Jasper Floyd is a guy thats been a steel guy right at the at the tip of the diamond right there Number one in gold Hes got wingspan Hes got quickness Hes got anticipation cheering It is a ninepoint game 320 remaining One timeout left for West Virginia two for Wake Forest Possession arrow favors the Demon Deakons Look if Wake Forest just takes care of the basketball theyre going to win this game But West Virginia theyre getting after him I mean theres a foul right there They got away with it Heres Harris leans in on a three Thats no good And a big rebound there by Amir Jenkins Huff Here we go Relocated for Its a two but was on the line Its over the top of the backboard Thats happened a couple of times in his shots tonight The length of Juke Harris that time at 67 bothered the shot He had to relocate because of the length and then Juke Harris didnt really buy the fake and got right in his grill during the release Great defense by Juke Harris Heres some pressure from the Mountaineers They get it over though Wake Forest does to Spillers Give it to Nate Calse Let him make a decision Purposeful passes from your point guard Nate Calse is a guy you want with the ball making the decisions Hes got nine assists tonight Four points three boards as well Hes got it There it is Marcus said it and he finds Belaloo for the wideopen dunk Yeah purposeful passes are winning passes Again knowing your role executing your role Nate Calse again Jenkins almost a travel spinning back up top Jasper Floyd more Nice But you cant keep trading baskets You got to make a stop I dont know if you can stop Nate Calmese I mean hes playing chess while everybody else playing checkers right now Spillers There it is Harris Its a three And that may be very hurtful to say the least as they go up 12 with a minute 42 to go That was a huge three as Huffs three is blocked by Cal Mace But right into the hands here of Floyd and hes caught in a double team Back out for Huff A step back three Offensive board fields Jenkins back to Huff Huff again Hes trying He just cant get it to go And its out of bounds off of Wake Forest And a fresh 20 on the shot clock but that used up a lot of time Mark And theyre still down by 12 And youve got to credit Wake Wake Forest and their defense Theyve got a long group out there and they are challenging shot after shot after shot Now theyve got to get a defensive rebound But credit this Wake Forest defense They have bothered West Virginia on every shot they have Huff Theyll let him do that And a timeout by the Mountaineers And that is their final timeout of the night And going to watch that one on the way home Yeah Im going to listen to it on the way home Im going to be all over that one Im going to have my ESPN app Thats right Im ready to go ACC championship Im pulling for Duke Knocked out of bounds by Huff West Virginia possession still or Wake Forest possession still excuse me James Madison Tain Going to hear those names tomorrow How about Duke basketballwise 10 Oh my goodness Cameron Boozer Holy You did a game at Lets change roles here Youre the analyst Oh you got Steo Never mind cheering The Boozer is awesome to answer your question inside and the reverse layup goes down for Jackson Fields 55 seconds left Remember no timeout for West Virginia Spinning out of it is Cal Nice Now you play keep away to Harris I thought he got fouled there They didnt they didnt give it to him Jasper Foy tried to wrap him up They do need to foul Time is of the essence here and West Virginia Thats Thats sure why theyre not fouling here as theyre going to use up some valuable clock Yeah they cant foul now Yeah And Harris puts the exclamation point on this one for Wake Forest 28 and hes one away from tying his careerh high We got 20 seconds left And the runner is good by Moore cheering Boy Wake Forest goes on the road This has been a tough gritty physical not a domination but theyve controlled this game for sure Big time win for Wake Forest They get it done here on the road in Charleston as coach Haj and
