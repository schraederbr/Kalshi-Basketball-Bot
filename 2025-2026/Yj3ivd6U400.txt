conference before we get in to conference play Cincinnati in black Clemson in white Our officials this afternoon Roger Ays Courtney Green and Chris Merllo We are underway Should be a close competitive game Holiday hoops presented by K Jewelers on ESPN Its Cincinnati that starts with the basketball Randolph alluded to it The Bearcats have struggled for offense this season Jizzel James should he help that but he is not in the starting lineup just yet Working his way back Shot clock down to seven Pull up pop off the mark from Krissa He struggled to shoot the ball in a Bearcats uniform As we take a look at the Clemson starting five this is a Tigers team that has played 12 games this season They have not had a 20point scoreer I think thats one of the more interesting stats in all of college basketball to have that many games and not a 20point score on a season But its by committee Its all hands on deck and theyre 10 deep in how they play Balance scoring for the Tigers as Godfrey goes to the floor Hes tied up The Clinton ball underneath their own hoop Godfrey in some pain there Didnt seem like he went down that hard I think he fell on the knee applause Hes saying hes good So two teams that are going to make you earn it You said yeah one of the two most consistent defensive teams in college basketball so points will be at a premium those hustle plays Both coaches are calling for that today Yeah the way they go about it is a little different Cincinnati is more than passing lanes and their pressure traps trying to force turnovers Clemson just kind of suffocates Its just everybody ball in bodies in front of the ball Everybodys rotating toward the basketball Porter knocks down the three cheering It opens the scoring for Clemson This is the Bearcats starting five Day Thomas probably the most consistent player for Cincinnati and he gets a backcourt boost with Gizzel James expected to come off the bench The freshman misfires Don Abayv He has shown flashes for Cincinnati They need him to spark it offensively DOWN LOW TWOHANDED SLAM RJ Godfrey on a rack attack He gets it that low Hes going to try to put you in the rim like that Youve got to stay between him and the basket He gets an angle Hes just too physically strong for the interior of a Bearcats And theres a turnover cheering and applause West Miller Cincinnati head coach said careless turnovers inconsistent shooting has plagued them this season You see Goffrey there just wedging out the area He beats everyone down the floor And again you got to get in front of him Either front him when he gets that deep Hes got to stay between him and the basket Heres Dylan Hunter His show now Hes been a great role player for Clemson in his four years for the Tigers Dump down low Good ball movement leads to a wideopen three Dylan Hunter makes the Bearcats pay cheering and its an early timeout for Cincinnati head coach Wes Miller Got to love the start for Brad Brown Nailed ball movement Unselfish play Everyone touches it The open guy gets the ball and just scores Just the way they play Again we talked about that stat Not a 20point score You see why everybodys getting in on the act cheering Great start here for the Clemson Tigers What a start for Clemson 8 nothing And you you look at their season best win comes against a Georgia team thats now ticked into the top 25 But if he can add a neutral sight win against a Big 12 team at Cincinnati obviously youd love to have the second half against BYU back But overall youd have to say a strong nonconference performance for Brad Brownell in this Tigers team Thats where Brad Barnell has this program And both of these teams are picked And where theyre picked in their league thats NCAA tournament expectations And this matchup is critical I mean theres a lot of these nonconference matchups here today And youre looking to punch your ticket in March Wins like this matter Is thrown the first punch And for Cincinnati look you know this game you are desperate for a quad one resume win which this would be a a program desperate to be back in March Madness for the first time since 2019 They have come out on the back foot AbaiV He got a good look after the hesitation but missed him Like to see Abay attack the paint there His size and ability to get to THE RIM WELLING LINES UP THE three and drills it Clemsons made four in a row Clemsons really high on Welling They feel like hes going to get all conference consideration as the year goes on Youre talking about a center that has threepoint range as he showed his ability to shoot it from distance which is big because hes going to pull Charm away from the rim Bob and Miller a three Nothing but air The big men for the Bearcats Cham and Miller are now a combined four of 30 from three They keep taking them though Godfrey working in the post Misfires Thats part of the issue I think with Cincinnati Theyre settling Theyre not a really good team Theyre 0 for four from the threepoint line here All the shots theyve taken in this game so far have been from three and you shoot 30 on the year And I think thats part of the identity we were talking about in the open Its just you want to take those shots but you cant hope they go in At some point you got to make the adjustment Stolen away Day Thomas Maybe the Bearcats can get something in transition Big struggle in the half court set so far Miller launches another three Misfires This is not good shots I think you get got a steal in transition You want to attack the rim Get a paint touch here Get her Bearcats You struggle to score Youve already spotted the Tigers 110 run here Start this game Welling open again Missed it this time Cincinnati needs something easy 0 for five from the floor so far applause And theres another turn But they started it inside out They got paint touches at the rim Goffrey with the dunk to get them going And Wellings ability to stretch the defense as a stretch five really makes it difficult for the Cincinnati defense Cincinnati comes out shows a little pressure defensively If they can get their transition going defense to offense has been the best recipe for the Bearcats but they continue to struggle in half court games That goes begging from Jake Wallen that position They want to force action force you out of your plays Theyve allowed Clemson to run their actions and they run actions as well as anyone in the half court Good feed inside through the double team A missed layup Zella got a good look Couldnt finish it Theres a gap on the rim right now You get your first twopoint field goal at the rim You got to come away with the basket there or at least field goal Cincinnati has started 0 for six from the floor Its allowed Clemson to separate early This is Bearcat defense got to have a lot of body movement ball movement Shot clock down to one WALLEN BEATS THE buzzer and its a 14 nothing start applause Wen more of a glue guy capable shooter Hes doing a little bit of everything for Bradell And we talked about balanced scoring for Clemson Well every starter has already scored before the Bearcats have a bucket Needed it and got it The freshman Sha Abayv finally puts it in for Cincinnati with 6 and 12 minute or 5 and 12 minutes to get your first basket though And he has shotmaking ability Hes a freshman that you got to allow the game to come to him really good at creating oneonone opportunities for himself but its learning to be patient on the offensive end of the floor They got to I think put the ball in his hands allow him to get aggressive Shot clock down to two Godfrey got a good look missed it and its Cincinnati basketball And here comes Gizzel James A unique story in todays landscape leading scorer last year for the Bearcats Started all 35 games for them a year ago was dismissed over the summer for some personal issues but never deenrolled from the school and went back to West Miller and said I want to be back a part of the team He said Well youre not going to be able to play So he comes back as a practice player a scout team guy after a fivemon absence And in the three weeks he has earned his way back to being on the court And lets face it Cincinnati needs him offensively for a team that has struggled without him Its a welcoming addition for West Miller in this group Hes just another guard that comes off ball screens is able to get to the rim and hes scoring but hes also can create other opportunities for his teammates And theyre going to need him to do that for a team thats just looking for an offensive identity And right now I think theyre just settling too much behind a threepoint line for a team that struggles and only shoots 30 from the threepoint line anyway One for seven from three so far Clemson four of seven from deep They go inside Davidson applause How about Nick Davidson the transfer from Nevada Theyre trying to get him going He has struggled offensively in a Clemson uniform so far Surprising to see him struggle offensively He averaged 15 points a game for Nevada But when you get mid majors coming up to high majors not everyone figures it out right away Hes had a little bit of a slow start Theyre hoping to get him going just in time for conference play Harris floater doesnt drop cheering Clemson a 163 lead as we take under 12 minutes to go in this first half They have dominated the opening eight minutes Right now the Bearcats are just chasing defensively now Davidson backto back baskets for him Another Cincinnati timeout applause Clemson and ball on a Sunday afternoon If Royys here hes played some golf I I bet you that hes morning tea time Yeah hes Roy got around and I can bet I bet better believe that hes here supporting West Absolutely It of course went against Brad Brown now for many years in the ACC ACE BUCKNER FLYING TO THE RIM cheering And West Millers really surprised at this team start here Just lack of dasical passing A lot of passing on the perimeter Got to get the ball in the paint either post ups or off the dribble trying to go for an easy one but even the alioop cant connect for Cincinnati Look at the passing Ace just comes in Thats how you get yourself going You get in the game running get a layup Ace Buckner now getting those minutes left by Zack Fosterss ACL injury Yeah tore his ACL on Tuesday night in the win against South Carolina really talented freshman guard and Brad Brownell said I dont know how well look without him He cheering was really important His athleticism they look pretty good Yeah he gives him a different dimension His speed in half court thing broke down was an advantage for the Tigers with that second unit So far they had needed nothing to worry about on the offensive end of the floor here today Davidson a three Its good AND CLEMSONS UP 20 WOW applause cheering Bearcats looking for answers here Youve got to get The problem is their identities on the defensive end of the floor and they cant get a stop offensively Take open shots Youve got to stop dripping around the perimeter and attack the paint here Easier said than done against this Clemson defense Another three goes begging Cincinnati now one for 10 from the floor Eight of those shots have been from three and theyve turned it over five times When your offense is struggling as bad as Bearcats are struggling you just it puts so much pressure on your defense Buckner crafty move Couldnt finish it though Hes coming off 197 rebounds in that win against South Carolina Thats not a good possession Theyve gotten this lead by passing and moving the ball not dribbling And plays like that will get Bearcats back in this game Kick out for a three Celesteine cant finish it This is a painful watch offensively for Cincinnati Three points in almost 11 minutes of basketball Day Thomas trying to get an easy two here and he does with a onehanded flush If Cincinnati is going to make an attempt to get back into this game its got to be the defensive end of the floor Pick sixes like that pressure you got to get Clemson to take quicker shots Right now there just two lack of days to go on the defensive end of the floor Hunter did a nice job to get Thomas up in the air 235 lead Cincinnati just ended their four and a half minute scoring drought Brad Brown now alltime winning as coach in program history Just won his 300th game at Clemson You were joking with him and we just saw Roy Williams in the crowd Hes become the veteran the old man of the ACC The grandpa of the ACC How about that And I Ill say this you know the last couple of years the NCAA tournament runs theyve had some incredible offensive teams This year hes going to have to do it a different way Hes doing it with defense and that has certainly been on full display today Jay Hes always done it with defense Hes been one of the better defensive teams in in the ACC doing his run When he gets really good offensive players you see the run that he made the last couple years in the Elite 8 This team is deeper than last years team He doesnt have the highend talent you know that he had a year ago The allconerence caliber talent but hes 10 deep Second unit brought a level of athleticism and speed to him and they just kept you off balance with just fresh bodies and rotating at you at all times Shot clock down to four A buy Thats just not a good shot Thats a settle And he struggled with shot selection as talented as he is with his size and length and creativity Get in the paint create for yourself and your teammates Get to the free throw line right now Fumbles the rebound Its a shot clock violation Ball with the Tigers up 18 Surprised Cincinnatis not picking up the pressure here Fullourt pressure Well clearly the Bearcats are struggling in the half court set Two of their five points came in transition You think they want to create more of those opportunities as Porter hits another one Porter is a scorer now Three level scorer Hes adjusting to Brad Brownells system James hunts a shot in transition No good Now Cincinnatis in a dilemma Jay because you got to get James going but you dont want him taking quick shots on the first side You still want to get on the second or third side Great drive there Dylan Hunter just they go as he goes I thought there was a foul early They did not call kept going and got another foul at the rim A lot of contact there Dylan Hunter is an old school player Randolph Hes an endangered species of the year 2025 Four years same school Hes developed and gotten better every year without having to transfer You know role player for the first three years Now its his show Well he played with his brother for a couple of years right I mean it it that helps you stay Yeah I mean you got to stay with that Oh hes carved out a niche is playing with a high level of confidence right now Hes seen how the lay of the land how it should be done here Comfortable here and its his team and he is leading these guys Dont look at the stats but hes playing really well on both sides of the basketball Dylan Hunter without question the leader of this group Day Thomas picks up his dribble Cham just throws it up there This offense has been tough to watch so far in the first half but the scoreboard reflects it A 22point lead for Clemson Credit Clemson though This is a clinic right now I mean Cincinnatis just chasing all over the floor Porter again Justin Porter just drilled his third three of this first half Cincinnati picked this up You and I be shopping online finishing our Christmas shopping laughter Hey credit Clemson because nothings come easy Even that make by Cham contested He makes a shot like that You pat him on his behind tell him great good job Keep it moving Youre not going to win a game taking contested shots like that But thats just telling you the struggles the Bearcats offense Even with that makes Cincinnati shooting under 20 Clemson shooting 61 Although that one way off the mark from Wallin Pace needs to pick up here for Cincinnati That quick shots Cham backto back makes for him Mustafa Cham trying to inject some life into this Bearcats team Someone has to get it going offensively And at 7 foot2 thats not exactly his game the sophomore from Sagal but finally something going Its a hot start here skipping it on the weak side Porter as a shooter but again paint touches here Th great shot there Scored the last five for the Bearcats again Hes struggling from the threepoint line as his teammate Thats just third threes only shooting 13 on the year But throw all the percentages out of the window right now Cincinnati you got to compete Your identities on the defensive end of the floor and youre getting carved up right now by the Clemson Tigers This is a new look Clemson team You know Brad Brownell has had the luxury of having a lot of guys return in this program this year outside of Dylan Hunter a lot of new faces but theyve bought in to what has made Clemson successful which is you play really hard defense Weve seen that in this first half Spread the ball very balanced offensively Jay Brad Brown was one of the more difficult coaches to prepare for because they would run so many sets There was so much information He felt like early on this group he was paralyzing them with information but so many sets So he said Hey I trimmed it down a little bit we dont run as much offense as we used to but as we get into conference play hell get back into that Hes like his guys are responding really well And he said hes lessened the ingame adjustments theyve made from previous years A good game plan from the start today And another turnover Six in this first half for Cincinnati I think Clemsons turned it into eight points off turnovers Looking for more Porter catch and shoot Hes had the hot hand but missed it that time Clemsons on the offensive end of the floor was playing with a lot more pace A lot of dribbling here by the Bearcats A lot of oneonone play now Contested at the rim Nothings come easy in this first half And its another turnover Ace Buckner with a head of steam Contact No call Cincinnati turning up the pace and an opportunity to get two from the line for Sincere Harris This is Cincinnatis best offense Get out in transition Put your head down Get in the paint Stop settling for threepointers right now Cincinnati here Look for fullourt pressure after the free throw Bowl season continues tomorrow with the famous Idaho Potato Bowl Its played on the Blue Turf out in Boise Washington State and Utah State Kicks off early 2 Eastern 1100 am Pacific on ESPN in the ESPN app Nothing has come easy offensively for Cincinnati and the Bearcats go 0 for two from the line I I dont know where their offense is going to come from because also this is not only are they a poor threepoint shooting team theyre a poor free throw shooting team only shooting 63 from the free throw line and cant come away missing both of those free throws Buckner missed the layup Foul called Hes got some good explosion to his game The red shirt freshman I mean again dribble penetration reversal ball reversal Get it to the second side Everybody gets it Defensive breakdown And in Cincinnati youre hugging your man Nobody wants to come and help because everybodys involved Youre afraid your guys going to score Difficult to difficult to deal with But this is where your leadership comes in Youve got to stick to your principles and theyre looking for answers Getting a well earned break here But this Tiger group is coming in coming at you with waves Everybodys comfortable playing 10 deep Leading scoreer averages 11 points a game Everybodys just falls right behind Yeah very comfortable sharing the basketball for Clemson Its been a lot of isolation ball for Cincinnati I think thats the most impressive thing about Clemson You get this many EVERYBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT GETTING NEW BODIES Baba Miller at the foul line When we come back Bearcats looking for life down 23 in this first half And its not even close right now And this is just Bobcats again Make this free throw try to establish some type of fullcourt pressure win the next 3 minutes and 56 seconds And this is the disappointing part Theyve struggled on the free throw line We talked about it And its just as a coach theres nothing you can do You just cheering and applause you cant simulate game pressure And after a while you start missing But its become psychological for your players Finally get one to go Yeah First make of the afternoon from the line West Millers team four of 19 from the floor Two of 11 from three and one for four from the foul line Here comes the pressure and its hard to set pull court pressure when youre not scoring But try to speed Clemson up a little bit Well if theres a point guard in all of college basketball that you trust against pressure its Dylan Hunter He takes care of the ball A three assist to one turnover ratio which is the best career numbers in the history of Clemson basketball Theyre not going to beat themselves And he has established himself Hes not the scoreers brother was but his floor game is just as strong Its going to get this team in their offense get the ball to the right players Great pass leads to the slam Carter Welling Thats what happens when everybody touches it and everybody scores Youre hugging to your defender You dont want to help Weak side single side action and no ones there to help And cheering well hes tried to tear the rim off And another turnover Eight turnovers of this first half for a Cincinnati offense that is beyond struggling They lift that weak side defender He goes chasing No one there to help Just simple ball screen Single side action This is tough for I mean Cincinnati I I mean we may have to send West Miller some PeptoBismol or something at halftime I mean this is what do you what do you say to your guys right now They have got to figure out a way to I mean just thats the type of defensive effort you want and you give up that I mean and theyre making shots now Well theyre confident Yeah theyre just its a lot easier to shoot when youre up 25 I mean theyre not uncomfortable and thats a surprise because they have been a really good defensive team and they are getting carved up here in the first half Yeah you said two of the best defensive teams in the country cheering Well Clemson has held their end of the bargain holding Cincinnati to 11 Foul called cheering And again everybodys hugging their hugging their man Hes already shown you he can knock down shots Hes just a step behind And things just not used to guarding a guy that can handle the ball from the rim to shoot threes effective in the post Hes usually around the rim so he can protect the rim and they dont have that And thats an adjustment Bigs that can stretch the floor throw your game plan off when you got a rim protecting big He wants to be inside the lane Now hes got to be up playing on the perimeter and that affects the other guys because their help is gone Hes been their best offensive player here Hes got six of Cincinnatis 12 And this is a Cincinnati fan base that you know certainly wasnt happy after the loss to Eastern Michigan Then you lose your cross town shootout game against Xavier get blown out by Georgia Youre coming into this game hoping you can salvage the nonconference and you havent even been competitive in this first half You have not Flip is prepared for the pressure Smith shoot around this morning preparing for the man pressure and his own pressure full Belling went for the onehanded slam Little too ambitious there Heres Baba Miller and he goes for a onehanded slam Neither one of those guys had a chance at making those dunks They took off so far away from the basket Trying to put on a show on a Sunday afternoon Jizzel James knocks down the three in transition Thats what they want this game paid at up and down pace for Cincinnati Did not want this game to slow down at all Continue with your fullourt pressure Got to sell out again Try to get this under 20 going in the half Heres Buckner Shot clock down to six Good defense from Cincinnati Thats more like it for the Bearcats Keep the ball moving James in attack mode Pull up pop Sticks it cheering There he goes for Cincinnati now Get out of all the dribbling Get the ball movement This is the pace up and down cheering Favor Cincinnati when hes Brad Barnells had enough of that Seven nothing run for Cincinnati season here in Greenville Winter Invitational And its Clemson whos the dominant in this first half Although Cincinnati a mini run before the break 7 nothing Bearcats run Foul called on the reach in Cincinnati did have a foul to give No run No one runs better high low action than Clemson So if youre big got to be got to be prepared for the duck in that time things caught off guard and Goffrey is a load He gets behind you and ducks in on you and you dont see him You have no chance Just gets so low His center of gravity covers up so much space so strong His role is expanded since hes transferred back from Georgia They get it to go rejected on his way to the rim Day Thomas wiped it Big time play there Day Thomas getting up challenging the big man at the rim Thomas stepped back three Missed it The threes have just not fall for Cincinnati Three of 13 in this first half and Clemson can hold for the final shot 10 seconds to work with I think the runup ball screen with Davidson here Thats what they do Hunter splits two Blocked and that finishes a first half that Cincinnati fans are hoping to forget applause The Bearcats do close it on a seven nothing So an opportunity with that fresh in the minds of the players coaches and fans to put that right and have a strong second half with a 20point lead Important for the Bearcats to win the first TV timeout These next four minutes you got to come out and make a statement here Put a little pressure on Clemson Tigers That 21point flip was just 12 days ago Now you dont have AJ to manage that That might be laughter a good point one of the requirements to have But lets see if someone can step up here I was about to ask you the recipe for a comeback and its just chip away Chip away cheering And once defensively though even on a miss youre down Youre denying the outlet Pressures picked up on the center of the floor Godfrey all alone Missed it Cincinnati only six made shots in the first half and eight turnovers Got plenty of time You still run your offense there JJ Thomas into the paint cheering trying to spin his way free Baba Miller cant clean up the spill I think Baba had a little contact there Just a good call Theyre letting him play inside Kick ball there off Cham Good job there by Tom with the kickball because Wellings had Bob Miller buried underneath the rim and the bigs are winning a battle of the feet inside Theyre not allowing you to three quart and get around Theyre giving their perimeter GUYS AN ANGLE WELLING SPLITS TWO cheering COUNT IT Plus the foul Carter Welling leads all scorers with 12 and a chance to complete the end one Yeah you gamble and you miss Again this is a skilled front line guys Theyre not just interior players Theyre all capable of putting it on the deck Someones got to step up and put their body in front of them and take a charge Oh we said it right after we tipped off Clemson through 12 games has not had a player score 20 Their highest scoring performance was Ace Buckners 19 points against South Carolina Wellings got 12 He He might get 20 Im hoping I mean 12 games into the season and you dont have a 20 point score I love the team balance but thats unheard of Yeah a testament to balance as Harris trains a three trying to breathe some life into Cincinnati A team that trailed by as many as 27 in the first half This is the style of pace you want to play Little too chaotic though And now Clemson has a threeon two Porter goes right into Baba Miller and draws a foul Just so difficult to score They get numbers Theyre trying to play with pace They dug themselves in such a big hole You go into the offensive glass you forget to get back in defensive transition Giving Clemson numbers and now you got a foul Roger just walked past and asked me to score the Cowboys game I just shook my head laughter told him it wasnt good cheering and applause Now speaking of the Cowboys Monday Night Football continues this week Big time playoff implications The 49ers and the Colts ABC ESPN Disney Plus the app Kickoff 800 pm Eastern time on Monday Sto 44 years old coming back playing How great is that Its amazing story Thatd be like you trying to lace him up right now Never happened Yeah Yeah Another three cheering Day Thomas drills this one And Cincinnati with a couple of triples continue to try and claw back at the start of this second half Lets continue to compete cheering A mismatch on the weak side Someones got to come over Help Harris inside 5 seconds on the shot clock They never got it to Welling on that mismatch Hunter leaves it short Baba Miller squeaks out hammers it home and cheering for the first time in this entire game Cincinnati with some juice switching five on that possession there Thats one of the advantages you have when you switch You got your big man on the top of the Kha when they switch Sometimes that defender comes up to pick up the point guard leaves that front line player alone like that for an uncontested layup Oh my god And the Bearcats with some defensive intensity that was cheering missing in the first half and they force another turnover Godfrey have his toe on the end line This is more like it for UC Great job Look at the physicality here Just putting his chest on Godfrey as he steps out of bounds knocks him off balance This is the Bearcat defense we thought wed see at the tip off Its a little cheering late to arrive here in Greenwood after a first half to forget Cincinnati doubling up Clemson in the second half Eight to four Can you make enough shots Put pressure on Nice move here cheering Everything but the finish for Gizzel James Offensive rebound Harris Count it cheering PLUS THE FOUL applause SINCERE Harris cheering with a threepoint Not the same Cincinnati defense The offense struggled but they did close the final two minutes on a seven nothing run That cut the Clemson lead to 20 And now with the and cheering one completed by Harris Theyre on an eight nothing run to make it 13 And for Clemson fans remember BYU led that game or Clemson excuse me led that game by 22 cheering They were in this spot 12 days ago You dont want to get it to where the panic starts to seep in and you go is this happening again to us Cincinnati had started this second half strong enough to put a little doubt in the Tigers mind just that that 21point collapse was not that long ago Clemson trying to weather that 184 run going back to the end of the first half Look at the defense getting through screens now Day Thomas swipes it away right to the rim Missed it GIZZEL JAMES FOLLOWS IT UP HE NEARLY had an and one Hell have to settle for two from the line Completely different looking team right now Defensively theyre fighting through dribble handoffs In the first half they were going under Now theyre blowing them up Theyre doing to Clemson what Clemson did to them in the first half Just being really disruptive pressuring the basketball Great job of creating turnovers Only two turnovers in the first half for Clemson and already three in the second half If youre West Miller and Cincinnati fans you have to wonder why wasnt this the Cincinnati mentality from tip off Why did it wait so late at the end of that first half and now in the second half But better late than never Plenty of time left He just has to bottle up whatever he said at halftime Nine nothing run over the last two minutes and its a 12point game Lets also add Jay Remember Zack Foster out with an ACL his ball handling it Backup point guard and his speed is something that you need Welling lines up the three Missed it And now its Clemson thats cheering settling for the deep threes of the shot selection THAT leads the misses Gets a little tighter now Harris going right at Welling That rolls off the rim No good Offensive rebound finds Thomas GOT IT DAY cheering THOMAS And its a ninepoint game cheering This is the Bearcat team we thought wed see at the start They have finally arrived Lead under 10 now cheering Clemson desperate to stop the bleeding Shot clock down to four Buckner in the paint Missed him Its going to stay Clemson basketball cheering Just a really good offensive rebound Great time to find a three Sincere with the rebound finds Dayday Thomas and he knocks down a three ball We have ourselves a game now Jay a 27point lead for Clemson is down to just nine Weve said it a few times but worth repeating 12 days ago in the identical spot to this against BYU and they lost that lead Jay without question And thats in the back of some of these players mind right now You start pressing a little bit ball stops moving there But big time make cheering and applause thats the guy Dylan Hunter delivers Got to put the ball in his hands We talked about his leadership there Thats a big move Big time move there and finish by Dylan Hunter cheering Ends a three and a half minute scoring drought cheering Thomas nice step back Got it again cheering NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM OF THE NET FOR DAY THOMAS cheering JAKE nice step back there Created space Snatch back Created some separation and knocked down to Jake He pulled that out of the Randolph Childrens playbook cheering as Porter flies to the rim and misses cheering Now the rim is just starting to tighten up a little bit Those were the shots that went in the first half and just a little sped up here cheering Celestine a chance to cut it to five and missed it cheering Cincinnati with all the momentum after a first half to forget Theyre right back in it Davidson a three Got it cheering Big three for Nick Davidson Davidsons been big Hadnt been the offensive cheering player that they thought they were getting from Nevada but today he has stepped up cheering knocked down a couple of threes Thomas HES GOT THE HOT HAND THREE cheering STRAIGHT threes for Day Thomas were saying it was hard to watch Well right now Thomas its Cincinnati making it look easy And they trailed by as many as 27 in that first half They have cut the lead down to eight And now Ace Buffner is in and the Hunters on the bench How does Clemson respond Well now with this lineup you want to play through your front line guys Not put so much pressure on the red shirt freshman guard but Buck Buckner RIGHT ON Q DRILLS THE THREE cheering Great applause action coming out Buckner Former Clemson Titan Greg Buckner not afraid in the moment He has confidence He knows what it takes Trying to answer with a three and its an airball Its even better when the Clemson Tigers are enjoy doing it This is a very philanthropic team and Dylan Hunter over the summer took off his own shoe before a homeless man had a job interview You love stories like that What Brad Brownell and Clemson fans dont love is this second half performance Another air ball and Cincinnati outscoring Clemson in this second half 212 James nice turnaround Missed it though cheering Bearcats back in this game after they were left for dead Clemson desperate to bring the momentum back to their side Buckner Nice move The blow by cheering and the floater falls I tell you what I the guard play has been impressive because were talking about this exact foster saying I got this I mean he scored the last five points and he looks like a seasoned vet out of red shirt freshman cheering Davidson reaches in and fouls Miller But youre right Buckner been terrific cuz this is what they thought they were going to get from Zack Foster His ability to beat defenders off the bounce At least Buckner is doing so Knocked down a three earlier Scored the last five for the Tigers and at a critical point in the game when their leader was on the bench Dylan Hunter has so much confidence You know Foster goes down early with that torn ACL against South Carolina on Tuesday night And Buckner steps in 197 seven rebounds and hes picked up where he left off He competes now Hes competitive guy and hes showing you that stepping up when hes getting the opportunity Its one thing to be given opportunity Its another to be ready when an opportunity presents itself So cheering Jel James trying to do an alleyoop to his 7 foot2 teammate but somehow overshot 7 foot2 Its hard to do Not many guys would have caught that lob Well James still trying to get his footing This is just his second game of the season Started all 35 games a year ago for the Bearcats Was dismissed over the summer for personal issues Came back to the cheering team after a fivemon absence Theyre happy to have him back and to be fair with him Jay its going to take some time Yeah cheering West Miller told us doesnt want to put a lot of pressure on him and expectations but its a his skill set is welcome He does have the ability to score the balls Another def potential guard with creating pressure creating opportunities for everyone else and really good passer out of ball screen actions pressure here Can they sustain the pressure Davidson draws the foul cheering Midway through this second half Cincinnatis done well to get within striking distance But now West Millers team at another scoring drought nearing three minutes and its allowed Clemson to add to their cushion Yeah applaud the kisses for that Calling for the contact there Davis was set Stood his ground Yeah Wall feeds it in Gfrey stepped out of bounds Another turnover for Clemson Second time here Gone found himself underneath the basket What happens is when he gets it theyre coming in and theyre putting their chest on him and its knocking him off balance Usually a low man wins Thats RJ Goffrey but two times tonight hes been standing straight up in the air been pushed off THE SPOT THOMAS AGAIN HIS FIFTH three in this second half A Thomas is hot now and hes shooting from a parking lot Its dangerous for a Clemson Tiger team thats struggling cheering And an offensive foul called against Godfrey gives the ball back to Cincinnati in the red hot hands of Dayday Thomas coming off that baseline runner Ace Buckner gets caught in the screen and Day Thomas knocks down his fifth three And here again I think Goffrey was set cheering The officials are over at the table to review this I thought Goffrey was set there and since he just tried three the entire first half they have turned it on in this second half Day Thomas has connected on five triples Heat check missed it cheering applause They say it was off Cincinnati last Clemson ball cheering I think they made the right call I think its the right arm there Well unless Miller was kind of looking to his bench Should I review this I You cant because you only have that one timeout with nine minutes to play You cant risk it No you cant Too much basketball left But at this point in the game youre still fighting here Travel cheering and applause And those are the growing pains of losing Zack Foster in the increased minutes to Buckner in the back court with Dylan Hunter as youre going to have a couple more turnovers than youre accustomed to Yeah Ra Buckner right now has got to pick it up on the defensive end of the floor because hes guarding Day Thomas now And you got to know hes playing with a different mindset and approach here in the second half Clemson six second half turnovers after only two in the cheering first half Ball on the floor and IT FALLS TO BUCKNER WHO SLAMS IT HOME cheering RIGHT PLACE RIGHT time for Ace Buckner Sometimes its better to be lucky cheering Wide open three off the mark cheering Davidson left it way short cheering Defense to offense Thats what Cincinnati has been at its best Harris scooped to the hoop for two This is the way Cincinnati wants the game to look Just scoring in transition More importantly just really aggressive in transition after a made or miss Do it the first half BUT gotten it under 10 here once in the second half Clemsons leaking old The turnovers continue to much stronger to start the season and I think a good bounceback year for the Tar Hills Trimble I think that team can go from really good to borderline great when he gets his legs up under him His ability to be a an elite defender Conference play right around the corner for everybody Cincinnatis got a gauntlet cheering in the Big 12 Clemson in the ACC This is really the last opportunity for a marquee nonconference win Boba Miller traveled 7 minutes to play as youre looking to stamp that resume A quad one win for West Miller was on the table They fell down by 27 points to Brad Brownells team An inspired first half performance and now just trying to hang on here Final seven minutes of a 10point lead Yeah theyve got to fight the leads coming back on the basket but they cant let up here in the defensive end of the floor Brown was yelling at his guys that cheering actions are behind you when you drive Dont look to the strong side look to the weak side like that Good ball movement Porter misses the three and a foul on the ensuing rebound will keep the ball with Clemson And Clemson did a much better job in the first half than theyve done in the second half of doing that Getting the ball to the second and third side moving the defense yelling at his truth to get back to that not just settle for the first side attack Really difficult against this Cincinnati defense here Theyre playing right in front of the Tigers bench and Brad Brownell has given them an earful and he calls a timeout here Brad Brownell has not been happy with his team to stick to their identity They dont have a guy They dont have a goto guy right So this is where you just continue to run your offense and do what youve done all game long Just be unselfish Drive the pass Welling rejected by Ch And Cincinnati dialed in on defense gets another stop Cincinnati defense is really difficult to attack from the first side Again first half they did a much better job of driving past You see the amount of Look at the bodies in the paint near the basketball Drive past that Going with some fullcourt pressure trying to disrupt the Bearcats rhythm Yeah theres a slow leak Theres air leaking out of the tires there for Clemson on the offensive end of the floor Five turnovers the last five minutes Theyve got to defend well and try to get some easy baskets Someone else besides Ds got to get scored Right on Q Celesteine the Canadian makes it a cheering sevenpoint game This is the closest it is closest it has been since the first half cheering Look at the pressure now Theyre pressuring the bigs Theyre active SO CRAFTY ACE Buckner delivers cheering Buckner put Dame in his spin cycle I think hes spinning in circles still We dont know where he is cheering All people youre looking for from Clemson youre not looking for the red shirt freshman but he is delivering at a critical moment here in this game Shot clock down to seven James pull up pop Missed it cheering Battle for the rebound One by Baba MILLER WHO CLEANS UP THE SPILL Thats when hes at his best Not playing on the perimeter Its altering shots at the rim attacking the offensive glass And heres another turnover Threeon one for the Bearcats A LOB AND A MISSED cheering LAYUP CINCINNATI HAD A THREEON one and they cant convert A golden chance to make it a fivepoint game for the first time since it was 5 nothing in this game Just simple bounce pass Its a threeon one What a missed opportunity with Cincinnati having all the momentum Yeah you dont get style points for that Got to make the solid play cheering Just isnt the time necessarily to throw lobs Well Cincinnati its been a valiant effort to battle back in this game But Clemson still in the drivers seat cheering Good bucket inside with Godfrey Great pocket pass there by Buckner again Again hes hes scoring and assisting on a lot of plays here down the stretch Harris going right at Godfrey He gives up a lot of size in that matchup cheering and its well defended applause Four minutes to play Clemson a ninepoint lead And an offensive foul called against Davidson Cincinnati getting the ball back trying to complete what would be a was Day Thomas It is five threes that brought the Bearcats back But on the last handful of possessions they have not gone to number one in black Yeah he needs to be the guy No one else is in double figures He leads this team with 17 points Again five threes in the second half Youve got to put the ball in his hands CH on the block Shot clock down to eight Bodying up with Davidson Turnaround Missed it Offensive rebound Shot clock does not reset Another offensive board Its 10 on the afternoon for the Bearcats Can they cash in YES COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL MUSTAFA CHAM NEVER GAVE UP on that possession Mustafa Cham had his moments earlier in this game He was their best offensive player in the first half cheering Great time there to get active in the second half scoring margin and the scoring column Great move for him Struggling with his first move They going back right back to him cheering completes the threepoint play and for the first time cheering since it was 5 nothing Its a twopossession game Cincinnati theyve battled all the way back with 314 to play Good sign for Cincinnati Jay Theyre making free throws now Struggling the first half missing their first three Its not a good free throw shooting team and they score free throws and field goals They can set their defense Who could have predicted this finish when it was 3811 in the first half Two two possession game under three minutes to play Buckner in attack mode Missed it cheering This is what youre seeing The problem with Clemson is that theyre a balanced team but they dont have a guy thats the goto guy This is you know theyre missing Chase Hunter That was Chase Hunters role and so far this afternoon Ace Buckner seems to be the guy CH on a clear out GOT IT AGAIN MUSTAFA Cham is taking over and its a fourpoint game cheering as Lance 72 No ones going to bother that release This turns and elevates Clemson is desperate for the finish line Two minutes to go Godfrey cheering powers IT UP AND IN GREAT job by Grey filling the body using the rim for protection We got a game here Everyone on their feet cheering Its a neutral sight game in Greenville but theres a lot of Orange willing the Tigers to the finish line Thomas trying to squeeze it in to Miller whos fouled Risky pass but it pays off Both guys going inside here cheering Tom just turns baseline uses his length shoots over Goffrey not to be undone Quick spin baseline uses the rim cheering to the shot Wont get blocked What a finish here cheering cheering Baba Miller makes the first You know foul applause shooting has been a huge problem for Cincinnati this season Outside of Day Thomas whos terrific at 94 cheering The rest of the team 58 Big one coming for Ba Miller cheering Got it Back to a fourpoint game Cincinnati sets up their fullcourt pressure Theyre manto man The Tigers turn it over cheering After only two turnovers in the first half Brownells team has turned it over 10 times in the second half Yeah you want Dylan Hunter You never want to throw across the basket because you got to throw a bounce pass When you throw a bounce pass like that sometimes it spins on you as a guard cheering Everything now has got to be fundamentals Two hand passes two hand grabs cheering CHISEL JAMES GOT IT Its a twopoint game cheering Clemson has two timeouts They get it in safely cheering Where do you go now for Clemson I think you got to get in your high low action See if you can get Godrey on the duck end Heres Godfrey Draws the foul cheering Was it on the floor or was Godfrey in the act of shooting Because if he was in the act of shooting this will be a goalend and and one And Roger says count cheering the basket Thats the new rule comes into play Continuation So here he contacts Hes in the motion of shooting That is definitely it He used to be able when the whistle was blown Maybe go block that But Joffreyys letting this bench know as well Big time response there We said it right as the second half started Clemson was in this identical spot 12 days ago against BYU They had a 21point lead at halftime Today they had a 20point lead They blew that second half lead to BYU Now just trying to hold on And as it stands it would be a fourpoint lead because this is called a goend And then Godfrey would have a chance to make it a threepoint play from the foul line It looks there though when we look at that again Looks like they got it before it hit the backboard Lets watch it again He pinged that against the glass Thats a good block So then Godfrey would be shooting two Hed be shooting two I think theyre going to count that as a good block Like he pinched that into the backboard I think he gets it before it hits the backboard He blocks it into the backboard Roger ays Courtney Green Chris Merllo in a long huddle here Man am I see the foul right there He continues I think he blocks it into the backboard I think this is two free throws And youre right A year ago that would have been a foul on the floor But because of the continuation coming to college basketball Im wrong Roger just came over and said it is a goalender Im surprised And that is a big call Thats a massive call cheering because now its already a twopossession game and a chance to make it a fivepoint game from the foul line for God cheering That changes things because you would have loved to put God in the free throw line Hes a really good shooter at 76 at this point in the game You never know And again I thought he blocked it into the backboard I thought it was a good block Roger says its a goend and its a goend cheering Godfrey missed it One minute left in regulation Cincinnati trailed by as many as 27 Theyve cut it to four Can a miracle comeback happen in Greenville You dont need a three here cheering Plenty of time to drive it Heres Baba Miller Its a mismatch cheering DUMPS IT DOWN CHAR ANOTHER AND ONE MUSTAFA Cham cheering with 40 seconds remaining A chance to make it a onepoint game Last thing you wanted to do was foul Baba Miller turns away to shoot a fade away Catches RJ Goff coming over to help Baba Miller not involved much in the offensive game plan all game long Struggling on the end And here is most critical part of the game They put the ball in his hands He attacks the mismatch and makes a great pass cheering Dame here with a chance to cut the one And he does Clemson has two timeouts Cincinnati has one Who could have predicted a onepoint game with 40 seconds to play when Clemson led 3811 This is where you like to get the ball in Dylan Hunters hands You dont have to foul here if youre Cincinnati Theres 10 seconds between the shot clock and the game clock and Brad Brownell takes one of his two timeouts Hes not happy with stand up enjoying the Greenville crowd here Dylan Hunter 10 seconds to shoot And now Godfrey in attack mode Goes right at Cham cheering ROLLS IN Cincinnati down three cheering Harris quick TO THE RIM GOT IT And Wes Miller uses his final timeout to set his defense with 10 seconds remaining Great job of extending the game Clemson went early just trying to get a bucket They were not trying to hold it and again clearing out for God to get to that right hand and play bully ball and he does and he delivers Great decision there to come down and take an easy two for long stretches in this game These teams have been searching offensively Well theyve made a combined eight in a row Cincinnatis made their last five Clemsons made their last three And a fun finish coming here in Greenville onepoint game Clemson with the lead and the ball Clemson does have one timeout Cincinnati out of timeouts So Brad Barell right now drawing up the press break And also you got to put the ball in someones hands make free throws So Cincinnati is going to trap maybe the first pass They dont get the steal So theyve got a foul No time to Its only 103 seconds left Cant let any time run off though try to deny Get a 5second count first is one option Trap You only got 10 seconds left So they 5second count is more likely and then you make the foul Need to stretch this game out as much as possible And if you can if youre Cincinnati avoid fouling Dylan Hunter whos the best free throw shooter for Clemson at 86 And it would just be shooting one and one And it would not be the double bonus In my Cincinnati Im putting Bob out all over the ball but I will not let Dylan Hunter touch this basketball Nick Davidsons the inbounder He can run the baseline because Cincinnati had scored Another guard Buddy Johnsons been at it Hes a guy if you could If Im Miller Im denying his guards Davidson gets it in cleanly to Hunter Cincinnati has to foul and they do with 77 remaining Dylan Hunter will head to the foul line to shoot a one and one These are the times and moments like that Hes the one guy who just mentioned I would just double him up Put the ball in his hand Everyone else man up They get it You foul Not everybody wants to be at the free throw line in these moments Cam Dylan Hunter will deliver it in again Plenty of time but itll dictate what Cincinnati has to do on the other end with 7 seconds left Bearcats no timeouts And does Clemson foul if he makes free throws Typically Brad Brownell does Yes cheering Hunter makes for Cincinnati cheering and applause Id put the ball in Day Thomass hand here and try to run a ball screen early A big free throw though Do you need a two Do you need a three Yes Dylan Hunter will decide that Got it cheering Both of them nothing but net And Brad Brown now uses his final timeout Hold on for another 77 Baba Miller the inbounder He can run the baseline cheering into Gizzel James just returned to the team this week And like we predicted Brad Brown now tells Dylan Hunter to foul and James will shoot one and one Now you got to get some size in on the free throw now So you got to go to big lineup Both teams out of timeouts Jizzel James steps to the line for a one and one And youd prefer Dayday Thomas to be at the line if youre a Bearcats fan 94 on the season Rest of the team just 58 Look at the lineup Jay on the floor for Clemson now So you got to watch for Cincinnati He makes the first with the size of the Clemson lineup on the floor cheering Now its on play He could miss the second So sometimes here you can run a free throw line play where you miss right Everyone goes right or everyone goes left Tip it out or put it back in Theres plenty of time here for that cheering James makes the second onepoint game Deny Dylan Hunter You got to double him and instead Davidson floats it into Hunter That is the last guy you want shooting free throws if youre Cincinnati Dylan Hunter by far the best on the team He just made two The reason why the option I thought missing a free throw and a rebound was on the table because now theres another decision here cheering Well and neither team has a timeout whereas before both teams had one timeout So you know its going to come down to something Might as well control it Yeah On an offensive rebound off the free throw miss Now with situations like this Jay Im a proponent of missing the second one Even with 39 because Im not going to allow you to run your set cheering play and advance the ball If you miss youre going to have famed Obama Miller with the basketball at 94 ft cheering Brad Brownell instructing Davidson and Godfrey to get out of the lane because these situations are allowing the team Yes he wants to clear them out because now everyone practice the situation for 39 seconds is a ton of time and everyone has a play here You dont have a play with a live ball at 39 seconds left cheering Hunter made them both again cheering Brad Brown now had his footboard He drew the defensive set to Jake Wall And now Wallen has to instruct the rest of his teammates what his head coach wants Getting creative without timeouts down the stretch Well I dont know why you put a defender on the ball at 3 seconds left Hes not going to get it Yeah this is the confusion you have in these situations It all comes down to this Cincinnatis battled back Can they get a three to tie Porter cheering swats it into the first row and that ticks half a second off the clock cheering Now its a dead ball You cannot move on the sideline here BUT PLENTY OF TIME THIS IS why I said teams need to consider missing that free throw Now theyre going to get two to three dribbles on the catch HERES THOMAS TRYING TO BE THE HERO FOR THE TIE MISSED IT AND CLEMSON SURVIVES cheering
