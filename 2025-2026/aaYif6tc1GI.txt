side leads the ACC in offensive rebounds per game in league play Lee Cassell Tim Clockardy and Chase SH officials today Pit having a gold rush today in the gold uniforms gold tshirts in the stands NC State in the road black Pit on offense first NC State in Manto man Sometimes they have struggled struggled guarding the ball Quick three by Barry Dunning Jr is rebounded by the Wolfpack As we take a look at their starting lineup we talked about Williams Keep an eye on Quadrir Copelan fifth in the league in assists Also averages 14 points a game Threepointers up and off the mark for Williams And the rebound is knocked out of bounds to Pit Pit not a very deep team They only have really nine available scholarship players They usually only play about seven of them We spotlighted CPA in the Open They have three double figure scorers Brandon Cummings Cameron Coren and Barry Dunning Theyll look to get it done with a short rotation today What they like to do on offense is drive the ball into the lane So North Carolina State going to have to work hard to stay in front of dribblers Cummings wide open three offensive rebound Yeah a strong one underneath And theyll kick it back out for a second opportunity Long three Minor Both teams off the mark so far Offensive rebound by Caleeppa Boy that was like from the middle of the second TE there That was a long long shot Now theres no question that he was open but there was a reason that he was open The foul was on Darien Williams so keep an eye on that He picks up his first foul already a minute into the game Boy how thats I mean that wasnt even close Miner of course he missed most of the last game Uh he was asked to leave early and laughter so that didnt help the pit cause The officials uh ushered him out as they gave him a flagrant two midway through the first half and he was out of the game for the rest of the game It led to Mari Moore the backup point guard a freshman playing a careerhigh in minutes Miner is back for todays game as Copeland up fakes out top and a foul away from the ball Itll be called against Pitts Brandon Cummings Pit led by eighth year head coach Jeff Cable has really turned it around over the past few seasons Three straight winning seasons for Cable and the program Theyve averaged 21 wins a year over those last three Quick inbounds for McNeel and its rebounded by Coran One of the problems the Panthers is going to have their guards are a little small relative to the NC State guards and NC State tried to take advantage of a mismatch inside Miner thought about the three and instead will feed it inside for Corhan Open three for Dunning Both teams off the mark so far and its out of bounds to Pit One thing to observe Robert is North Carolina State on defense they do an awful lot of switching And so Pit is if they move the ball theyre going to be able to create mismatches And thats what they had with Corhan inside against Hollowman the smallest player on the court for NC State Coach Cable told us that really makes NC States defense unique Dont just switch the ball screens they switch everything Down to six on the shot clock Cummings in traffic with two Miner contested three as both teams continue to misfire Pit now 0 for five from threepoint range but hell stay with Pit again cheering applause Take us through this switching as we look at the replay This is what were talking about Uh the Panthers theyre every time they exchange whether its a screen or theyre just crossing one another its everybody switches And there you can see Hollivan matched up inside against Corhan and he actually did a pretty good job All five pick shots so far from beyond the arc Theyve missed every one of them Theyve got the time of possession lead here so far Down to four on the shot clock again Cummings is fouled Got to reset the shot clock to 20 And again with all that switching the NC State players bigger guys are going to have to move their feet to stay in front of the smaller guards But NC State so far this game has done a very good job doing that You cannot let Pit get into the lane and start passing the ball out for jump shots You got to look at Will Wade in his first season 13 and six The Wolfpack have won three out of four and eight of their last 11 Dunning will pass up the three will attack the rim and its rebounded by Luben Now I know hes missed a couple of threes but when you have a wide open three like that you have to take it What he did is he passed up open a wide passed up a wide open three and then took it into trouble And Will Wade you know hes wondering how his guys have missed the fact that the courts still 50 ft wide A little bit of a sleepy start for both teams but NC State in particular has only had the ball for about 20 seconds of the first three minutes here it seems like will way a success at every stop hes been 259 career victories Boy they missed Cororehan inside He was wide open underneath Another three is off the mark and the rebound is tracked down by Caleppa He had it knocked out of bounds and itll stay with Pit again Well thats what Caleppa does He just chases down the rebounds We talking about all the switching Look at Corhan down inside Theres nobody there Now he he was covered by the time the shot went up but when a big guys open inside its and hes you got to get him the ball when hes open because hes going to get covered up very quickly So pick continues this multiple minute possession here over three minutes into the game Miner quick three rebounded by Williams cheering Pitt has had seven shot attempts to eight actually to NC States two cheering and CPA clears the board Well Luben missed an inside shot You almost never see that Dunning lays it up and in Lots of times when you miss an easy shot it allows your opponent to get out and go And Pit needs as many transition opportunities as they can get and they got one there Dunning averages 12 a game First year with the program Also five rebounds leads the team in blocks NC State still looking for its first point They wont get it here as Corhan rebounds The Hollowman miss pounding it into the floor Another great rebound by Caleppa Puts it up and in flexes for good measure Well that was great defense by Luben but your defense doesnt end your team defense doesnt end until you get the ball And C Apa just took that one away You talked about Caleppa in the open Three points five rebounds before the first time out Well he just chases after the ball and chases it down Luben whos only made threepointers all season still cant get NC State on the board Caleppa Good tap by Corhead to Dunning who missed it Caleppa taps it out of bounds Nope hell stay with NC State Just under 5 minutes in Pit pitching the shut out 5 nothing and Will Wade is fired up as we go to break Selea and the Panthers running the floor with the early lead music special guest from the Boys and Girls Club from Western PA Thank you for your continued support Hey fans turn your attention to the video courtesy of Remax Select official real estate partner of Danielle Davises Happy with what can only be called music a lethargic start for his team Theyre down five to nothing Theyve missed all five of their shots so far And he was fired up throughout that timeout And he cant be happy with the way theyve let Roman Caleeppa dominate the game so far Well Caleeppa we talked about him before the game He is very aggressive He is a music tremendous offensive rebounder and hes been going after it today You know averages a little over four offensive rebounds in ACC play Already has three Now if youre Will Wade and you just dont see any fire on the part of your players youre trans trying to transfer your fire to them Sometimes that works sometimes that doesnt I mean these players have a lot of distractions The folks from NC State are talking about how fast they have to get out of here after the game to beat the weather And you know sometimes the players just they get distracted and thats music not a good way to start the game Fortunately for them they havent made any shots but theyre holding pit to 15 shooting And again the early start not a huge crowd Its about 0 degrees outside right now And as you said theyre looking to hustle out of here to get home They force a turnover Luben drives to the rim and draws the foul on CPA Hell go to the line And again NC State comes in theyre playing well Theyve won three of their last four They just had their best win of the year at Clemson On Tuesday theyve won eight out of 11 Pit is struggling Lost two in a row five of six Nothing can be taken for granted and partic particularly by Pit And one thing they cannot do is turn the ball over and give North Carolina give NC State the opportunity to get down the court and get easy baskets Luben gets NC State on the board Luben started his career at Notre Dame played a year there scored 12 and six at Vandy for a year and then last year at conference rival North Carolina where he led the team in rebounding and blocks Hes really come on put up much bigger numbers this year 13 and seven for the Wolfpack He does a great job around the basket and one of the reasons is you cant really double team him because of NC States great threepoint shooting ability So he generally gets some room to operate himself You talked about NC State lead the league in threepoint percentage and second in makes in the top 15 nationally in both those categories They love to shoot the three Theyre 0 for three so far Cummings pass down low See Alpa a lot of contact Followed up a corner and hes fouled The folks from Pit have to be scratching their heads that these are not missed wide open layups but they have had so many point blank range shots contested Yes Cumins he just cant get by Williams Thats really nice defense right there And but then Caleeppa he hits the bottom of the backboard and Coran gets fouled but he misses it too You know its just its very frustrating for Pit They missed layup after layup against Boston College And the other thing they did against Boston College is they missed 10 free throws and theyve already missed two today Theyre just seven out of 17 from the line in that threepoint loss at BC on Wednesday First sub into the game for Pit is Noas Andrew Situs A sophomore transfer from Iowa State as Corin gets on the board with one out of two Pit is two out of 14 from the field and 0 for eight from beyond the arc yet lead by four I think NC States size in the back court has really bothered the pit guards who are a little bit small Its tough to get in there and get looks because of the NC State size Matt Ael a freshman is checked in for NC State as a forced three by McNeel is rebounded by Dunning cheering I think Panthers really have to push the ball This is their point guard Demarco Miner See thats what Im talking about The Neil 66 Miner cheering 6t tall He cant squeeze the shot off inside Boy they miss Corhen again Path shut off again Injuritus rebounded on the weak side by Copeland Copeland is a guy whos going to want to go to the basket Alioop and laid up and in for the first heel goal of the game by NC State 6 and a half minutes in Pit defense was so worried about stopping Copeland getting to the basket that they left Luben And Luben leads the ACC in field goal percentage You cant leave him close to the basket Fifth in the country 67 as Dunning has it blocked out of bounds by McNeel Then Allan Luben has been on a real tear of late 18 a game over his last three Well he sets the screen at the top of the key and Coren is forced to step out toward Copeland and Dunning just doesnt do a good job getting back and covering You know if youre going to switch switch If youre not then dont But they were caught in between right there and that left Van Allen Luben wide open You know NC State not noted for their defense but its their defense that is keeping this game right where it is They are making everything difficult for the Panthers Caleppa Both teams getting some reserves into the game Three from the left wing is up and in for Caleppa whos got six already Thats the first threepointer for either team in 14 attempts You begin to think that Caleppa is a guy who can do just about anything Now in conference play hes only shooting 25 from beyond the ark but that was a really nice shot in rhythm Theyre obviously not worried about Caleppa driving and so he had a little bit of room Thats the most room any Pit players had on a three Hes from Australia and we asked Coach Cable how he ended up at pit The jump shot is no good Its rebounded by Williams and a foul against State I think itll be the second on Williams Thats a huge call Two fouls on Darien Williams But a former Pit Panther Lamar Patterson class of 2014 was Caleppas teammate on a semipro team in Australia told him about Pit Caleppa as you might be able to tell from his body was a tremendous rugby player So they brought him over He had a lot of visa issues trouble getting into the country He didnt get here to pin until the second week of school in September Theyre glad he made it Yes Particularly today Started playing in that semipro league at 16 years old I mean steps through and scores but steps through steps possibly too I mean it looked like a travel to me but thats what he likes to do He likes to drive you back and then pull up and shoot But again hes going against the 66 guy and thats hard to do So he stepped right by him Cummings is the lead the teams leading scorer 13 points a game Were about 8 minutes in here Hit with a sevenpoint lead as NC State throws the ball out of bounds Will Wade Will Wades head might pop off Just the sloppy sloppy beginning See Aleppo get a breather Dunning comes in And a coach lots of times can see this kind of thing coming All coaches are afraid of these noon games but just because you see it coming that doesnt make it any easier to deal with And again sloppy is exactly what describes North Carolinas offensive or North Carolina States offensive play so far And Williams is out of the game right now tied up and the jump ball The air will favor NC State when we return Darien Williams two fouls early music and he is out of the game You see the second one here pushing off on the rebound The preseason player of the year music has two fouls early a free throw and twopointers to win up to 100 cash for all play Hey be ready Get set and go Play free All right I got one 15 seconds Get in there 8 7 6 5 cheering for making every shot Hes going home with 100 Thanks for playing and thanks to supporting Yeah again hes trying to get his guys going and the pack has started a little slowly You have said a couple times sloppy play and nothing drives a coach crazier than sloppy play Eight 20 win seasons in his first 11 years and seven NCAAs although should have probably been in eighth LSU probably would have made it during the co year Well never know but hes been very successful Whats kind of the the secret sauce for Will Wade I think his passion for the game is a very big factor in it Obviously hes a great recruiter and you know its just one of those things Its you got to put a team together and hes still struggling to do that at NC State with all the new faces Only one guy back from last year Paul McNeel the only returning scholarship player on the team And the Wolfpack quiet so far Heres Copeland attacking the rim Steps through Missed the lefthanded layup Its rebounded by Dunning cheering running the floor Corhan lays it up and its goalended That was a great job by Pit getting out quickly And Copeland is a guy whos going to drive the ball to the basket Sometimes he takes tough shots in there cheering Remains to be seen if Darien Williams will play it all in the remainder of the first half Quick three by Hollowin is good First threepointer of the game for NC State Hes never been a great threepoint shooter and he has struggled so far in ACC play from beyond the ark Comes off a sixpoint effort against Clemson Has really struggled shooting the ball of late Two out of 11 over his last four games Heres Omari Witherspoon whos checked in and a foul on Copeland cheering and applause Thats that switching Now Copeland is 66 but if NC State is going to switch everything and Pit moves the ball that really helps get open get Coran get open And this is just everybodys playing for the drive And thats only the Hollowmans third threepointer in ACC play So playing a little bit off of him encouraging not encouraging him but daring him to shoot it So when you say NC State switching everything how do most teams play it as they turn it over Copeland will run in and athletically lay it up and in and a foul Aquadir Copeland chance for three But how do most teams in modern basketball handle that defensively Well most teams they talk about a hedge where you jump out and jump back But and thats just this is a very poor pass on the inbounds And one of the things we said that Bit cant do is turn the ball over and those have been NC States best opportunities And Copeland is a guy who can get to the basket Two fouls now on Caleeppa whos been Pits best player so far He has two fouls Big call there as well Copeland completes the threepoint play And again its the Wolfpack defense that has kept them in this thing Whole team shooting about 25 26 so far and a lowcoring affair Theres that mismatch inside Coren against Hollowan cheering Miner with the shot clock running down gets by his man and then has it blocked out of bounds with two on the shot clock That was a great job by Terrence Arsenal for the Wolfpack He recognized the mismatch inside He went over and he relieved Hollowman and Pit was not able to get the ball around the court around the rim around the lane quickly enough to take advantage Dunning off the terrific inbounds pass rushed it a bit Corhan flips it up Couldnt finish Oh put back no good Finally rebounded by Ael for NC State Boy how many point blank range shots can one team miss cheering Copeland crosses over Scores in the foul And thats what Copeland does He attacks you He can get to the get to the free throw line off the drive And again heres a little mismatch Hes going against the big guy Just a lot of confidence Bounces into Corhen and scores Copeland who started his career with a couple of years at Syracuse went to play for Will Wade at MC last year and is singlehandedly carrying his team back into the game with six straight points A 9 run now for NC State Pit breaks that at the other end Thats what you do when somebody shows the press You make them pay for pressing you cheering Gorhan with the dunk Five points now for him Hard to miss that one Copeland in attack mode Spins down the lane Fade away jumper Rebounded by his teammate Arsenal and then thrown out of bounds A turnover Thats a really tough pass You throw it down at the ankles of Sier cheering and applause But this is a perfectly thrown pass And Corhan does exactly what youre supposed to do in that press break cheering And Corin has been an iron man You dont usually see a big man play huge minutes Hes averaging 33 minutes a game this year Its third in the ACC Usually the its the little guys that play the 34 35 minutes Well one of the reasons very few big guys play that much is because they tend to get in foul trouble And Corhan has done a nice job staying out of foul trouble for the most part Hit a couple of players they were counting on inside Papa Aadu Kante went out for the season with a knee injury Deshawn Jackson a transfer from Iowa State never hit the court for Pit this year So Corins really their only inside guy for the most part Good ball movement Three on the shot clock Rising to three is Cummings Good balls Swoops in for the rebound But great reaction by the Wolfpack to cover up the shooters Ael up fakes Pulls up from the right baseline Followed up and in And you think its not a problem for Pin with Caleppa on the bench I mean hes a guy NC State has really done a nice job getting offensive rebound since Caleppa went out of the game who has two fouls The game is tied up again at 15 Lowscoring affairs so far Cummings draws contact and will go to the line You said your defense doesnt end until you get the ball and Arsenal just comes right down the lane and tips it in Nobody blocked him out Andrew Sidus is guarding Arsenal and nobody helps Andrew Situs when he stops the man dribbling the ball Arsenal played his first three years of his career at Houston first year at NC State And coach Wade emphasized getting winning players and I think youd be harder to find a guy with more wins than Terrence Arsenal Their record at Houston in his three years and4 Thats pretty good I think thats a lot of winning folks Thats 33 wins a year and hes come on strong of late A junior from Bumont Texas just outside of Houston Panthers continue to struggle from the free throw line Three out of six after Cummings makes one out of two Pit comes off a 17 and 15 season last year eight and 12 in the ACC NC State has already surpassed its win total from last year 13 wins on the season Last year they were 12 and 19 Another turnover Leagues best team at avoiding turnovers Well send us to a timeout Low scoring from the Peterson Event Center Pit by one Introducing Sports Center for you Personalized every single day Now available on the ESPN app powered by your favorites If youre shut in around the country weve got a lot of college basketball coming on this afternoon on ESPN It rolls on with a Lonear State matchup between number six music Houston and number 12 Texas Tech at 2 Eastern 1 central Game day was there this morning The night is capped off by Learon Phylon and Alabama hosting Tennessee in Tuscaloosa at 830 We talked about Houston Terrence Arsenos former school and theyre a contender again always under Kelvin Samson there And theres Celp sitting on the bench with two fouls So both he and Darien Williams have two fouls Two of the key players in this game We talked about them both up top Whats your sort of philosophy on if you playing guys or not with two fouls Well it all depends on the guy and it all depends on the game situation You dont want the game to get away from you So if you got a guy with two fouls its best to keep him down if the game situation permits it But if not then I think you got to get him back in the end of the shot clock again Cummings is going to have to force it up Air ball and its a shot clock violation And I sound like a broken record but again smaller guards Hes 62 63 playing against a 66 guard And so far NC State is doing a great job staying in front of the dribblers Nobodys getting by and you just its hard to pull up when youre that size against a much bigger guy Coach Wade told us that was something his teams really struggled with this year guarding people off the dribble as a blocking foul will be called against Pit but theyve done an excellent job of that so far And NC State is also a team that likes to drive the ball to the basket And here they just get hung up on the screen outside It wasnt really a great screen The Pit guys just sort of ran into one another and Hollowman a veteran player He sees the lane and he goes and he is an outstanding free throw shooter Its also the second foul on Pits leading scoreer Brandon Cummings Again Pit really only goes about seven deep normally So to have two players with two fouls is not ideal Indraitis comes in for Mari Moore who made a brief appearance And Cumins stays in the game This is what you were talking about You know Cumins unable more able to be careful with two fouls than an inside guy Spoon comes in a freshman from Buouie Maryland averages seven points a game So Cummings the leading scoreer on the bench and Caleppa whos really been Pits best player in the early going of this one both on the bench with two fouls Darien Williams of NC State picked two up two fouls very early played only seven minutes Where are the Panthers going to get some offense I think Dunning is a guy who can provide it Tried to do just that but hell go to the line The Pack playing a little bit bigger lineup right now Sier at 610 and Luben at 69 They dont often play together as Darien Williams gets up to check into the game And if youre going to play a guy with two fouls a veteran guy like Darien Williams is somebody you can have confidence in Gunning missed the free throw Tomorrow afternoon on ESPN and the ESPN app the womens basketball matchup of the day Joyce Edwards and number two South Carolina looking to bounce back when they host Michaela Blakes and undefeated number five Vanderbilt in Colombia Our coverage begins at 3 Eastern 2 Central There was scheduled to be a womens game here tomorrow Duke at Pit Because of the weather they moved that game to this afternoon at 400 as Dunning misses two Pit continues to struggle from the line three out of eight Interestingly NC State flew off on the same charter flight with the Duke women Alas they are not going to wait for the Duke women to play this afternoon Duke found its own charter flight to go home NC State is bolting for the airport Their goal is to be on the plane by 300 Eastern time Its also a half hour drive to the airport cheering here in Pittsburgh Copeland against the smaller defender Shoots it over him and its rebounded by Dunning And a smaller defender cant play defense any better than that Dunning driving to the rim deflected right out to Miner Missed the three and its rebounded by Luben The Panthers now 1 for12 from beyond the ark In fact these two teams combined are two for 17 from beyond the ark Again this is an NC State team thats arguably the best in the league of threepointers and the chance for a threepoint play for Darien Williams Well Darien Williams hes really good at backing somebody down and hes got the sixfoot minor against him and you know its no help comes nobodys coming to help and thats just I mean thats game over right there Too easy for Williams as he gives NC State its first lead of the game Williams played the last two years at Texas Tech and played well He was first team all Big 12 last year cheering Took them all the way to the Elite 8 the Red Raiders And he completes the threepoint play here A senior from Sacramento I think this is a danger zone for the Panthers right here You see the numbers Williams has put up in his career Over 1400 career points now with that threepoint play hit with a couple of their key contributors on the bench right now with two fouls They cant get a shot Witherspoon stepped back to a twopoint shot for Witherspoon Well now they got a shot but thats a very tough shot And if thats the kind of shot youre going to be forced to take its going to be a long afternoon for the Panthers Ties the game up at 19 as we come up on five minutes left to go in the first half Lubman defended well by Coran Bad pass by Miner Stolen by McNeel Paul McNeel Jr missed it Rebounded by Witherspoon And NC State hasnt really been great at making easy baskets What a pass to Corham for the score That is a great pass but its also a great catch Put it in traffic and Corham came down with it went right back up and laid it in Hes got seven points cheering McNeel buries the three Thats his game The catch and shoot three He can drive the ball to the basket but you have got to get him You got to make him dribble the ball If hes just able to catch it in rhythm like that hes going to make almost all of them 41 threepoint shooter high volume as well Incitus midrange jumper Thats a tough shot Rebound tap to Williams Another three is up and in for Trey Hollowman Biggest lead of the game for the Wolfpack Well send us to a timeout Trey Hollowman up to seven points to lead NC State and they lead it by five Please join us in thanking Rita for her generosity and her enduring commitment today Make some noise Its time for the presented by the something like this Under four to go in the first half Will Wade at NC State with a fivepoint lead over Pit and they brought in nine division one transfers this year Some of the more notable ones well theyre all notable in a macro sense but Darien Williams music Copelan Luben and Hollowman all putting up good numbers Well and you add Arsenal to that mix and those guys have scored 22 of the 25 points today And Trey Hollowerman is a guy who last year music at Michigan State he shot under 33 from beyond the arc was much better the year before but he has always been known as a very streaky shooter and hes made two in a row now And so NC State that has really helped them offensively and this is a guy you know he got hurt a little bit and he wasnt able to play and they really counting on him to run the show You know all from real winning programs Texas Tech had a lot of success with Williams Hollowman at Michigan State goes without saying Copeland two straight NCAs with McNiss and Arsenal from Houston And I mentioned it before and Pit responded but the Panthers are in a situation now where they just they dont have a lot of offense out there on the court Where are they going to get baskets Corhand nice pass across for Witherspoon Hes fouled And now Pit has to make free throws But the way theyre struggling to score and youre right Robert the good news is they got fouled and theyre going to the free throw line The bad news is theyre going to the free throw line Yes not only on the season when theyre in the bottom four in the league in free throw shooting but theyre only three out of eight today So you got to make the most of these opportunities Its Witherspoon at the line Robert Lee Dan Bonner and entire terrific ESPN crew with you from the Steel City Pittsburgh Pennsylvania NC State comes in four2 in league play tied for fourth place pit near the bottom of the standings at one and five and four out of 10 from the free throw line cheering Copeland has come alive Copeland and Hollowman both and that has really fueled Wolfpack Williams is back out of the game with those two fabs Schneiders too small to guard Copeland takes him to the rim and scores And that thats really a problem for Pit When you get one of those guys back in minor down youve got to give help and youve got to time it so they dont kick it out for a three And Panthers just not able to respond that time Quit post feed for Coren Gathers goes up strong missed the shot Tipped up and in by Dunning Theyve got to get some contributions from Dunning Hes missed a couple of threes and it looks like he sort of went into a little bit of a shell offensively and he has got to be confident Copeland quick trigger three Its rebounded by Witherspoon whos provided a spark off the bench Miner running in transition Dunning wide open three He got it Lets see if that gets him going a little bit He missed a couple early threes then passed up a couple but really nice response by the Panthers Backto back buckets for Barry Dunning Jr cuts the lead to one ABLE OH the lefthanded finish That was another situation where the Panthers got all tangled up with the screen at the top of the key and created a wide lane for able to get to the goal Freshman from Baltimore highly regarded recruit top 30 last year playing well Eight points a game as a freshman Injuritus draws another foul Andrew Situs I mean if youre He went for the steal and didnt get it And that leaves him wide open And the guy whos coming there to help out to block the shot is the sixfoot guy Miner Thats not going to work Able 66 as injuritus will go to the line cheering You take a look at injuritus and you figure he ought to better be a better free throw shooter than he is Hes only 55 overall That looked like a pretty good stroke there So with NC State going on offense here Will Wade brings Darien Williams back into the game cheering with two fouls in the final minute 50 or so You just you trust your veteran guy that he is not going to commit an offensive foul cheering cheering 11 on the shot clock for NC State Able off the window and in Backtoback buckets for Matt Ael Doing a really nice job using the screen out top to beat the pit defense The Panthers really not guarding those screens out there very yet With a spoon well off the mark Rebounded by Van Allen Luben Williams pulls up for three and its rebounded by Dunning Final minute of the first half Incitus free throw line jumper way off Tipped up by Dunning Long rebound Injuritus Hes all alone Hell shoot the three and splash it What an impact Dunning has had on the last few possession A couple of tip ins that time A tip out Seven points seven rebounds for Dunning now cheering as hes really come on strong after kind of as you said a bit of a lull there Able Check that It is able and a foul on the rebound I think itll be caught on Cor Thats his second of the game And thats really a tough one with so little time left in the first half But Dunning tips it and then tips it again And thats about as wide open a three as Pit has been able to get off the offensive rebound or in transition So they do get Williams out of the game here on what should be one of the final possessions of the first half cheering as Luben makes the first free throw And the Pack has been very good from the line and theyre very good in that game against Clemson That was one of the reasons they were able to pull out that win That was Clemsons first ACC loss of the season Packs first win over the ranked team one out of two for Van Allen Luben About a 5second difference between the shot clock and the game clock This could be Pits final offensive possession of the first half NC State still has their use it or lose it timeout if they get the ball back and want to use it Corin has to be very careful here He doesnt want to get his third foul Witherspoon the athletic catch and then he slays it up and in Omari Witherspoon has played well Hell stop the clock with 4 seconds left and its its a delay a game warning as the ball ended up going kind of into the corner of the court while the clock was running So they stopped the clock with 4 and 12 seconds left NC State will have to go length of the court And what that means is they wont issue another warning and next time its a delay of game on Pit itll be a technical foul And now Pit will break out fullourt pressure Theyll put 7 seconds on the clock now And Corhan is out of the game with those two fouls NC State running it up the court with Copeland Gallops to the rim Lays it up and in A little bit too easy there for NC State as theyll go into the half with a onepoint lead 3433 Copeland with 10 Alamman has seven for the Wolfpack Gorhen and Dunning lead the way for Pit with seven a piece Halftime show is coming up from Pittsburgh 3433 music NC State with the lead You can roll with us but we know we moment Only played eight minutes had 66 rebounds and an assist Warhand rebounded easily by Copeland He had a double team coming and hes got to sense that and find the open man And this guy McNeel is a deadly threepoint shooter but he only made one in the first half Only took two shots 41 threepoint shooter Makes over three a game See if they can get him on track here and get him some open looks This is Darien Williams the ACC preseason player of the year Volied around and stays with the Wolfpack Williams has such an ability to he starts backing you down and then he suddenly he spins and hes into the lane Usually hes going to make that shot but he drew the defense and so theyre able to get an offensive rebound Coach Wade told us they really want to force the ball to him a little bit more get his usage rate up a little bit Said hes really unselfish but theyd like to get him a little bit more involved This time he passes it and turns it over Thats what youre talking about He had an open three He needs to take that Heres DeMarco Miner Did not score in the first half Averages 10 a game At 6 ft tall with all those 66 guards out there hes had a problem Oh see Aleppa contested three Good heavens This freshman from Australia right up at his season average now and he looks terrific Hes right up at his season average and hes only played nine minutes Right showing range to his game here too as Luben lost the ball and its out of bounds off of Corhead Well and that was a break for North Carolina State And this isnt a break for him Now Copeland is there but just doesnt put much pressure on him That is an uncontested three But that ball bounced right up off Luben and hit Coran in the face and went out of bounds Luben attacking the rim and hes fouled by Coran Thatll be his third of the game And thats thats an issue for the Panthers They theyre not very deep Youve mentioned that a couple times particularly They have nobody basically behind Corhen and he picks up his third They have two other starters with two fouls And thats a big part of why Corhans playing 33 plus minutes per game Corhans fine there until he drops that arm You just keep your hands up Thats not going to be a foul But you drop that arm and every time thats going to be called against you And coach Jeff Cable really has no choice but to keep him in the game as Vin Allen Luben makes the first free throw As were talking about the foul trouble and NC State they were seven of nine from the line in the first half Pit really struggled from the strike as Luben ties the game NC State theyre looking to shoot the threepoint shot but lets see if they try to get the ball to Luben to go oneonone inside against Gorehead the next time they have it They pick up some fullourt pressure here Cummings drives on Copeland AND NO DID NOT SCORE All the way around no good And a foul on the rebound against the Wolfpack Now this is not an easy shot by Cumins but boy that ball it did everything but go in the basket I thought it was going to stick up there on the flange That ball hung up there for probably about two seconds of real time Wow Teasing the crowd here Cummings who grew up in nearby Midland PA about 40 miles northwest of here played at Lincoln Park His brother Nelly older brother was a standout player for the Panthers a few years back when they went to the NCA tournament in 23 Okay Caleppa has a mismatch against Hollowman inside They have to be able to find that Theyre trying to get it to him Instead itll be a minor three and he knocks it down Okay Well if you cant throw it inside make a three There you go Just exactly what I was saying Dont look in there Shoot laughter the three just the way you drew it up right there 39 shooter minor his first three of the game McNeel short on his three Long rebound run down by Luben Another chance for Hollowan cheering Rebounded by Miner Thats a couple of open threes there Miner feeling it Oh why not Did not score in the first half They took five shots but you know he is undeterred shall we say 60 run now for Miner Copeland draws contact Oh late call Late call and a foul on Dunning Jeff Cable cant believe it cheering And I think part of the complaint is the official near midcourt called that foul right under the basket The officials you know they help one another out And if one guy doesnt have a view of the play the other guys supposed to help him And thats a foul He jumped up in the air and jumped into him And the official whos underneath the basket sometimes cant see that They put Copeland at the line And this is what happened in the first half with NC State that they struggled a little bit offensively Copeland got him going And so Copelands doing it again cheering The foul was on Dunning Now the Panthers they take Corhan out of the game and they elect to go very small And the risk with this is your guy playing in the post against Ben Allen Luben is Caleppa at 66 and he has two fouls Miner is heated up here in the second half Hes picked up by Hollowman Turns it over Copeland the steel Twoon one Copeland for Hollowman Lace up No good Rebounded by Caleppa Panthers with numbers Threeon two the other way Caleppa like a freight train is foul applause Thats one of those things where Caleppa takes off with the basketball and knowing that hes got two fouls Thats one where the coaching staff just covers their eyes to hope its not a disaster Ends up going the other way Its a third foul on Williams So Darien Williams of NC State just picked up his third foul in transition Itll put Ceppa at the line In in all fairness though NC State played pretty well offensively and defensively both with Williams out of the game in the first half Well this is just Caleppa just takes off And Williams is I mean either get out of the way or try to take a charge but dont lean back and try to slap the ball One out of two again for Pit from the line Williams stays in the game Theres that mismatch inside against the smaller minor Williams looks to attack him feeds it for his teammate Ben Allen Luben who dunks it Hes hes matched up in there against the little guy and so everybody comes to help him help him And Luben does a great job continuing to move without the ball and finding the open spot Williams can really pass the ball Pit which struggled so badly from three in that first half Three out of 16 Three out of three to start the second half Of course Situs turns it over Copeland running twoon two Kicks it out for a left corner three He got it Hell make that one every time I mean wide open in transition in rhythm cheering Thats a great double team by NC State Nice straight game McNeel has made multiple threepointers and he ties it at 43 cheering Cummings wild shot offensive rebound and put back for Caleb applause Seba thats He does a great job on the offensive boards but that time I dont think hed gotten the rebound except it was an air ball But he just goes and gets it doesnt he Sure does 12 points eight rebounds Closing in on a double double McNeel short on the step back three Its rebounded by Dunning Thats not the best part of his game shooting the three off the dribble like that Calempa almost banked it in Its rebounded by Van Allen Luben Hes hot and so Im okay with that He has made a couple today Two out of five for the game as a foul is called The scoring has picked up here in the second half Back and forth we go Neither team is led by double figures music in this game Demarco Miner a couple of threes for Pit but NC State answering back as music well with their sharpshooter Paul McNeel Jr hit by two Lets take a look He does nothing picked up six wins by Thomas points by 92 overall the ACC health plan And now its time for the Junior Panthers straight up on the promo Jason Coming up 530 Eastern on ABC and NBA Rivals Week triple header rolls on with Warriors and Timberwolves Then the inside the NBA pregame show at 8 followed by Luca and music the Lakers taking on the Mavs 830 Eastern 530 Pacific Roman Caleppa is nearing a double double in 13 minutes He has I mean hes really keeping the Panthers in the game with his offensive rebounding in the NBA They talk about per music 48 minute stats I mean what what are his numbers Im not going to ask you that You didnt tell me there was going to be math today All I can say is hes got 12 points in 13 minutes Thats pretty good Pretty good And hes got two fouls but hasnt picked up any here in the second half Darien Williams continues to play for NC State with three fouls He has only three points and he gets the ball off the inbound Defended well by Dunning Its rebounded by Indraitis Long diagonal pass for Dunning looking to attack the rim Its off glass and its a foul against the Wolfpack I dont Did they call foul goending I thought they calledend Goending to count the bucket for Dunning And the only guy whos upset about that is CPA because he got the rebound ball is above the rim It hits the backboard and so you cant touch it after that Thats automatically goalending Hit a team that comes in one and five in the ACC Have lost five of their last six NC State had come in winners of three of their last four Their last game their best of the year a win at Clemson in overtime Coach Wade lamented the lack of consistency from his team And theyre struggling here Three on the shot clock Able blocked by Caleeppa And now Miner is in all alone ahead of the field He will lay it up and in And you know Caleppa thats a great play but its a dangerous play for a guy with fouls like that Caleppa has done everything Hes been the best player on the court A freshman from Australia Williams forces a three Rebounded by Luben and a foul Caleeppa does a really good job moving his feet and Abel stumbles and because Abel stumbles hes not able to get into Calppas body and that makes that an easy block and then nobodys back on defense and so wont get an easier basket than that Well Minor Seleppo real bruiser we were told he loves contact looks like a rugby player I dont know anything about rugby or the positions but he looks like a guy who didnt get pushed around a whole lot Hes a freshman He looks like a guy whos not afraid Theres Okay Oh there you go That is such an interesting sport I I I dont pretend to have any understanding of it but it looks very physical Too physical for me thats for sure 11 points now for Van Allen Luben is the second NC State player into double figures NC States defense continues in the half court to keep Pit out of the lane Theyve had a hard time in transition with the Panthers but theyve really kept him out of the lane in the half court Four on the shot clock Long three is tapped out to Pit Witherspoon Hell shoot it from 16 Heres Caleppa again Saves it back in bounds for another opportunity from Miner who hits the three Now Caleppa will not get credit for any rebounds there but he tipped the ball to a couple of times to allow the Panthers to recover It ends up with a three cheering Miner has come alive all 11 points in the second half including three threes NC State on the ropes Its out of bounds Its a pit now Copeland Copeland lost that and Miner decided not to risk it But had Miner been able to pick that up Dunning was ahead of everybody Theres Seal up He tips it saves it back in bounds cheering Andrew Situs picks it up So did they credit him Okay with the rebound his 10th They should have They should have gave him a three for that Its his second double double in a row 12 points 10 rebounds again in just 16 minutes cheering Miner is heated up The transfer from Oregon State Long three Guess who for the rebound Its Caleppa in mixing it up Hes got it and it is a jump ball The arrow will favor the Wolfpack Well you know you can feel pretty confident shooting it because as long as Calepp is in the game you got a pretty good chance of getting the ball But you know that was a sort of a heat check He took one in the first half did minor from the T That time he took it from the P and both of those are pretty far away This is the kind of game that with the exception of that Louisville game the Pit plays all the time Theyre gritty theyre tough they hang in there but can they finish the deal It was Musa Sier taking it to the rim and it was out of bounds Caleppa has seven offensive rebounds again amongst his 11 boards And again he leads the league in ACC play Nice pass to Ael who lays it in Good play off the inbounds by the Wolfpack to cut the lead to five Miner feeling it Still plenty of time on the shot clock Ditus in amongst the trees Blocked Got it back Shoots it from midrange and tapped out to AOL Thats good defense by North Carolina by NC State excuse me Buying is going to text me again and Im going to be in trouble Its been a hidden story line in this game Williams has been very quiet Backing in oneonone Gets to the rim Couldnt get it to go Incitus the rebound Williams one out of six from the field Indraitus lost it in transition Copelands got it End sequence Copeland for a wide open man inside Nice pass for the score Beautiful look from Williams Boy that is a tremendous turnaround right there And think about that as we go down the stretch of this game Andrew Sidus was trying to make a lefthanded onehanded pass all the way down the court Lost the ball And so instead of Pit having an opportunity for two they give up an easy two on the other end Cuts the lead back down to three cheering Miner drives by Sier Suffers the consequences with six on the shot clock Good one here Pit maintaining music a threepoint lead as they try to break a twoame losing streak Senior Darien Williams was first team all Big 12 at Texas Tech last year He hurt his shoulder in the Maui Invitational missed a little bit of time and just hasnt been quite the same Hes still ramping up and hes really struggling today And thats very odd in terms of his road games in ACC play Hes averaged almost 20 a game on the road And but the amazing thing about that is you got to really tip your hat to the grit of NC State with Williams playing so poorly only scoring three points so far Theyre still in this game And they almost steal the inbounds Pit has not scored in two and a half minutes And Pit a couple of times today has tried to get the ball out in bounds from underneath the basket and theyve thrown it away So they reset the shot clock there They should not have done that They go back to five on the shot clock Its called a homecourt advantage Just say NC State had possession there at any point Was a homecourt call No doubt Five on the shot clock Pits got to hurry and they turn it over They turn it over I mean they havent turned it over a lot today but theyve turned it over a couple times on underneath inbounds passes If youre a coach you just spent the whole time out drawing up what youre going to run traffic coach Another missed shot Its rebounded by Dunning Thats pretty good defense again by Miner against taller guy Midway through the second half Only meeting of the season between these two schools And a foul Its going to be caught on Sier Its his third I think this is another situation where with Cummings struggling a little bit today to score Pit really needs some contributions from Dunning and he had that one stretch in the first half where he scored seven points but Dunning getting the ball in the basket would really be a help for the Panthers here down the stretch Dunning has nine but like you said almost all of it came in a little spurt Its been C Aleppo with 12 and Miner with 11 all in the second half Miner with a size mismatch here Shoots it over him and a foul on the rebound again against Sier I believe itll be his fourth of the game So Luben is going to come back in the game But again the best thing the Panthers have done today is on the offensive boards They are crushing NC State on the glass They have a 205 advantage in second chance points Gorhan had it knocked away and they turn it over on another inbounds play They havent scored in over three minutes now Pit close out on Able Lefthanded shot rolls around and in Matt Ael pulls the Wolf back within one Panthers are a team that struggle offensively Gorge spins to the rim Missed the layup and caught his own rebound and hes fouled applause Well that looks like the first half when they missed so many point blank range shots and boy its the fourth foul on Darien Williams So thats a huge call there So Coran missing that bunny if he can make the free throws Its almost a little bit of an advantage because its four fouls now on Williams who was in the wrong place at the wrong time Pit has as many offensive rebounds as NC State has rebounds And theyre only ahead by three points or by excuse me by two points which shows you the extent of their offensive struggles So Williams to the bench with four fouls and thats that Coran is a 50 free throw shooter in conference play Thats what hes been today They are making a living out of going one out of two from the line Thats not a living you want to make No Eight out of 16 for the game Arsenal turned away Corhan the rebound Really good defense by Caleppa Numbers for Pit Miner runs into Copeland and a foul And the foul starting to pile up now on NC State cheering We talked about seal up his offense or excuse me his offensive reboundings but he does a nice job right here playing the drive He didnt allow uh the the offensive player to get his body into him and so hes able to block the shot That was the sixth foul against NC State So into the bonus the rest of the way from Pit as Dunning hits the three They can get the if they can get it in bounds underneath the basket they can get it basket They had turned it over a couple times in a row in that situation Dunning with a much better look that time and he hit the three from the corner Hes got 12 points Looking to answer at the other end McNeel and a timeout NC State Well take it with them The teams trading music threes in a close game in the Steel City always do After this game Ill be heading back to my hometown Cincinnati Ohio for a Miami Ohio game on Tuesday Ill check in on Joe Burrow and next years Super Bowl champs while Im there Well we dont like Cincinnati people around here So Well I dont appreciate that dude laughter Im a very nice guy I just happen to Yes you are We roost for a tortured franchise Its its its painful Theres always next year for for everyone Here its Pit leading it by two over NC State in whats been a good game Neither team has led by more than nine points Pit has led for most of the game thanks in large part to Roman CPA whos got the ball The freshman from Australia drives to the rim athletically scores in cheering a foul You know Caleppa is just you know he has basically taken over this game at various points and this is not an easy play Hes got to spin Hes got to step through defense and then somebody comes and fouls him and he makes the basket anyway That is just an outstanding play And itll send us to our under 8minute timeout Hit with a chance for a threepoint play Roman Caleppa has 14 points and 11 rebounds leading the way NC State led by one at the half Pit took the lead and they have not trailed on the second half Pit actually had the lead out to seven points but NC State battled right back This has been this has been sort of a back andforth affair Williams you see him on the bench Hes got four personal fouls has only scored three points today See Aleppa missed the free throw but its out of bounds Oh I think Pits going to challenge this Im not possibly No Im not sure that its a good idea to challenge that kind of a play at this point with eight minutes in the game Okay fair enough So just a twopoint bucket for Caleppa whos got 14 and 11 Three from the left wing is short Its rebounded by Vin Allen Luben He backs in Dunning cheering and scores Well Luben is just so good close to the basket Hes 6 n Hes very strong And Dunning is only 66 so hes overmatched in there Luben with his own double double 13 points 10 boards fifth of the season cheering Running it through Caleppa The freshman attacks the rim The freshman puts it high off the window Its another offensive rebound for Corhead Brings the ball down in amongst the trees Hes fouled applause See this is what youre talking about Robert The ball goes up and its tipped Yeah Tough to tell if it was 22 or three there Well unless youre 100 sure I dont think you can challenge that But heres Luben He gets the ball inside makes contact gives himself a little bit of room and lays it in the basket He has been so effective this entire season close to the goal Pit continues to struggle from the line Eight out of 18 You mentioned in their last game they were seven out of 17 40 killing themselves from the free throw line right now Well theyve done everything they can to keep themselves in the game defensively on on the boards But free throws are a big part of it And if youre going to miss that many free throws youre just asking for trouble 42 from the free throw line Inside for Luben again Kicks it out for Copeland Nice layup is up and in for Quadrir Copeland And NC State ties the game And Copeland is does such a great job finishing in traffic He drives the ball to the basket Hes a hard guy to stay in front of and hes a hard guy to stop Copeland from Philadelphia in the NC State cheering section behind their bench Fired up Offensive foul Demarco Miner his second NC State just keeps hanging around The defense surrounds Luben because hes made a couple of baskets and that gets the ball out to Copelan who can start to the goal before anybody can get to him cheering Copeland Here he goes again Gets downhill kicks it out for a right corner three Its good NC State takes the lead on a Paul McNeel three And it sort of all works together You Copeland has scored So now you had you try to stop him and you drop off McNeel And you cant drop off McNeel You let him have that open three in rhythm Hes four out of eight from beyond the arc today 70 run for the Wolfpack Coran missed it Rebounded by NC State cheering Van Allen Luben Copeland attacking in transition See McNeel here SHOOT ANOTHER THREE screaming ITS GOOD PAUL MCNEEL BACKTOBACK threes and suddenly its a sixpoint lead cheering 100 run for the Wolfpack Pit has struggled music in close games Well step aside Under six to go Wolfpack have stormed back Heat music Heat Paul McNeel has five threepointers in this game now And hes a catch and shoot threepoint guy And Copeland draws the defense Miner leaves him because Copeland just scored And because Miner leaves him then that sets up McNeel And again McNeel goes off a little screen there Miners too late when he can catch and has he doesnt need much time or much room but when hes in rhythm like that and he can catch and shoot he is dead Sophomore from Rockingham North Carolina about 70 mi east of Charlotte One of the best threepoint shooters in the league A high volume shooter as well Had an incredible 47point game against Texas Southern earlier this year with 11 threes Miner against the larger Ael with seven on the shot clock This is Cummings Fade away over Luben Tipped up in the air Abels got it NC State on the run Three on two on a 100 run Copeland draws the fab I think thats going to be four on Coren And hes just got to stay in the game at this point with only five minutes to go And its Copeland again Uh he really puts pressure on a defense with his ability to get into the lane on the dribble If theres been a theme for Pit these last couple years inability to win close games in singledigit games this year Theyre one and seven and they were up cheering big in the second half but they had a lead in this second half I think their biggest lead was seven applause Yeah they had a sevenpoint lead in the second half and they just werent able to hold it Theyre a team that struggles to score and NC State even though to Will Wade its got to feel like theyve been cheering running and setting concrete the entire game they have toughed it out They have hung in there and they have 120 run right And now they have they have really disrupted the Pit offense to the point where the Panthers have havent scored How does Pit bounce back here Well you got to put the ball in the basket This is a very big offensive possession for the Panthers Cummings will hoist up a three and hit it And thats one way to do it And its been a struggle for Cumins because hes going up against bigger guys today But Luben just got too far away from them that time But now the Panthers they need a couple of stops And Copeland has found his rhythm He attacks the rim scores and a foul cheering You know the Panthers have not really been able to find lanes with the NC State switching all the screens And the Panthers do not switch the screen Theyre trying to get through but Cummings does a very poor job holding up the dribbler And that creates a wide open lane to the basket Copeland with a game high 18 points You know you said Whats the difference between switching the ball and not switching Well when you dont switch you have to help that defender get through the screen And theres a number of different techniques to do that And what we just saw right there wasnt one of them 19 now for Copeland extends the lead back out to eight cheering 153 run over about three minutes for the Wolfpack Cummings Step back three Back to back for Brandon Cummings And thats thats thats really a positive sign for the Panthers But of course if youre behind and youre going to come back in the game you got to get some stops on this end cheering Gets the lead back to five as we come up on four minutes to go Copeland looking to attack the rim again Hes matched up on Cummings Calls for the ball back and gets it with 10 on the shot clock Hes going to try to back him close to the basket Offensive foul Well shouldnt that was a little bit more aggressive backing cheering Four fouls on Quadier Copeland Wow Four fouls on Copeland Four fouls on Williams Brandon Cummings has found the range from three and then at the other end acting a little bit for the charge Quadier Copeland has been tremendous for NC State with 19 points in this game but looks like hes going to the bench with four fouls Well this is what he does so well And here he just really winds up I mean the referee has no choice right there But Copeland and Williams both are really good getting the ball in that free throw line area seeing a mismatch and backing down And heres the heres the issue facing these teams These these three guys are all key elements to their teams Copeland and Williams Now Williams hasnt had quite the game that Copeland has had Hes only got three points Williams is in the game with NC State leading it by five Pit has the ball Robert Lee Dan Bonner our entire frigid ESPN crew from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 9° outside Snow coming later tonight Hope everyones staying safe all around the country Three and a half minutes to go forehead bullet feed and its a turnover and thats I think that was the right place to throw the ball but you cant throw the ball 500 m an hour at somebodys shins like that now had no chance to catch that ball cheering has struggled with turnovers in the second half weve talked about Pits advantage with second chance points but you see right there North Carolina North NC State 183 and second cheering chance pit and points off turnovers there You add two more Van Allen Luben 15 points Pit has turned it over eight times in the second half and its now a sevenpoint lead for the Wolfpack The Panthers are in a situation where they got to score about every time down Miner turns the corner feeds it underneath for Coran who missed the shot again Coran will dunk it this time Hes really struggled around the rim today The Panthers have really struggled around the rim in their last two games applause and cheering For a double double 10 and 10 his sixth of the season Williams controlling the play here Hes backing down for a big three from Ael Offensive rebound Williams And hes foul You know what What a great play by Williams that time He gets into the lane and passes the ball out for a shot And he doesnt just stand around He gets in position for an offensive rebound And hes a really good free throw shooter going to the line 80 for the season for Darien Williams This will be two shots Both teams with two timeouts left cheering The possession arrow favors Pit He gets down in the lane Four guys come around him that creates an opening but hes being guarded by a smaller guy and he just forces his way into the basket If you want to know a difference in this game its from the free throw line NC State is 17 of 20 Pit is eight out of 19 Now the Panthers are running out of time They got to score and they got to move a little quickly here too Cummings wanted to shoot the three Abel closed out on him And again Abels one of those 66 guys Its hard for Cummings to get it over him Long three is rebounded by Williams With under two minutes to go NC State leads it by six cheering Size mismatch here Williams backing down Miner Draws the foul Scores the basket That whole side was cleared for Williams to operate against Miner cheering And weve talked about how Williams struggled for a lot of the game He was in foul trouble But here went down the stretch when they absolutely need the basket Who do they rely on Well it goes to Williams 6 6 going against 6 feet tall And thats his game right there Yeah a little wink There you go NC State closing in on a big road win in a game in which they struggled for much of the game And I think thats really important if youre going to be a good basketball team You get into situations where youre just not maybe emotionally charged up for the game where you struggle a little bit And if youre a team that can put in a workmanlike performance under those circumstances and win a game I think thats a sign of a really good basketball team And NC States been right at home on the road This could be their fourth straight ACC road win to start the league schedule and they almost forced the turnover Its out of bounds Theyre three and 0 in league play on the road Last time they started 4 and0 40 was back in the early 70s when they won the national title Theyve now got their largest lead of the game cheering and notably they were 0 and 10 on the road last year Theyre not going to get to 90 points today But I mean this has just been a tough gritty effort inside for Corhan Rebounded by Ceppa and he draws the fat Career high in rebounds for Caleppa with 12 And hell try to pick up some points while the clock is stopped here Win or lose Caleba has really opened some eyes over the past couple of weeks for Pit Absolutely he has Hes hes played really well but North NC State really struggled on offense but I think their defense was pretty good Will Wade has been um hes been critical of their defense but they did a really nice job keeping Pit the particularly the smaller guards from getting the kind of shots that they normally get because they forced them to shoot over much taller guards Yeah Miner four out of 12 Cummings three out of 11 and its out of bounds No its a foul No foul Excuse me Itll put NC State at the line fourth foul on minor and youre pretty comfortable having Hollowman at the line 80 in conference play 84 overall So thats why hes in the game at this point Coach Cable told us that they tried cheering to recruit Hollowan out of the portal transferred from Michigan State after last season as once again the Wolfpack have matched their biggest lead of the game So these teams have essentially taken the same amount of free throws but NC State is plus 10 in makes One out of two for Hollowman Still a ninepoint lead with a minute 15 to go Got to go Miner guarded by Hollowman Drives by him takes it to the rim and draws the foul cheering Miner is aggressive and hes strong and he can drive the ball in there but hes only six feet tall and that has presented a problem the entire game Its not like NC State has a couple of sevenfooters in there but other than Luben whos 6 n just about everybody else is 66 Miner did not score in the first half now has 12 Hes had a really good offensive second half up until about the last four or five minutes when the offense just deserted the Panthers entirely That might be the first time Pit has made two out of two from the free throw line this entire game Good time for it to happen Theyre down by seven as well step aside for a 30 second timeout NC State with the ball in a sevenpoint lead trying to move to 5 and2 in league play Came into the game tied for fourth place upcoming schedule hosting Syracuse on Tuesday at Wake at SMU Virginia Tech and then at Louisville for the Wolfpack Again the top four teams in the ACC tournament get that double buy and theyre right on the cusp of that right now I think he got a foul Copeland is fouled I think Corhead just fouled out of the game Well and the problem the Panthers are presented with right now in addition to Corhead leaving the game is the worst free throw shooter out there for NC State is Luben And hes 70 on the year and hes seven for eight today I I hope I mean that thats replay right there is sort of you could get that from him five times a game The way he goes drives to the basket contorts his body seemingly off balance and either scores or draws the foul or both aggressive Its always been a very aggressive player Oh theyre going to challenge or no excuse me review now Was a foul on the play against Corhan It was his fifth It was his fifth Our officiating crew today Lee Cassell Tim Clockardy and Chase Shaw Common foul by Pit is under review Was he said a common the common foul by Pit is under review And so that means theyre looking to see if they can upgrade the common foul to a flagrant foul If it remains a common foul Copeland would go to the line for two shots A flagrant foul would add possession to that as well Keeping possession Lets see what were looking at here That might be what theyre talking about right there Grabbing the guy from behind You know remember the definition of a flagrant foul Theres a couple of different facets to it Right there It appears that Dunning may have grabbed him from behind Then when you grab somebody from behind like that go to the basket Got it Okay Common foul stands But right there I think NC State might have been asking for a flagrant foul and then was the contact right there Excessive andor unnecessary And the bottom line about all of this is its a common foul So hes going to go to the line Hes going to shoot two Goodier Copeland is a 74 free throw shooter and he is a perfect seven out of seven from the free throw line And in that situation when a coach asks for that kind of review when theres that much contact there the officials will go and theyll review that And if they uphold their original decision they wont necessarily charge the coach with a timeout And they didnt in this situation If the officials are sure and they say No we didnt really think so then the coach might get charged The coach will get charged with a timeout Seal up another rebound is 13th Pit desperate down by eight need scores Need him quick Miner into traffic Had it ripped away Hollowman has it NC State can run time off the clock You have 45 seconds left Cummings fouls Hollowan Pit in games decided by 10 points or less One and seven Now may end up losing this by more than 10 But theyve really struggled in these close games Now they have played the Panthers have they played very very hard today They led for much of the second half and this game sort of encapsulates this season for Pit You know theyre right in it And then they just dont have enough offense to finish the deal at the end And theyve got a tough schedule coming up Four of Pits next six opponents are ranked amongst that group at Clemson at Virginia Duke and North Carolina back to back in the middle of February as its two free throws for Hollowan Hes into double figures and the Panthers now are a little bit concerned about whether they can finish in the top 15 of the ACC and make it to the ACC tournament Incitus hits the three cuts the lead down to seven with 33 seconds left Pit does have one timeout remaining Hollowan alley slams it home Then Allan Luben the exclamation point in transition Well again a foul This has been a pretty pretty effort by North Carolina State The win when you dont play your best throughout the game is really something And this is among the best things theyve done Hollowman just throwing it up there And another another addition to the points off turnover stat that has really cheering hurt Pit particularly here in the second half Copeland fouls out with a terrific 20 points three rebounds and nine assists And again NC State located in Raleigh They told us their goal Now everyone has a goal They said their goal was to be on the bus pulling out of the arena 5 to 6 minutes after the clock hits all zeros Their coach Will Wade is going to do his postgame radio interview on the bus to the Pittsburgh airport They hope to be on the plane by 300 The airports about half an hour away And they want to be home in Raleigh by 400 roughly an hour Now this game went a little long but a couple hours from now NC State hopes to be back in North Carolina and theyll be there with a hardearned 8172 win over Pit They did not play any place to their anywhere close to their best game but this may have been their grittiest game This was really something NC State improves to 5 and2
