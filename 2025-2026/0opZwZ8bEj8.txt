this Thursday Chase Shaw Tony Henderson and Lee Cassell are the three officials And off we go on a Sunday afternoon in Winston Salem Nate Calmese runs the point for the Deaks His floater over a Daimara did not fall Trey Spillers foul trouble much of the game on Tuesday and the lob was too high Wake Forest could not convert the opening possession And heres the starting lineup for the Riverhawks Yepto Spencer Simmons Fry and the aforementioned Green who played at Texas State last year Spillers the steel Spillers going to the free throw line The foul on Shawn Simmons the second I I want to see out of Wake Forest worthy energy and effectiveness I need to see you coming out and play hard and and and valuing the basketball making the play Im not mad about missing that lob dunk but you got to finish those type of plays because you werent able to do that at the end of the game against Michigan So you got to come out with some juice and play hard today Get the stink of the loss off you and just play smart basketball You You coached in the ACC I Ive been and you know what its like to have a really big game and then a game that youre supposed to win Yes And then another really big game sandwiching that game youre supposed to win A let down game A let down Thats thats why I said Bill you got to come out with some energy and some focus You got to create your own enthusiasm I dont necessarily need highlight plays What I need is to be effective See like that loose ball you dont finish They get the first bunk Austin Green throws it down Take them out of their misery if you can And if youre UMass Loy you just keep playing hard play smart Youve been in every ball game you play Well in the fact that they showed up to play thats true I wouldnt say they were in the Yukon game They lost by 16 but they lost big because Yukon is Yukon But they came out and played very efficiently early in the ball game They didnt have the big eyes Garrett Fry to the corner for Green Green backing down Spillers Theres a double comes to help Green fires and scores Yeah And as ugly as that was its very effective for him He took his time after he got the basketball again Hes a solid inside player now 19 against Columbia in the loss Thats good Thats a finally three for Omaha Valoo He started the season 0 for9 and hed been really struggling from the perimeter but he was a good shooter in limited playing time last year for Wake Forest Yeah but you know the first couple shots hes taken early ball games havent been that close Thats a good look for him in the offense And Steve was saying guess she forms get get out Lets go play I want to see intensity right now This is all of a carrier Youre building something Early deflections have been spillers goes to work He has really got that shot down especially turning over the opposite shoulder using that lefthanded little five six seven foot baby hook Defensive pressure You got to have it today LOL needs to remain poised against that pressure to have any chance From the four games that LOLs played theyve had two games where theyve had more assistant turnovers They cant turn the ball over and give Wake Forest those easy plays Greens been decent on the block An accidental pass and its a Daniel Yepto three Yepto came out of St Mat St Michaels was a solid scoreer He can put the ball on the floor and make some plays but they look for him for some leadership and that midrange ability Thats a nice basket after ugly offensive set Harris throws it away Thats not what Steve Forbes wants to see Thats what Im talking about Spencer on the drive Curious if we would have gotten a timeout if that had gone in Instead numbers for the Deaks Calm me in the corner He struggled early this season from the field Nice quick hands Mason knocks it away Calm me the other way Harris decent look Comes up short Mason for the rebound Calm me reload Got it Second and third opportunities Blow did not take advantage and get that rebound You got it I got it No one has it See if Im watching this game if Im Im coaching I want to win the game I want to be effective I dont want the turnovers I dont want plays like that to happen against us Im not worried about the highlight plays Those will come Fry takes it Offensive rebound for Green inside Doesnt get the roll on the cheering layup right Luckily mistimed his jump Harris from the wing and bombs away so far Des now two for five from Dee Cooper Schwagger is going to be the first man off Steve Forbess bench along with the ball reversing the trap I think youre probably thats Miles Coven getting ready to check in Fry Thats his wrench He loves that left side left wing Five out of 13 from the three lay so far this season Hes a got a quick release Nice off touch from Spillers Hes got a quick six UMass LOL played at Colombia on Thursday They were outscored 5336 in the second half and lost by 14 And theres three more for the Riverhawks A little rub off a down screen and just catch it in the shooting pocket Got to put more pressure on the basketball Got to put more pressure on the passer Gipto with his ninth three of the season second of the day Beloo already lthered in sweat Hell get to the free throw line But first well get our first time out Just over 5 minutes gone Omahas playing And look they they beat Michigan last year and didnt help them get into the tournament There were plenty of reasons for that of course but uh youre 16point underdogs You lose by one in overtime on the road Theres a lot to build upon and ultimately its about what happens from here We got opportunities You know you youve got a tournament coming up next week in the Bahamas that uh is not a vacation Its a chance to get two quality wins Win this basketball game Try to get better You can learn from that loss Simmons fouled by Beloo Yeah this is a matchup back court front court guys especially that Im interested to watch with with Simmons Hes a good leaper Played at St Joes for a couple of season Didnt really put up a lot of numbers but is a good athlete Uh you know can run the floor got caught with a cheap foul a moment ago but can elevate Dont know if hes got the manpower to be able to play against the the front line of Wake throughout the ball game without picking up some some cheap fouls but he can give you a couple of solid plays inside Beloo rebounds the miss Akens Kulvin Schweagger all in the game for the Deaks Mason and Beloo the two starters staying out there And its Yepto guilty of the foul He picks up his secondary Two threes and two fouls for Daryl Yipto And to the bench he goes Now the Riverhawks have been a good American East team They theyve won more games than they lost each of the past three seasons They went 17 and 15 last year They were 46 and 18 the two previous seasons combined UMass LOL beat Georgia Tech a few years ago They beat Boston College a decade ago So theyre capable of springing an upset with the travel Like I said they theyre not afraid and they dont have the big eyes early and so you just got to get out there Wake Forest and execute and and keep a good focus But you can see right there what theyve done in the past They also have 0 of their scoring back from a laughter year ago So this is a completely new team than the one that went 17 and 15 The jerseys are the same the coach is the same but thats it Three guys that are on the team were red shirted last year Thats a nice move Yes it is Austin Green blowing right by Cooper Schwagger And you got to remember the scouting report Hes a lefty He took it left and went strong Mai Mason rising up and rebounded by Green So every possession as this clock winds down that UMass Loyal can stay in this basketball game not make a mistake and score back to back That puts more pressure on Wake Forest and they become freer and freer because they say Hey balls going in Oh were getting steals Lets keep playing Marcus Marian makes his first appearance Duke Harris also returns And Wake Forest as you understand to be able to execute you may have to just jab and jab and jab You may the knockout punch isnt going to come immediately Theres not going to be a 10point shot Where would the 10point shot be from if there was Itd be from uh beyond the three possession stand No itd be beyond the three arc and somebody get fouled and itd be the fourpoint play and it be a technical foul and somebody else would have and then a couple other technicals and something crazy would happen You go free throw line Shot clock winding down Green to the basket Takes it strong The upper body strength of Austin Green Hes got eight points already in this game is tied 14 a piece James leading scoreer averaging about 14 a ball game and you seeing why inside as well as outside Miles Culvin cant connect on his first shot Riverhawks looking for the lead here Playing with poise and purpose And Spencers shot is short Rebounded by Harris Quickly to Aikens Sebastian Aikens with a left hand Nice decision that time The hesitation dribble had everything under control Saw the opening down the lanes Able to finish Deakons retake the lead on the first bucket for Aikens Thats well done Nice little flex cut there Just kind of rolled down the baseline Great recognition again Pressure on the basketball Wheres your help side defender You got to talk Its too quiet in here right now Bucket for the Hofster transfer Khalil Farmer Akins for three Coming off the bench and has given him a little bit of excitement The layup a moment ago and then the knockdown three Third three of the season for last years Summit League Freshman of the Year at the University of Denver the answer Long rebound tracked by Juke in the corner Here comes Akens Will he call his own number for a third straight possession Not immediately Harris goes right into Green and its tipped up and in by Schwagger I love his movement Two times he was all allconerence scheme in in Missouri Valley his length before this seasons over Hes gonna have that really big time double double I I I I almost guarantee you because hes a guy that can make some plays Theres a play there Thats his second foul laughter I beg your pardon Thats just his first Curious what you mean by music a really big double double But before that he was at Boston College under Al Skinner for 13 years as an assistant on the grounds of Chestnut Hill Fivepoint game midway through this first half Some different looks out there for the Deaks JJ Mascoy whos been a good scorer off the bench and you can see why Hes averaging 11 and a half a game He is physical and he doesnt hesitate trying to score in the midrange and goes to the free throw line So it this inside out game not not as much pressure around the perimeter that time allowed them to get into their offense to go into Masquin 0 for two now and Masakoy with a rebound Masco is undersized Theres no way hes 66 which is what hes listed at but hes tough Schweagger got a hand on it Knocked it into the back court retrieved by Spencer Green pestering on the glass Thats good hustle from Austin Green Hes tied up Itll stay this way Be honest with you Little is out hustling Wake Force diving after some loose balls That was a physical possession that time but nevertheless you know they call a foul applause and cheering No there theres just not an understanding of where the referees are pointing Yeah thats thats what I you know I was under an understanding it was a jump ball tie up goes to blue Blue is going this way But again you got now those are things like that You got to be mentally locked in about the ball game today You know Michigan game is over with Thursday Friday is not here yet Worry about what youre doing today Play hard Play the more that this team stays in the ball game the harder its going to be for Wake Forest Shot clocks at six High low Thats well done Excellent Got a guy that that loves to post up is physical can go inside and score Four quick points off the bench for Mascoy Calmise back in the game sets up Mai Mason whos short with it Oh rebound popped right through the hands of Victor Aoji and Spillers takes the gift and lays it in Look what I found Trying to isolate a little bit Reverse and get a post up Theres your trap Mason the steal and the turnover No rhythm Just no No rhythm Good play good idea Just just no rhythm Youre right And how do you change that You cant just say I want to have rhythm You cant start singing a show tune and all of a sudden you got rhythm and my girl who you got to keep working at it to get in rhythm to get in step You know you just got to you got to execute Dont try to make again Im Im just going to say it till I get tired of talking about it You dont have to worry about the the big play with Bob Mulip always just talk about you know singles and doubles count too You dont hit a home run on every play Nice behind the back Nice steal Nice behind the back The no look Okay fine You got to execute it then If you dont want me to talk about it be tough about it then do it right laughter Im sorry I got I got coaches I got coachs hat on today a little bit Challenging is out of bounds call They got a timeout They have the ability to do so Lets see here Yes they are Its an interesting time of the game to use your challenge Wake Forest head coach has challenged the out of bounds call is off white blue ball If you want to take a timeout anyway and theres a call thats close and you think you can steal possession I get it All right Heres the better look I dont know if that didnt hit Mason last Yeah but again this could be Steve Forbes just not liking what hes seeing There you go There you see you You Youre on page with me now See youre thinking what Im thinking See there you go So you got to have you got to find something to get them charged up I understand Some days you just dont have it Lets take another look at this I think we got one Our guys are doing a great job here It looks like it goes over his foot Yeah those are nice shoes because of See there you go See I could not pull off those Im trying to get Im trying to stay focused in play and you tell me about the shoes Youre not going to talk about I wish we had a pair like that I I dont I could pull them off After further after further review there is not conclusive evidence to overturn the out of bounds Wake Forest will lose its challenge We will cost them one 30 second timeout and theyll have no longer challenges the rest of the game I get it Just a few days ago Wake was on the verge of perhaps potentially knocking off a top 10 Michigan team on the road Now tangling with the Riverhawks of UMass LOL here on your home floor and struggling to break free Doesnt surprise me Doesnt surprise me You got But heres the thing Im going to say this Im going to let it go Dont let one loss equal two Yeah You know what I mean You know just that Michigan game is over with Lets dont even talk about it anymore That was a foul Fry picks it up Fry the former Seawolf played at Stonybrook for three seasons average eight points a game last year Yes he did kind of you know going from a Seawolf to a Riverhawk Theres an aquatic theme to his mascot lifestyle Oh theres good defense from the former Seaw Wolf Jared Fry That was kind of a combination sever I I like the way you do that I let you go Calm might have gotten away with traveling Im thinking the same thing Mason right at the rim Cant finish And the fouls against Wake Forest as Farmer clears the glass Foul charged Jaylens third Jaylen Cross into the game to club Trillion by picking up the quick foul the mentality tough this through and again every possession is a positive thing for the Riverhawks That one wasnt but I like the idea of being able to take it strong to the hole Rebound by Spillers ahead Belaloo for three Nice job Caught it in rhythm We talked about his idea of 0 and nine and missed some shots terribly that time He felt very comfortable Step back That was a rhythm play and a knockdown three Two for two from deep so far Cross gets knocked down Gets right back up though Stays with it Fry guarded closely by Cal Mason And Mascoy is a problem right now Well he gets great inside position but it was a great penetration by Fry and a perfect bounce pass right where he could catch it and go up in the same motion More free throws coming here for Trayvon Spillers free throws after the timeout 721 left in the first of free throws here A transfer from Appalachin State in his second year at Wake Forest Today could very well be his second double double of the season Hes got eight and three right now You know looking at some numbers this morning late last night trying to get a get a grip on this game looking for those X factor things And something that really struck me Wake going into the day had committed 63 fouls Their opponents had committed 61 And Wake had made 53 of 75 from the free throw line Their opponents 55 of 72 So you say Well what does that mean I dont know or thought similar also Yeah Yeah I dont I dont know because that means one youre fouling too much and youre not going to the free throw line and youre giving the other team the opportunity to do the same thing That cant continue throughout the season because you put teams at the line theyre going to make those free throws Well the other interesting thing and look its just three games but early in the season last year we talked about the threepoint struggles Quakes threepoint percentage to start this season is below 30 which is basically what it lingered at all of last year All year long Now Deaks are four for 10 so far today Stan you can do that math Four for 10 You just call me out I was praising you Mascoy Everything but the bucket Third effort for JJ Mascoy Wow I told you I told you Just hungry right now Just trying to be a player It doesnt matter who gets the credit just get it done Eight points for Mascoy off the bench in the first half patting his rebounding stats as well laughter Miles Coleman Juke Harris coming back into the game Victor Aoji picks up the foul for LOL He had 16 against Columbia in that game You talk about River had 18 you know points He scored the basketball But again its just the want to rebounding is just about going after the basketball and making a play I want the ball more than you can get it You want Thats nice Calm n this one high off the glass goes very high That was the angle that he had on the potential gamewinning bucket over a Daimara on Tuesday Five points for Cal Fry steps beyond the arc and Spillers cleans it up That baseline cut is too easy right now Wakes got to do a better job of putting pressure in the ball and and help side defender on that cutter Coven has been a highlight reel at times this season That smooth midrange game His ability to make the midrange to be physical to finish up in that Maryland not Maryland in the in the Michigan game He had a fantastic dunk off transition Okay When we get a whistle I got a question for you Good timing Ill have an answer cheering But watch watch Kelvin drive inside there High off the glass Perfect angle Kiss did it at the top and goes inside And then go ahead and drive inside Watch the 10ft jumper The lost start The 10 to 12t jumper Gets on two feet Fires up Bam Knocks it down Miles Kovven created another poster on Tuesday night Yeah thats the play Im talking about I think Yeah And he had an unbelievable alleyoop here in the season opener I think hes pretty quickly risen up the list of all time Wake Forest dunkers And I was thinking to myself whos the greatest dunker in Demon Deacon history cheering And the candidates all right Rodney Rogers Yeah LD Williams Okay Trent Strickland And Im sure theres a couple that Im forget Yeah I dont know I dont know I You reacted like you had it obvious No I know I had the names of the people and I remember the players and everything Rodney of course but I dont I to be very honest with you its two points laughter I really I couldnt tell you you know I I mean I just I dont know I know that all those players were aggressive They were great leapers and they finished the plays So I Whos a crazy I dont know Itll be one tonight tomorrow somebody What you better do is make the basket How many times have we seen people go for dun and miss him It happens Too many times Oh thats nice There you go With two hands THE GREATEST DUNK IVE SEEN EVER IS RIGHT THERE Come on At the 508 mark Come on Spillers finished it Thats the greatest of all That was in the dunk contest That would be like a six and a half No disrespect to Trey Hey you were talking about it I gave you one You gave him a P You said youd have to be right That was better execution offensively too by Wake Forest Tighten up the defense Fry will take it Makes it You cant let him get his feet set If hes moving a little bit hes not as good shooter that time You kick back and hes there waiting He knocks it down Brings the Riverhawks back within five Still knocking on the door Steal in the ball game Oh got away with one Culvin from the top of the key Rebound Austin Green Hes got eight points and five boards The number of times Wake Forest has been one and done Farmer makes it a twopoint game He is a streaky shooter Evan doesnt have the big numbers so far this year but he can definitely knock down threes He cant had four going into the season in this game as the back end Spillers now with 13 here in the half Spillers at 67 and lefthanded gets on that block and can just work and work and elevate and uses the glass similar to what we saw a few moments ago with Cal I like that shot for him Oh sneaks the pass through to Green and its a foul on Blue and UMass LOLs going to have two free throws when we come back Dan Lutter Im telling you you just the greatest dunk of all time The greatest of all time A dunk by some cold water Wake Forest A fourpoint lead Look at that duck Is it beautiful Every year in the Steve Forbes era at Wake Forest there have been impact transfers and this season is no different Calm me from Wazu Mai Mason from Udub Sebastian from UD and Miles Cvin the former Boiler Maker who could match up with his old team on Friday in the Bahamas if both Wake Forest and Purdue win on Thursday or if they both lose on Thursday Sure hell enjoy seeing some of his former friends and coach Painters club Regardless you watch the Boiler Makers Theyre pretty good I wouldnt What you say I wouldnt I wouldnt care if I saw him or not tell you the truth till after we finished playing Come on No Im ser Im serious Im going to tournament Try to win tournament Yeah Are you see high and by not going to a high school reunion God reunion Not going to a wedding or funeral I dont need to be playing with you The game is over We finished playing Youre done in two days after that Okay Id talk to you if we won If we lost Im like No Im be real honest with all this stuff about being all nice I got to love it No Trying to come win a basketball game You can do both Theyre not mutually exclusive Yes they are Harris to the basket Gets two First two of the game for Juke Right now youre trying to find ways to win You got to you got to make the other person kind of your enemy You got to try to find ways to win You got to lock in This is too important for you I want to talk to you that better Ill call you next week laughter Fry passed it up and Juke had his hands on him Sixth team foul No free throws yet Yeah watch Juke I mean hes hes really been able to attack and glass and also make that midrange jumper like I said leads the team in free throws made and has been playing some exciting basketball the last couple of weeks The Michigan game the 19 points but scored in so many different ways I think you can you know thats a guy that can continue to get better and stack his game Its going to be good this year There you go Right on Q Hes taken over in stretches Thats going to be a double dribble Gary Mar second turnover Wait fourth I love his anticipation to get in the passing lane Didnt you want him to make a big play to just get careless for a second and it only takes a split second You could have gotten kings Here we go Back screen Notice the spacing right there If you can beat the trap at the top youve got something on the weak side or back Drive from Logand Rebound Harris Juke Harris with a left hand and the foul Attack attack attack screaming It all came off a defensive play You contest a long shot get it in the open court let Harris go downhill uses the left hand there and kisses off the glass A little bit of contact you play through that Thats what Im talking about Create your own enthusiasm Create your own juice Make your plays Second foul on Simmons Harris unable to complete the threepoint play Wakes largest lead has been eight That could have cut the deficit in half for the Riverhawks Instead Cal Me the rebound Have got to make that shot Coven traveled Stepping into the three off the pass You get that trap You just saw it And youre able to reverse it Youre going to be open for a split second or even longer So youre on that wing You have got to knock that down But theyre bailed out with another turnover Another unforced turnover Did you think he traveled there I did So did Tony Henderson Thats what matters Mascoy has been the star of the half off the bench for UMass LOL Yeah Flex my friend Well you know what It says not the size of the dog but the the fight in the dog the size of the dog something like that You know what Im talking about Hes not the big Hes not the biggest person in the post but watch this He goes inside He spins back to the middle uses the off hand kisses off the glass He knows how to position his body inside and he elevates well enough that he gets spacing to get the shot off and hes strong enough that if there is contact hes able to finish Not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fighting the dog There you go You got it But all I know is in fighting it dont matter how big you are Threepoint game laughter Thats all I got 11 I make it 12 Calmise to Marian Tough catch and hes got fouled And Marcus Marian will go to the free throw line Its a little sharper Got a little sharper I like the idea Marcus one for three at the line so far this season Said it all last year They really felt like sitting out really helped him Worked on the injury got a little stronger You can see hes a little bit bigger and just hes one of those players that just needs to get quality time on the court to make some plays One for two Only a point and a half two years ago 90 seconds in the half This is closer than anybody expected Austin Green reathers and it was out of bounds off the Riverhawks Flies tell coach who wants to challenge it and theyre going to Well this is a chance to use their use it or lose it timeout anyway So using challenges if Im you know thats going to be that like that last timeout situation in the ball game You got to have a timeout anyway but you know what Im saying Theres your tra see they beat it then you attack Masakoy had it knocked away by Schwigger Shot clock at 11 Tough inbound spot from the corner Spencer gets it back Hes from Calgary for the shot clock winding down Tough turnaround goes Oh nice elevation Good defensive effort by Calmese Spun got his feet set elevates knocked it down Dont have to rush if youre the DS Be effective Culvin for three Got it Big time play there Well done by Wake Forest Possession there goes Wakes way also if in fact theres not a tie up in the next 30 seconds Underrated big bucket creates some separation and a two for one bucket 6second difference Now Wake Forest are they going to push it or they going to pull it back out Theyre going to push and Mason was fouled with 185 to go Valon Farmer That change of events the knockdown jumper on one side then youre able to come back run something get a really nice look that Kovvin does and you stop them And there in transition could be the kind of thing that kind of turns the juice up just a little bit for Wake Forest Stan if I had told you at halftime Weights going to be shooting north of 50 theyre going to be better than 40 from three only five first half turnovers Youd probably think theyd be in pretty good shape Well Id say what they do in the defensive end I probably would though So okay Wakes got a 15 18 point lead maybe Yeah Not even half I but I really felt like that Wake had to come out early as we said in the opening just kind of being in attack mode like McMaso has been in attack mode ever since he came in two seconds at the buzzer GOOD OF IT GOES HE DID IT MILES CVIN FROM 34 COURT AT THE buzzer to inject Thats what I mean Hey or Mitch Shaw Atlanta Take him Thats it Take this Take take the pick All right 20 minutes on the clock All right Let me see what Well I was about to say they got already a foul I want to see how much enthusiasm Wake Forest can take from that last couple of seconds flurry of a basket and then the long range threepointer Got some buzz in the building Does it dissipate there at halftime or do you keep playing off that excuse some execution keep up with the first four minutes Mai Mason gets swatted and Tony Henderson has a foul on Simmons Third see this would have been fine for Simmons if he doesnt hit that arm See the arm go back and then he hits the floor See everything up top is okay Everything up top is fine But its that its that he recoils and then also going to the floor So quiet first half for Mai Mason 0 for three from the floor Only two points at the line Hes a guy that a lot of people expected to be the leading scoreer for the Digs this year at 20 in the opener against American Seven against Morehead then 16 points against Michigan but just five of 18 from the floor He made four threes He was only one for seven on twos in Detroit this past Tuesday Well his game will come and a lot of thats going to come after the half sets A lot of thats going to come on the enthusiasm the way he plays on defense Look for the high load He didnt get it Theres your trap Green goes for the basket gets it to Simmons who missed the layup and Beloo emerges Got to finish that Dodge the bullet there did the digs Hai Mason to high percentage shot and he missed it You know Ive seen in the last two weeks of basketball more shorts and layups like that by a by lots of teams I mean you they missed and I can never remember Do you have theory No I if I did I Id share it with a lot of people Deep three for Fry Comes up short Harris wasnt the first of the ball but he comes away with a rebound lack of concentration Probably thinking hes trying to you know dunking or trying to make the highlight play Trayvon Spiller for two See how quickly he did that Got in his move and his jump in the same play Just kind of both turned over his shoulder Its not been highlighted material Its not been fl fancy and flashy but able to score And UMass low getting on the floor arrow belongs to the Riverhawks Now UMass Law has got to understand that a trap is coming in the middle of the floor and their first options been the high post pass And Wake is doing a very good job of trying to deny it to make that hard So theyve got to be ready Their wings have got to come up and try to make that skip pass make the diagonal to go someplace else with the basketball Theyre tra theyre taking the middle way which is what youre supposed to do as best keep it moving Fry thought about it from the W Feeds it inside Sean Simmons better Thats a great job of handling the trap and a good finish that time Left no doubt We told you Simmons was a great leaper Finish it strong Mason unable to bank it home Duncan style Fry decent look Rebound to Belaloo Calmese to Mason Pop pass to the corner Juke Harris to the bucket Draws contact Two free throws coming for Harris Watch this ball move There it goes inside Nice bounce pass Watch that footwork Boom And you spin and he takes it strong Watch this again Boom Boom Kip it up high Didnt even put it on the floor Theres no doubt about that play as opposed to what he had a moment ago which is probably a little easier And he missed the layup Nice move from the former St Joes Hawk There you go Thats why it made sense for him to go from one hawk to another Hawk River Stay with me here man Hes I I got it I got it Ill work it in for you Im happy to see that you made it in on your flight I I tell you what that just its like wow Never been so happy to see Evan Leard knowing you were safe in the air Long flight Fortunate to have a ball game yesterday and thrilled to be at the Joel Coliseum today Every time you get a chance to wake up you should be happy Every time you get a chance to wake up and do a ball game thats even better Yes indeed Theres your trap Good hands Spiller is going to take it all the way There you go Great job there Yes More pressure Theyre tight on the trap and UMass Loyal has got to find a way to attack it better Ball fake shot face good timeout Pat Zucat wants to talk with his team Wake Forest on an 82 spurt coming into the second music half They outscored the Riverhawks 162 since the end of the first with 45 seconds left in the first half Less than four minutes later Deacons have a 16point lead That Miles Coven buzzer beater certainly built some energy and the Deaks have come out strong to start the second half Yeah I Ill count the final 51 seconds part of what I was talking about earlier Theres a threepoint play gets you back about how do you play the first four minutes It was a 162 run kind of that last 51 seconds for Wake Forest And thats what you have to have And what did they do They put pressure on you They got some traps They were able to finish strong knock down a three had a couple of dunks out of that Those are the plays that youve got to have in a game like this or any game but especially today This freshman from Prince Georges County Maryland JJ Mascoy has been a menace Hes got 15 off the bench One shy of a season high at 16 New Haven Juke Harris Wow Angled shot Circus shot by Juke Nice But Messiqua is hard to guard because when hes 64 65 66 whatever they say but hes as hes wide as he is tall I dont think hes that tall Yeah but hes you know but he hes wide enough He takes up space and hes got really nice footwork in the man Take that shot away now See what you can get Everybodys got a get in the middle Aoji spinning in the lane Thats the play Well done for the Castlebar Ireland native Good discipline by Fi not to take the long range three from the left side which is the area he likes to shoot in Take your time working get in the middle and then just a Koji does a nice job of turning over this shoulder with the jump hook Duke tough turnaround Yeah hes going to be very tough to guard if he gets a foot in the paint Strong enough also can elevate over you Last two baskets have been paint baskets Aoji misfires that time near the rim Here comes Calmese from the point Anticipating the foul Calme down the alley going glass Tail of two halves basically This is the way I think coach Forbes would have liked to have seen his team step up and start the basketball game Fry jump stop in the lane Back outside Its Yepto Hit a couple early threes and hes bumped by Cal Me on the floor And well get ourselves a timeout team And you think about Alanis Williams and Tyrie Applebee and Jake Laravia and all the other players that Steve Forbes has brought in through the transfer portal in recent years This trio any of them are capable of being the best player on the court any given night Yeah you know Mason Colise veteran players have the ability to score So well just see Just take time You never know South Rabius start for the Lakers the other night Heres Nate Cal and hell get free throws out playing great Los Angeles Third foul on Yepto Cal to the free throw line Thats his third team sporting timeout for your 6 miles period Next to the line stays perfect at the strike comes into the ball game The Riverhogs had a very interesting first half and two out of five from the from the field One threepointer and was very active Well see if they can get him going on the up Look out Kiss knocked it away Loose ball Marian dives on top of it Gets it to the point guard Thats what I want to see Wake the chance to stretch the lead past 20 Its a twopoint game not that long ago Duke will go to the free throw line Really needs a basket right now He just kind of lowers his head goes inside gets about that ACC logo and just makes a play Either elevates over here or explodes and goes by him big time scorer at Salsbury High School 29 times he scored at least 30 Eight times he scored at least 40 Stan Lutter like numbers The Horn Yeah The Salsbury Hornets Straight away Akoji cant connect Not the shot they wanted out of him with the rebound And then you just kind of slowly surgically extend the lead There you go Calm me into double figures with that three And the Daks are suddenly up 24 with a lot of time to play Turn D up Take care of the B Theres your trap Trying to go to the middle Steel Another near steel instead Yep Gets a great look Rims out That shot was going in in the first half ahead Its Coven He will step back and shoot Marion on the glass Kicks it Calm me Reload for three Calm me averaged 15 points a ball game last year at Washington State Weve looked at him more as a penetrator and a passer so far this year but he cant step up and knock down shots backto back threes And somebody stopped the bleeding for UMass LOL Spencer misss but Yepto with a rebound Farmer steps inside the arc and comes up short CALM ME AHEAD FOR SPILLERS LOOK OUT cheering TIMEOUT RIVERHAWKS All of a sudden Wake Forest leads by 29 music Its a 16 nothing run over the last three minutes And remember its a 347 run dating back to the 45se secondond mark in the first half Was 4038 Felt like Wake was going to really have to grind through this thing And now they cant do anything wrong Juke Harris throws it cheering down So now what team is this The Digs What team is this Because the team you played in the first half cheering and applause thats a different team This is what they wanted to do This is what they coach for wanted from the moment the game started Xavier Spencer the Canadian gets two more traps and passing lanes follow shots Every loose ball youre diving after it from the corner Juke Harris all of a sudden Jukes up to 17 Spillers with 19 Calmese with 15 Nates also got seven assists and six rebounds You see how high Wake Forest defensively comes out So okay even if you get it in the middle Ill reverse it I can trap you out of that which is what happened a moment ago So really more intensity on the defensive end being aggressive There you go The steels are coming in a flurry and Juke takes it himself He had Miles Coleman ahead and Juke said I want the two And a highlight reel just waiting to happen now Whistle on the way down the floor Deacons cant miss right now Cal to Harris Demon Deacons have scored 33 points in less than eight and a half minutes to start this second half It has been a sight to behold Stan Lutter we were waiting for it and finally it happened Call my name out loud like that Stan Lutter Its just Stan Dont call me People know might be in trouble sometime Not to be confused with the great Stan Cotton who was on the football game last night for 30 years Got a nice award nice play Im waiting for hours 30 years 20 20 more years Um yeah its just a tale of two halves And its amazing how whatever can turn the light on See look how aggressive they are Here we go Here we go Marcus Marian takes it coast to coast Thats a nice play Good for Marcus Marion You reward yourself when you do positive things Got out there doubled up got the skill took it up and then took it strong Its just its amazing Three points 50 points now for the Danish thirdyear sophomore Comes out again They rush you And the trap that trap is worked It sped them up but the shot is still available if you handle the basketball The problem is that theyve not done a good job in the second half obviously of handling the pressure by Wake Forest from the other corner this time Its Miles Coven And its amazing the harder you play the better you play on defense the easier shots come to you This Ray Wicks going to hit 100 by the under eight timeout They give it they give you something here Get like a ChickfilA or only if they miss two free throws after the 8minute mark you get ChickfilA I was just wondering what you get if you get a 100 because we gonna get a 100 You going to get 100 Satisfaction Well not us Something about seeing a hundred on the board As soon as somebody dunk everybody just goes nuts over So you know Im just wondering I still vividly remember when I was a freshman at Wake Forest Okay And Wake was hosting Indiana in the ACC Big 10 Challenge Okay And Wake won by like 33 I want to say And Richard Joyce who was a freshman didnt play a lot maybe a sophomore Anyway he hit the bucket with like 35 seconds to go to to give the Deaks 100 and the place went berserk Who was a coach in Indiana Uh it was coach It wasnt coach Knight Coach Knight was No So uh Miller or was it Davis Let me think about Mike Davis I think it was Mike Davis Yeah hell come to me Akens cant connect See I I did you like you do me sometimes didnt you laughter We were talking about a minute ago the impact transfers and Cooper Swagger somebody that I think can also be very impactful know a very impressive resume coming out of Valpo and I was talking early in the ball game about that potential double double because of his length at 69 610 his ability to have good footwork and run the floor hes going to be able to get a lot of weak side rebounds and follows a really nice move Im really impressed with him but I think his ability to score the basketball in the midrange pass is going to allow him to have that you know it might not be a 25 and 15 game but that play right there he didnt make that but thats a good look for him Hes going to have to hes going to have to have some big number games like that this season I think Mascoy about 66 Yes Id say hes probably closer to 63 Nah but hes hes alone Hes hes strong Yeah you know hes a freshman Can he play at a higher level I dont mean to take him away from the Riverhawks but its the natural question in this day and age And I think again I would answer that by saying I dont know because you just dont know what that particular team needs but there could be a place for him at some level Oh he gets it to go Look what I found I tell you the harder you work the luckier you get Sam if you call that the greatest dunk in Wake Forest history Im going to smack you Well to keep me from having to hurt you it hit me Hit me back Ill let that go Ill say that was a very impressive dunk By the way you were right Mike Davis was the coach of that Indiana team That was laughter the greatest DUNK IN WAKE FOREST HISTORY SLAP laughter I I remember the exact score It was 167 when Wake beat Indiana December 2nd 2003 Oh you look that up man You dont remember that You dont know what the day date is Somebody lost the shoe 20 22 years to the day Wake Forest will host Oklahoma on December 2nd Bingo ACC SECC challenge Ill tell you what I tell you what weeks from now seriously seriously the challenge of this nonconference schedule the Wake Forest has to play navigate thats got to open some eyes if he has success dont you think The tournament this weekend if you have success Yeah Well thats the idea is to win them Mason struggling right now But you cant you cant I tell you what Im be Im serious about this Well have time for the foul Its going to be okay Im very serious and I think coach Forbes would tell say this too They cant play the first half against the Texas Tech and Purdue and whos the other team is tournament and Memphis You cant you cant play like that consistently expect to beat those teams I mean you have to come out not firing at all cylinders but close to it because you know theyre going to I think theyll theyll naturally be more energy I think so too Yeah Thursday cheering night 830 tip off CBS Sports Net has todays game Todays game kind of reminds you and a lot of nonconference games early remind you of NCAA first round games except this isnt a neutral sight But you know you youve got youve got to go out and create your own enthusiasm People just get in the building sometimes whatever You have to go out and play And thats why I like how they ended the first half They got some steals got some scores Yeah You cant depend on a a slim dunk someplace A little zone out of out of l right now Isaac Carr dishes Omaha Belaloo flushes Probably the most impressive offensive game Beloo has had this season without a doubt Easily 10 points Three for three from the floor two for two from deep Hes also two for two from the line He hadnt missed Remember he came off the bench last year in the Coppin game Was his first game at Wake and knocked down a couple of shots and everybody was Omaha Blue Farmer Tough turnaround Doesnt get the bounce like Mascoy just a menace You have to be that big to do that He just got great position and went after the basketball Went between two W defenders Hes been unbelievable And hes got another rebound Yeah 24 points six boards Mascoy takes it all the way Good hands good footwork Hes going to go for a 30 piece and explode to the glass again You got to like him Got to like him Hes got 28 and his team trails by 28 66 235 lbs Mason finally dials long distance and connects Saw a sigh of relief by Mai Mason when he knocked down the three Started the game 0 for seven from the field 0 for four from deep Got in the passing lane That was a good read Farmer over Schwagger No Mason the rebound Here comes Isaac Carr the freshman from Portland Oregon Mason again Not this time Rebound Green Crosscourt Farmer for three Nice Nice Quick timeout taken by Steve Forbes and we will take it as well 9365 music Digs for Wake Forest forcing turnovers getting out scoring in transition Effective double team there at the top Good trap get in the music passing lane picked up the dribble Nice unselfish pass line for the finish Cant trap the basketball Push it Push it Push it real good Lay it up Got the basket Better defense plays better enthusiasm harder getting plays And what happens You get 13 fast break points and 18 points for Wake Forest off turnovers gives you this big lead Its Isaac Carr Miles Coven Omaha Belaloo Trayvon Spillers and Juke Harris for Wake Forest And the Deacons turn it over for the sixth time First time in the second half Not bad though 14 minutes second half without any turnovers Very good Isaac Carr ahead to Juke Harris Look out Two more for Juke Hes got 21 on the day See how easy it is to get layups and get the dunks when youve done something to the defense You take their heart away with the steel You come down get the easy basket Great job on the traps and with the size and the length of Wake Forest The the the U Mass guards have had a hard time trying to make the right decision where to make the pass ball side or skip side Roersonson could not connect inside Chance for Isaac Carr to look for his first basket perhaps Belaloo kicks it out Carr gives it up Harris too strong with the rebound tipped by Spillers and then tipped away from Belaloo and then tipped again by Kovven but its a Cooji Riverhawks three Yep No Harris the rebound Isaac Carr has his first two points as it demon There you go applause and cheering gets a nice hand from the knowledgeable crowd that recognizes the circumstances Here we go Trayvon He was fouled Lifted back up Spillers is all right Take a deep breath We got 358 to go when we come back Wake Forest has five double figure scores and 97 total points and two free throws coming here for Trayvon Spillers to add to the offense Wake Forest will take on the Texas Tech Red Raiders Thursday night 830 down in the Bahamas And then one night later take on either Memphis or Purdue Its going to be a challenging couple of days especially the quick turnaround back to but even thats the Thursday Saturday or Friday Sunday Its not backtoback days Yeah but youre preparing the moment that another game is You got to flip the script So that day between his is walk through and film session and rehab ACC tournament Yeah same tournament is pressure express You got to be ready to play Strong rebound by Jaylen Cross and he just got fouled and thats going to give him a chance to go to the free throw line for the first time Here we go Cant go down there looking at the beach in the sand Its there but itll be down there win if its even better Jaylen McCross averaged 15 points a game as a high school senior Caldwell Academy Greensboro native looking for his first points Yeah good for him Met his mom and some family members at the U Morehead State game cheering So uh very excited about being in Wake Forest and what his potential could be So good for him Got in the score Swagger the rebound Kick out Carr for three Bam Got it Its what hes known for as a primitive shooter But again Swigger making that contribution Smart play Second chance opportunity Kept it alive Found a shooter Car Bears and gets another point on the board Been over two years since the Deakons have scored a 100 cheering So you get you get something else Bojangles talked about here You already got your freebojangles today Scott Yeah but you got a hundred I dont think so Im just asking asking for a friend Omaha Omaha It is football Sunday after all It makes sense that weve had some Omaha knocking down threes Good to see the ball going to basket for him Started the season 0 for nine from Threeland Loves that corner Loves that deep wing Thats good for him Come the walkons for a little late run as well Three from the corner for Victor Aoji Hes been impressive in his Riverhawks debut here today America East better look out because this team they got only a tenth of a point returning Okay Whatever But uh this this is going to be a a team to record with throughout the season The American East Carr takes another and Walter has the rebound Isaiah Walter the Australian and he is going to get to the free throw line for a one and one Good spot going to bring in the Wake Forest walkons Will Underwood Vincent Rakuti and Anson Beard Jr cheering applause It took a little bit to get rolling for the Deaks but uh a a basket just before the half the long range half court to 34 bomb and he come out with a new attitude and a fresh approach and uh 50 second hand second half points plus some and also welcome number 30 Junior Anson Beards first ever appearance as a Wake Forest Demon Deacon freshman from New York City This is Will Underwood who comes up with a loose ball Wills appeared in six games in the past but hes never scored No time like the present time Cross kicks it This is Rakuti Around and out and a reaching foul on the junior from San Diego Vincent Rudy I I like this time you know rewards some of the guys that dont get a chance to play some of the walkons and that type of thing that get out there and put in the time and effort as well And I like to see them try to screw the basketball but what I want to see you do is run your stuff and get a shot Dont be Dont be bashful to shoot the ball make a play make a smart solid play and just kind of go with it You Youve earned that just dont come down there jacking them up because the crowds going crazy They want to SEE PUT LAPLER IN PUT LAPLER IN Youre bouncing off your head off your shoulder and stuff like that Run See I like this Run something If if a shot comes in your offense its going to come Take it There you go On the drive Layup wont go There you go Carr with a steel Got Cross with him Carr met at the rim Cross ts with it Gets the hand one applause and cheering Isaac Carr had big ambition there and his eyes got a little big thinking about his first collegiate dunk Watch Angel Monttos kill in the weak side Measuring it Measuring it Here we go Boom Gets the block But again the ball in the right place And now Cross gets a chance to get the threepoint play He does Nice stroke Four points for Jaylen Cross Wake will have probably one more possession with the walkons to get a chance Oh and one at the other end when Bucko two were to play I tell you Im impressed Not only I expected him to play hard but Im impressed with some of the athleticism you see out of some of these guys cheering And you watch them on tape a little quicker than you than you think and and maybe make some plays bigger than you And I tell you what you cannot talk enough about Masipla going to call kick ball on Will Underwood preseason what picked uh number four or you know Vermonts always up there so I think its Vermonts number preseason one main super flags brother ace flags on that team and you Albany is always good and you miss so hey this will be Wake Forest ball with 519 so realistically this is likely the last possession for Wake Forest with a shot clock on can Underwood or Rakuti or Beer get a bucket NJIT comes to this area in a couple of weeks also sir Rakuti deep three Boom Take the shot Had a couple good looks That was a long one More free throws coming with 256 to go So the Deaks are going to improve to three and one The one loss by one point in overtime to a very strong Michigan Wolverine squad led by Dusty May And now Texas Tech on deck Thursday night Deacons next home game the Tuesday before Thanksgiving a week from Tuesday against the Fighting Camels from Buoys Creek North Carolina Texas Tech Remember the name Donovan Atwell kid from over in the Charlotte area Can fill it up Can fill it up Played at UNC Greensboro for a couple of years He can knock down threes applause Steve Forbes and Pat Duket shake hands and Wake Forest wins by 34 Its a twopoint game with 45 seconds left in the half
