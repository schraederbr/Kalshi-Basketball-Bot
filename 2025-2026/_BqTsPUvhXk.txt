Lennox and ready to get underway tonight from Syracuse Hawks are the first possession of tonights game And here is Jones cheering Bounces it inside for Justice Aaron And that feeds the cutter to Seir Haskins to get things started tonight Well Mike one thing St Joes does a really good job of is cutting off the basketball and you see it right there Haskins with a great example Great find and finish at the rim Starting five for the Orange tonight Whats been most impressive to you as youve watched this team so far this season with this group Defensively theyve been there every single game Maybe minus the Iowa State game but every single game theyve been competing at a high level and theyve really been hanging their hat on the defensive side of the ball Theres your starting five of the Hawks here tonight Aza big guy inside Hassan scored the first bucket Jones has actually hit a couple of game winners this year for St Joes as theyve come in on a fourgame winning streak Yeah Jones is a guy who its a lot of give and take with him He has to be in control He has to be in efficient but man he can score in bunches Hes dynamic and hes not afraid to be aggressive and get downhill and attack the basket Syracuse possession here Little fadeaway jumper baseline as a go by Nate Kings And here come the Hawks the other way once again with Jones Derek Simpson inside Azima and he lost it and then he tried to save him from going out of bounds there inside with Sadique White Jr quickly the other way George and hes fouled on his way in And Mike you see early on just the versatility and the activeness of Syracuse defense allows them to get out and play in transition One thing they have to do when theyre not getting out in transition they have to be more efficient in the half court execute so they can get clean open opportunities How about Adrien Autry uh and the job that hes done now here in his third season for Syracuse What do you think Well first of all its tough when you have to fill the shoes of a Hall of Famer Coach Beheim right But hes come in I think this season hes got the guys that he wanted to get Athletic versatile right every time they play a game theyre going to be either as athletic or more athletic So I think hes more comfortable about the guys he gets and now hes be able to put his system into play And you know its working for him so far this year How about this schedule for Syracuse I mean you played Houston you played Kansas you played Iowa State and then you beat Tennessee I mean you cant get much tougher than that in the early part of the nonconference Well what do they say To to be the best you have to be able to play the best And I think early on they want to see where theyre at and they competed in every single game except that Iowa State game But if they sure some stuff offensively and execute theyll be there every single game Theyre competing at a high level Derek Simpson puts it in for two Its 4 to2 Hawks here early Two minutes gone by in the first half White short on the hook and rebounded by Jones And theres an example right there Stagnant isolation basketball Syracuse needs to get more ball movement so they can get cleaner opportunities This is like one of those games right If youre the opponent you hang around you play hard early then then youre in that type of ball game If you let them get on a run right Get down double digits early it could be a long night Well especially on the road when you give guys some life now theyre feeling like okay we can play with these guys So you want to be able to try to set the tone early and not let these guys hang around too long applause and cheering Thats off the leg of Jones and Steve Donahghue What a crazy runner was this off season right He was actually brought in as the associate head coach in May Billy Lang left to go to the Knicks and work for them and that was in early September and then right off the bat they promoted him to head coach and now here we are 24 years in college basketball hes seen it all Right And hes going to have his guys ready to compete and play And this isnt his first time in the carrier or the JM JMA Ryland dome No Im going back to my playing days but he knows what to expect when he comes in here in the dark What were we saying earlier about he had a coach against Carmel Anthony right And now his son I guess is playing now for the Orange right And we asked we asked him how it made him feel and his answer was It makes me feel old laughter Heres George for Syracuse feeds the cover OH cheering FOUL IS CALLED AN almost highlight reel material and the potential throw down there by William Kyle Look out And this is where Syracuse really excels in open court You see Nate George one of the best passers in the ACC And I tell you what if you get in the way of William Kyle you better say your prayers because he is attacking the basket And here comes Kayen Anthony Carmelo Anonys son Carmelo is here tonight There he is The alltime greats Friend of yours here of course from the Orange Yeah Hall of Famer I mean how awesome is it to come here and see your son play in where you where you dominated at and then let alone his sons coming in as a freshman contributed in a major way Just an unbelievable feeling to be able to come in here and watch your son play at a high level Working it in is Jaden Gber Tusano and the runner for two4 All right lets go to DVOs Dimes here Uh what do you got tonight Eric Well I think for St Joes uh two things paint touches and free throws If they can get in there collapse the defense theyll get easier opportunities then theyll get opportunities at the free throw line And then two limit Syracuse in transition Make them play in half court Make them shoot jump shots And on the other side for Syracuse keep the guards out of the paint These guards love to be aggressive getting downhill and then play with pace We talked about the struggles they had in half court Get out play fast and get easy looks at the rim Well to your point right here Sadi White goes in but doesnt get the runner And St Joes the other way Simpson on the cut and he kicks it out to Jones Nice feed inside and the bucket for Simpson And on the other side like St Joes isnt afraid to get up and and play with a little bit of pace They got decision makers They got guys who can make plays Syracuse has to be able to make them play in the half court as well Yeah Syracuse I mean St Joes has scored in the 80s three times so far this year They scored 100 earlier as well Almost a steal by Jones Heres Starling to the corner Its a three Kings and hes got it And Mike Kingston has been struggling shooting the ball this whole season Hes come in known as a threepoint shooter He shot 44 at Oregon State last year Had a great first half last game versus Tennessee 19 points Great to see him knock down his first threepoint attempt On the drive and a fouls called here as Jaden Glover Tusano will head to the line for a lot of people So uh if you can help out this is an important week for cancer research Yeah no doubt And and this is where your donations and your money go to help these type of families these people these personal connections right And 100 of your donations go to directly to cancer research If youre able give now at vorgdonate Back to action here tonight with St Joes leading 97 of the free throw line Jaden Glover Tusano transfer out of St Johns cheering sophomore for the Hawks and has now put him up by three Well St Joes has been the aggressor Theyve been one setting the tone attacking the rim getting to the foul line Offensively Syracuse has been stagnant and theyre shooting tough shots They got to get some more flow in their offense and get some more rhythm going Shot clocks inside 10 Ball knocked away Warren still have it To the corner Starling Thats a jumper Thats no good And rebounded by Simpson Ahead of the pack He finds Jones Wow They forget about We talked about Syracuse playing with pace How about St Joes getting up and down And these two guards Jones and Simpsons they can make and create plays And you see him right now getting up and down playing fast pace and getting opportunities at the rim out of bounds at the sideline Eric look I know its early but I think a lot of people thought this might have been a onesided affair here you know but St Joes a pretty good team All right theyve won four games in a row Theyve got a lot of guys returning that have played together that know each other And this guy right here and Steve Donahghue everybody has said what a perfect fit he has been you know leading this cheering group right now We talked about 24 years in college basketball Hes seen it all Hes going to have his guys ready and these guys are young for St Jones but a lot of these guys are are transferring in from St Johns Iona like theyve played high level basketball Theyre not coming in here intimidated at all No not at all cheering Fivepoint lead right now for the Hawks as they turn it back over Theres Anthony over to Kings working his way in Back out to the outside Intercepted again Simpson does it again Haskins Alume Jones Timeout Syracuse And coach Audrey has seen enough as the Hawks lead it by seven How about St Jones defensively turn it into offense on the other end and throw IT UP FOR JONES Imma lay it up I I I played at the Qs from 05 to09 and we played Cornell every single year One thing about coach Donahoo is hes going to have his guys prepared Theyre going to know the scout report Theyre going to know all the other players tendencies and most importantly hes going to have his guys play super super hard Starling knocks it in for the Orange Its a fivepoint game Yeah After Cornell he spent four years at Boston College nine at Penn and now here at St Joes Good rotation and a nice block by Anthony on the shot that time by Simpson Great job by Syracuse just showing their length being active That was really good ball move by St Joes but Anthony did a great job of recovering getting the block Couple of substitutions here for the Hawks We got Anthony Finkeley in for the first time tonight Number five Jaden Smith number 10 And then also Austin Willilifford number 13 is in for St Joes And Mike we were at shootaround earlier and and coach Donahghue he was raving about Willordford a freshman a true freshman a guy who is a threelevel scorer super talented and and he said he thinks Willford could be one of the best prospects that St Jones has had in a long time That balls knocked out off of Jones And yeah Willford Willafford coming from St Ans Bellefield School down in Charlottesville Virginia Freshman at 64 195 Hes fitting right in pretty well here early Thats for sure And they and they go pretty deep I mean this is about n or 10 deep that the Hawks will play on a nightly basis Yeah And and guys are going to be ready And another guy you got to watch out for is Anthony Finley right Hes a guy who shoots 44 from the threepoint field but this year hes really been struggling shooting the ball Theyre looking to him to get back on track Yeah Coming off the bench now And now here comes Starling into the front court Its Betsy for three Its no good And Simpson has been all over the place with the rebounds here tonight for St shows Hes up to four boards already in this game Simpson actually leads the team in rebounds assists and steals Hes a doitall guard in the back court Yeah 53 rebounds per game and hes already almost at that average Heres Frankley over to Jones Shot clock down to four Deuce Jones pops it up And Syracuse will live with that shot every single time Isolation tough shot We know Duce Jones can knock that down but Syracuse will live with that Nice shot there by Figer to come in and knock it away Jones gets it Will Ford trying to use his body and theyre going to call it on the offensive foul as getting back on D that time was Betsy And they call Will a Ford the the last four games for Syracuse You saw the numbers there The net ranking on average was at 18 And then because of the level of competition they played It was crazy right I mean you had Houston you had Kansas you had Iowa State you had Tennessee Obviously a little different here tonight because they are trailing Uh but maybe it starts to let up a little bit right before they get into conference play Well look their first four games they win by an average about 30 to 40 points All right And youre supposed to do that When you go play against Houston Kansas and Iowa State its going to be a different story But I think Syracuse competed in all those games probably except for Iowa State If they continue compete at a high level defensively theyll be in every single game Offensively they just got to find some more continuity on that end and hopefully get some cleaner looks and knock them down Now lets pop that graphic up again because that is a major problem and you cannot be at that level if you want to be a potential championship team right I mean what Look at this I mean this is second to last in free throw shooting so far this season Hopefully that starts to turn around Well yeah Well in late game situations when your guards have the ball theyre going to get fouled Now you have to be able to knock down free throws and and when one of your main guards is shooting 45 from the free throw line you dont have a lot of confidence in him with the ball So A lot of it is mental Just step up to the line and be confident We know they shoot thousands of reps in practice You just got to go up there and believe that youre going to make the shot and hopefully that turns around for Ter Kick out here for Pinkley Now Meyers his pass deflected Got it back Got it to Jones Five to shoot Jones is wrapped up and fouled there by Nathan George One thing about the free throw numbers the good thing is its still early in the season right When you go through and you look at players and you get numbers and you say Oh hes a 90 free throw shooter Hes nine for 10 you know like give me a 100 shots and see what happens So I mean thats not a great number right now We have played nine games eight games but later in the year hopefully that starts to boost itself up Yeah Mike I I dont care if we played three games If youre shooting 40 from the free throw line thats an issue right there Especially a high high major game you have to be able to shoot at least 65 as a team Azaba is fouled and hes headed to the line for two Great drive and find and Aza hes just being aggressive at the rim You know usually the aggressor wins Theyre either going to make the bucket or theyre going to get opportunity for two shots at the line Azaba whos a graduate student here for St Joes and started his career at Harvard He only played six games back in the 202122 season So he had gotten a waiver was able to get that year back Uh second in conference in terms of block shots Thats what hes going to bring to the table Hes already got 19 this season Uh and his story is incredible Grew up in Nigeria uh lost both parents within a month to illness at age 10 Came over here to the United States and you know really started to get into basketball He wasnt really introduced to it till later you know in his life you know as a younger player wasnt really playing that and now look at him here at the highest level here in division one and I think most importantly a great kid We were messing around with him earlier in warmups just talking about the pronunciation of his name and yeah you know he had some humor with it but we talked to Donahghue at shootaround Hes averaging almost three blocks a game but hes almost the opposite of William Kyle Hes not a guy whos going to be flying around and coming from the weak side Hes more of a guy thats timing your shots and thats how hes been able to get you know most of his blocks Franklin was called for the foul for St Joes Theyre still up by five points here early almost halfway through the first half Ken Anthony has it Starling got hit Gets it back out to Betsy Thats a three Its good cheering And Mike those are the type of looks that you want to get Drive and kick touch the paint kick it out pump fake get a good look knock it down Thats a big shot there to put him within two Pulling up Jones Not there Long rebound out to Finley Bounces it Aaba No but a foul again William Kyle in the foul Mike both of these teams dont shoot the ball particularly well Both are under 30 shooting from the threepoint line So you know both teams are going to be aggressive getting to the basket Syracuse two of four from the threepoint line St Joes 05 How about these games coming up on Tuesday on the ACC Network Give me your take on Duke and then give me your take on North Carolina this season Well how about the big fella boozer We We got another fatherson thing going on that that must be an ACC thing going on But I mean Boozer hes a guy who can shoot pass and dribble from the forward position And then talk about Caleb Wilson from North Carolina Hes a top five draft pick I mean the guy is athletic off the charge in the mid post and you can put it on the ground Hes one of the best prospects in the nation regardless of class Thats some of the easiest recruiting youre ever going to have right Just going to qualify Oh look at this Its a threepointer and a foul counted for Betsy as he hits the deck cheering and Finley gets called for his second personal and Syracuse is in front And Mike Betsy has had games where hes got hot hitting three four threes in a row We see it right him knocking down his second three and a chance for a fourpoint play will be at the line for Wood Those are gamechanging moments right there I know its early Its a onepoint lead but that just kind of turns things around in Syracuses favor Right now theyre playing from ahead Get a little bit of confidence The shots are going down Third threepointer they made tonight Got to knock down your free throw Im going to add a little bit of negative You got to knock down your free throw but especially at home you need that momentum You hit a few shots Now youre playing a little bit tougher defense and youre getting a little bit more flow on the offensive side Simpson kicks it out Haskins stays in bounds Pops up a three Its no good And rebounded by William Kyle First Syracuse lead here tonight 1615 Anthony by Kyle cheering Well Mike I tell you what if that ball sits on the rim for more than two seconds you better watch out cuz William Kyle is coming by like Superman What a finish That was incredible No field goals over the last 5 minutes plus here for St Joes And now you see the defense intensity starting to pick up The ball pressure theyre in your pocket Its an eight nothing Syracuse run after being down 15 to 10 Heres a three Its no good cheering by Jones Orange now starting to take a little bit of a command of this game even though its early Trying to add on to this eight nothing run back up to Nathan George Shot clocks inside 10 Syracuse has to get some off ball movement Everybody is just standing around behind the back Betsy tough fle got it to go cheering as the shot clock is winding down and look its a great shot but its a tough shot you want to be able to get some easier looks you cant sustain throughout the game taking tough hard shots 10 nothing run or a 131 run over the last five and a half St Joes has missed their last seven make it eight cheering Starling behind the back Its intercepted by Jones Didnt need that there Thats unnecessary right there You did a great job defensively forcing a tough shot And now you come back on the other end and St Joes take advantage of it Knock it down to three Now theyre right back in it Thats like a fivepoint swing right there Eric as we got to But you got to deal with some of the turnovers and then unfortunately hes had about five technical flagrant fouls here this season And that you just cant have that Well look Mike Im not one to talk cuz when I played I I I wore my emotions on my sleeve I was a passionate guy You just got to tone it down a little bit And you got to know how that can affect your team in a negative way But hes super talented Hes a guy who can score in a variety of ways He just has to be able to settle down and tame it a little bit so his team can end up getting some wins All right So do you remember if theres any uh particular games that you know you probably could have toned it down a little You know what Technical What do you know the total or is it like something So I didnt have a lot of texts I was just I got I talked a lot of trash right So I I got a lot of go Hey Der settle down a little bit will you But one particular game I remember were playing uh Chicago Illinois and you see the shot clock violation right there Great defense by I blocked the shot and then I yelled something really loud Im not going to say what I yelled but I got a tech right away and then coach Behem sat me down and he put me back in later on But I was passionate I love the game and and emotions were always high but you do have to be able to calm it down Its for the betterment of your team Yeah Well and theyre going to call that I mean youve seen it too Any any taunting whether directed at the players or the staff or the fans or anything like that the officials are all over that these days Like I was in the old Big East Not the old old Big East but the old Big East So it it was physical It was trash talking So so a lot of those refs you know they were used to that So they didnt they let all that go a little bit Jones and he got fouled Yeah Thats the kind of thing when you think about right college basketball the different types of either atmospheres or leagues you know theres an identity you know some of those right you talk about the Big 12 or like you said Big East back in the day like you kind of understood that So if you were coming in as an opponent and the officials too they all kind of knew what to expect in those type of situations Well and two if you set the tone from the jump being physical and youre consistent playing that way the whole game thats how theyre going to call it If youre inconsistent playing like that theyre going to call it differently The foul is on Fenel missing on the three was Simpson as St Joes is now 1 for 10 from threepoint range And running it up and in is Sadique White Jr We havent talked about Sadique White but hes a guy whos a big time NBA prospect A guy who flies around Right now hes better on the defensive side of the ball Hes raw offensively but he has the tools and he will keep improving as the season goes on Haskins feeds it off here for Jones Gets it back Haskins for three Thats no good Tough shooting so far for the Hawks from the outside And quickly that is a goalend And they count the basket Were talking about lets take a look at the goalend here Yeah we just talked about this with the officials before the game Minute it hits the backboard and then you hit it Thats an obvious goal And if anyone knows it we know it We went in the back in the locker room talked to him and cleared up everything But great job by Nate Kings just pushing the pace putting his head down and being aggressive towards the rim When you do that good things usually happen wanted to ask you about not only White but the freshman class here with Kayen Anthony and Luke Fenel who are getting a lot of time right now for the Orange What about that uh trio Yeah I mean Kai Anthony threelevel scorer He can do it in a variety of ways Sadique White we just talked about him super athlete better on the defensive side but hell improve offensively And cheering Fenel is a guy who played pro overseas in Australia Hes a heady point guard makes good decisions he can shoot the basketball and hes still young He wont hes not going to get a lot of time this year but as he gets older he hell see more time for the Syracuse You just heard and saw Azaba throw it down there for St Joes Fourpoint game on the runner here now by Fenel No good Here come the Hawks Jones stopping popping and nailing a three And its a onepoint game And and Mike what created that was Simpson Hes getting his fifth six rebound He Hes a point guard leading the team in rebounds Gets it pushes the pace kicks it ahead to Jones who knocks down another three Simpson has had his hand into the passing lanes and all over the place defensively for this team so far tonight We talked about it Assists rebounds and steals Hes active Hes a big guard Hes aggressive getting downhill Hes averaging about 12 points as well Heres Spinkley He can play on the outside like that A pass a bad one Its intercepted George behind the back out to the corner Three ball short offensive rebound off the Fenel miss And its going to be William Kyle heading to the free throw line for two In position to have success applause and cheering a little unorthodox to say the least right He gets it back to that right side though Its almost like he does a left to right and hes making it harder than it has to be But you know what He made the gamewinning free throw against Tennessee and he just knocked down his two free throws right there Which is good because he came in at 41 on the season and I dont want to say its because of the style Its just you know thats whats going on But he is four for four tonight Right I guess if its not broke dont fix it laughter Why are they shooting so poorly from the foul You know its like heres a steel on the way to home for two is George And Mike this is a guy who Ive really been waiting on Nathan George had an unbelievable season last year at Georgia Tech Led the ACC in assists Great playmaker Hasnt played up to the expectations Syracuse fans think but hes coming And when he does this Syracuse team will take it to a whole another level Yeah look out Right Deuce Jones here on the bucket And were back to a onepoint game St Joes 24 excuse me threepoint game Talk about taking it to another level Deuce Jones is a guy who has no fear and he isnt coming at your chest every single time 2825 Syracuse 245 to go in the first half Threepointer is good and Kings knocks it down Its a great sign for Syracuse just to be able to knock down some threepoint shots or some perimeter shots loosen up the defensive a little bit create driving lanes and now theyre going to be able to attack a little bit easier Hes got two of the four threepointers made tonight Syracuse is four of eight Long three by Not quite the shot I think they wanted there And Kings has it on the rebound the other way Not the shot that St Joes wanted but definitely the shot that Syracuse wanted Yeah Starling on the miss Fastm moving first half here Down to two minutes to go in the first frame Sixpoint lead Syracuse Theyve been led by Kings with eight points Also Betsys got eight Threepointer They got altered there The shot from Jaden Wall Rebound Syracuse St Joes is going away from what they did in the beginning And now theyre settling for jump shot jump shots instead of being aggressive attacking the basket And a foul on Case is going to go to the free throw line I think its you know you hit a couple right And then you get your confidence back and you feel like oh okay now now we can shoot these But youre right I would I would kind of continue to try to get inside get those twos They told us that before the game tonight that they dont have to live and die by the threepointer Hasnt been a huge strong suit of theirs so far this year Yeah And you want to be able to shoot the opportunities where you have wide open looks but St Joes have been falling into contested Theyre already hard shots Now it put a hand in your face It gets even harder Dont settle Get downhill and try to get to that basket Womens basketball for you on Sunday afternoon right here on the ACC Network 400 starting at number 22 Louisville at number 12 North Carolina Thats coming your way on Sunday right here on the ACC Network and womens basketball Third foul of the game here tonight for Anthony Finkeley and he is out for St Joes So they got Haskins Jaden Glover Tusano with Duce Jones Derek Simpson and Justice Azaba in the game right now for the Hawks Simpson foul And Mike if you notice how high Syracuse is picking up St Joe is almost at half court and you want to be able to get up in there but you got to stay in front because if not this is what happens Simpson get downhill and draw in the fouls So you got to be able to keep guys in front of you If not youre going to put a lot of pressure on your bigs at the rim Audrey teaching over there on the sidelines for Syracuse as the free throw is good by Simpson And I think Mike a big thing is just having the IQ for the game of basketball knowing like hey this has been working for us so maybe stick with it St Joes attacking the rim early on but keep going Keep going with it Dont settle for jump shots You see Simpson getting downhill to the rim and knocking down two free throws Just over a minute to go in this first half here Syracuse leads it 32 to 27 Tough contested fadeaway that time Doesnt go there by Anthony Well one person touched the the ball the whole possession You know those shots will always end up being hard Traveling violation All right What are you thinking here in the final 58 seconds of this first half Well Syracuse if youre playing in the half court you got to get some flow You got to get some more movement Every time it seems like they get stopped on the initial now they just go into the pick and roll but everybody else just stands and watch You got to get some off ball movement going All right lets see what happens here in this possession 45 seconds to go 17 to shoot Uh not that time And intercepted and stolen by Jaden Glover Disc Smith 13 and 12 second differential shot clock game clock Simpson puts it up and in Its a three again A hard shot on this end from Syracuse You go you drive into the three four players When you do that you got to have the awareness to kick it cheering out Now you come down on the other end Missed assignment Knockdown shot by Simpson cheering First three of the night for Simpson Theyre now three of 15 from threepoint range Starling Yes With 8 seconds to go Hawks have a chance here Jones for three No And thats the end of the half But a tight game here at 3430 Great job by St Joes really setting the tone early St Joes has won four in a row This is their third game in six days Like sometimes that momentum right helps you Yeah I mean you get a break you get your bodies rested you get the injuries healed up whatever it is but at the end of the day when you step out on this floor you got to be ready to compete In St Joes they were ready to compete They dont care if theyre coming in here against Syracuse in the dome Theyre going to come out here and play hard And Syracuse has to be able to match that intensity Heres Simpson who also had a good first half for the Hawks He had nine points six boards an assist couple steals as well Got his hand in the passing lanes Speaking of steals Nathan George now for Syracuse George to the hole for two Nobody picked him up Thats what Nathan George has to do Hes known as a passer but he makes himself an even better passer when hes looking to be a threat scoring the basketball If you have an opportunity to drive the lane drive the lane be aggressive look to score the ball Averages eight and a half a game Hes got six so far here tonight The lead is six and a foul as Jaden Glover Tusano to the free throw line for a pair Thats a great job by Glover Tusano not settling putting his head down getting to the rim Hes known as a threepoint shooter but you see playing off two feet strong absorbing the contact Opportunity for two shots at the line The other thing about this St Joes roster Eric that you look at is they keep their guys They recruit in Philadelphia They build players up a little bit I mean you know all across the country some rosters are completely brand new Like this St Joes team is not And they lost a lot of good players Like we know that Sher Fleming to the NBA playing with the Suns Eric Reynolds is in the GLeague for the Oklahoma City Thunder And then Xavier Brown was probably one of their could have been perhaps their most important player from last year Now hes with Oklahoma averaging over 13 points a game In this new transfer era NIL era its hard to keep guys on right Even if you do like the coach theyre throwing the bag at you Other teams whatever it shows you a lot about coach Donahghue and how much the players love to play for him Hes done a great job of building a culture and he look most of his teams are freshman and sophomore right They have one grad student and then one senior in Simpson He still has a lot of room for these guys to grow and get better as a team Correct And Simpson is a returning player Anthony Fininkley is returning to Seir Haskins Justice Azaba Theres a lot of guys that understand what St Joes basketball is about And then when you can bring in those new guys theyre able to help say Hey heres our culture Heres what were doing We talked to Coach Donahghue about this He said I was going to come in here and start changing a ton of stuff Hes like he was showing us a set that they were running Hes like that thats what they did last year and Im letting them do those things you know And a great thing is the guys who have been here theyre putting that culture on those new guys coming in the system coming in Theyre letting them know what to expect And kudos to coach Donna who for building that culture and keeping it going Nice runner by Starland for two Its 3832 now The Orange Mike Thats what he really excels at Get downhill Use those big shoulders Play through the contact get an opportunity at the foul line Finish at the rim if you can Strong move by Haskins and he wanted the foul as well but gets the bucket and its a fourpoint game You got to give it to St Joes Syracuse scores on one end they come down Theyre aggressive Get a bucket down on the other end Rebound Jones Hawks on the run Counces it inside for Haskins and he scores it again And the Hawks fired up on the sideline Its a twopoint game We talked about one of the keys for Syracuse playing with pace but St Joes is not afraid to get up and down They have the players that do that They have guys who can make plays and make decisions Great job by Deuce Jones dropping it off Haskins with the finish Jones has done that on both ends of the court here tonight I mean hes going to get you up Hes hit those threes in transition and then defensively over to offense Pretty darn special Well think about this Like hes a Jersey guy so he most likely grew up watching Syracuse basketball This Northeast region is really Syracuse basketball and hes excited to come here and play in the dome Yes he is Trenton New Jersey number two in black for the Hawks Deuce Jones from Lasal last year And now driving in is Jaden Glover Tuscano to tie the game Glover Tuscano Im tired of you saying Im just a threepoint shooter Last two possessions playing strong off of two feet finishing at the rim Second leading scoreer on this team has tied things up at 38 A timeout Syracuse 1634 If Syracuse loses this game it would be St Joes signature win of the season Theyre not going to play probably a better team the rest of the season going into conference play Theyre not going to play anybody like Syracuse So if they get this win its a signature win And then for Syracuse itd be one of their worst losses of the year Coming off a big win against Tennessee losing at home against St Jones it wont do you any favors in the net rankings at all Yeah Speaking of the net uh Syracuse at a 73 right now So this would be a a quad one win you know for St Joes on the road And then if youre Syracuse Mike you got to protect home court right cheering I texted him I said What would this do to brackettology right now You know if St Jones was He hasnt got back to me yet Hes looking right at us though before Yeah He He was looking right at us with a little smirk It wasnt a smile It was a smirk Yeah Like Hey what do you guys think about this Huh laughter I love how brackettology starts like November 10th now these days You know what I mean Its like hey theyre 1 and0 theyre a seven seed Like hey lets hang tight here right Exactly Just give me a minute Right Lets figure out how they really play Hes the best Tied up at 40 here Just under 16 minutes to play in this second half Shot clock winding down and falling down And that shot is UP AND IN BY BETSY at the buzzer And sometimes you just got to get lucky but theyre just making it hard on themselves Another possession where theyre shooting with one second on the shot clock and and Betsy like in the first half hes battling him out knocking down his third three Heres Deuce Jones Checked by Betsy coming off the screen over to Haskins trying to back his way in to Seir Haskins No theyre going to call a cheering foul Is led by more than seven Its a threepoint game right now thanks to that Betsy three at the shot clock buzzer and they confirmed it It was a three And now free throws here for Haskins for St Joes What I really like about St Joes is Syracuse is throwing a couple punches for sure Well St Joes coming right back and throwing them back being aggressive getting to the rim and now Haskins is really getting on on the action being aggressive to the rim and knocking down two free throws Feel like this has been a pretty clean you know flowing game here tonight Pistols have done a nice job and back and forth Yeah I mean besides the 17 turnovers combined in the first half you know its its been as clean as you can right But again offensively Syracuse is stagnant They dont have any flow Theyre taking hard shots And St Joes is theyre being the aggressor They started the first half like it and they started the second half like it as well being aggressive to the rim Second half though just one turnover for St Joes and none for Syracuse Rebound pulled in here by Jaden Glover Tusano And St Joes has a chance to go back in front AB is going to be a blocking foul cheering and call that time on Kings You see right there Kings just turned his body He was he was a second late right there He just You just got to be straight up If he wouldnt have turned his shoulder to that left it probably would have been a charger Just missing on the three that time was Jaden Glover Dusano and it stays a onepoint Syracuse lead cheering Syracuse has to play with more pace in the half court Theyre theyre stagnant and theyre slow getting into their sets What a block here by Jenn Tusano And Haskins the other way and hes blocked and fouled and Betsy called for it Well take another look here Pass Look again the aggressor is going to win Thats a foul You put your hand on top of the ball then you got a piece of the arm But again we talked about in the beginning Mike if you set the tone from the start being aggressive youre going to get those calls late in the game Well I think its also on on the body there too I think when the fans you get so fired up Is that all balls Not quite believe in the body too Thats where that call was made Haskins can tie it with a second free throw and substitutions here for the Hawks and for the Orange And all these opportunities for St Joes are coming because of bad offense in the half court from Syracuse Stagnant not playing with any pace in the half court and its always ended up in a tough shot Tied at 43 now Orange not that bad The free throw line here tonight Theyre eight of 11 The Hawks are the ones that have missed six Theyre 12 of 18 and were tied at 43 Three ball that C off the mark and rebounded by the Hawks This is Kafi Meyers a red shirt freshman number three First action of the night and threw it really to nobody but Haskins tracked it down Great defense right there by Kyle Shot clocks at seven 13 and a half to go Meyers corner pass three for the lead Bell for the rebound Picked up by Willford for St Joes cheering You havent really said Willards name a lot this game He needs to be able to make his presence felt Myers nowhere to go Back up top Heres Duce Jones going to shoot Its a long three and way off Rebounded here by Kings Kings the reverse No but a foul But Mike it works both ways Bad shot on one end Usually ends up getting to a good opportunity Nate Kings he he really doesnt He keeps it simple right Cross over put my head down put my shoulder in your chest have an opportunity at the rim He did he did that the whole first half against Tennessee and he ended up having 19 points But why not keep it simple If you can get to your spot be strong on the finish have an opportunity at the line and knock them down right I laughter know I know We We showed the stat Second the last of the nation for Syracuse at the free throw line coming in 57 And Mike my thing is okay we understand Kyle maybe even understand Starling a little bit but a guy who shoots 44 from the threepoint line last season missing two free throws like that it doesnt make sense We got to go up there with confidence to shoot the ball Yeah And on the other side Steve Donahghue said What doesnt make sense is that we didnt get the rebound And now they get a chance for a threepoint play That is a damaging sequence right Instead of having the ball and a chance to go in front they give it back and now Syracuse can go up three Kayenne Anthony he we havent been saying his name too much tonight but he has the ability to get by his defender finish through contact opportunity for a threepoint play Melos son Brooklyn New York Long Island Lutheran the freshman converts a threepoint play really a great start to his career averaging over 11 points a game and he got great pedigree of course so its a threepoint lead and its hard for him because the expectations are so high you cant come in and compare compare him to Carmelo Anthony the guys an NBA Hall of Famer so you got to ease up a little bit I mean hes having a spectacular start to his freshman year yeah cheering great point six for three doesnt go rebound orange and its in front the Kings And now Anthony saw a little bit of a gap and goes back at the Kings for three cheering applause Three Timeout St Joes St Nate Kings I can shoot the ball AS WELL KNOCK IT DOWN KINGS might be going back to that sequence where we were tied at 43 and then Syracuse had missed two free throws but they got the offensive rebound a basket and a foul Then after a St Joes miss a three theyre up six What happens here Good offensive boards cheering Look at that 510 red shirt freshman sticks it back up and in Theres no way Meyers should have got in there 510 when you got 610 69 65 sitting right there and then he comes and gets the steal Good minutes here for Myers in the second and hes fouled on the offering there from Simpson his third person I tell you what Mike I do not want to get in the way of big fella number 22 Hes going to put a couple bruises on your chest And but how about Meyers coming in and this is how you win games If youre St Joes on the road versus high quality opponents you need everybody to come in and and make an impact collectively Absolutely I mean he didnt even play in the first half and all of a sudden now its second half here with Kafi Meyers out of Roman Catholic in Philadelphia making the most of his opportunity Hes averaging about 12 minutes a game Hes played in every game this season Plays like that for Meyers Thats how you gain more trust with the coach And now your minutes go from 12 to 15 15 to 18 When your opportunity comes you got to take advantage of it Thats a foul George got hit from behind You see some of the games coming up this weekend How about Louisville How good is Louisville this season So I did a few games I did a few Louisville games last year One at Louisville one here at Syracuse Okay I love Pat Kelsey I I he is the best coach in college basketball to me that and just for for my opinion I watched the practice and from the managers to the coaches to the players on the hop bang bang bang bang bang I mean he has his guys buying into everything that he is selling high energy guy one of the best coaches in America hands down thats good to hear and see what kind of year they can have I mean theyre a championship contender absolutely ranked 11 right now y got Memphis coming up twopoint game Runner is good for George And again this is what Nate George has to do If you cant get by use your size advantage against Meyers Finish over top Syracuse shooting 45 from the field 42 for St Joes in this game Heres Jones trying to take contact rejected inside by Betsy and right back to the Hawks and its up on top Jaden Glover the sky and he bangs a three and again St Joes they just continue to play They keep fighting They keep fighting Great ball movement making the extra pass and we know Glover Essano can knock down that Just had seven against Copen State in the last game Thats their first three of the second half Theyre one for five from threepoint range Four of 21 for the game and a foul on Meyers up top Thats his second fifth team foul for St Joe Syracuse has already committed seven here in the second half So the Hawks in the bonus for the rest of the game here with half of this second half still to go And theyre going to get opportunities at the free throw line just from being aggressive Again they set the tone from the beginning Were going to play aggressive This is how the referees are going to call the game Yeah And thats not what you want to do if youre Syracuse putting one of the best free throw shooting teams in the nation on the line for potential you know end of game scenario here which it seems like were headed towards as nip and tuck as this ones been all game Thats it And that right there thats a tough foul right there by Jones Did a good job of standing them Its going to be a tough shot You got to live with it if he makes it Yeah But you got to got your hands in the cookie jar You want that one back if youre Jones First foul on Jones Betsy to the free throw line Hes 0 for one tonight Nine of 14 is the team I dont get it I I I I dont get go up there You know what it is It goes off everyone feels it now You know one person started missing Now it goes to the next to the next Go up there and be confident knock it down It it its just its weird to me when you can shoot the threepoint shot so well but then youre a subpar free throw shooter Its all confidence and mental when you step up to that line I know Coach Autry is going to have to get his group really working on it throughout the year so they dont end up losing games at the free throw line Heres Jayen Gulbert way off of the jumper Twopoint lead though still here for Syracuse Anthony George again Look at that in the last three possessions Two of them by Nate George Just getting downhill getting to the rim Keep it simple If its there take it Hes got 10 points now third orange player in double figures in scoring tonight Heres Jones Stop and pop Front rimmed it And Jaden Dcato couldnt finish applause Or Austin Willford excuse me Anthony rebound Lets get some more movement on the offensive side of the ball and get better opportunities Ive been saying the whole game for Syracuse You cant play that iso ball the whole game Nice speed inside a from Duce Jones for two and its a twopoint game Mike weve been talking about Duce Jones being a scorer and we know he can score the basketball but how about his playmaking ability Numerous plays in this game hes been able to find his teammates for finishes at the rim to your point hes got five assists here tonight Coming up on eight minutes to go and the runner scoots in there by Kings And a lot of times in this era guys are talking about oh I got this bag I got that bag How about you put your head down and get downhill like Nate Kings does and get to the rim and get to the spot and finish Great job by Nate Kings just being And thats going to be a moving screen on Azaba And thats his third personal foul that takes us down to the 801 mark of this second half as three subs come in for Syracuse here I I mean I dont know Did he put his shoulder into it a little bit Is it a little home cooking I dont know what its a tough call Again Mike we went and talked to the refs They dont see what we see right So th those are called though Theres theres a lot of those called you know throughout college basketball Youre seeing moving screens Got to be 100 set 100 You got to be solid And then the effort to kind of get there on time Thats kind of what happens you know when you push it way into the defender Another nice runner here for the Orange and JJ Stling So weve seen everybody do it here George Kings Starling getting to the rack and great job by sir Thats what he he his strength is getting downhill to the rim But if youre St Joes you got to know the scoundreport Im not rushing out on that threepoint shot at JJ Sarland Im making him shoot it and contest it And a steal Stland feeds it inside for William Kyle got Aaron in the air and the hoop doesnt go and Azima gets the rebound Simpson Good board there by Sadique White A timeout coming to the next whistle 645 to go in the game Sixpoint lead for the Orange Each team with two timeouts remaining here Anthony No Jones on a try Wow Deuce Jones How many times have we said it Hard shot on one end leads to transition on the other Unbelievable finish by Duce Jones Just being aggressive getting to the basket Jones has 16 points and that leads all scorers in this game here tonight Stland big time offensive board there by Kyle fouled cheering and almost had it and hell shoot when we return Syracuse 58 St Joes 54 how that changes things And when they decide to bring him back in as at the foul line is William Kyle for Syracuse and hes been money at the line tonight Hes yet to miss Hes five for five as the broadcaster jinx continues and its 59 to 54 Well I tell you what William Kyle is five for six All the shooting coaches throw all of it away Yeah laughter right You see Qs come out in a little two3 zone to signature Yes Three ball for the Hawks Thats off that time And the offensive rebound in front of Dano Then it was Simpson Then inside Dano puts it back up and in Well Mike if youre going to play zone the one thing you have to be able to do out of it is rebound the basketball Right Im low Im low Instead they gave up multiple offensive rebound opportunities and the Hawks convert it Back to Kyle inside Sneaks his way through Basket and a foul and the call is on Solano Picks up the ticket and the Orange up five and a chance to make it six And you know what I love about William Kyle Hes not a guy who youre going to throw it down low every single possession and tell him to go ahead But when he gets the ball hes efficient He has good footwork and he continues to play through the contact All right So let me ask you this Solano whos in as the red shirt freshman 7 foot out of the Bronx and he didnt play in the first half Now hes in an late game crucial situation because of the foul to Azawa And then you also had Meyers who really didnt play at all in the first half either Hes in a second half crucial time situation here You wonder what thats like for some of these Hawks players Well when youre playing college basketball you want to get an opportunity to play So when you get the chance you got to be able to take advantage of it step back and the miss and J Sky on He almost had his rebound Hes out of bounds He he wants it reviewed but thats not going to happen Remember the thing today in college basketball that changed from last year The coach has to ask for any review of a ball of a ball going out of bounds on theres no more reviews for out of bounds calls like that you have to challenge it My advice is before the season for every head coach call your head official and know the rules ahead of time So when you get in late game situations you know how to use those challenges You have to have a timeout too as well to be able to challenge St Joes has two Syracuse has two Four and a half to go Foul Count the basket with Betsy cheering And Bessies the guy who could do it inside out I mean he is a big frame Hes 68 He has broad shoulders You see him put it right into his chest And he just created that separation with the contact Great job keeping you balanced Opportunity for a threepoint play A twopoint play laughter Well give Betsy a lot of credit though He he has made some really timely plays here tonight for Syracuse Hes got 14 That was a big one Theyre up seven And really Mike what its going to come down to if Syracuse wins this basketball game is they have more individual talent on their team right They have guys you can give the ball to and they can go ahead and make a play Ashabah was back cheering in as coach Donghue didnt want to let him sit any longer but he couldnt make the shot inside And now Syracuse back with him A chance to extend on their largest lead of the game which is seven Betsy blocked by Azab and it goes out and weve got a timeout Hes playing with four fouls Hawks down seven 345 to play from Syracuse Mike Cory alongside Syracuse alltime great and pro Eric Demandorf here tonight from the JMA Wireless Dome Little snow here today and a late start I know its not quite the same major crowd here on hand but good environment and always fun here at Syracuse nonetheless Well Syracuse knew you were coming Mike so they wanted to show off a little bit and show you what the weather is like up here so we brought it Oh wow And William Kyle hitting the deck hard and rocking the rim there on that one Look at this And Aabah has just found jumps I mean he just jumped over 611 guys back and almost dunked it in his face and then hes six for seven from the free throw line right laughter With that uh with that release It you know what it been a lot of funky jump shots in in basketball history I mean Reggie Miller one of the alltime greatest threepoint shooters shot from across his body and and brought it back Youre right Thats a Thats a good point Its when youre works I guess right Yeah Well its a confidence thing If youre confident in going up and shooting the basketball more likely than not youre going to make it Theres a foul as Jaden Gano to the free throw line for St Joes This is the largest lead of the game for the Orange at eight I mean St Joes theyre fighting Theyre continuing to get in the paint When you can get paint touches opportunities arise Glover Dano doing a great job just being aggressive around the rim Another opportunity at the foul line Thats four on Betsy right there As you see cheering and for St Joes to try to inch their way back in they want to be aggressive getting to the rim slow the pace down a little bit and get opportunities at the foul line We talked about them being the number one shooting free throw team in division one at 81 If they get there more likely than not theyre going to make it Kings back up to George Syracuse in no hurry here but the lead is only six Still over three minutes to play in the game See St Joes going into a little zone themselves trying to protect the paint and make Syracuse into a jump shooting team And Betsy Ive known Ive known the zone long enough Short corner free throw line Great job by Betsy getting to that free throw line area and just making a play Haskins for St Joes and a runner Its no good there by Jaden called Tuscano And here comes George Hands it off KYLE scores it Thats what Nate George does Pushing the pace I I was going to say slow it down a little bit You dont need that But you know good decision getting it to your big guy whos one of the most athletic guys in the country Finishing at the rim Well foul here on Kyle Its going to send St Joes to the line Thats the thing St Joes was in the bonus with like 10 minutes to play in the second half So if youre Syracuse the last thing you have to do right now is foul because you got like you said the best free throw shooting team in the country going to the free throw line with the clock stopped And thats just being smart right Youre not going to foul a guy 28 ft from the basket If you if youre going to foul a guy make it worth it rebound pulled in by Kings and check and see if Kyles okay Was he a little slow to get up there Jaden Smith was in He heads back out to the bench for St Joes Betsy has tied his season high in points at 16 for the Orange The lead is 10 Mike all Syracuse has to do is take care of the ball and dare I say make free throws or dont foul Yeah exactly One or two or both if they could Starland Nope Rebound by Jaden Glover Tuscano Opportunity here Simpson for St Jones in a hurry to the hole No save from going out but D Jones has it for the Hawks and hes fouled Kings picked up his fourth personal foul Jones is at the line here for St Joes And well have another We talked about it earlier with Duke and North Carolina Duke hosting Lipgum 600 on Tuesday followed up by the Tar Hills and East Tennessee Thats at 800 Two outstanding teams of the country ACC this year Eric Right How much better is the league in 2025 26 Well we talk about Duke Louisville and North Carolina but and then you got the Syracuses you got the uh Clemsons the Notre Dames Wake Forest The ACC is so much better than it was last year Not as good as I guess historically but much much better I wouldnt forget about NC State as well NC State Yeah absolutely Will Wade over there doing a great job Yep Orange tried to run this one out here tonight coming off that Tennessee win 62 to 60 11 days ago Jones with the foul his second and Mike Syracuse if he knocks down these two free throws theyll be up 11 But its been a much much closer game and its a this will be a hard fought win for Syracuse But you you got to give credit to St Joes Theyve been battling from start to finish but again good teams they find out ways to win Syracuse They havent played the most efficient game offensively but individual guys have stepped up and made plays Were doing all that we can here with this team at the free throw line Uh a lot of credit to our statistician Christian de Guzman doing a great job with us here tonight Like Syracuse team high uh at a game this year for free throws made is 13 Well theyre at 12 right now as Starling just missed Its like what do they have to do There it is There we go free throws made of 24 tonight at a timeout Well be back Minute 24 to go Back helping us out tonight Thanks everyone as we have 1 minute 24 seconds to go 10point lead Syracuse And heres Simpson now for the Hawks Corner three is blocked Out of bounds Stays at St Joes Minute 16 to play Lets see if Syracuse stays in that zone on the out of bounds And Mike we were talking about a little bit We had lunch this afternoon how lucky we are and blessed we are to be able to just call these games right We get the best seat in the house and we get to talk ball Pretty lucky guys 100 I uh I totally agree with you And you know when we get into it game after game theres so much talk right Transfers NIL all that stuff Well it comes down to you just want to play basketball right And it it has been a fun one here tonight as Jones misses on the three offensive rebound Jaden Bulmer Tuscado back out to Fakeley Thats good as he knocks down a three and St Joes calls a timeout And you know game this team in the Im not saying the St Joes here Im just saying you know you ask that question Do you want to see this team in the NCA tournament And a lot of times you say yes and they dont get in You know its like come on Well these are the type of teams come tournament time that get big time upsets right Theres the foul Yeah And if youre Syracuse right now you you come off you know three losses in a row previously to Houston Kansas and Iowa State Really no shame in that Obviously got blown out by Iowa State but theyre a great team And then they beat Tennessee Thats a huge win right there More than likely going to come away with a win here tonight you would think Well see what happens here 55 seconds to go But they were challenged in the nonconference Its going to be a good conference slate you would think in the ACC Heres what theyve got coming up We talked about Saturday Well be here for that one with Hofra Honestly they got a favor They got a favorable schedule right there I if you look at the next nine 10 games they can win all of them right And theyll put themselves in good position you know come conference play But Syracuse has really been hanging their hat on the defensive side of the ball They have been there the whole year minus the Iowa State game Theyve been competing at a high level Again Ive been saying it every single game They just have to find more on the offensive side of the ball Wow How about the ups here by Jones as hes fouled trying to throw it down And thats going to be it for Kings Hes fouled out 14 points tonight five of eight from the field had five assists And Mike hes a guy thats just gotten better and better every game Yeah defensively he has always been there Early on his shot wasnt falling but then he decided hey Im going to put my head down and drive to the basket be aggressive get opportunities at the rim Doing that being aggressive has opened up his threepoint shot and made three here tonight for St Joes Lets continue on kind of a final assessment of Syracuse Uh we know about the free throw shooting is going to improve What else you want to see uh from the Orange moving forward Well defensively I think theyve been great You know they just want to continue to compete at a high level Theyll be one of the more athletic versatile teams in ACC conference play Offensively they just have to find some more flow in the half court They want to play with pace and get out into transition but good teams arent going to allow them to do that So in the half court you have to be able to execute your sets and get easier opportunities right now theyre making tough shots You cant sustain like that through a whole season Now what about on the other side for St Joes Valiant effort here tonight Yeah I mean I think for St Joes they just got to compete at a high level If you can compete against these teams right here high level Syracuse teams you know North Carolina those type of teams come conference play you should be in every single game They got the individual talent they got the coach Now you just want to be able to put it put it together and improve game by game Heres Betsy Offensive rebound by William Kyle Another foul Anthony this is my favorite time right now And they missed their fair share of free throws too for being the top team in the country They were 18 and 27 at the free throw line That is not like them at all from what weve seen through the first nine games Well coming into this game versus Syracuse theyre only a 28 threepoint shooting team They wont be the number one free throw shooting team in the country anymore after this game They were 81 thatll go down to you know probably 80 or 79 But any team when youre not able to make perimeter shots the defense is just going to box and elbow you right And its going to be hard Theres going to be no driving lane and every shot is going to be a hard shot You know who played the best was Virginia and Tony Bennett Oh yeah They force you to shoot and make perimeter shots And if you didnt you werent going to win the game Block shot inside Syracuse has it Betsy and hes out of bounds on the sideline Yeah Talk about a team that you know for the year of that loss to UNMBC and then to come back the following year and win the national championship it doesnt get any worse and it doesnt get any better I mean that was those are some Youre right about Bennett though They they had a good team and it was Virginia probably wasnt your favorite team to watch play basketball You know they were going to muck it up and it was a 50 to 52 type game right But they got it done They got it done and and Tony Bennett one of the greatest coaches in college basketball got him a national championship playing that way cheering Thats all for this one here tonight Syracuse will get it done They win it 7163 over St Joes to improve to six and three on the season
