And its the same story for Steve Forbes coming off wins over Georgia Tech in Atlanta and Stanford here at the Joel on Saturday RJ Godfrey gets it inside on the first possession of every Clemson game And more often than not he scores Thats where he goes I mean hes really good in the low post Doesnt matter how big the guy is playing he can score Sebastian Akins back in the starting lineup after playing just nine minutes against the Cardinal A game that Wake led for only two minutes and 40 seconds but they led at the right time Trayvon Spillers ties it up Spillers is a guy gets that left hand and when he can get to that close to the basket he can make it through but hes much better closer to the goal particularly when he can get to that left hand Hunter and Wallen and Porter have all been struggling offensively lately for the Tigers W over Harris gets on the board And he heard you He wanted to get that one up Well the last two games he was only two for eight while Hunter has only been one for nine and the Porters three for 16 And in a related story theyre 0 and2 in their last two Well their bench has been really good scoring the ball but and I think they will be tonight Now Spillers is two for two I see now Spillers I think has a strength advantage against Wallin inside Hes stronger Hes more athletic And theyre they might have to bring some help The Tigers said it forest Coach D Forbes said to his team on Monday to go against Clemson you need to eat your wedies and take your Flintstone vitamins cuz he thinks this game is going to come down to interior toughness His team didnt know what that was Flintstone vitamins No clue Did you take Flintstone vitamins as a kid 100 Didnt help cheering but they were tasty Yeah thats why you take them First miss of the game courtesy of Dylan Hunter Aens in the lane off one foot cheering for two Zeke have started three for three against one of the best defensive teams in the ACC Godfrey a late whistle and the foul is on Schwagger You know thats the call that I dont think its good He waited and when he missed he blew his whistle I think its its either call it or dont Dont you dont wait and see if he missed He got hit in the head Thats a good call Veteran fish Experienced crew Lee Cassell Tony Padilla and Maris Pedigrew Tony Padilla came over before the game said he never called a game and he hes refed 25 years I said Well youre the only official that I havent seen so I guess I I guess I have no bad memories of you Ill be nice cheering screaming cheering Godfrey goes one of two Tigers L Cameron on Saturday but Brad Brenell thought his team played pretty well defensively holding the Blue Devils to 67 Well when they struggle they unlike that game last week against Virginia Tech they normally dont struggle on the defensive end They just have a hard time scoring Last Wednesday night the Hokes were on fire at Little John Duke Harriss first shot of the night wont go but its tipped up and in by Spillers He hes off to a start tonight Well hes a guy I think that when the season started the Deaks were expecting a little more from him Welling stays with it and hell get back to the line for the Tigers Spillers has given him more tonight And Welling is the guy whos been the starter whos been able to put points on the board the last couple games and their bench is really productive offensively when they bring those guys in They bring them in to score defense suffers a little bit but their offense gets a lot better Brad Brownell the longest tenure active coach in the ACC Hes had success against the Demon Deacons He is 16 and4 at the helm of the Tigers against Wake Forest And he and his staff have done a simply outstanding job putting this team together And then you got to put a team together every year in this current era very very smart coach who was always on on the bubble to get fired for about eight years They finally taken that off Weer got away with a little push off and lays it in awkwardly with a left hand Well he a lot more was expected of him He struggled a little bit coming up and watching him at practice and they had a full out practice today Everybody going full speed A beautiful pass and a foul inside Welling will get back to the line and thats I believe the second foul on Spillers They called it on Schwagger Its number two on Cooper Well Schwigger is a guy who had a really great year at Valpo last year Thats I mean its like hes playing horse with that shot Im not sure that thats normally in his playbook You never know when you step up the different level of competition how some guys really step up and agree some its just not the same Its just hard But he was a tremendous rebounder in the Missouri Valley and he was their lead he was the leading shot blocker in that league and he simply and I mean he had a really good Missouri Valley tournament last year but he just hasnt put up those kind of numbers this year for the deeps And Steve Forbes and Wake Forest fans were hoping he would be Jake Laravia and he has not been Well thats a high bar Hes starting for the Lakers right now Yeah When nobody when Jake Loravia came here nobody expected him to do what he did He just Hes one of those guys he stepped up and he had an outstanding season One thing about Larabia he was always the first one in the gym We would show up a couple hours early He would be the one guy in the gym getting enough shots Miles Coven kicks it Sebastian Akens D3 wont go but its a face guarding blockout I believe on Carter Welling So Wake Forest will retain possession Welling picks up his first We are off and running on a Wednesday night in Winston Salem Picked up in second Well you know they theyre going to go inside as much as they can Clemson They dont shoot a lot of threes Theyre going to try to score inside Thats their game Nick Davidson Ace Buckner into the game for the Tigers off the bench A very productive bench for Brad Brownell Coleman hangs in the air and goes glass Thats where he is most effective He is big and strong and he can drive the ball to the basket Hes only shooting 30 from three in conference play So hes got to get to the goal Super athletic transfer from Purdue Pass hits Fillers in the chest and hes tied up by Davidson and the arrow belongs to the Digs This were talking about with Coleman He just takes the ball right to the basket Thats not bad defense right there Thats just a guy whos really a good offensive player Wall moved his feet made the tough shot A tough shot Akens Spillers Beloo Coleman Juke Harris who hadnt scored yet is Wakes leading scoreer in the number three score in the ACC coming into tonight 213 points per game Spillers turned away and throws it away They never got inside the threepoint line Good job by Porter coming up with the theft and keeping it in bounds Partner in the lane No good And its been about four and a half minutes since Clemsons made a field goal Holden on the drive Lays it off and Belaloo lays it in Theyre getting to the basket Thats very unusual against Clemson Yeah if you cant stop the group of penetration its hard to play good defense Another foul against Wake Forest inside Godfrey took a shot to the chops from Omaha Belaloo This Theres three guys around Kovven and Belaloo just is in the right spot and steps to the goal Its a really good pass Sometimes guys force that shot He makes good really good assist RJ Godfrey back to the line Hes their leading scorer at 116 points per game But in screaming conference play hes not a particularly good free throw shooter Hes under 60 Johnson in for Clemson Isaac Carr and Marcus Marion into the game for Steve Forbes Isaac Carr coming off a 31 minute outing against Stanford on Saturday The most minutes hes played in the game this season Freshman from Portland Oregon One of two again for Godfrey Its Stanford Carr was just very solid with the basketball didnt do anything spectacular but didnt make any mistakes either Marcus Marian has only scored two points in Wake Forests last 13 games played five of them Harris in the lane creates some contact loses the ball Godfrey outlets to Porter the other way That was well defended Porter step back to strong save by Harris on the baseline Porter is now 1 for 11 in his last three games from three Wonder if hes thinking about You know he is like to get her you know they like to get him Hes just struggling right now Carr to Cvin clock winding down Miles Cvin for three cheering And thats a huge basket I just said hes not shooting very well from three in conference play but he looked good on that stroke Hes had some great games throughout the season offensively Hes very streaky especially if he makes his first He had a game this year he started 11 for 11 Thats a good start Thats kind of what Dan Bonner did I think in Virginia Absolutely 50 years Well not for Well 11 maybe for 11 years but never 11 for 11 Ray Corus by nine Deacons with a twoame winning streak entering the ninth And well the shooting wos continue for Justin Porter That was not close Knocked out of bounds by Budda Johnson And Wake Forest has that lane wide open Theyre real and theyre not setting a lot of screens out on the perimeter Theyre looking to beat their guy off the dribble and get to the goal What are you all snorts seeing from Clemson defensively so far tonight You know theyve let a little bit get inside you know theyd have trouble with that but its their its their offense thats struggling and and usually thats what it is within Their defense is pretty solid Even though they play a lot of guys it stays pretty solid Kai Mason talked about him in the open 27 points in Wakes last two ball games Omaha Belaloo finger roll for two And Wake looks like a team thats won two in a row And Clemson looks like a team thats lost two in a row right now And again the Tigers are the team that have 20 wins And Wakes just a game over 500 for the season But were here now today Thats where this games being played I think Wakes going to They look better in practice today They look more alive A good defense Marion in the passing lane Mason chased by Purple Jersey Tigers Kicks it for Carr Back to Mason Got it cheering cheering Its early to be worried but I think Clemson better be a little worried cheering Wondered whether Brad Brownell would take a timeout He just put out his hand and said Calm down And Justin Porter gets a little closer and scores Tough shot that they needed Sometimes you got to let the guys take care of things themselves First Clemson field goal since the 1858 mark Bad pass Ha saves it from being a back court Marion in the lane and its a foul on Welling applause Late call Probably the right call The second foul on Welling Miles Co But right now theyre making shots and Thumpsons not Game is a lot easier when the ball goes in the basket and its not going in the basket for the Tigers at the moment Deacons 10 of 13 77 from the floor so far And theyve saved two turnovers that could have been backcourt violations with athletic plays First from Harris this time from Carr Isaac Carr They wave off travel Its a travel on the digs Right foul Well he felt like he had an opening but thats really a nice job by Buckner to get back there and get in his way Force that travel Porter feeds Welling who missed the layup Rebound deflected for Marian Midway through this first half Forest is doing a great job moving without the ball And look at the how spread out the court is Theyre doing all this without Harris which is not the way they usually play Hes 0 for two Has not scored Duke into the lane Gets on the board He heard me Has now Theyre just getting whatever they want Yeah pretty much Harris mentioned number three in the ACC Hes number 12th in the nation in scoring tonight Johnson outside for Welling Wrapound pass Godfrey Triple team comes Godfrey loses it cheering and applause Thats the first time theyve gone down there and helped out against him and he wasnt ready for it Wake has made its last four attempts at this end Carr playing with so much more confidence than he had earlier in the year Harris with backto back buckets The ball moves from side to side and when one of the dicks catches it they start a drive they force the defense to react and then they start passing it Wake up to 80 12 for 15 butter Johnson That is a monster shot Clemson youre never out of it early but they were getting close to being out of it early Oh now you got to get some stops Is feeling it and he got hot He got his first look a good look and now hes ready to go applause The defender was right there and it didnt make any difference So you know it doesnt matter what your record is or how youve won all year When youve lost two in a row and you go on to the road its never easy to get that thing turned around It takes a little luck and a and you got to score Clemson is now scoring Mason fouls Johnson on the drive First on Mai What would you like to see from Clemson offensively Well I mean part of it Wake Forest defense you know is good tonight Theyre doing a good job They havent been good defensively but they are good tonight And you know Clemson has struggled to score in the last couple games They have not been able to get good shots and they havent made them when theyve got it Buckners hitting the guy that can get a bucket on call and he gets one there I know that ball was slipping out of his hand but he controlled it We fouled inside We get ourselves a timeout with 742 to go last seven Yeah they get a big lead without him at all which has not happened all year long And then now he comes in and hits a couple you know one really tough shot and now everybodys scoring for Wake Forest and nobody for Clemson Harris has missed two shots The rest of his teammates have missed one If you were coaching Clemson would you be telling them Wake cant maintain this pace Well you you No youre telling them Hey we need to stop them Theyre going to theyre scoring We need to play better defense By the way a bookkeeping note I said earlier that Welling had two fouls They gave two fouls to number two on Clemson Dylan Huntner not number 22 So Welling has no fouls Hunter on the bench with two And thats Wallen inside Thats where they want to go They want to go inside but that was a very tough shot Now this is what youre talking about Jim Clemson needs to go TO STOP screaming AND THEYRE PLAYING ZONE YEAH thats unusual This is where Beheim shines as an analyst folks Well its very unusual for Brad play zone defense Brad Brown is one of those guys who thinks you only play zone when you cant guard them manto man and that seems to be the case tonight Well he got an air ball out of the first possession so thats not a bad strategy Brockner nice hesitation dish Blocked at the rim by Spillers but a Johnson stays with it inside and scores Forest 0 for two since Brownell went zone Well they didnt get a chance to set up their zone The zone never got into play there Big shot from Mason And the Tigers finding their rhythms Ace Buckner right in front of Steve Forbes knocks down the three Will take the timeout about 90 minutes from now Second straight Wednesday night with a 900 pm tip off at McCamish Of course last Wednesday night it was Wake Forest getting the win in Atlanta They played really well that night That was kind of the breakout game for Mai Mason Cleopes back to the manto man Little surprising You know you got two stops You might think you stay in it a little bit longer but clock winding down Coven creates something for himself Down the three Thats cheering when you play you dont get anything and then you make a three like that Thats pretty pretty for fortunate for Wake Forest Too strong for Buckner Wallen tracks down the rebound in the corner Davidson fouled on the way to the hoop You know these fouls are beginning to pile up a little bit for the Deaks Clemsons trying to attack inside Number two on Blue Well Belu now has two Swagger has two Become the nine and 10 free throws of the half for the Tigers Whoa That was 90 the iron unkind as our old friend Tim Rando would have said about so theyre ninth and 10 free throws and theyre four for nine at the moment and when youre struggling offensively and youre getting to the free throw line that often you have to convert Boston College the Eagles made 11 threes last night in Tallahassee but went three of 13 from the free throw line in a close loss What a fun Tuesday night of hoops it was though Wild atmosphere in Raleigh The Wolfpack getting the win Miami Another close victory and another heartbreaker for the Hokes And SMU is on fire at home against Louisville Big win for Andy Enfield and the Mustangs Davidson short Godfrey the rebound Bel didnt want to pick up his third cheering and Harris instead picked up his first looked like everybody was kind of battling there like just an out of bounds play Well Wake Forest is not a great rebounding team but Clemson is not a great offensive rebounding team And this is a situation where Spillers comes over and helps out and they get enough out of Harris So just a lot of slapping around in there Yeah Nothing clear cut Just kind of Well something happened in there Were going to Were going to blow the whistle here I thought you said they were going to be nice I am I mean they can miss one or two Davidson the Nevada transfer makes a pair this time Five minutes to play in the opening half sets another screen Harris goes to work on Davidson and pass deflected out of bounds by Buckner Nine to shoot for Wake Forest Thats a situation where Davidson and Wallen can switch out there on that screen and theyre both quick enough that they can stay in front of Harris with some help which they got If you can switch its the best defense Clock winding down again Akens tough two It goes Waking everything in this first half And theyre talking tough baskets not cheering easy baskets Brad Brownell just over there shaking his head when that ball went in the basket but they play much better defense Yeah What else can you do No good for Davidson Coven the rebound applause and cheering gets it to Aens Holden from the corner Wow On fire He hit that first one at him and you said when he does he can really get going Hes rolling now Weight fans have seen this before from Miles cheering Coleman Time out have been and are capable of and I expect that to change a little bit and they better start pretty soon Of course Miles hit the buzzer beater to beat Memphis on the uh Bryce MZO play again Clemson is not a very good offensive rebounding team so they got to make some shots Baldin also had a threequarters court buzzer beater earlier in the season that really helped the Knicks pull away in a nonconference game that they didnt play very well in in the first half Akens bumped on the ground Wake Forest has just been very good patient move the ball get good shots Theyve made and when they havent theyve made them When theyve gotten a tough shot theyve made them tonight And you know thats just the way some games go Usually it levels out by halftime second half but you want to get as many points on the board and get the lead up as much as you can when things are going your way And thats what Wake Forest is doing Foul was caught on butter Johnson His first Harris too strong this time and a good block out by Davidson Carless pass The Tigers are fortunate to keep it Wake just got back and got in there and really helped and that pass was not there You know Wake Forest in ACC play they give up 52 53 twopoint field goal screaming percentage and its theyre not doing that tonight Corner jumper short from Wall Ambitious pass What a catch by Spillers cheering Just a great play a great pass and probably a harder catch cheering and even a harder finish This is just a situation where Spillers outr runs Clemson down the court and really a hard I mean this is really a great catch and finish Boy Spillers is you know we just showed you Coleman was four for four Spillers is now fourth and four He hadnt missed any shots either Alon Walls makes it a 17point cheering Wake Forest lead applause This has been close to a perfect half for cheering Wake Forest Hunsons only turned it over three times They just cant make shots Coven again He can make shots Covens five for five cheering Wall answers I dont know how many people thought Wake would be up 20 in the first half here tonight folks No one Akins kicks for Marian Under two minutes to play in the half Shot clock at five Harris with two cheering Harris gets it off I expected that to go in with the way things have been going for Way Forest Heres the Thursday night womens basketball double header right here on ACC Network in the ESPN app 22nd ranked Tarheelss taking on Virginia Tech at the Castle at 6 Eastern Then Miami hosting Stamford in Coral Gables at 8 Eastern Thats tomorrow night on the ACC Network and ESPN Clemson really has to close this out with a couple buckets and a couple stops Theres one Thats a beautiful pass from Butter Johnson setting up Wallin And theyve got to get the ball inside Theyve got to create easier opportunities on the interior They cant rely on threepoint shots Wine only six points in Clemsons last two games but hes got nine here in the first half Johnson takes a spill Harris gets open Jukes just three for nine from the floor Rest of his team is 15 for 17 applause Frustration growing for Brad Brownell Well cheering he was thinking about challenging that one but he checked with his guys behind the bench and they looked at their iPad over there and decided that that was the correct call So no challenge I thought he was going to challenge it Well he wanted to know He started yelling at Lee Cazell And Lee Gazelle said Well you know you challenge if you want to And he decided not to The reaching foul Its the sixth team foul against the Tigers Number one on Porter And Wake Forest continues to do a good job getting by the initial defense out on the perimeter That time they drew a foul Theyve only had to take a couple tough shots in this first half Theyre getting the shots that they need to get And when they had a couple tough shots they made them just delivered a stern message to Steve Forbes Ah okay Okay Apparently the Clemson iPads are not working So hes telling Wake Forest to turn theirs off And so thats thats why they didnt challenge because they couldnt tell whether they should or not Just nothings going right for Clemson tonight Aens the rebound They call him for a push off cheering I dont know about that but hes got to be careful You dont want to get a technical foul in this situation Itll be one and one for the Clemson Tigers at the other end You be the judge A hand on his back a little bit maybe Well in his defense Johnson did go flying in the one direction One and one for But a 83 free throw shooter fans sitting courtside do not like the calls This is the day and age were in basketball How many times did the referee ever come over to you and say you had to turn your iPad off You know youre kidding We didnt even have iPads Youre lucky we had kind of paper about a five and a half second difference between the game and shot clock Just wants to get a stop and a bucket in their back reasonable position Tigers have scored the last seven points and this is an offensive foul against Wake Forest Marian raising his hand trying to claim it and he does And he does He was worried they were going to call it on Spillers Thats being a good teammate right there It would have been the second for Spillers They called it on 25 11 seconds for Clemson They trailed by as many as 20 Got a chance to cut it to 10 Porter comes up short and that ends the first half That would have been a big bucket right there defac for five Trayvon four for four The Deakons 18 for 27 as a team And I think for Clemson Godfrey has to take more than two shots in a half Theyve consistently gone to him early and then kind of forgotten about him Well hes also got to work a little harder to get open Second foul on Spillers 9 seconds into the half Buddy Johnson starts the second half for Clemson Carter Welling his first field goal and he drove that all the way from the top of the key and no help by the Deeps It was a 20point game Now its an 11point game Clemsons calling card has been its defense Coven comes up short His first miss Well thats the kind of shot he made in the first half obviously because he made all his shots in the first half Wine has been the hottest Tiger tonight Hes now five for six in the double figures with 11 Again Wake Forest not noted for their defense Jim Just what Clemson had to do come out and score a couple buckets and theyre back in the game Akins gives it up Schwagger will take it Another stop for the Tigers defense Bucket here and you might get the quick Steve Forbes timeout Welling sealing off Spillers inside Welling lost it out of bounds and saves it to Coven That was good defense that time by Spillers and he had a lot of help Things have gone pretty well for Wake Forest when theyve doubled or even tripled down on the Tigers bigs Thats a moving screen on Clemson and thats so we havent played two minutes yet Hes picked up two fouls Hes got three now Number three on Trayvon Well thats a great job by Welling there right at the end of that play to screen off the defensive help Cant extend your arm and push the guy Thats a blow It was a good football block Yes absolutely Blue in for Spillers Very different complexion to this game now compared to about 3 4 minutes ago in the first half Welling brings the Tigers within seven Thats a great cut by Welling A good catch but a really good pass by God And Wake Forest really needs to get a great shot and a bucket Really this is where they really miss Nate Calmise to run the show Calmise got the boot off his ankle this past Monday C4s expect itll still be another 10 days two weeks or so before they get him back to action applause Reaching foul going against the Tigers Thats a good job by Bel recognizing he had Johnson on him and hes trying to pull his way to the basket Clemsons gone from down 20 to down seven and thats what they had to do So a 130 run from the end of the first half into this half Harris from the corner All of a sudden the Deaks cant buy a bucket Wake 0 for three from the floor to start the second half but offensive rebound and another foul against the Tigers The first on Welling Hey we got him I think Schwagger surprised him with how quickly he started his dribble And you dont expect Swagger to beat you off the rib Blakes last basket came with 227 to go in the first half Scored since that cold three They need a good shot Aens creates more contact Thats the third foul on the Tigers in the half Second on Johnson and number three on Budda Johnson overall But a little shaken up Well Akens only has four points in the game but hes done a really good job putting pressure on that Clemson defense with his dribble penetration that in the first half they got in there and got good shots A little bit harder right now but they get in there and they pass the ball They got the defense to commit They pass the ball and so after moving it to the other side of the court then they got wide open shots So Wake has had the ball on this possession for about a minute and 12 seconds it feels like Was that poor checking Is that the term Yeah The pressure beyond the blue line is immense right now for the Tigers Omaha Belaloo was fouled on his way to the rim and hell get two free throws I think they were they were almost going the other way when that whistle blew but thats the way they ref some of those plays They they wait to see if it goes in the basket They call it on Hunter Its his third Thats good drive to the basket by Belu You need to see the ball go into the basket pretty soon Clemson has literally been called for four fouls in the last 31 seconds You got to make the partisans here in the Joel Coliseum Happy Yeah Well in the first half they shot 14 free throws Pumps Blue goes one for two And that breaks that 130 run we were talking about Still feels like the Tigers have some momentum despite that interminably long possession Wake Forest netted one point Davidsons wide open and its a fivepoint game Times it Steve Forest This has been the best game Ive seen him have and he gives them an extra guy out there that they need Theyre theyre still having trouble getting inside where they like to get it but the bigger difference is theyre playing better defense And Wake is now making some of the shots that they made in the first half Well and the other thing Wake was 12 out of 15 shooting twos in the first half and in the second half theyve only taken three shots Theyre all threes and theyve missed them all How much is that about the Clemson defense A little bit but its its its in the movement too Its a little bit of both Mason off the bench kicks it out Good defense inside by Hunter Just really good defense right now Sweagers bold pass off Gods foot Shot clock back to 20 and Wake gets a timeout to talk about what theyre going to do with a fivepoint lead and a lot of time to play Right there All those teams could be in the final four or none of them depending on what happens in college tournaments Its crazy the balance right now Team might go from the first four to the final four like Jim Behind Syracuse Orange did Thatll be hard to do now Not this time One arm on the rebound Steve Forbes wanted a foul cheering Clemson basketball Boy there was some scrapping going on there was there Yeah looked like a little hold but you know its a ways away Its hard to see Theyre right there They should be able to see that Clemson trailed by 20 Theyre on a 161 run Theyve done what they had to do to get back in the game Mainly theyve tightened it up on the defensive end Entry pass deflected Akins wins the battle for the scrum Wake Forest does a really good job forcing turnovers getting steals Akens getting more minutes with Cal Me out Playing better tonight Only played nine minutes despite starting Oh Davidson went down but Wake could not capitalize Uhoh Welling the other way Blocked cleanly apparently by Mason Tigers ball That is one heck of a play by Mason to Harris back in He got a little bit of time off after he played all 20 minutes in the first half He never he never touched him He got the ball And they need to get players going Thats a big key Hes hes their guy Hes got to get something going It was a little slow start to the first half but he needs to get going now Three of 10 one of six from three pullup comes up short and Welling paddling for the rebound was fouled by Omaha Belaloo Its his third Three on Belaloo three on Spillers two on Schwagger Theres been a lot of fouls like that Rebounding fouls going against the ball or holding and blocking out a lot of that stuff tonight Entry pass knocked cheering away by Got to try to get that movement going again which they had so went so well in the first half Little bit like that Little bit like that Ball goes from one side to the other then comes back That creates a driving and they worked on that in practice today Little simple drill One side cheering back and go and it was wide open I think thats the first bucket in a long time for Wake Forest The first field goal since there was 227 to play in the first half cheering Davidson backing down Marian cheering Wade clears it If youre going to play oneonone like that you better make the basket I mean he fought his way in there but pretty good defense by Wake Forest Bel from the corner There Thats what we saw in the first half Yeah that was a tough shot Hes a 35 threepoint shooter but he had a hand right in his face cheering Eight points for Omaha off the bench In and out for Wall Harris the rebound Hson wanted a tie up but no whistle cheering That was a long three in the shot Hes been He feels good tonight though Hes got confidence He thought that was going Shot clock down to seven Mason on the drive Lost it Finds Harris to beat the buzzer No rebound Hunter Wow A ton of contact Wii lays it off Davidson fouled clearly from behind Thats blue if thats Ford Yes it is And thats like how about Beloo does a nice job getting back in play and all you got to do is leave him alone there Youre not He just pushed him Got right up into him and pushed him cheering Davidson misses the first Tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after the womens basketball double header the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the night in the ACC Highlights and analysis from every womens game and a look ahead of the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend and early next week Weve got you covered all season right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN The fans are very unhappy here at Wake Forest definitely lively Yeah theyre wide awake Well theres been some contact on a couple plays that I think Wake has a little complaint And Clemsons really picked up the physical nature of their defense in the second half Yes they have And its gotten awake a little bit Having trouble getting what they want when it looked really easy in the first half at times pretty well defended by Welling This is Clemson basketball Wake with only six points in the last 10 and a half minutes of game action They struggle to move Thompsons coming and you can feel the momentum Yeah theyre just getting in there and getting in the lane and getting good shots And Wake is just having trouble scoring Their defense is almost the same as it was in the first half Theyre just not getting anything done on the offensive line Six points now for RJ Godfrey Mason over it We talked about him before the game Hes a guy that has really shot the three well in this twoame Wake Forest winning streak That is a big basket Godfrey counted and one RJ Godfrey Take a snapshot of that because thats not going to be what the ACC tournament bracket is going to end up Well look a week ago at this time Wake Forest had to be worried about making that record But two losses last week and another one tonight would really help Wake Forest not guarantee their spot in Charlotte but increase their odds dramatically being among the 15s that get a chance to play in a little dance Isaac Carr found his balance but couldnt finish with a left Another rebound for Carter Welling And thats another tough shot created by the fact that the Clemson defense forced him to dribble that whole time Cars first screaming shot attempt of the night He does have five assists and no turnovers or excuse me one turnover off the bench cheering Buckner no good on the three Spillers ahead for Mai Mason Step count it plus the foul applause I thought that Buckner had the opportunity to throw the ball inside to to Welling who had great position against Spillers but he didnt throw it in there Instead he shoots the three falls down trying to draw the foul So theres nobody back on defense And we talked again we talked about Mason before the game Hes had pretty good offensive numbers the last two games And hes been very productive here in the second half And its really a run by there for the foul Yeah With some of the contact weve seen in this game that wasnt much Yeah but thats out in front of God and everybody here 11 points for Mai Mason Beloo is back in the game with the four fouls Porter for three Clemson could really use Justin Porters offense down the stretch here Thats offense that has disappeared basically for two and a half games And the great as you say Evan if they he could find it now Oh he had a bad door Good hands by Porter And hes got two more Had a wide open back door and missed it and give up two at the other end Big Ruben of the fourth quarter of this game here at the Gold Coliseum in Winston Salem North Carolina Spillers in and out cheering They got to get the ball in Harriss hands Been a while since it feels like hes touched it Youre right Dan Theyre right back in the game Godfrey This is what he does Oh had it poked away Thats really a nice play by Bel because Godfrey was setting up to back him all the way down Omaha playing with the four too This is really a nice job by Welling to stop the dribbler and then steps right into the passing lane Does Porter and he scored the last five points for Clemson He had made a three in 16 straight games before going 0 for six at Duke on Saturday But with that three hes made a three in all but two games this season 25 of his 27 contests Tigers are 20 and six Theyve lost two straight after the 20 and four start been since January of 04 Tigers lost three in a row Duke Harris gets the B Very hard shot but thats what you have You have to go to him and make let him make a play and he made it Spillers in the passing lane cheering Gfrey goes down SPILLERS CANT FINISH but Harris is there to lay it back up and in And they all got there for that one There was Clemson laying One guy went down the other guys just watched cheering Brad Brownell with his arms crossed standing on the Clemson sideline cheering Porter step back short and Wake has snatched the momentum back Well theyve snatched it back with their defense How many steals have they gotten here during this stretch A lot Harris with 10 to shoot Coven puts his head down gets it back after it was blocked and it was blocked again and then he throws it to a wideopen fan in the corner Conor and Beahheim back at the Joel with 757 to go in a 10point game Yeah Cle Thompsons got to get get a couple buckets here They made a couple run back in but Link Forest has answered both of them and got back up to a double digit lead How about this pop off the bug Clemson leading the ACC with 30 bench points but the bench has been quiet tonight Wine has picked it up as a starter and hes matched his season high with 14 Hes been really good tonight This is the best hes played in a while Clemsons offense sputtered because they were really sloppy They threw it to Wake Forest a couple of times and that is what got the Deaks back on the right side of the momentum Tough shot to Ashen Akens Their offense has been good enough the whole game Davidson needs it Got a hand on the rebound but its controlled by Spillers Wake by nine with the ball Under seven minutes to play Clemson has plenty of time but each of these possessions becomes more and more important Got to get a stop Harris hesitates and puts it in Really really hard shot Well defended Offense was just better than the defense cheering and applause And thats thats what your closer is supposed to do Yep cheering Speaking of closers what about Trey Donaldson last night in Miami Yeah I mean he just finished the game and you know Virginia Techs let two or three games get away where they had the game and they just couldnt close I mean theyve got 17 wins They could have 20 very easily This guy that was a that was a tough shot but again hes your star and when youre coming down the stretch and you need points you expect him to get them And hes made a couple of tough ones He scored at least 20 13 times this year including each of the past four ball games Shes got 13 so far tonight Down the lane off a nice pass Davidson with a punch Bumps been so much better in this half They just had a a big hill to climb Theres not often you come down from 20 and thats what they were down on the road very hard Come back from 20 Harris Yes Thats what you do when youre the main guy Thats only his second three of the night He made his first one and then missed five in a row I mean he struggled all night and makes two when they really need him Makes it big cheering Hes improved dramatically as an outside shooter and this his sophomore season Hes improved in virtually every aspect of his game Important answer but Wallen missed it And the foul and the rebound action is on the Tigers I think thats one that Godfrey has to turn around and muscle his way to the basket Yeah he usually does that but I think they wanted to get the three Wen had hit one and I think they just want to go back there Not a bad play but Im okay with that if its an open three but there was a guy out there Theyre in position 12 now It just was six So weve got to make a couple stops and get a couple baskets and get it back into the sixpoint range before we get more than two minutes down Theyre going to pick it up full Clemsons not really a pressing team They dont do a lot of that Now if you wait you dont want to hang on to it You want to keep doing what youve been doing You dont want to slow it down You want to get a good shot And that some people say Well thats slowing it down But I dont think so I think that you have to try to use as much clock trying to get a good shot And the last five minutes if youre up 12 and you use the clock and get good shots you should be okay unless something just goes haywire Foul on Buckner is second One and one for Aens And look theres some make or miss luck that has hurt the Tigers They had only allowed double digit threes twice in their first 24 games of the season but both the Hokes and the Blue Devils had doubledigit threes their last two games And Wakes nine of 19 beyond the arc right now Well when you go on the road and youve lost two in a row youd rather be home for that next game Its tough when youre on the road and youve lost two cheering in a row Confidence is down a little bit Well down the boulevard for a loud two hand slam I think thats what you meant isnt it Go to the basket Yep Go to the basket Well this is a really impressive job by Wake Forest I mean Clemson cut it to five and Wake responded And then the Cs part of defensively right there and Welling took advantage Steve Forbes did say earlier today he thought his team needed to get to 70 tonight They have done that with time to spare Marian doesnt often look for his offense and hes called for the travel and he probably shouldnt have there Hes not that good with the ball on the floor and just made a bad mistake But they they just cant turn it over in those last four four and a half minutes Just get good shots and play defense and youll be right there Right And thats a perfect example of what youre talking about Jim that when Wake has tried to set its half court defense here in the second half it sometimes it struggled but when theyve been able to get turnovers thats whats cheering gotten things going for them Jim when was the last time you threw it down the way Carter Welling just did Thats I I had one dunk I think but it was on a court where hit the baskets were 4 in low I think in the summer time That was horrible Buckner back with the line The foul called on Aens Theres been a little inconsistency And theres some plays that are really physical the whole way through with nothing And then that was a little one there but this guy sitting next to us hasnt liked to call the whole night I dont wake forest chef Well thats his job Hes a Wake Forest fan Hes not supposed to like he doesnt and hes sitting down on the court so he can yell at the officials like theres no fans at the dome that get the refs ears Just wants a case They let the coach do it up there Right So here here comes Clemson again Theyve cut it back to 10 Now theyre playing zone again Yeah Again this is a highly and the thing about playing zone its easier to run the clock down when youre playing playing against the zone You can use more time This feels like must stop territory for the Tigers particularly if theyre going to play a zone and let them run the clock down Harris cant connect Here comes Buckner speeding down the court off the glass for two Hes Hes really good at that Nine points now for Buckner Tigers within eight And back into the zone goes Clemson applause and cheering Not a bad look A straight away He has not made a threepointer in ACC play but Coven saves the day to the offensive board And thats what you worry about when you switch to the zone Another offensive rebound for Wake Forest and Spillers is fouled Thats the reason that especially man had an opportunity One and one for Spillers And in conference play Spillers is a guy you like to have at the free throw line Hes 85 coming in Hes been really good tonight Really steady solid play 10 points five boards for Trayvon Spillers the transfer from Appalachin State Hes also got a couple of steals and Wake Forest had a stretch of some steals here in the second half and I thought that was a key to them keeping Clemson at bay Eight steals in the game Clemson only has nine turnovers total Looking for Welling Hes undercut and lands hard And Blue just fouled out and hopefully Wellings okay Second straight Wednesday night Weve watched Carter Welling writhing in pain on the ground Now theyre going to look at that tempting with the ball but its not an offensive play Hes not guarding a guy with a ball Hes guarding hes as you said hes blocking out Thats what hes doing Shot Looks like after further review the common foul has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul cheering Itll be two shots for Clemson and possession of the ball on the end line Yeah I I cant get this right but just because they said that that doesnt mean were wrong You could make the argument that the contact was if not excessive at least unnecessary And there was certainly no attempt to play the ball on what everybody thought You know Blue didnt think so But what everybody else thought was a pass Yeah I think he thought it was a shot And the referees dont agree with it Well remember flagrant foul 302 to go Chance for Clemson to put together a four or fivepoint possession Down by nine This changes the game potentially You get the two free throws and score to go from nine to five screaming Well makes them both in double figures for the fourth straight game and for the 18th time this season And if they score here they can get back to within five And thats as close as theyve been Baseline inbounds Buckner throws it to Johnson Mary in the rebound That was obviously the play they were running to get him a three but I you know it wasnt an uncontested three Clemson is has run some good stuff and got some open shots and hasnt made them tonight Tigers 6 for 20 from deep cheering Harris a chance to back down Davidson screaming showing off his strength Its a foul on the bump with five on the shot clock Harris to shoot one and one That foul was coming It was the same thing thats happened down here and theyre going to call that First free throws tonight for Harris applause Wake back up by eight Coming up next well send you to McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta Georgia Tech and number 14 Virginia Doug Sherman Scott Williams standing by Harris misses the second Tigers down eight with two and a half to go And its a sixpoint game as Buckner attacks the Raps Why is he not picking up the ball Wake wants the clock to run And heres that zone again So I think you take your time against as much as you can Take the whole clock No he did not do that For the first time in ACC play makes it three What a time for it applause Buckner step back short Akins rebound saves the Spillers screaming Akins had been 0 for9 in conference play from deep cheering before that switch and he takes it early in the shot clock which you dont want to do but it goes in Well this is if you grab you got to figure that out Thats how evil your luck is tonight You know youre playing the zone and if the guys going to shoot a three okay this is the guy we want to shoot the three but he knocks it down Aens knocks it down at the line A transfer from Denver closing in on his season high He had 15 points in the first week of the season against Morehead State got 12 after going one of two at the line here Tigers now down 10 with very little margin error the last 95 seconds Davidson three doesnt go Tiff doesnt go Welling third chance and he was fouled to the dismay of the Wake Forest fans here at the Joel Well the fans dont like anything now That was a foul Fourth on Spillers Wake Forest has had an answer Every time Clemson has made a move back tonight theyve had an answer You have to remember Wake Forest played Michigan a onepoint game And Michigans arguably the best team in the country right now Who do you like Saturday in DC The Wolverines and the Blue Devils You know that its Michigans really good but its closer to Duke I I I think I think Duke will win but Michigan is really really good And these are this is the game like a tour NCA tournament game where Duke has to get other guys It cant be just two guys One more other question for you Jim What do you think of the nonconference games in February We saw Virginia play Ohio State Louisville play Baylor Well you know we used to do that all the time Had one schedule just to get ready for a tournament but they havent done it as much the last couple years cuz theres 37 teams in the conference Thats a good point applause Yeah Im surprised that game popped up I used to always say when we went to play why are we doing this But if you wanted it was oh this was a good idea Well ACC has so far pretty well in those games Yeah this has been the reason the ACC is getting more teams in is the ACC won more games early which we havent done in the last few years and thats why were in better position better record against other power conference teams eight teams according to Joe Lunardi in the field And the key there is Clemson Joe has them at an eight seed and this wont help them applause Thatll be their third straight loss and theyd be headed home to face pretty redhot Florida State team Seinals have won six of eight Welling missed the three and that should just about do it barring a miracle Timeout Wake Forest with 110 to go Deacons up 11 with gave up 76 against Virginia Tech And again if their defense is not going to play well their offense is not good enough to carry No theyre defense first team Thats what they are and thats what theyre not doing Meanwhile Wake Forest heads to Virginia Tech on Saturday and Wake turns it over Mason has it slapped off his foot Apparently its Tigers ball underneath Down 11 They would need four punching ball Three of these turnovers to get back in this thing And we need threes You see the end of the NC State Miami game on Saturday Wall lead for three Tigers with an eight 103 to go The ball with about a minute to go and had multiple turnovers like what we just saw from Mai Mason in Miami stole that game at the Lenovo Center Bullpack certainly bounced back last night against the Tar Hills What a season Quadir Copeland your former players had Yeah it took him time His first two years he wasnt Last year at MU State wasnt quite ready This year hes fully ready and is probably playing as well as any point guard in terms of production assists steals getting the ball to people and scoring Hes six and he can really handle the ball Akens knocks down the free throw Yeah Hubert Davis said after the game that he controlled the game Hes very very good It just took him time which is reasonable Yeah its what it should be but so often we dont give that a barreling into the photographers on the baseline and a foul called as Buckner gets help back up to his feet Boy he I mean he was really going full speed there Sebastian Akens has really bounced back He only played nine minutes on Saturday against Stanford tonight cheering 29 minutes 14 points one shy of his career best Thats been big for the Digs And that three that he made was huge That one for 20 in conference play but the one was a big one Eightpoint game 534 Yeah but hes one for his last one Thats right Akens into the fourth court Gets it to Coven Hudson finally fouls Mason Well Mason is not a guy who goes to the free throw line very often Hes a threepoint shooter whos only taken only attempted five free throws in conference play and made three of them Its always good when you have two Yes And yet hes a good shooter and this is his third straight game in double figures after he only scored in double figures three times in his first 22 games of the season Wick has been really good tonight Theyve had an answer every time The pumpson came back at him and he just answered it every time cheering Wakes able to close this out on Saturday They got a Virginia Tech team that they already beat albeit a really close game And now Nate Calis the biggest bucket of that game and he will most likely not be available this Saturday for the noon tip off at Castle Coliseum And Wake heads up to Castville to face a struggling Boston College team on Tuesday See Nate Cal Mace Blakes hopeful to get him back near the end of the month Finished by Welling but time is running short for the Tigers Time out Brad Brownell with 339 left Well they cant Anything can happen Into Coleman ahead to Aens He gets hit checked into the first row The fans are trying to persuade the officials to call a flagrant foul The fans should relax This game is over Just sit down and be happy you won the game and stop yelling Usually when you sit and where we sit the front row people have paid a lot of money and theyre usually quiet Not here Not here I think somebody gave this guy the tickets tonight and hes just coming in here and yelling at everybody the whole game Hes still yelling You got to appreciate the passion right Absolutely This is college basketball on the road applause You know Im really impressed at Wake Forest Theyve got 83 points now This is against a really good defensive team and Akens has struggled without you know playing the point Second string backup coming in having to play and hes been good tonight Its his best game of the season careerhigh or season high 16 He had a 27point game playing for Denver last year against North Dakota State This is different against Clemsons defense as Hunter makes the three first points of the night Just dying with every player is in the game No question about it What about when your sons playing Same thing You live and die with it Hunter may have jammed his finger foul to Harris with 21 seconds to go Going for the ball that time This has been a pretty impressive stretch for Wake Forest taking care of business late night last Wednesday in Atlanta Then coming from behind to beat Stanford on Saturday and now a home win over a Clemson team that is the de facto number 26 team in the country in the AP poll First team in the receiving votes department after their own and two week last win and theyre in great position to win three or four more games in the regular season out of their last five Great position you know get some momentum going into the tournament and see what can happen No good for Hunter there Rebound Spillers Is Clemson going to foul in the final 8 seconds Does not look like it cheering and applause Well who saw this coming Wake has won three in a row Clemson has lost three in a row Deakons by eight over the Tigers
