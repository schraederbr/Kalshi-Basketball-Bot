2Ds Yeah look at that smile He has been flying high this year 19 and a half points per game Hes shooting 63 from the floor Number 21 Look out Shannon Carter wins the tip for Georgia Southern And away we go Eighth alltime meeting between Georgia Tech and Georgia Southern Last one came just a couple of years ago but Georgia Tech wins As you said Georgia Southern averaging over 90 points per game a feed down low and with seven to shoot a threepointer from Tyron Moore drops in Georgia Southern one of the most lethal threepoint shooting teams in the conference if not the country hits their first one And Tyrons averaging 13 points per game this season 46 from beyond the arc And he picks up uh right where hes left off coming in here And a high lob entry pass to Bango The same starting five for Georgia Tech now in each of the last four games Meanwhile for Georgia Southern a slight change to their starting lineup Dwayne Williams Jr the red shirt freshman making his first career start A threepoint strike from the left side and Alden Apple White drills it And this is what we expected Georgia Southern they can shoot from three Georgia Tech theyve got the size advantage Expect them to try and work in the paint Yeah its a veteran team up one logged in Craft knocked down five triples at Georgia in the loss was coming in tonight with the hot hand but he left it a little bit short on that one But right here well see Georgia Southern This is what they like to do Get to the paint kick out Most times theyre going to have four players on the floor that can shoot that three and they are not afraid to let it fly Wy five players shooting 40 or better from distance Baseline inbound after the jump ball Jaden Mustaf at point guard for Georgia Tech looking to get it in He goes to Cila a true freshman 21 years old out of Sagal Mustaf looking for Cila who tumbles Mustaf tries to drive and split the D Draws the foul Thats his strength right there Putting the ball on the floor Hes a bigger guard Has a knack for drawing fouls Uh hes going to be aggressive too Loves to attack the paint So fresh shot clock Cam Craft transfer from Miami of Ohio his first year at Georgia Tech Gets it into Mustaf Will pick and roll from high to low Dongo up and hell go to the line as hes hit from behind We Yeah thats uh you got to watch that You know Georgia Tech will attack the paint put the foul on the Eagles leading scorer Web on this play Here we go High low action attacking the offense from the high post and they they love that big to big action with Clock to Dongo So Dongo at the line preseason all ACC selection averaging nine points so far this year He was averaging over 13 last year as an allconerence selection and now just five for nine at the free throw line so far this year Dongo should come in well rested He uh only logged 19 minutes in the loss at Georgia Uh had 10 points in that game was four of six from the field but was saddled on the bench in foul trouble And that was one of the keys for Damon Statimers Can they defend without fouling Particularly in the front court Georgia Tech feels like if youve got Bango and Moila on the floor points are going to be hard to come by in the paint Yeah great length even on the perimeter Well I mean you look at Mustaf guarding the point guard position Were talking about a guy thats 64 65 nice wingspan I mean thats one of Techs strength while theyre top 10 in field percentage defense in the country Seven to shoot Williams gets it to Tyron Moore Got to go up with it Apple White lets it go Dong goes straight up No whistle And action continues Close to a shot clock violation The Jackets in transition Cam Craft No And now Georgia Southern can they get out and run Craft had everything but the finish there Hes a great shooter so he commands that poor close out Got to rim just couldnt finish Tyron Moore rattles it in and Georgia Southern now three for four All from threepoint layer whos uh got over a thousand plus points in his career Georgia Southern with a sixpoint lead here in the early going Kawishi Reeves to answer Splash featured him on the open Thats why hes been hitting big shots The senior steps up knocks down a triple when the Jackets need it And a jumper just inside the free throw line from Web wont go but a second chance now for Georgia Southern DONGO GOES UP SPUD WEBB FINDS A WAY WOW Webs a guy hes about 64 but he is long arms able to finish in the paint Must tries the teardrop it wont go tying more jacks a three little too strong and Kesi Reeves with the board Its one area where Georgia Tech was really beaten last week against Georgia as Jaden Must travels with it But points in transition John 306 Georgia outscored Georgia Tech on Friday Yeah that will be a key area of focus uh for the Jackets But decision making against the Eagles the Eagles are going to play high pace You see Charlie Henry hes known for coaching highpaced offense WY has had much success in his career Came from Alabama and then uh was also with Iowa State and sometime in the GLeague as well Hes a guy thats got a diverse portfolio out of the box hire Hes doing a great job here at Georgia Southern spent a lot of time around Fred Hoyberg and Nate Oats Most recently from Alabama is Dwayne Williams just off the mark and a rebound from Mai Fleming who checks in for Georgia Tech the true freshman What I was saying Wy before were featuring coach was uh playing fast uh you know its okay to play fast but decision making while you play fast is tough The Eagles are a team that theyre used to it This is how they play Im interested to watch how Georgia Tech takes care of the ball and makes good decisions And here we have coach Stamire in his third season at Georgia Tech Spoke to him before the game and he felt like the key was like you said decisionm taking care of the basketball and its something Georgia Tech has struggled with so far this season Theyve committed at least 13 turnovers in every game this year including 20 in a win over Southeastern Louisiana Theres going to be multiple possessions in this game Uh its going to be back and forth The ability of Georgia Tech to take care of the basketball be critical as well as guarding the perimeter And some late subs coming in by Dongo heads to the bench Cam Craft checks in Couple changes on the Georgia Southern side as well as we get a look at Jefferson Kulabali and Nicabian White And off the inbound pass Cam Craft short corner jumper Hes money from there Great execution and uh he did a nice job curling off the staggered double and his timing was just perfect down the left side Apple White got a step on Flemmy and Sila goes up Itll be called for the goending and that takes us to our first break Georgia Southern one of the top offenses in the Sunb Belt Theyve already hit three threes in the opening minutes here in Atlanta Well when coach Charlie Henry rebuilt the Georgia Southern roster this off season He looked for shooters and that is what he has gotten through four games this year The Eagles lead the Sunb Belt in both those shooting categories On the flip side John Georgia Tech is top 10 nationally in defending both shots and threepoint shots And so far Georgia Southerns winning that battle Yeah somethings got to give Its early on in this one but right now Apple White with five points Hes one of two from beyond the ark And Tyron Moore two for three from Beyond the Ark So theyve combined for 11 of 13 points and that damage three of uh three of the main field goals coming from beyond the ark Only one returning player for Georgia Southern from last years team that is Nicavon White not currently on the floor as Craft gets to Lamar Washington drives kick out Reeves off the mark and thatll be last touch by Fleming Georgia Southern basketball That was nice hustle by Fleming trying to get on the glass and Washington did a nice job getting to the paint finding an open shooter Inside out three come up short Defense need to dig in for the Jackets Web down the right side of the lane feeds low and its swatted away by Payton Marshall the Missouri transfer Atlanta native coming back home this year And Washington might have been poked in the eye there We got a foul coming and thats going to be charged to Shane and Carter But just a moment there we saw Jefferson Kulabali guarding Lamar Washington They were teammates at Pacific last year out in California now competing against each other in Georgia What are the chances right Huh Reunite in Atlanta Georgia Two different teams Washington averaging 14 and a half uh through two games played Uh they really like his veteran leadership and hes got experience And Craft has a shot deflected Navian White got a piece of it Georgia Southern with the basketball A fivepoint lead 5 minutes in White slips his man bounce pass down low A little miscommunication perhaps between Andre Bernie and Alvin Apple White First turnover for Georgia Southern Lemon got hit on the back door Lost sight of the man It was just a miscommunication Apple White was running into the offensive attack Chaz Kelly has checked in for Georgia Tech now Three in white Pardon Seven and white down in the bottom right corner Marshall in the low block Got the mismatch on Bernie gets tied up down low and Georgia Southern earns a jump right there Yeah Marshall backing down one dribble two dribbles that look like theyre going to go on the first dribble A hard double They sent two guys at Marshall See if he can handle the pressure So another turnover for Georgia Tech And some pressure here in the back court as Kelly rides Kyrie Dunn and is called for the foul That was an area of concern against the the Bulldogs Uh fouling you know fouling off the ball Really gave up a lot of points Uh lost the battle of the free throw line against the dogs uh by 15 points And uh you know if they cut that in half they get the dub and leave Athens with a win Georgia shot 44 free throws That was the most free throws taken against Georgia Tech in a single game since February of 2008 as Dunn Waltzes his way down the lane The tap in there from Andres Bernie So far Georgia Southern 6 for 12 from the floor and theyre winning the rebounding battle Dongo crosscourt Fleming gets a step wide open lane GOES UP HANGS and hits Acrobatic finish right there by the freshman Hanging and then drops it Georgia Tech needed that one Down five Two possession game Coach Statimar told us if he could do one thing over Friday night he would have had a Kai Fleming play more cuz that one goes threearters of the way down then pops out Lamar Washington walked 30 minutes at point guard Hes called for carrying there I think he lost it on his right hip Now three Georgia Tech turnovers are right there Fleming hes a guy thats electric on the offensive side of the ball Super athletic playing just shy of 18 minutes per game and averaging nine points in each outing this season Hes a guy thats going to add value Hes going to continue to grow and mature along the process but I love his his ability Hes got a very high ceiling to his game on both sides of the basketball See him pressuring the Cave on White there in the lane Koulali off the front of the rim Dongo looks to run the break after getting the rebound and by turns it over looking for Marshall Eagles are running done Cant finish And now its Washington Theyll slow it down for the Yellow Jackets Look at some of the numbers from Georgia Tech against UG from the guard position You see Washington with 16 Mustaf 15 And theres by Dongo with the right hand But thats going to be key for Georgia Tech They rely heavily on Dongo and Cila but theyve got to get some offensive production from the guard spots Yeah And I like what Flemings doing right there and then tacks off the bounce and finds the peg for the finish The Eagles answer again Done from deep Four threes already on seven tries And this is part of Georgia Southerns DNA This isnt necessarily a hot start Its really the skill they have They had a 61point second half as they create another turnover here Theyre averaging 93 points per game through four games played this season This is how they play Georgia Tech will need to respond Kyrie Dunn sophomore transferring in from College of Southern Idaho Gets it off the Navy on White Late feed and Bernies there to finish it Big to big And now Georgia Tech getting beat on dribble drive penetration Transition offense the early offense the dribble drives stinging the Jackets early on in this one WY Georgia Southern looking for their first win over Georgia Tech since 1958 Off to a good start turnovers from Georgia Tech and its been a collective effort Five different players with one turnover There are the numbers youre talking about Georgia Tech trying to take better care of the basketball as Dongo crosscourt Fleming plenty of space just a touch short One and done so far Georgia holding their own on the glass as well Oh thats been a big key Zavian White off the dribble He gets it to fall And thats where theyre tough to guard Payton Marshall was not there on the show on the ball screen at the top of the arc And all this team needs is a split second Theyre going to let it fly Fleming hoist it high Dongo gets it Reverse in And a bench warning here coming on Georgia Southern That was called by the officials Trey Stein whos late father Ramy an ACC legend There we see the high low action again Georgia Tech getting in the interior Offense has not been a problem other than the turnovers for the Jackets Theyre getting high quality shots have missed a couple good threes Itll be taking care of the basketball and then assignment defense So far the comments that coach datamire shared with us had shoot around today feeling like this Georgia Southern game is similar to what the North Florida game was last year defensively at least they seem pretty preient right now cuz this is a Georgia Southern team that can shoot the three but as you pointed out earlier they were having success in the paint just before that last timeout Yeah it takes a disciplined approach and it takes a discipline approach from all five players on the floor that that was a solid defensive possession but then you give up the offensive rebound done wide open And another offensive rebound on the third try its Andre Bernie And you expect Georgia Southern to hit their threes and make their shots but you dont expect if youre coached to lose the battle of the boards Its a team that requires you to play discipline communicate all five guys for the entire shot clock and then youve got to box out team that shoots a lot of threes theyll be long rebounds And were already seeing the offensive boards being a factor in this one Another turnover Here comes Kyrie Dunn but a whistle And weve got a foul coming here on Navy and White Thats a bit of a break for Georgia Tech And Georgia Southerns coming from every angle As soon as Georgia Tech post players touch the ball the trap is coming right there from the top They X from the top rotate out and its fast break right there Georgia Tech luckily gets the foul called on that one But this is an aggressive half court defense right now Wy I beg your pardon That foul is actually going to be on Jefferson Kulabali Mustaf to inbound Moila has been quiet so far or not a single field goal attempt from the freshman big They look for CEO down low Its denied Mustaf to shoot Flemings got to cut it loose and he knocks him down Great looking player Hes He can do it all and hes so young and the more experience he gets hes going to be a tremendous player here in the SEC Kick out Spud Webb not known as a threepoint shooter clanks that one Hes one of the few guys in the Georgia Southern roster that its not their strength Fleming already with five points Looking for more It wont drop Well he checked right there I dont mind that Knocked a couple down And White was close to walking with it Turnover anyway Mustaf looks to Reeves goes up and he will go to the line drawing the foul Yeah the ability to draw contact We spoke of it earlier Mustafs a guy thats a big guard plays well going downhill towards the basket and with his size and strength and his physicality Hes going to put fouls on the defender Its a great look at it right here Eyes are up He sees the floor One hard dribble and he gets it The side step the euro step High IQ play He made the right decision there Free throws will be important Wy especially for Must got a great free throw rate but shooting just a tick over 50 strike so far this year He gets the first Georgia Tech started the season 3 and 0 They went into Athens against the instate rival and uh left 11 points at the free throw line Lost the game by five So who knows You know free throws are definitely a premium on them right now and its an area of focus for Georgia Tech to improve on So Mustaf hits them both Lead trimmed to six We got a foul coming here Its going to be on Moila This is foreign territory right now for starters Jackets this season and their only uh opponents are averaging 62 points per game against them and now just 11 minutes is into this one theyve given up 25 points So see if they can adjust more kicks out another three Apple White no longs got it for the Yellow Jackets Gustav steps into a three and an offensive rebound for Georgia Tech That was their first of the game Washington tried to finger roll left it underneath the rim as Georgia Tech basketball Its an athletic lineup for Georgia Tech Fleming Washington Mustaf Reeves surrounding the big Cila Youve got a lot of length a lot of athleticism and versatility All five guys can go off the bounce All five guys play above the rim and they can all stretch the floor to Cila guarded by Sevent Satirov from Bulgaria Ball is loose Cila recovers Ball pressure from Georgia Southern has been so impressive Washington a three No Ca scarfs up the board Reeves high arcing three Drains it Now an 80 run for Georgia Tech over the last two minutes to get themselves back to within three Reeves second triple in this one Hes got six points Two of three from beyond the arc Dwayne Williams a three Way too strong And the Yellow Jack a chance to continue this run down low Cila and a high pass corral by Kuisi Reeves in the corner and looking for Fleming but Williams is there and its Satira with possession for Georgia Southern Reeves picks it off and jarred loose by Web The Yellow Jackets they withtood the first punch An 80 run has gotten them to back within three And so far pretty high quality basketball between Midtown Atlanta and South Georgia the tier of player thats coming to Atlanta Uh Coach Hobbs a veteran associate head coach on the bench Great recruiting done by the assistant coaching staff by the old Jackets CILA WITH THE PUT BACK and hell go to the line for another Thats the first shot of the night for Mo Caes Its a high percentage look and hes got a chance to tie the game here at the free throw line CIA averaging 11 and 11 on the season Uh hes a double double machine but again Georgia Tech the ability to get to the rim and attack at the basket Mustaf right there even though he missed that creates the offense for Cila And Cila hits the free throw Hes struggled from the line so far this year Thats a good sign So the game is tied An 11 beg you pardon 130 run for Georgia Tech Georgia Southern meanwhile they missed their last five threepoint attempts They go down low banging and left short by Carter And Georgia Tech up again Washington weaves in off the glass Cila I think theyre going to get him for hanging on the rim Yeah thats going to be offensive basket interference Yeah Cila well probably get another look at it here in a little bit but the left hand was on top of the rim Uh Sila touched it So left hand was right here Were going to get a good look Boom Left hand on the basket touches the ball Thats where the call the whistle comes in Meanwhile Lamar Washington saying to himself Ive never been called for that once in my life Nice work by our production crew They didnt leave me hanging man Thats cuz were on the Were on the ball I love it They take care of team They like you in there Babel in that in that truck Tanner Moore cuts loose a three Georgia Southern They hit five of their first nine but since have gone cold Must stop up and hell go to the line And now youre seeing the effect of Georgia Tech pushing the ball playing with pace but making good decisions When they take care of the ball wy theyre effective at getting to the basket And again I said the versatility of this lineup Guys that can get out pitch ahead and attack And theyve got the size advantage from the perimeter Great at taking the contact Goes to the left and almost got the and one And that is the third foul on Tyron Moore So he will head to the bench And hes been their leading threepoint shooter so far this year So we may not see more of him these next six minutes Meanwhile Georgia Tech now with their first lead of the night See Mustaf gets two there Hes drawn three fouls on the opponent already in this one So not only are you getting the line youre putting fouls on some of the key players for the Eagles White drives and he is hammered up top Fouls going to be charged to Mo CEO Jackets on a 130 run over the last 355 152 run in the last 5 minutes and change And Im not sure what coach Dtomire said but the entire team has responded You see right there attacking the basketball verticality Fleming and Cila two dynamic freshman ready to play right now And White misses the free throw Georgia Southern hasnt scored at all in the last 4 and 12 minutes Another look here They got Cila on the call Guess coming down there Yeah probably a little suspect at the end of the play but Georgia Southern earns the whistle White did a nice job attacking aggressively Didnt back down from the shot blocker And White goes one for two That was Georgia Southerns first trip to the line tonight So a onepoint lead for Georgia Tech to the Yellow Jackets who committed five turnovers in the first five minutes only one in the last 10 Washington takes on Dunn Feeds Dongo Good active hands for Spud Webb A scrum for the ball and the Eagles come out with it Is that going to be a foul on Dongo It is 14 Ston goes first 14 fouls for the Jackets You see the swarming defense the Eagles the ability to get in there Theyre going to trap on that baseline drive and then the collapsing defense is on point So with more in foul trouble its the sophomore Kyrie Dunn running point guard for Georgia Southern Dun bouncing off of Washington Ps and hits the runner Tell you what coach Charlie Henrys got the Eagles ready to go Eagles competing Theres high energy on the bench and on both sides of the ball Theyre just playing aggressive and loosey goosey and no pressure And a foul coming on Spud Webb here He wants Coach Henry to challenge it contending that Dongo tripped You had a better look at it than me I got the full screen from Charlie Henrys staff Uh Kente Hart Nory Johnson George Nielsen assembled a nice coaching staff Heres a great look Yeah theres a little little bit of contact downstairs You can see the feet got tangled up and you can see Spud Webb looking for the review No challenge from Georgia Southern Its a new rule in college basketball this year And Tongo hits the front end of the one and one That really hurt Georgia Tech You mentioned the free throws they missed John against Georgia but there were also some front ends of one and ones that they missed Absolutely And tonight seven of eight from the line So shooting at 875 clip Much better Dog with a game high eight points and now nine Bile will take a seat Payton Marshall coming in So lead back to Georgia Tech and its Jefferson Kulabali on the ball now White takes Reeves off the dribble off balance Its to White with six to shoot Threepoint try Air ball Washington A poor pass and a turnover White goes up and its Shane Carter who flushes it And another turnover And another turnover Oh my Just miscommunication on that one And an offensive foul coming on Carter Carter was moving on the roll right there The screener roll totally wiped out the Georgia Tech defender Theyll have another look Marshall nice job staying vertical Carter was there to clean up the mess Its an athletic Eagles roster Theyre playing hard Really getting after the Yellow Jackets And you made the point earlier Georgia Southern wants to play fast And Georgia Tech wants to do that Theyve got to make good decisions And a couple of sloppy turnovers when the game picked up pace Washingtons three too strong Fleming rises for the rebound Goes back up and off the mark Well Georgia Techs really adjusted to the pace of play They had five early turnovers and now just seven in the game So theyve only had two turnovers over the last 10 minutes So an officials timeout Georgia Southern a onepoint edge These teams trading blows here in the first half It was a priority entering this season Coach Datamire spoke about it before Georgia Techs opener but turnovers Can the Yellow Jackets take care of the basketball And it has been a challenge so far tonight again already with eight and still nearly four minutes left in the first half Yeah and luckily the Jackets are three and three and one but you see the turnovers Uh Maryland Eastern Shore to start the season 13 turnovers against Bryant They had 13 Southeast Louisiana 20 Adjusted on the road against tougher competition but still 14 A little bit too much You want to be at 10 or a little bit below there And so far tonight again pace of play number of possessions through the roof but the Jackets eight turnovers in this one resulting in some points for the Eagles Yeah worth noting George that was a high possession game right So theres maybe a little bit of uh you got to factor that in a little bit but ultimately Damon Statamar not satisfied with the amount of turnovers as Pton Marshall tries to hang on to the rebound gets it off to Lamar Washington And of course Nate George who led the ACC in assists last year no longer at Georgia Tech transferring to Syracuse And theres a feeling that you know its going to take a little time to figure out the guard rotation and find some rhythm with so many new players So I think the hope is for Georgia Tech Thats a member that continues to go down throughout the season Yeah And you know whats crazy A lot of the turnovers not just coming from the perimeter Uh the post players adjusting to getting trapped Weve seen uh Georgia Southern Theyre automatically trapping Marshall Cila and Dongo forcing Georgia Techs front line to make decisions Thats where many of the turnovers have come Fleming hits the first Georgia Tech well into the double bonus now You know I asked you know Coach Damar about perhaps moving Lamar Washington into that starting rotation after the games hes put up And you know hes got a pro mindset on it John where he just doesnt feel like starting is as significant as those on the outside might think Ultimately comes down to how many minutes are you getting and are you on the floor at the end Yeah cumulative minutes Washingtons logged 28 minutes through two games on average and eight assists five turnovers averaging 14 and a half Uh but he brings a steadiness to him And then Mustaf also playing some point Uh hes getting reps and thats what the most important thing is at that position getting reps ingame reps uh playing at a fast pace Don goes up left it short but tipped back in by Andres Bernie the red shirt senior in his sixth year of college basketball Hes playing his 156th career game tonight John thats five offensive rebounds and eight second chance points for the Scrappy Eagles Marshall trying to go up and he jams it home Good patience underneath Back tied at 32 White feeds it and Bernie will go to the line Foul coming on Kesi Reeves Another possession where the Eagles are able to get into the the blue area on the floor the paint and theyre breaking down Georgia Techs defense here Well get a great look at the lob on the other end Tremendous lob pass Nice job by Marshall to gather go up strong and finish And on the other end its just Georgia Southern has had a knack at getting to the paint and thats forcing the Jackets defense to break down a little bit But you go back to that North Florida loss a year ago and a similar type of opponent for Georgia Tech tonight There was this feeling that Florida Tech might have tried to guard the three too closely against North Florida and open up some lanes to dribble drives Its kind of a fine happy medium as you described it before we went on the air tonight between protecting against the three a good shooting team but also not giving up the paint Yeah some real positives Georgia Tech again theyre theyre holding Georgia Southern 40 from the field 31 from three and theyve only sent them to the line four times So Georgia Techs still doing a lot of really good things defensively Transition bucket doesnt go for Georgia Southern and a turnover and turn here Wy you take it No you take you want I insist Well you know its the holidays Its the giving time of the season Were going to have to work on our offense to defensive conversion here too I mean were going But thats it The pace of play the number of possessions Theres an adjustment you have to go through And if you play fast a responsibility comes with that pace And right now were seeing the residual effect of maybe playing a little bit faster than youre used to Marshall trying to take on Bernie and hes traveling with him And another turnover And another turnover Wow Thats one thing youd say about coach start Hes a guy thats been there done it seen it all And I love his demeanor on the sideline Uh just his poise If youre a player and youre playing for him you can look over there Hes always just got that point guard face on you know solid stoic get to the next play I think theres something to that you know as a former player when you look over there and you can see your coach He believes in this team And Washington robs done two one flips back to Dongo but its Mustaf who ends up with it and he will go to the free throw line It feels like were playing on ice And again were going to see uh the Mustaf right Hes the one that hung the foul on the opponent Scrappy defensive effort Washington brings that to the table Transfer from Pacific Not sure he intended the ball to go there but Mustaf with a nose for the ball has the ability to draw those fouls get to the line and knocks down another one You mentioned the challenges playing point guard and Dame Statmires demeanor He was joking earlier today about how a lot of guys want to play point guard until they actually get the opportunity and they say You know what This this is pretty tough You have to be in elite condition to play the point guard position And if youre picking up 94 ft defensively youre getting banged on on ball screen situations And then offensively youre never off Youre just on Youre leading Youre directing Youve got the ball in your hand Youre getting lit up by a defender Tough position to play Dunn has the ball kick off his feet on the ground Its Bernie and jump ball belong to Georgia Tech Tell you what both teams from uh instate rivalry game right here The uh pace of play has been tremendous The intensity has been awesome Both benches have been into this game and uh its been a fun one to call One minute to go We got a one possession game Jackets leading this one Again game is 3332 Pace of play probably favors the Jackets Uh if they can take care of that basketball mentioned Georgia looking for their first win against Georgia Tech since 1958 Its important to note theyve only met five times since then Georgia Tech winning all five of those of course but the Eagles four years ago here at McKameish had a threepointer to win the game and missed The Yellow Jackets escaped Its hard to believe only five times You know the Jackets theyre not going down to Statesboro That that place will be a mad house And Georgia Southern by the way opened a new facility about a year ago the Hill Convocation Center And that one rolls in off the back of the rim An and one opportunity for Georgia Southern as they take the lead Surprising stat here is points in the paint Georgia Southern 18 points in the paint 19 points coming off the bench tonight Georgia Tech points in the paint just 12 Uh so did not think that would be a strength tonight for the Eagles But scoring in the paint theyve done the damage just like that in transition And White completes the threepoint play Hes got seven Andre Bernie who averages just five points per game has got eight tonight And a foul coming here against Kyrie Dunn And he doesnt like the call Georgia Tech in the double bonus Thats a tough one to swallow for Georgia Southern Lamar Washington to the line shooting Thats 13 fouls against the Eagles as a team which obviously doesnt affect the double bonus anymore but stacking up fouls across a lot of different players Yeah Moore Big piece of that Hes been settled on the bench with three Web leading scorer with two Carter with two Kavali with two So Georgia Tech gets one out of two and Georgia wants a timeout here with 18 seconds Want to try and capitalize on the last possession of the first half Well have it for you on the other side Tech matches up man or zone Uh regardless I think you know work the clock attack would say five six on the clock Theyve been very successful whether its a dribble hand offarm or a ball screen situation put the head down try to get to the paint and then if Georgia Tech collapses you want to kick back behind the ball But Georgia Techs had a tough time uh with dribble containment Looks like theyre in a sagging mantoman defense So look for some ball screen action or dribble handoff They might go 14 low That looks to be it 14 low for Georgia Tech No foul Switch everything And a foul coming against Georgia Tech Thats going to be on Lamar Washington They got him with a push and that puts Georgia Son at the line for one and one That hurts for the Jackets Just a little bit too physical on the perimeter So these are freebies Chance for Georgia to score but Georgia Tech can secure They have 8 seconds to operate on the other side of the ball D makes the first We never even got to see the 14 so they fouled before then Feel a little cheated Yeah man I was excited to see what coach Henry drew up Yeah he was going one4 clear out Mhm Dun hits them both A threepoint lead for Georgia Southern And the Eagles are going to press a little here into Washington Greavves floats it ahead to Mustaf with 3 seconds trying to get it down low to Dongo who is fouled by Andres Bernie That pass was going out of bounds And with less than two seconds remaining Dongo is going to have a couple of free throws Georgia Tech executed the a set play side out of bounds Two passes and then a sprinting dongo secures the post up Well see the physicality right there Got the left hand wrapping around a little bit too much contact Officiating crew all over it AJ Messiah Trey Stein Chase Shaw playing a great game thus far Always taking care of the officials John Babel Always got to give him the shout out Got to respect the stripes man Got to respect them Well youre wearing the black and white tonight Oh yeah Home team So Dongo hits one at the buzzer and it does not fall for Apple White And so itll be a onepoint lead for Georgia Southern at the half 3736 We have been treated to quite the opening 20 minutes between the big city Georgia Tech and South Georgia Georgia Southern Its been a competitive 20 minutes here at McCish Pavilion The Eagles have been lighting it up Georgia Tech working down low in the paint Weve got much more coming at you here from Midtown Atlanta can knock down shots to the threepoint line His range is true The guy has Theyre really going after it Theyre not flinching Uh theyve got Georgia Tech turned over 10 times in the first half Caused the Jackets some problems So Moore back on the floor with three fouls He was sidelined the final six minutes of the first half in foul trouble and Carter draws an early foul here on Jaden Mustaf John you were talking about the experience that Georgia Southern has on their roster Take a look at the veterans on this Eagle roster Theyve got six players who have played at least five seasons of college basketball Yeah and it shows uh you know points in the paint They were winning the war of points in the paint 18 to 12 in the first half This is a veteran group that attacks Theres no fear And you see those names Web White Bernie Moore Apple White and Koulal These guys get after it Theyre going to be great in the Sunb Belt You might ask yourself how do these guys have this eligibility Well some of that red shirting uh some of that even co for some of the oldest guys as Dongo dumps it off down low to Cila who brought it down tied up and ripped away The other piece of this though is when youre playing at that junior college level it doesnt quite affect your NCAA eligibility like it does if youre playing D2 or D3 Threepoint miss Thats now nine straight threes that Georgia Southern has missed after hitting five of their first eight And another turnover for Georgia Tech Here comes Spud Webb No relation to Atlanta Hawk Great but hes making a name for himself Little head fake And a foul coming here Is this another one on Mustaf It is Thats two quick ones two quick ones And you see uh Moore number 12 Tyron Moore was sat on the bench with three fouls and only played seven minutes in the first half But hes made his impact early on here in the second half much like he did to start the game Dropped two threes before he got settled with those fouls You might have noticed when we looked back at that previous meeting from two years ago that Tyron Moore was playing for Georgia Southern but last year he was at UAB and then has since transferred back to Georgia Southern And by Tongo devours that shot More our second chance just off the mark And another long offensive rebound Apple White baseline Williams out of control And its Craft on Web And thats going to be goalending Cam Craft with the first points of the second half to give Georgia Tech the lead Youre going to see the effort play Dongo hanging in the air Swats Carter The athleticism the discipline to stay vertical and not foul on that play There you see thats what experience does Hes a guy thats going to be a force to reckon and rip this season in the ACC And thats really the key to Georgia Tech success Not only do Amos Moila have to produce but theyve got to be on the floor And that means defending without fouling AVon White weaving in No look feed Web corner three and around and in And that snaps a streak of nine straight or big pardon 10 straight misses from threepoint land for Georgia Southern Not certain where the breakdown came but Cila might have had to leave the paint on that one to contest the three And there we get a a traveling violation So a turnover here at the other end first Look at this pass from White Sila It gets pinned under the basket in a scramble situation He may have to get out Closest guy to the ball Wide open three Reeves got stuck in the paint as well Thats 15 turnovers now in the Yellow Jackets could be a different story here if they were able to take care of the basketball That has been the early story for Georgia Tech this year White running the offense and out of Carters hands into Webs Web taking on Reeves now Left short Sila gobbles it up Craft a threepoint try No SILA THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND and one Moila cashing in second chance points for Georgia Tech He was able to just muscle number 11 Shane and Carter under the basket And those are the 5050 balls that the winner of this game is likely to win that battle here in the last 1658 Who can get the 5050 balls The effort plays and take care of the basketball And on that possession Jackets win the war By the way thats the third foul now on Shainan Carter So both he and Moore for Georgia Southern with three fouls See what misses the in one White with some handles at his size Apple White Walled off by Craft Settles for the hook What touch just over the fingertips of Moila Impressive from Alden Apple White Did not play last time out for Georgia Southern He was ill And tonight now with seven points and seven boards Dont sell him short Hes got three assists too Guys a player Air ball there from Reeves Itll stay with Georgia Tech though Well that again to your point John just speaks to the balanced attack its been for Georgia Southern Theyve got six players with five or more points but nobody with more than eight And I think White and Apple White uh they both bring an element to their game that is going to serve them well in the Sunb Belt The physicality the athleticism they are tough matchups And the pedigree of Coach Henry coming from the NBA working with an NBA guy in Iowa State like the mayor um their head coach he he loves to find isolation situations the offensive side of the ball and attack And you can see that influence of the NBA game and his coaching style especially late in the game Dongos got to let go of three not his strength And a shot clock violation right out of bounds Either way its Georgia Southern basketball By the way before that last inbound a delay of game warning was assessed to Tyron Moore And the mayor I was referencing was Fred Hoyberg one of the greats Iowa State and a 10 plus year pro coached in the NBA and certainly a mentor to Charlie Henry as hes come up through the ranks His first college job was as a GA at Iowa State for Fred Hoyberg and of course followed him to the Bulls A head coach in the G League was Windy City and all of a sudden I dont know they changed the air condition in here Thats a lot of air balls being thrown off The wind pattern has changed Lob entry Dongo jams it Dongo having a night Hes got 13 points to go with his four rebounds and just 15 minutes to play A couple of assists from the big man Long shot wont drop These teams have been attached at the hip all night Tied again at 42 I kind of feel like who can string together three four consecutive stops and answer on the other end Nice job by Mustaf Yeah big oo on that Cila very capable of turning that one over but a good foul Sea go to the line Hes just shooting 33 from the stripe on the season Theyll have a chance to get it going uh give the Jackets a lead Were knotted up 1508 to play on Courtish Pavilion in Atlanta 8 to four a plus four advantage in the paint 62 advantage in the second half for Georgia Tech on points in the paint You know Dongos a big part of that but Georgia Southern in the first half was plus six points in the paint They had 18 points to Georgia Techs 12 So what stands out there is a concerted effort by the Jackets to get inside and pose their will on the backboard in the interior scoring and hopefully that plays out Georgia Southerns had trouble with opponents on the backboard Wy the Yellow Jackets would tell you theres not a game that they should lose the battle in the paint I dont care who the opponent is Uh they would tell you thats got to be their area You know coach datimire says he feels like he has one of the best front courts in the league if not the country A turnover in transition picked off by Moore Threeon one and contest from Lamar Washington He will force Moore to the free throw line Nice job by the Eagles on that possession Just weathering the storm making a play and theyll have a chance to earn it Hands up play Tyron Moore read the eyes much like a free safety to a quarterback and makes a play Hell go to the line while weigh and again guy that should be well rested Hes got some legs He only played seven minutes in the first half with three fouls but he did hit two triples and he ties the game again Couple of subs coming for Georgia Southern with that foul on Washington He now has three And you throw in Jaden Mustaf with two Those are the two most trusted ball handlers for Georgia Tech And I wouldnt say theyre quite in serious foul trouble but theyre nosing up against it And and against an opponent like Georgia Southern theres multiple possessions more possessions than so in a regular game because of pace of play So having the discipline to play without fouling is a premium on that Georgia Tech will have to watch their backboard fouls Kai Fle Fleming in off the bench putting together quality minutes these last few games for Georgia Tech as CIA tries to bulldoze down low A three it wont go Reeves soarses in for the board and one Kesi Reeves emerging erupting suddenly soaring through the lane Thats a big energy play for Georgia Tech Yeah hes second leading scorer for the Jackets on the season averaging 13 and a half per game shooting percentage not great this year but his ability to make timely buckets when his team needs it thats been his most valuable piece of his game and his contribution to the team early on in this season Hes really stepped up as a leader and hes making plays in clutch situations when the Jackets need it You go back to opening night against Maryland Eastern Shore he helped avoid disaster with what ended up being a gamewinning three in overtime And I believe he was one of 10 from three before he dropped that second triple the night which really clenched the win for Georgia Tech Allowed them to get out of there with the dub has given Georgia Tech a threepoint lead Dunn crossing over on Dongo Gets it over Dump go and that is wet Oh man were tied again Dongo step back creating space Dongo answers at the other end Preseason second team allac selection now with 15 points for Georgia Tech Its already a season high for Dongo White lost control of it Gets it out to Satiro and his shot An air ball Bernie lays it in But first Foul Weve got a foul coming on Bernie Thats his third The fouls now are stacking for the Eagles Thats 18 fouls See Georgia Tech slow to get out and Dunn dropped the three And then Dongo answers quickly on the other end Nice positioning Switches to the left hand A solid finish Georgia Tech up two They have to go the length of the floor Eagles picking up full court You know Dunns giving up eight inches there on Dongo and it felt like they each kind of took advantage of the mismatch Dunn hitting the three in Dongos eye and then right on the other end Dongo posts up Dunn Im not a mathematician there but Georgia wins that battle if it keeps going that way Three to two Dongo feeds it across the lane to Marshall and Payton Marshall Hes got his first basket tonight Really nice postto post passing the high low action Dongo with the hook pass on the Marshall Kept it high and Dud answers again Hes shooting over 40 from three entering tonight Three of five from distance this evening Dongo with space tries to lay it in and itll stick with Georgia Tech There is no sign of separation for either of these teams coming anytime soon Don lefty point guard You think Damon Stomires uh like Ive seen guys do that before Like look in the mirror myself Uh got a little starter in him The lefty pullup three Done with 13 points in this game Sloppy pass there from Georgia Tech Another turnover That is 17 now tonight And that one on an inbounds pass Just an air mail Dongo Done How hot is he You try again This time on the drive Hes in trouble and he turns it over Yeah Jackets dodged the pull Peyton Marshalls got to stay until his uh teammate can get through that ball screen especially against a Dunn and hes already dropped three triples You got to stay on that action And Dongo is tied up The Yellow Jackets will keep possession Where we have found some separation has been on the glass Georgia Tech is at plus 11 Reeves off the mark Theres the board for Georgia Southern but thats a number to follow Thats been the weakness for the Eagles so far this year And Apple White draws the foul Is a little out of control And is that going to be on Washington It looks like it will be And thats going to be four on Lamar Washington Oh my That is a significant development for coach Statamires His primary ball handler is going to have to head to the bench They might have an argument right there I Im not sure if he had any contact Hes looking for an instant replay Its like cant contest a foul No Done A three and Akai Fleming rises up for the rebound So Georgia Techs going to have to lean on Fleming and Mustaf to handle the ball here with Washington headed to the bench with his fourth foul Fleming elbow catch Solid gets the poor close out Covers some great ground One dribble covered about eight feet Explosion elevation Knocked it down Thats a big time shot by the freshman One of the top 60 recruits in his freshman class according to ESPN Spud Webbs got just five points tonight Your leading scoreer Bernie on the follow and he will get to the line He will have two shots when we come back Georgia Tech a threepoint lead This has been tight the whole way and we got a great finish coming up here in Midtown Atlanta Points early in the season against East Carolina 11 points is his season high in the win against Johnson C Smith And tonight its a new season high for Dun with 13 and we got 119 to play Andres Bernie misses the first free throw And hes one of those guys John we talked about it Six years of college basketball Hes at his fifth different school Hes played at the junior college level the NIA level and now here in D1 for the second time He spent a year at Jacksonville State He hits the second free throw to cut it to two And whos Georgia Tech going to have at point guard with Lamar Washington on the bench right now Kai Fleming bringing the ball up the floor Switching zone defense 32 matchup zone Double down on the paint Reeves tap in from Dongo A second look and hes got it by Dongo This is the all ACC play he has put up throughout his career And Bernie just couldnt get it done Given up size down there Had a little bit of help from Moore but hes given up inches as well Lefty Webb misses the three Tustle for the rebound All bodies all over the floor and Georgia Tech ends up with theyll stay with Georgia Tech Georgia sudden of their last four from the field Uh no field goals in the last 232 of this game So Georgia Tech maybe this is that run that creates separation We havent seen one yet Could be knocking on the door of that right now Jackets with the ball in control Chance to stretch the lead Plus four advantage right now which matches their largest lead of the night So as you mentioned they havent found separation Georgia Southern did have a double digit lead about midway through the first half but really since Georgia Tech won on a run to tighten it up weve been nip and tuck Dongo with Apple White on them CEO with five to shoot A long way from the rim Kicks out to Mustafa Hell try a three way off the mark Thats a shot clock violation against Georgia Tech Georgia Tech uh stalled a little bit let the clock go down And Georgia Southern stoic effort on the defensive side of the ball holding their ground contesting shots And Georgia Southern you know the first eight minutes of the game they shot close to 50 Since then theyre shooting below 30 Those shots have not been falling Dongo with some hands creates the steel HELL TRY AND FINISH IT AND ONE BY Dongo taking over How about that for Georgia Tech puts the foul on Dunn as well The leading scoreer for the Eagles picks up his third on that play Dongo active hands pick going the other way Substitution for the Eagles number How fluid is he in transition The body control takes the contact by Dunn and finishes Great concentration by Dongo Timely bucket Sixpoint lead for the Jackets Largest lead like you said WY in this one for the Yellow Jackets Chance now to stretch it to a threepossession game And Dongos got 20 He had just 28 points combined in the first three games he played And right now hes the difference in the game On White with an aggressive take left it short And the Yellow Jackets sensing a little bit of momentum here Eagles havent made a basket in nearly four minutes Fleming a couple of offball screens And of the shot clock again Reeves off the window No its a solid defensive unit Fleming Reeves Mustaf and then you anchor it on the interior with Dongo and Cila Thats an athletic lineup you can switch on the perimeter stay big These guys have great athleticism closeouts and if you get beat you got Dongo and CE in the paint to erase any mistakes on the outside And looks like theres going to be a challenge here on the out of bounds call Georgia Southern like you said of their last five from the field one of their last seven in a scoring drought So a challenge on the out of bounds and we will step aside Georgia Tech with their largest lead of the night Georgia Southern looking for an answer Challenging the ruling on the floor of out of bounds He shows us everything Today Go So theres a look at AJ Desai and the announcement to review The ball goes out of bounds off of Georgia Southern number 21 The challenge is successful Georgia Tech will retain their timeout They also have one challenge remaining Thats new in college basketball Coaches have an opportunity to challenge those out of balance plays And well lets take a look at what AJ Desai and his crew saw Take a look at the right ring finger of Spud Webb Reeves hits it and then Spud Webb right there And you can see a little bit of a change in the rotation of the basketball And so with the successful challenge hell be able to keep the timeout and one challenge remaining Good call by coach Dtomire and the Jackets Dongo right at midcourt Puts it on the floor Largest lead of the night for Georgia Tech Fleming a three Hes fouled and hell have three free throws Georgia Tech they havent hit a three in nearly 20 minutes of game time So thats because they relied heavily in the paint Yeah thats okay You said it But theres the inside out You command the respect of the defense Solid shooter Gets the contact Kai Fleming at the line But Georgia Tech points in the paint in the second half 182 advantage And again in the first half was all Georgia Southern in the paint 18 to 12 They had a plus six advantage And now its for the game 30 points in the paint for Georgia Tech 20 for Southern Fleming hits the second Obviously so much was made of Moila coming to Georgia Tech and so far of course hes delivered averaging a double double but Akai Fleming has made quite the impression now in four and a half games it feels like for Georgia Tech And we talked about it earlier but those minutes are going to be going up Hes played 23 tonight averaging under 18 this year And production is high Hes had averaging nine points per game in those 18 minutes per game hes playing Been huge second chance points from Shane and Carter and to Dongo The extra pass to Cila He flicks it through And that triangle action wing short corner high post and Dongo and Cela you think theyve been practicing that in the preseason individual workouts and practice They do the tap to the lob and that one was the bounce pass and it was like second nature But again Web answers trying to keep Georgia Southern in this twopossession game Webb now with eight points That was his second triple in the game Thats just three threes on the season Fleming from the corner wont drop Battle for the board Reeves goes up Dongo a third chance Maybe a fourth between his legs Takes a hard fall on his Georgia Southern basketball Crew was letting some contact go on that possession Both teams getting after it Georgia Southern in striking distance down two possessions Well be back in Atlanta ACC basketball All right The timeout trailing by six Georgia Southern And they make a run They relied heavily on a threepointer tonight And a reverse on the drive No but an offensive rebound from Kyrie pardon thats called an apple wipe Web off balance and Dongo another rebound Now one board shy of a double double He also leads the Yellow Jackets with four assists tonight Dongo has been everything for the white and gold trying to clear out the way Brunner and rebound controlled by Spud Webb against Fleming Good hands from the freshman and its Georgia Tech basketball He forces the turnover and Georgia Southern and Charlie Henry They want to review this Were going to see a challenge and I think Henry has a pretty good argument here from the angle I saw Heres our first look at it Fleming reaches in with the right Goes off his shin Oh I dont No No contact I think they got it right Charlie Henry was right there Southern I didnt see Fleming touch it Well see what AJ decide his crew along with Chase Shaw inside the Georgia Southern Huddle meanwhile And the other thing thats going to become a factor it feels like in these next 6 minutes and 18 seconds is the foul count And Im not just talking about getting in the bonus but the foul trouble both these teams are in individually Youve got Shane Carter and Tyron Moore each with three Kyrie Dunn and Andre Bernie each with three So thats four Eagles with three fouls and youve got Lamar Washington with four for Georgia Tech You see on that angle right there the right shin Yeah And doesnt look like Fleming touches it Who That is Webs hand that were seeing right Correct Yes that is Spud Webbs hand You see Fleming there reaching in a little higher up Yeah Looks like a call has been made Lets hear from AJ Des Have to review The challenge by Georgia Southern is unsuccessful Theyll be charged a timeout and they can no longer challenge So Southern down to two timeouts left now Georgia Tech with three Long way to go in this one A sixpoint margin A little over six minutes to play But Georgia Tech with the basketball and Kuisi Reeves will inbound it from in front of Georgia Southerns bench Reeves floats it Alioop No Good job of getting in the way by Spud Webb and company Apple White goes in draws contact Hell head to the line Apple White nice job getting to the paint Was the 19th turnover in the game for the Yellow Jackets Uh really one of the main reasons the Eagles have been able to hang around Alden Apple to the line Alden Appleweight transferring in from Murray State where he spent the last couple of years A 75 free throw shooter Misses his first try of the night Its the second fivepoint game Georgia Southern averaging over 90 points per game And it looked like early they were on pace to reach that mark but give Georgia Tech a lot of credit They have clamped down since about midway of the first half Mustaf probing Dongo trying to flash open Its not there Fleming with three seconds to shoot has it knocked loose and here comes Georgia Southern on the break Threeon one more to cut the lead in half Short wide penetrating LONG THREE AND APPLE WHITE DRAINS it all the way from Statesboro He let that thing fly and its down to two A 70 run for the Eagles The Eagles fans whove made the track from Statesboro theyre into this one Entire bench is up We got the defensive chant coming on strong from behind the Georgia Southern bench And we have under five minutes to play and Fleming ruled to have gone off McCab on White Now Georgia Southern doesnt have the challenge here First look at the shot from Apple White And a timeout here called by Georgia Tech with 8 seconds to shoot The Yellow Jackets trying to protect a twopoint lead The Eagles roaring back here late in Midtown Atlanta Take Take a look at this last sequence of Kai Plumbing It was ruled to have gone off Navy and White and John White didnt touch it Thats a break for Georgia Tech He did not And then well look back at the end of this one However it shakes at 618 on the clock The unsuccessful challenge Yes By coach Charlie Henry Uh so they were charged a timeout and they no longer can challenge which you know who would have known a minute and a half later you wish you had that challenge the percent you do And if we stay with that replay I think we were about to see Navians Whites eyes pop out of his skull when he saw the call 8 seconds to shoot Fleming turns it over Apple White again And an offensive rebound for the Eagles They bring it back out Twopoint game A 70 run for Georgia Southern trying to add to it Sweight Web spins andll go to the line with a chance to tie it Web a nice job getting into the teeth of the Georgia Tech defense and somehow finds a way to draw the contact on the veteran defender Reeves here crossover Took some contact right there No call and then the bottom left hand of Reeves in the back He earned that one Chance to go to the line Spud Webb who spent the last four years at Division 2 Emanuel By the way they call him Spud His name is Tvar but his grandfather called him Tater Head until he was 9 years old And finally Spud went up and said Hey Grandpa can we We didnt Im no longer Tater Head And so they settled on Spud and he he added that second D so he could distinguish him and the Atlanta Hawks spud well Spuds working because hes averaging 20 plus points per game this season Its a baller And Lamar Washington back on the floor for Georgia Tech now with four minutes to play Hes got four fouls Mustaf got more in the air Good help from Carter Dongo trying to post up and 5 seconds to shoot Bust outs got to let it go Hes not going to get it up Another shot clock violation for Georgia Tech The Yellow Jackets have not scored in over 4 minutes A onepoint game Our final timeout Weve got a finish on our way in Midtown and the Eagles are 68 on the season Both teams effectively in the bonus Next foul for Georgia Southern would put Georgia Tech at the line and a rare turnover for as sloppy as Georgia Tech has been at times That was a big mistake out of a timeout A poor pass from KD on White looking for Spud Webb Techs defense been solid again holding uh Georgia Southern 34 from the field in this one and right now theyre 30 points below their season average of 93 points Does feel like Georgia Techs been a little slower to get into their offense early in these possessions Oo nearly picked off by White Fleming lets a three go off target White the rebound Under three minutes to play White gets a step goes up CEO with the rebound Nice job by Dongo Staying vertical on that not fouling You can see the scoring drought for Jordan Take over five minutes but they still have the lead Both teams with two timeouts remaining CIAs going to have one And he hits it Moila How about that for your first career three locks up the double double on that too Give 11 points 10 boards An answer from Apple White No but right to White HELL LET IT GO And Lamar Washington the rebound as he throws it ahead for Mustaf on the tape and a blocking foul Thats going to be four on Tyron Moore Take another look at the three Cila no hesitation Corner three Ive worked on that in individual workouts Got the green light Let me drop my first college three No better timing Moila double double Well if you draw up ways to break a fiveminute scoring drought for Georgia Tech I dont think a Moila threepointer is on the list Thats the first three Georgia Tech has made since the 8minute mark in the first half It hasnt been a focus of their offense tonight but still take what the defense gives Corner three nothing but net and then Mustaf chance for big free throws to create separation Give him one Georgia Southern has been in tight games all year A onepoint road win against Florida G Coast with a threepoint win at home a week and a half ago against UNCC Asheville Yellow Jackets as well an overtime win a fivepoint loss in Athens on Friday More catch and SHOOT THREE THATS BIG AND ITS a bullseye Oh hesitation on that one Came off the curl squared the shoulders nothing but net Lead is down to two Calling for Reeves on the wing Mustaf goes right taking on Moore is PLAYING WITH FOUR FOUL AND JADEN MUSTAF What a drive Its a big possession right here Both teams have two timeouts remaining And speaking of that John time out Georgia Southern A fourpoint lead for Georgia Tech and into the Georgia Southern huddle Coach Henry is going to try and draw something up Yeah Coach Henry saw the shot clock winding down a little bit 19 to go on the shot clock Mustaf look at the finish right there But again with two timeouts remaining now just one Coach Charlie Henry coaching both sides of the ball right here What are we going to do offensively And then if we score if we miss a lot going on in that timeout huddle right now Wy I think theyve got to get something going to the basket draw the foul get to the free throw line And again if they can suck in the defense throw back behind the action and get the three Kron Williams has had the hot hand I mean Tyron Moore my bad To your point Kyrie Duns been pretty good too though from behind the arc So 19 seconds to shoot And on the flip side John Georgia Tech defensively they have put the clamps down on Georgia Southern In your mind whats led to that success defensively Just their length the communication the sense of urgency theyre playing with Its been a solid defensive effort And I think the athleticism they can switch guard to guard Uh you know the threes that Georgia Southern have hit have been usually off a turnover early offense or a ball screen where the big is late showing So you may see some ball screen action on this little roll replace and throw back behind the D for the three or if you can turn the corner get something going to the rim and draw the foul get to the line 19 seconds plenty of time to work with 108 on the game clock One timeout remains for Georgia Southern two timeouts for the Jackets And possession favors the Eagles Here we go A minute and 8 seconds left in the second half White has trouble getting it in and that is not a backourt violation as Carter collects it but NOW HE TURNS IT OVER A turnover out a timeout Georgia Tech with possession Less than a minute to go and it looks like Georgia Southern is going to try and play this straight up down by four Kick out Washington thinks about a three but he wants to kill some more time Its a great decision by Washington Lets burn another 10 seconds off the clock Five to shoot now Mustaf lets it go No And Washington cannot save it Itll be Georgia Southern basketball But now with half the time they had before that turnover and missed shot dead ball situation So they cannot run the baseline on this And only one timeout remains into spun Web Georgia Southern they need a basket Can Web give it to him He wanted the foul off the window Nearly dropped instead Its a rebound from Osilla and Georgia Tech And now a foul and frustration for Georgia Southern and Spud Webb with some words there for the official and not calling that threepoint shot foul He was lobbying for the call I might have been some contact on the on late in the play right there And that would have been the fifth on Washington if it was called What do you think there John Was that the right call I think so I mean let them play They have kind of kicked the legs out after the play was made Um by the rule book youre supposed to allow the shooter to land And I think he did land So I think it was the right call Sila hits the first free throw Cila with nine points tonight in the second half I should say There you can see the double doubles from the two bigs down low Thats the engine for Georgia Tech this year Dongo and Cila Yeah Points in the paint in the second half 22 Georgia Tech four for the Eagles Dongo and Cila big part of that fivepoint game Southern needs a bucket quick White takes the three and were not done yet Navon White cuts it to two Georgia Techs got to get the basketball in Coach Statamire wants a timeout Thats a big shot from Navy on White Plenty of time no time no score One timeout remaining for each team 95 on the shot clock And the Eagles ball movement number five White knocks it down Its kind of similar to that shot Kesi Reeves had a couple of weeks ago John You look at Whites numbers tonight entering that shot He was two for 12 one for five from three but he hits a big one to keep the Eagles in this game That was his first field goal in the second half Wow The big one Stepping up So if youre Georgia Tech obviously you want to get it into one of your better free throw shooters Absolutely You know substitution pattern Well see who comes out for the five Georgia Tech players on the floor But again the team that has struggled in the free throw line early this season in the low 60 percentile there Craft thats a great substitution but even sitting on the bench a little bit stiff and Craft a great shooter has not taken a free throw this season The key right now is youve got to step to meet your pass Youve got to come to the ball Well see if Georgia Southern guards the ball or stays off it Theyre going to go Carter heavily pressuring the freshman inbounder After a make he can run the baseline Gets it into Kesi Reeves Hes tied up and a foul called with just under 7 seconds left Its going to be on Spud Web and itll be one and one for Kesi Reeves 75 free throw shooter coming into the game 12 of 16 from the free throw line And if you know Coach Stoddardmire you got to love it You got your senior hes made clutch baskets this season Hes a 75 free throw shooter to avoid turning it over Right now a chance to make it a twopossession game with your senior leader on your home floor No pressure Quy No pressure No pressure The Georgia Tech graduate at the line trying to ice it And he misses the front end 5 seconds Southern may have a chance for the win here WHITE TRYING TO TIE IT AS THE CLOCK EXPIRES The Eagles do NOT GET A SHOT OFF Georgia Tech wins
