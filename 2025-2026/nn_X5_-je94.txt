ical contest played to their advantage They outrebounded Stanford in that game by 12 And I think thats going to be a story line here in this game An area where Cal really struggled in their last performance Opening tip controlled by the Irish Cal going with a gold navy blue for Notre Dame cheering And this late start from the West Coast I should point out that with the 47 points in the win that was two fewer than the Notre Dame football team scored at Stanford late in November across the key and it rolls in for the freshman Jaylen Harrelson No surprise to see coach Rusberry go to his freshman Harelson there in the post He has a big size advantage A little surprised to see Mark Madson not look to double team him on that first play Here is John Camden from deep Missed a three He had a rough night against Louisville Lost out of bounds It stays at this end with Cal But the Golden Bears need John Camden to make shots He just was 1 for seven from three 1 for 10 overall against Louisville on Tuesday Yeah I mean Ken their stretch starting the season 12 and two was one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country both in terms of total makes and percentage as Day Ames knocks down the three from the corner and thats a good sign for a Cal team that has really struggled with slow starts throughout the year 45 on his threes and Ames gives Cal the early lead almost a minute in cheering Starting five from Micah Shrewsberry in Notre Dame across the bottom and again playing without Marcus Burton Theres star point guard as a three off the mark from Braden Shrewsbury the son of the head coach and Cal with the rebound Yeah Mark Matson making a change there Double teaming Harelson as soon as he got the ball in the post Unfortunately couldnt knock the three down Three rims out for Day Ames and the rebound pulled down by Notre Dame Irish have won two straight road games It spins out Shrewsbury having a tough road trip He was scoreless at Stanford and 0 for two to start his night Justin Pippen and one I think one of the big strengths for for Mark Madsons team is Day Ames playing alongside Justin Pippen Both of them have the ability to beat their defender off the dribble and draw contact Pippen does that so many times throughout the course of the game especially in transition putting his head down trying to create the contact And one for Justin Pippen the LA native the Michigan transfer And the son of the Hall of Famer Scotty Pippen comes up empty at the free throw line And saving it but right to Pippen was Logan Ims John Camden short on the three And the long rebound Braden Shrewsbury for the Irish Thats two plays in which the Irish had an easy rebound only for it to go off of their hands out of bounds or throw it directly for the turnover The Irish have a tendency to make these games ugly but early on having some struggles closing the rebounds Well so much more Austin on the plate of Jaylen Harelson in the absence of Marcus Burton Yeah in three of those five games he went for 20 points or more He is seeing he is now the primary focus of opposing teams defenses and he is having the ups and downs that a freshman in that situation you might expect Doing very well offensively at times struggling with shot selection uh and turnovers as well And Harelson part of this heralded freshman class for Micah Shrewsbury ESPNs national recruiting director Paul Biancardi had Notre Dames class ranked ninth of the incoming freshman class into college basketball this year The Fighting Irish had three top 100 prospects including Haroldson the McDonalds AllAmerican And its funny you know as you bring in those freshman so much of that is still dependent on Howard your leading scorer that now you are without and you have to shift a little bit and find other ways uh to be effective offensively And its going to be a little bit of a process Offensive rebound Carson Tout Here is Harelson driving baseline Powers his way up inside and Jaylen Harelson is all four for Notre Dame Yeah and thats just a big size advantage there against Bell Bell only 195 lbs and Harelson just able to put him under the basket for an easy two Here is Pippen Shot clock down to 10 Day Ames way out top Step back from Ames Way off on the three and Jaylen Harrelson grabs the rebound for the Fighting Irish Here is Harelson trying to back his way in Logan starting for the second straight game after coming off the bench each of the first 13 for Notre Dame as a three and the first career three for Jaylen Harrelson who was 0 for 10 from deep prior to that bank Yeah I really like the patience of the Irish on that possession They didnt force things when they were being double team But you said it with Harelson We watched shoot around today Mark Madson told his team close short on Harelson Dont let him beat you off the dribble Make him make that shot And thats exactly what he does from the corner Pippen launching a three That one rattles out on the rebound grabbed by Notre Dame And Garrett Sundra steps into a three Sundra in and out and the rebound Days pushing for Cal Syracuse transfer Chris Bell Here is Lee Dort inside Had it stripped Got it back Off balance Left it short Lee Dort one more time Had it poked away Got it again Still plenty of time on the shot clock Dort muscles back up Another miss Another offensive rebound If at first YOU DONT SUCCEED TRY TRY AGAIN cheering I think Dor had the ball in his hands for 20 seconds in that possession I actually think he got tired and considered kicking it out to the perimeter but he does not get the ball in the offense organically Its like they have to intentionally remind themselves to get it to Dor but when they do good things normally happen Jaylen Harelson again a three He has all 10 for Notre Dame How about that I mean as good as he has played offensively the threepoint shot has kind of been the question mark for him but he gets one to go the confidence and steps up and hits another 0 for 10 prior to tonight Hes made two in the first five minutes John Camden too strong and the rebound batted free and Braden Shrewsbury tracks it down for Notre Dame Carson Tal the Brad transfer from Northern Arizona who led the country in rebounding last year as Braden Shrewberry nails a three and its Notre Dame by six Mark Madson unhappy on the sideline Substitute coming in likely for Bell We mentioned the shoot around run Shrewberry off the threepoint line anytime he touch it make him a a driver and Bell a little late on that close out and Shrewsbury needs no time Here is Bell on the drive Bell to the bucket and hes hammered and Chris Bell will go to the line The foul is on Jaylen Harelson but the Fighting Irish only 47 points on Tuesday Going to help but now that you can hit down the threepoint shot you have to get up and on to Harelson That quick first step hes going to get by anybody I dont think it was really a question of if that was something he could add to his game just a matter at what point he would start having confidence from behind the line One more for Chris Bell a 90 foul shooter as Notre Dame on an 112 run until that free throw made by Bell But Harelson the McDonalds AllAmerican and hell give 13 points He led Notre Dame in scoring at Stanford on Tuesday But the most impressive number to me Austin was the nine fouls drawn by Jaylen Harrelson in that game Yeah I I think anytime you see freshman at his size that that look for contact is a really good sign So many players avoid it they look to drive in kick The more you can get that defender on their heels get them up in the air get to the foul line cheering you have so many different ways in which you can score Stepping through the double team Sir Mohamd finds on the baseline the jumper rattles in for Brady Kaylor another one of the talented freshman for Notre Dame Yeah I mean hes obviously got a lot of weight to put on his frame but you can see the ball handling ability the confidence at the threepoint line that he is going to be play a big role for this team this year but certainly into the future Shot clock down to seven Deep three by Justin Pippen Too strong and the long rebound Logan IS for Notre Dame And that was just an empty possession for Cal I mean that ball didnt get inside the threepoint line It was just passed along the perimeter and then you settle for a shot 5 ft behind the threepoint line I think thats a little bit of what they did against Louisville They need to get into attack mode get the ball in the paint Good ball movement by the Irish AND AN OPEN THREE FOR Brady Kaylor I I mean thats just scouting report right I mean not only is it scouting report but he just shot hit a shot on the previous possession Youve got to know who youre guarding Make sure that you run them off of there And now at this end of the floor if youre pipping if youre aims you got to find a way to get into the paint make that defense shift Four threes for Notre Dame already Day Ames on the drive Justin Pippen the floater in the key Too strong and the rebound inside Ripped down by Kebai for the Irish Now the shot didnt fall for Pippen but thats thats the look that you want You know her preferably you do it earlier in the possession The layup missed by Braden Shrewberry Point blank Now Shrewsberrys missed two shots and Ive actually been a little critical of him of settling for threepointers too often Hes done a great job attacking the paint but not able to finish And a foul committed by Brady Kaylor of Notre Dame in the first whistle against the freshman But the ball movement by the Irish theyre playing unselfish ball Yeah I mean they look like a completely different team from the one that we saw playing against Stanford Not settling for bad shots Every time a defender comes they make the extra pass Jeremiah Wilkinson at 36 for California in that game And that score was tied at 61 with 5 and a half minutes left in regulation in the final after four overtimes 112 110 Notre Dame trip as Days went sprawling to the deck driving into the key Im not sure what the message was from Mark Matson at that time out but really looked like a different possession from them again attacking getting into the paint And I think Day Ames and Justin Pippen are as good as anyone in the ACC at creating their own shot They just have to make it a point of emphasis to attack and not settle just passing the ball along the perimeter Second foul on Brady Kaylor Thats the fourth on the Fighting Irish Day Ames Cals made just one of eight from three to start the game inside Milos Elish The kick and a corner three is way short from Nolan Dorsy and its out of bounds to Notre Dame And and again thats thats two possessions in which Cal has had really good offense I like having Milos Elich set that high screen roll hard to the basket Hes not a super confident offensive player looking for his own shot but even if you get the ball in the middle collapse the defense and kick it out Now its a good look Dorsy just has to step into that shot with a lot more confidence Cal just one for their last 10 from the floor Notre Dame has opened up a ninepoint lead and shot clock at 10 Steel Milos Elich out top The big men go oneonone in a slam by Milos El transfer from Lyola of Maryland How about Elich I just get finished saying he doesnt have a lot of confidence catching the ball in the pick and roll And here he gets the steal in transition and throws it down 610 in the open floor Maybe thats it Maybe hes more comfortable in the open court He needs to bring it up the floor Twin brother playing at Sam Houston Velco Elich has a three missed in the corner by Garrett Sundra Cal runs it down The freshman Simmitri Carr TT Carr from deep way off of the three I mean the threes just its so frustrating for a team that has had so much success from behind the ark virtually all season Now here a full game and half of the first half in which they are struggling and carrying over defensively I mean thats just way too easy for Serta getting both feet into the paint and a little bit of a floater No weak side help from Cal You cant let your struggles at the offensive end carry over to what youre doing at the defensive end First points for Serta But you mentioned the struggles that Cal has in this confident shooting team Theyre 25th in the country in threepoint percentage on the season As a club theyre 39 outside the arc And the corner jumper Day Ames Well thats the luxury that Madson has in a guy like Ames when you are struggling when youre not getting the offense and shots that youre looking for he is a guy that can create his own That was a tough one falling away on the baseline Cole Sera launching from deep a three Serta was one of the guys at shoot around One of the walkons had a number five practice jersey on and the whole team practiced running him off of the threepoint line That is the shot Madson did not want to see Irish have made eight of their last 11 and their largest lead with 908 left in the half A foul on Notre Dame Mark Madson his third season as the Cal head coach former NBA champion nine years in the NBA played with the Lakers the Timberwolves four years at Utah Valley now year three in Berkeley Yeah I played against him for nine years in the NBA and he was an overachiever He was a guy that brought his best every single night I think lots of times you see the personalities of players carry over into their coaching style And certainly that is the case with him And again at shootaround like the speech that he gave to his team before you know at the end of shoot around he had me ready to run through a brick wall had me ready to play again Mark is certainly one of the best guys in basketball John Camden step back on a three too strong Milos El trying to keep it alive but ripped down by Mark Zachary the fourth playing in just his second game with Notre Dame basketball as he played 10 games for Marcus Freeman in Notre Dame football this season made three starts as a true freshman defensive back and with the injury to Marcus Burton as a reverse laying crawls in for Mark Zachary the fourth Its not very often that you have someone play power four football and basketball in the same season I mean thats got to be an incredibly short list of players to accomplish that and the plan wasnt for him to play basketball at Notre Dame and one Milos Elish going inside for Cal but just finish the story on Zachary He played AAOU with Braden Shrewberry and Cole Serta and or rather with Logan IMS and Shrewberry So Micah Shrewsbury knew about him and then when Marcus Burton went down he knew he needed some help in the back court went and brought him off the football team and Marcus Freeman gave him the goahhead I mean just an incredible story something that you definitely dont see very often but he has given meaningful minutes here in his second game And on the flip side Elich at the free throw line I I think that is going to be a story line for Cal this season you know Reus Petritus out with an injury potentially for an extended period of time Um they have great guard play wing play but what are they going to do in that front court Elichs minutes have really been up and down Its good to see him having a good start to this game Probably the best he has looked in a Cal uniform so far this season And we mentioned earlier the offense not really going through Dort often although he is very effective when he gets it This could potentially give them another option Coerta from deep and that three is off the mark Lee Dort pulls it down Here comes Cal Shot clock inside 10 Chris Bell drives the kick open Nolan Dorsy short on the three and the rebound Garrett Sundra for the Irish And thats tough now Now youre starting to get the looks that you want and you cant get them to fall Bell really assertive there Getting both feet in the paint Did exactly what you want to do Just a little bit hesitant on the shot from the perimeter Corner three short Certa chases down the miss Gets it inside It spins out but a foul on the shot by Jaylen Harrelson and hell go to the foul line 2516 Notre Dame Theyre looking for their third straight road win Not only do you do you prepare to play without him but do you change your style One of the best point guards in the country tomorrow 14th ranked Alabama hosting Kentucky Were finally back to full health for Mark Pope as Jaylen Harelson misses both in the rebound grabbed by Cal Our coverage begins noon Eastern from Coleman Coliseum on ESPN and ESPN app Finally Mark Pope getting his full aopment of players Chris Bell off a screen missing a three and the rebound Garrett Sundra for Notre Dame Yeah I mean at some point you know the threes that fell all night earlier in the season do you change your styling right Do you continue to attack At some point these struggles are really costing them Rims out for Braden Shrewberry Cal with a rebound but the Golden Bears are only one for 13 from three Yeah I mean youre youre youre obviously not going to win games shooting at that type of a percentage but at what point do you slow the percentage of total shots that you take from behind the arc and look to find other ways to score It is not as though the Bears dont have other options You know we mentioned at the top uh TT Carr Justin Pippen uh Day Ames all of those guys have the ability to put it on the floor but what you are seeing here tonight is kind of a mirror of how they struggled against Louisville in their last game a game that they really werent in And obviously you continue to work on the threepoint shooting You dont want to completely go away from your strengths but there is a certain point where you have to look to attack the rim more when those shots dont fall Cal in the bonus now the seventh team foul And Justin Pippen one more free throw coming And this will also help Cal The Golden Bears are 11th in the country 78 collectively As soon as I talk about how well they shoot at the foul line you get a miss cheering spin Jaylen Harelson kept his feet there on the baseline Nearly stumbled over Way out top is Harelson Step back launching a three That ones off the mark And Justin Pippen pushes for Cal Pippen looks to attack to the basket Well defended by Harelson creating a turnover and back the other way Braden Shrewsbury for Notre Dame That really is a great job by Harelson He bricked the threepointer off of the backboard but didnt hang his head Gets back in transition and comes up with the big stop Great maturity by the young player on the drive and the floater on the baseline No from Shrewberry Missed the follow Lee Dort the rebound I mean hes had three really strong moves at the rim Unable to finish all of them He gets the offensive rebound cant make the PUT BACK PIPPEN FALLING DOWN THREE We have said it Two guys that that can get them shots at any time Pippen and Ames It has been ugly offensively for the Bears but they have found a way to make it just a fivepoint deficit Notre Dame just three of their LAST 10 BY HIMSELF UNDERNEATH Carson Tout Rams it home Yeah I I think that Cal is holding their double teams in pick and rolls a little long You know as soon as that offensive player comes off the screen and you double team they take a dribble towards half court Get out of there You Youre not going to get a steal in that situation Youre really stringing out the double teams You got to get back Fumbled out of bounds Lee Dort tried to make a play before he had it and Cal with a giveaway Yeah its its its not been a night for Cal in which they have gotten easy looks at the basket and that would have been one for Dort first Wow Took them 15 and 12 minutes just about And now theyll pick up full court Stanford had some success by speeding up Notre Dame when they got down by 16 on Tuesday got into a little bit of a fullcourt press that caused some turnovers and made Notre Dame uncomfortable and Cal needing to do something to disrupt the Irish Yeah we weve talked about Harelson the freshman being you know kind of the object of the the focal point of the opposing teams defenses And to your point he has struggled with turnovers but Cal hasnt really put him in positions uh for that to be exploited Hes averaging seven turnovers of the last two games First foul on Milos El ei Harelson had eight turnovers in that game at Maples Pavilion on Tuesday cheering Pass deflected Run down near midcourt by Logan IS Five on the shot clock I forced out I into the key I swatted by Milos Elite Jacquel comes away with it Chris Bell attacks bunked and a foul and Cal the bonus will shoot free throws on the other side of a timeout When youre struggling from the floor maybe this can get you going Notre Dame by seven Late half number one ACC play in Berkeley I see Lets welcome all to todays free basketball basketball Look at this play Earlier we talked about in the pick and roll Dort comes out way too far in the pick and roll defensively He needs to show make the offensive player one take one dribble to half court and then get back to his net man day aim stays for a second He has to get back to the shooter and it leaves Tout wide open All of that because Dort spent too much time in that pick and roll Its a quick show Make him take a dribble towards half court and get back Bad rotations for Cal lead to a wideopen dunk for Irish and Tal 354 left first half Notre Dame by seven The Irish have led by as many as 12 And Chris Bell a one and one Hes two for two at the line tonight And one more coming for Chris Bell Chapel Hill at the Dean Dome Number 16 North Carolina takes on Stanford followed by number 22 Baylor and Ames against 10th ranked Iowa State And we close out the triple header with number five LSU and number 12 Vanderbilt in Nashville Great womens triple header for you on Sunday on ESPN and ESPN Carson Tout and one and thats really the same play that we just highlighted You know Cal is just sticking with those pick and rolls And I if if you are going to pick and roll you have either got to come really help from that weak side or youve got to make the rotation quicker Cal the second possession in a row doesnt get there You see Illich saying kind of where is the help and just another breakdown defensively from the Bears You combine that with the struggles theyre having from behind the threepoint line as Tout gosh hits the top of the square on the free throw Uh but I mean this is a cow team very fortunate to be down only seven points Second foul and Milos Elich TT Carr turns the corner The kick to Chris Bell Five on the shot clock Bell tough turnaround jumper I like that shot by Bell at 67 Hes not a big guy Only 195 lbs but hes lanky Hes got size on Shrewberry Just kind of does a a post up in the lane Shoots over the top of him Tough leaner Sir Mohamd didnt leave himself any room on the baseline trying to lean in for it And a ball was kicked and will stay at this end and 20 on the shot clock for Notre Dame Yes Sir Mohamads playing time you know his minutes have really been up and down He scored 20 points in a game just three games ago the last two games only playing about 5 minutes per maybe forced something there Notre Dame fortunate to get the ball back TT Carr called for a foul off the ball and the first against the freshman for Cal Thats team foul number five against the Golden Bears was just inside three minutes to go until halftime cheering Notre Dame looking for their first 20 ACC start since the 2017 cheering 2018 season Cal trying to bounce back from a disheartening loss in their ACC opener here on Tuesday against 16th ranked Louisville as the runner wouldnt go but a foul will put Sir Mohamd at the line for Notre Dame And it has not been the story line of this game You know the struggles for Notre Dame offensively It looked like a completely different team uh than the one that played against Stanford But in that game in their struggles youre asking kind of who else can help this team offensively And you have seen Mohamd at times be very effective You know whether its hitting threepoint shot putting his head down and getting to the rim And you can see two plays in a row excuse me three plays in a row in which he has been very assertive getting to the rim Mohamd is a 50 foul shooter Notre Dame struggling limit opportunities to the line tonight And Mark Madson frustrated Lee Dor just saddled with his second foul forcing Mark Matson to go deeper into his bench than he probably wants to And the rebound batted free and Mohamd got it Deep three Colert on the reload Hits the top of the backboard and John Camden pulls it down for Cal But in for the first time is Montes Coochinis transfer from FAU the sophomore from Lithuanian whos played sparingly for Cal this year John Camden left open hit the side of the backboard on a three Just a great drive and kick by Days Ames to Camden whos one of your best threepoint shooters I mean you cant draw up a better play than that Just the struggles continue for the Bears from behind the ark Foul called on Cal off the ball and its on Chris Bell and that will put Notre Dame at the line for a one and one Braden Shrewsbury will shoot at 71 For the son of the head coach cheering and one more coming for Shrewberry you can only score points at the line First made free throw for Notre Dame And Shrewberry hits them both Hes got five Jaylen Harrelson leads all scorers in the game Hes got 10 for Notre Dame Six each for Justin Pippen and Chris Bell to lead Cal Here is Bell and a foul on Shrewdberry and a one and one for Chris Bell And they are talking back and forth I like Bell utilizing that size Hes got it And Im not convinced that that was the spot on the floor you want to take that shot from If you can get a little bit deeper in the post I like the matchup Um I dont think that Cal is getting enough out of their high pick and rolls Um the Irish are looking to kind of go to a hard show And when you do that youve got four on three somewhere else on the court You know look to make that quick pass You get a back door cut The spacing a little bit better Free throw rattles out for Bell Second foul on Braden Shrewberry And Notre Dame with the ball up seven Logan I rims out a three Harelson couldnt control the follow and Cal clears it TT Carr Day Ames from the corner Montas coaches on the weak side Grabs an offensive rebound and he bangs into Carson Town Coachinis had his shot blocked and Tal pulls it down and screams an elation I mean Coachin has just made up his mind that he was going to take a shot there He was he lost his balance He lost the ball a couple of times Thats where you got to kick it out and make sure you get a better look cheering Jaylen Harelson weaves his way into the key spins out and the rebound tipped out of bounds by Carson Tout It belongs to Cal with 61 seconds left in the half Yeah I mean Harelson missed that shot and he missed another post up a couple of possessions ago but you can just see the size that he plays with his ability to back down defenders Uh you know unfortunately he couldnt get those to fall but that is a unique skill set that is going to require him to be double teamed Notre Dame defensively Austin theyve had to adjust in the absence of Marcus Burton how theyre playing They play a different style but theyre seem to be so locked in defensively They were phenomenal at Stanford They held the Cardinal the other night to 23 shooting from the floor Cal is just under 30 Defensively what are they doing so well Yeah I mean I think when we talked to Micah Shrewsbury he acknowledged you know listen offensively this could potentially be a little bit of a struggle for us We are going to take our time and figure it out but weve got to do it on the defensive end being more aggressive as you see them come up with a turnover here But when in that loss to IU Fort Wayne they did not bring it defensively And I think for him it was a sign of if we play defense at the level we need to we can still win If we dont we can lose Those practices were not fun when they came back Christmas after losing to Purdue Fort Wayne And a foul will get Cole Serta to the line for the Irish and now technicals have been handed out and the teams need to be separated as you see Michael Shrewberry come out onto the floor and same with Mark Madson to make sure nothing escalates here with 14 seconds left in the half the referee He sort of kind of sold that B It was Elich as Serta was on the ground Elich kind of stood over him Looked like he gave him a little nudge Yeah Not necessarily in an aggressive manner but he easily could have just stepped back here I mean Serta was kind of standing up previous dead ball contact technical foul Theres nothing extra here I think its a a Cal team thats a little frustrated with the way that they are playing So with 14 seconds to go it appears a technical was handed out and the call on the floor was a common foul on TT Carr out front kind of reaching going to the line for a one and one And thats the last guy you want to foul As Cole Serta has made the most free throws in the country without a miss this year Hes 27 for 27 Its under an official review here with 14 seconds left in the half You said they did call a technical The technical I saw a technical was called Adam Floor one of the three officials working with Tommy Morrisy and Rick Crawford tonight And I did see him give the the whacking of the tea cheering There was nothing extracurricular after the play Notre Dame will shoot one and one So they have there was no technical actually They took it off Yeah I I agree with that I did not see a whole lot there I mean Serta had an awkward fall after the contact on the perimeter Elich kind of was standing where he was as sort of fell Sort of went to kind of stand up under Elich I think its a great call by the officials I I dont think that there was anything there And also good job by both benches to understand the rules because if you lead the bench youre automatically gone And everybody stayed on the cow bench right near the play Nobody left the Notre Dame bench except for the coaches who are allowed to come out to help police the situation with both Mark Matson and Michael Shrewberry doing that So hes 27 for 27 at the line this year The most made free throws without a miss in the country I did it again You did Not only did you say over two times once wasnt ENOUGH HAVE YOU DOUBLE JINXED HIM Day Ames TT Carr left open three and that was a huge shot for Cal to close out the half as Notre Dame controlling play but its a fourpoint game Thanks field all 10 of those points came in the first 10 minutes of that half He went 0 for three from that point You mentioned the struggles both teams have had from the threepoint line Certainly a story line as well Both teams took great care of the basketball only three A combined three turnovers in the first half You dont see that very often Cal committing among the fewest turnovers per game in the country as Cal attacks goes inside and Lee Dort lays it in Yeah and weve mentioned this a couple of times He just doesnt seem to get the ball in the normal flow of the offense Not surprising that coach Matson calls a play for him to start the second half and he delivers The layin miss but a foul will get Jaylen Harrelson to the line for Notre Dame But you look at the numbers in the first half Austin Cal shot 17 threepointers in the first half They only shot 11 twopoint field goals Yeah it its its its hard Again we they had so much success at the beginning of the year 12 and two on the season and the threes were constantly falling They continued to go to that at the offensive end So when you get to a point where you cant make shots sometimes its hard to identify what differently you are going to do at the offensive end and it has been a struggle I think that they did a better job Bell getting into the paint Day Ames getting into the paint and getting other looks and those are the adjustments that you have to make when the shots arent falling Second foul on Cals Chris Bell and Milo Elich an early appearance here in the second half One out of two for Harelson leads all scorers in a game with 11 for Notre Dame Day Ames has it stripped by Logan Ims will stay at this end to Cal Ball and Jaylen Harrelson motioning to their bench They should challenge this as the coaching staff for Micah Shrewberry looking at their iPad there to see if they should challenge Thats a tough one you know especially because it was not called on the floor to potentially waste the ability to have a replay later in the game Make a wise decision not to challenge it Cal keeps it alive Justin Pippen with the tips Pippen deep three trying to tie the game Milos elites the offensive rebound Day Ames AMES FROM THE WING TIES THE GAME WITH A THREE And already that is a different type of look than they were getting in the first half The first half it was a swing along the perimeter for 25 seconds and hoist up a contested three That was Pippen getting into the paint shifting the defense kicking it to Ames in rhythm Great finish Great play by them as a team Cal foul but the Golden Bears have pulled even The first time they have tied it since it was 77 And we we talked about it but you had a a five a sevenpoint lead with a chance to make it nine at the free throw line going into the half You missed the front end of the one and one You give up a three Instead of it being a ninepoint lead its four That was a huge break there for Cal the way they finished Braden Shrewsbury a three for Notre Dame Yeah he has he is way too good of a shooter to continue his struggles from the threepoint line And Cal cant continue to test that leaving Shrewsbury that open He is a very good threepoint shooter at 45 Chris Bell rims out a three and a good box out by Carson Tout for the Irish Boy last years game that went four overtimes had 14 lead changes 17 ties Notre Dame leading by as many as 12 in the first half of this one slipping to the bucket An easy slam Carson Tout again off that feed and Cal losing tout Yeah I mean if you are going to show that long in a high pick and roll you have got to completely uh come across from the weak side and help I I think youve got to make it a quicker show Get back to your man But either way it is just allowed Notre Dame to get three wide open layups Justin Pippen three applause Well the threepoint shots that didnt fall for three consecutive halves for the Bears are finally starting to fall Two for five from deep to start the second half Crossover Jaylen Harlson gets it the bucket Rattles in for Harelson And thats a big bucket for him because he has gotten the shots that he wants but not been able to get the finishes We mentioned him playing oneonone in that low post If he can get a couple of those to fall it could force Mark Madson to double team him when he gets it in the paint Step back by Dayday Aims for Cal A different team right I mean you could just see the energy that they are playing with Everything now is attacking Everything is getting at the rim as opposed to along the perimeter Step back by Braden Shrewberry and the rebound Lee Dort boxing out for Callen Carson Tout is down slow to get up Justin Pippen drives Double clutches and a foul on Garrett Sundra of Notre Dame Well send Pippen to the line but Carson Tout is claiming he got elbowed in the face and he wants the officiating crew to review it I mean I I understand you know frustrated that you got hit and you didnt get the call and hey hes going to get the officials to take a look at it And this is not a challenge from Notre Dame This is an initiated review by the officials after the conversation there with Carson Tout where he feels he got elbowed by Dort It didnt look like anything intentional or swung right the officials looking at it and they have informed us that it did not meet the criteria for a call of flagrant one against Cal And again that was a official initiated review not a challenge by Notre Dame So it does not cost them a timeout They still have their challenge but no call warranted on that play And we will resume action with Cal at the other end of the floor So let me ask you this What triggers the automatic review because it was a hit to the face Thats if if the referees music determine that its something that should be looked at which they clearly did Yeah But none of them called a foul in that moment No but it was brought to their attention It was brought to their attention so they can go and look at it Okay And I I dont think Tout saw it coming right And I think it probably to him felt like there was a level of it being intentional but in the review you can clearly say that it was not uh it was just Dort going for a defensive rebound I think thats the right call and I I think in film its obvious So the call on the floor was the common foul on Garrett Sundra of Notre Dame the second There was no flagrant foul on the previous play Theres the explanation from Tommy Morrisy and Braden Shrewberry and the Irish coming back out on the floor Carson Tout right there who felt that there should have been a call against him He brought it to the officiating crews attention And then Micah Shrewberry getting the explanation Same with Mark Matson at the other end and free throws for Cal after the common foul on Garrett Sundra Both teams shooting it well to start the second half They have picked it up Neither team shot it great in the first half Notre Dame 40 in the first half Theyre three for four from the floor in the second half Cal 32 from the field in the first half and theyre four for seven to start half number two I think the biggest thing that we I see def offensively for Cal as Pippen knocks down the first free throw is the ball movement right They dont seem like they are just standing and holding the basketball in the presence of of the Irishs pressure Theyre handling it much better getting it to the middle of the floor Theyre getting it opposite They are shifting that defense Something that you really didnt see him do in the first half at all One thing they did get to during the timeout is they corrected a foul call earlier in the half which they charged to Chris Bell is getting free for three Braden Shrewberry again you could just see Mark Matson so unhappy with Camden on that close out He kind of ran right by him and a shooter in Shrewberry you know hes going to go with the pump fake you have to stay down and run him off of the line Day Ames drives and finishes Fakes it in And thats just way too easy Ames just put his head down went straight to his left and virtually a straight line drive Got to find a way at the point of attack to make the defender go sideways You cant let him get a straight line drive Here is Shrewberry trying to get free But earlier in the half a foul was called on Chris Bell They changed it He now has one Lee Dort playing with three fouls for Cal Logan Ims missing from deep And there is Dort on the glass to pull it down for Cal Yeah And the Irish on that play didnt get the ball below the free throw line extended That was just passed along the perimeter and then a shot by as you mentioned a good five feet behind the threepoint line Complete empty possession for the Irish Cal looking for their first lead since it was 54 and Day Ames missed terribly in the rebound grab by Notre Dame I dont know if that was a heat check after his drive on the last play but that was nowhere close Lost out of bounds by the Irish as Garrett Sundra couldnt handle the pass Turn over to Cal 4241 Notre Dame in the lead and Lee Dord will sit with the three fouls as Milos Elites coming back for Cal Elos only averages 18 points on the season Hes got five already been very effective especially in that high pick and roll John Camden is scoreless for Cal tonight A guy they need to fill it up Elich in the lane and a push and the first foul on Kebai of Notre Dame Yeah but I just like that offensively you know even if Elich is a little uncomfortable getting that ball in the paint right It just creates an awareness for the defense that they have to kind of take a step towards him right A natural instinct So now yeah now you can swing the ball if youre not comfortable scoring but anytime you can get that movement inside outside its going to shift the defense enough that your looks on the perimeter are incrementally better PIPPEN LAUNCHING THREE FOR JUSTIN Pippen and Cal takes the lead cheering Their first since about two minutes into the game 14 for Justin Pippen 10 on the timer Jaylen Harlson forced out Brady Kaylor moving in Harrelson left open Missed the three Offensive rebound lost by Jai A foul on Cal First on Dayday Ames Yeah I mean again it just looks like a completely different Cal team You see here Day Ames coming off of the high pick and roll Hes double team He throws it back to Pippen Gets the wideopen look Notre Dame a bad job closing out to the shooter and offensively And now an offensive foul Justin Pippen got cleared out by Kebach Jai And the second foul on Ji and Mark Madson wanting a review Well I mean you just get the sense that this is a game the the momentum is completely changed in favor of Cal You look at that screen and thats a good call I mean you cannot step into it that way As of now it doesnt appear they are going to review that Yeah I mean I dont I dont think that there was anything more other than a moving screen I I think its you know the right call by the officials but you just get a sense for Notre Dame Theyre only down two Obviously no reason to panic but you get the sense that the the momentum is clearly shifting in Cals direction It may have flipped that late three before halftime by the freshman TT Carr of Cal Here is Carr Chris Bell moves in in the lane Bell eight for cheering Chris Bell applause and the largest lead of the night for Cal And it its more its its kind of a demeanor thing right Its its a mindset that you are seeing completely different from the one that Cal started the game with Deflected by Justin Pippen stays with Notre Dame as Sir Mohamd coming back for the Irish and Jaylen Harrelson going out He got off to a hot start Yeah Did you see Cal adjust defensively Well they didnt panic right Im surprised that we havent seen them go to a little bit of a double team I think Mark Matson sticking with the game plan guarding him oneonone and making other guys making him beat you and he has certainly had his struggles But you know this is the point in the game where you miss Marcus Howard excuse me Marcus Burton You know he is the guy that in this moment where things start going sideways you rely on your veteran to make sure that you get good looks And this is something that Shrewsberrys team is going to have to identify in this moment Who do we go to And Marcus Burton a careerhigh 43 in the win against Cal last year And going inside Sir Muhammad for the Irish You played against his dad Nazi Mohamd Yeah he was a great role player for a long time in the NBA Very effective player 18 years in the NBA Was it 18 Wow With eight teams played at Kentucky as a foul called against Notre Dame Strong and strong in the post If you were out of position Odds were not going in your favor against Nazi Third on Brady Kaylor Twopoint Cal lead inside 12 12 minutes to go with Austin Croer and our ESPN crew ACC basketball from Berkeley in a twopoint lead Cal looking to gain a split here at home to start conference play while Notre Dame inserts their first 20 ACC start in eight years Heres Milos Elich down low Spins Elich just got it off before the shot clock and the rebound Logan IMS for Notre Dame cheering I who did a phenomenal job defensively along with Braden Shrewberry against Stanford and they slowed down one of the top scorers in the country Ibuka Okori But A Cororey went nuts tonight for Stanford as they knocked off number 16 Louisville who won big here at Cal on Tuesday Out of bounds last touch by California It belongs to Notre Dame Four on the shot clock Tight game Twopoint lead Cal and Notre Dame leading scoreer Yeah I think Caleb Wilson is the one thats you know so impressive to me I think Boozer came in with incredibly high expectations and he has certainly met them Chris Bell launching on the reload three and Elich was knocked down on the other side of the floor Four on five Really a missed opportunity by Notre Dame defensively to run Bell off of the line with the extra defender 102 run and Cal enjoying their largest lead Too strong by Brady Caleb and the rebound Justin Pippen Bell again transition three in and out and the rebound Brady Kaylor for the Irish Sir Mohamd trying to go inside and its kicked by Cal will stay at this end and Mike Shrewsbury making wholesale changes here Not not surprising That was a lineup on the floor for Notre Dame that probably does not play big minutes on the year When you are down and youre sensing that the momentum is changing you want to get your starters back on the floor Cole Serta fouled Will get to the line A great just attack there by Serta I dont know if Ames thought he could stay on his hip but never really did a good job getting in front of him Sort of strong move Great job getting to the foul line Two shots for Serta He sended Ben in my way again after he missed in the first half cheering Hes got to start a new streak now Perfect First one Saturdays ACC Network mens hoops double header Virginia Tech travels to Wake Forest start us off at noon Eastern and Winston Salem and then Boston College and Georgia Tech at two Great afternoon of basketball and ACC Network tomorrow on the ESPN app as well Wake Forest won the Dukes May Bowl Carson Talent off the steel ahead BRANDON SHREWSBURY GLIDES AND MISSES the layup and Milos Elix pulls it down for Cal Oh what a missed opportunity for the Irish Ames just gave them the basketball and they cant finish But at the other end Camden continues his struggles from the threepoint line I mean this is a guy that was on fire for the first 14 games of the season And in the last two he cant buy a basket Thats the second layup miss by Braden Shrewberry today I I think hes got more than that Again hes had so many good looks right at the rim but he has got to be kicking himself for the number of short ones he has not been able to come up with Here is John Camden Shot clock down to five for Cal Day Ames The crossover The quick burst into the key and challenged by Carson Tout But then TT Carr knocked IT AWAY LAST TOUCH BY NOTRE DAME AND GT Carr with the hustle play the three before the half to turn the tide He is sticking with every play and a great job here Its just one of those pesky guards that is always trying to keep the ball alive and those are the possessions that can make big differences Freshman from the Bay Area wasnt all that highly recruited Finished up at Redwood High School in Marin County Hes not necessarily considered a hot bed for basketball talent Step back day Ames in the corner 14 for Ames Yeah he mentioned that with Carr sticking with that play getting the turnover that essentially ended up getting Cal two points they otherwise wouldnt have had Colerta too strong on the three kept alive Carson Tout diving for it and a tie up The arrow stays with Notre Dame But the possession arrow belongs to the Irish with 941 to go And Cal has matched their largest lead of the night for Notre Dame How can they get Jaylen Harrelson more involved in the offense You know I I dont think that Cal is really taking away his biggest threat which is that post up You know they havent really made the decision to go to the double team He has gotten good looks out of it Id continue to look take advantage of his size and get him in the post Braden Shrewberry from the corner A three 14 for Braden Shrewsbury And if youre Day Ames youve got to know who youre guarding You cant forget hes had his struggles tonight but he is always a threat and Ames just didnt have his hands up to contest 43 John Camden launches and Camden his first points of the night You can see the entire building Feel the relief come off of Camden to finally get one to fall averages 14 and a half a game and a 42 threepoint shooter but he struggled in the first couple of conference games against Louisville and now Notre Dame tonight Coert on the drive and then missed at the rim but the hustle Carson Talon throws it away Nolan Dorsey brings it up for Cal Camden from D and short on the three and Carson Tout the rebound up top How about that heat check You go 0 for eight you make one and you take one from 10 ft behind the line Doesnt take much as you get your confidence back does it You know better than anybody Shoot or shoot There you go And a foul called on Cal off the ball Its the third on Dayday Ames Team foul number five on California Eight and a half minutes to go Its that mentality right You take a shot Its Yeah you you got to have it You know youre a shooter you always feel like the next ones going to fall He was open but Dick Cuchin former Notre Dame assistant head coach of Cal Theres one player that comes to mind also that played at both Notre Dame and Cal Remember the name Matt Beasert Played at Cal and Notre Dame in the mid to late 80s Started Notre Dame finished at Cal Braden Shrewsbury GETS FREE FOR THREE He is feeling it He is heating up for the Irish And that play was completely set up by Harelson and the pressure that he puts on the defense He turned that corner He drew an extra defender and threw it back to Shrewsbury One of the better looks that he has had all night Twopoint game TT Carr from deep answers for California Just love the confidence that Carr plays with on both ends of the floor his second big three of the night Cal is 6 for13 from three since halftime Team thats used to knocking down threes theyre doing it now Yeah and I was critical of them in the first half with a lot of the threes that they were taking But they looked completely different You know now the balls moving from one side of the floor to the other Theyre you know getting the defense on their heels Theyre getting the They have made a huge point all game of the threepoint shooting for Cal their struggles in the first half Six of 13 in the second half here Justin Pippen music knocks down one Bell knocks down another And then Camden who has had his struggles knocks down his first in the night And TT Carr he got the one at the end of the first half knocks down another And it has been a completely different offensive effort from Mark Madsons team in the second half Fivepoint California lead Notre Dame led by as many as 12 in the first half Braden Shrewsbury from the top short on the three Carson Tal on the offensive glass in the last sequence Lee Dort for Cal by the way picked up his fourth foul Were inside 7 and 12 minutes to play Pass deflected Day Ames comes away with it THE LOB FOR CHRIS BELL FINISHES And what a play at the off other end by Day Ames deflecting that ball Pippen runs in transition and Bell runs with him and a perfectly executed lob And this building is as loud as it has been tonight Spinning darting to the basket and Jaylen Harrelson will go to the line for the Irish Again this is set up by the deflection by Justin Pippen Ames picks it up gets it back to Pippen and Bell with the lob Just a great play in transition Two players just a little bit of eye contact so Bell knew that the lob was coming and perfectly cheering thrown by Pippen One more for Harelson 14 for the freshman and he hits both free throws Much needed for the Irish I think we made a a big deal about the the the pressure defensively that the Irish showed in the first half but that was primarily in the half court as Bell goes up for another one Comes short Theyve got to get back to putting that type of a pressure on Cal making them feel their bodies a little bit And a whistle away from the ball And a push called on John Camden of Cal and Notre Dame in the bonus A one and one for the Irish first on Camden And here is Cole Sera at the line Seven points for Serta off the bench Slowly restarting his streak Hell get one more tomorrow 14th ranked Alabama takes on Kentucky Wildcats Finally full roster for Mark Pope More coverage begins noon Eastern from Coleman Coliseum on ESPN and ESPN app Sophomore guard from Bama Baron Phylon averaging over 21 a game A fun matchup SEC country tomorrow at the rim Milos Elix with a season high seven points Yeah And he has been so effective in that pick and roll I mean he is a big wide body and sometimes bigs like to kind of half set that screen and slip He actually puts his body on the defender and a great adjustment there by Cal We talked about how often they got strung out in the first half in that high pick and roll Great job by Elich with a quick show getting back to his man The rotation stayed a little bit longer until he got back Great adjustment by the Bears Braden Shrewberry spots up in and out of the three CARSON TA THE OFFENSIVE rebound and put back He is so active underneath Yeah he really is And we that was a huge storyline in their last game against Stanford and how they were able to win that game out rebounding them by 12 It wasnt really a factor in the first half of this game Cal has done a good job But now Tout with his second offensive rebound in the last five possessions Led the country in rebounding last year in Northern Arizona as Day Ames slithers in along the baseline I mean every time the Irish have come up with a big play there has been a response by Cal Attacking the basket and a foul called with just over five and a half minutes to go And if thats Elach thats his fourth Cal Bigs in foul trouble Thats the fourth on Milos Elich and Lee Dort on the bench Hes got four as well getting set to return though at the table now for Mark Matson And its a great play there by Harelson You know hes very aware of his size and his ability to beat smaller defenders off of the dribble then lower that shoulder create the contact and get to the rim I mentioned it earlier Theres the cow foul trouble by the way but I mentioned it earlier the impressive game he had at Stanford the most eyepopping number to me for Harelson He drew nine fouls in the game against the Cardinal and hes very comfortable posting up But when you post up it becomes easy for a a team defensively to double team get the ball out of your hands But when you are just kind of lining a guy up oneonone you can drop turn the corner drop that shoulder create the foul Its very difficult to guard for a play player that uses that contact Chris Bell missing from the corner Another rebound Logan IMS for the Irish Times moving in and the errant pass behind Braden Shrewberry and Notre Dame with a giveaway Yeah And that was really after Notre Dame had a really good defensive effort on one end of the floor They got the stop Now they come down and really just an empty possession of their own throwing the basketball away If Notre Dame is going to continue to get these stops theyve got to turn it into something at the other end Turnovers have been few and far between tonight Thats just a seventh for the Irish Cals committed only three Shot clock at five Dana Ames on a step back missing the three and the rebound A good box out by the Irish and Braden Shrewsbury grabs it Here comes Jaylen Harelson Open three COLE SERTA BURIES IT FOR NOTRE DAME And that is the first wide open look Serta has him had tonight and all set up by Harelson going full speed ahead into the paint again Collapses the defense Serta great job trailing the play for the open three transition Serta you cant leave a shooter that open each with four fouls And nobody for Notre Dame really in foul difficulty other than Brady Kaylor whos got three Approaching four minutes to play John Camden spinning back middle and the rebound grabbed and Nicole Serta lost it and its picked up by Shrewsbury for the Irish and thats the shot that you like for Camden You took a smaller defender into the paint No help came and just a fiveft shot He couldnt get to fall Certa goes baseline picked up Kebachai underneath left it short and the rebound pulled down lead dort for Cal and Notre Dame returns the favor by missing a shot right at the rim Neither team able to finish even though they got good looks on consecutive plays Justin Pippen way off on the three and its saving it John Canva but right to Logan IMS and Notre Dame controls Ims penetrates Culer to open three NOTRE DAME HAS the lead And you love the effort by Camden but that gave the Irish a five on four break Slow in the rotations and you just gave up a wideopen three Heres Dort down low and hes fouled trying to step through the double team I dont Yeah there was not a whole lot there Sixth team foul Cal not in the bonus Just a great play there by the Irish in transition Very fortunate to get the oneman advantage but Serta has hit a number of big shots And that one there cuts it or gives Notre Dame excuse me the lead by two Third foul on Keba Jai Dorsy left open cant get the roll And the rebound grabbed by the Irish is Nolan Dorsy missing from D Yeah And two plays from Cal that kind of get went back to passing the ball along the perimeter and chucking up contested threes Jaylen Harelson way out high Logan Iron sets up Missed the three and the rebound The 10th grabbed by Lee Dort tonight Cals gone scoreless for about three and a half minutes now Yeah And another play The ball did not go below the free throw line extended That was just beyond the threepoint line Didnt get any depth Didnt get it side to side in a contested shot Down low to Dort Backs in to Carson Tal Dort the jump hook Too strong Carson tout the rebound for the Irish cheering Seven straight points for Notre Dame Cal scoreless for four minutes Theyve missed their last six shots from the field cheering Cole Certis spins Tough shot RIMS OFF AND THE REBOUND TOUT HUSTLING FOR NOTRE DAME GETS A TIMEOUT BEFORE falling out of bounds and Tout the guy who averaged 15 and and he does his role perfectly We saw it uh in in a high fashion in their win over Stanford Weve seen him come up with a number of key plays But in a game in which you have a twopoint lead with a minute 27 every possession counts and he earns his team an extra one Jaylen Harelson straight on three missed by Braden Shrewsbury and the rebound count cheering from Ames Either a high pick and roll or an isolation Try and turn that corner Get something going to the basket Everythings on the perimeter They got to turn this corner Get something at the rim Dayday Ames step back long two heel of the rim No And the rebound grabbed by Jaylen Harelson for the Irish and a foul is called on Nolan Dorsy and Elson Harelson to the line for Notre Dame Not a whole lot there by Dorsy in a game in which we have had a good amount of physical play for the officials to call that there I didnt see a whole lot easily could have been play on but it will send the freshman to the line with an opportunity to make it a twopossession game and a double bonus now Notre Dame two shots Thats a big miss Even if he makes this youre down to one possession Notre Dame has eight of the last 10 rebounds in this game They are all over it We mentioned Shrewberrys team has got to find ways to win games ugly They did that against Stanford and doing it here climbing back into the game and taking the lead And their free throw struggles although it rolls in for Harelson who is now 5 for 10 at the line in the ball game Its still just a onepossession game but just 11 for 20 Notre Dame They left a lot of points at the line John Camden missing a three Lee Dort the offensive rebound PIPPEN GOT SOME SPACE SHORT ON THE THREE and the rebound Logan I for the Irish Theyre going to have to and they foul Serta the last guy they want to put at the line And you didnt have to foul right away right Like I mean you could have gone for a steal in the back court You could have gone for something quick and to your point you really fouled the wrong person Foul was on John Camden his second cheering And he misses Camden 27 in a row coming into the game He has missed two in a row He did a great job of making himself available to get the basketball knowing that a foul was coming He knocks down the second making it a fourpoint game If you are Cal this does not have to be a threepointer Do not just take a quick shot thats contested Make sure you get a good look Chris Bell drives Offbalance runner by Bell Twopoint game Timeout Cal All right Now if youre Cal youre down two run and have the ball up two with 194 And the Cal shooting went cold at the wrong time Sir Mohamd can run the baseline Has trouble getting it in Gets a timeout before a 5second call Yeah great awareness Coach Ruseberry told I am sure Mohamd Hey weve got a timeout Keep a a a countdown in your head of where youre at Call it whenever you get close Notre Dame their first 2 and 0 start in ACC play in eight years Fullourt pressure and Sir Mohamd will throw it in for the Irish They trap Shrewberry in the back court and a foul is called as he stepped through and two shots for Braden Shrewberry at the other end of the floor Uh and Cal was not trying to foul there And and its almost like sometimes when youre the offensive team youre Shrews Bear you catch that ball and you and you kind of tuck it in and try to protect it assuming that a foul is coming But thats not what the Bears were doing But on the trap they allowed room for Shrewberry to kind of split through the middle of it and he ended up drawing the foul Two for Braden Shrewberry Hes two for two with the Lion tonight And the first one rattles in This is a big one Makes it a twop possession game with 16 and a half seconds to play Got it Make or miss for Cal It still does not have to be a threepoint shot You cant take a ton of time off of the clock but you still have to make sure that you get a good one Ames with the ball in his hands STEPS INTO A THREE AMES GOT IT ONEPOINT GAME NO timeouts for Cal Same same strategy here If you are the Bears you dont have to foul on this inbounds Youre going for the steal cheering And they trap and foul Shrewsbury in the corner with 99 remaining TC Cares is third Third on TT Carr So now Mark Matsons going to have a play that he is telling his team even if Shrewsbury makes both of these free throws you are only down three Every team at the end of practice spends time going through late game situations You need a two you need a three 10 seconds on the clock What play do you run up without a timeout Without a timeout So they again thats why you practice them as often as you do Got the first one 20 for Shrewberry There will probably be some sort of a long pass and the counter to that would be if Shrewberry makes this puts him up three Do they foul with the long pass getting in not giving the Bears an opportunity to hit a three Here comes Ames Ames weaves his way GETS A SHOT OFF AND HIT IT COUNT IT A CHANCE FOR FOUR UNBELIEVABLE Micah Shrewberry was imploring his defender TO GIVE THE FOUL BUT IT WAS NOT THEY CHANGE THE CALL THEYRE WAVING it off No made three And Mark Matson is losing his MIND RIGHT NOW INITIALLY THEY HAD called it count the basket they have changed the call with five and a half seconds Martinson Mark Madson has every right to be losing his mind How is that foul called the officials arms when IT AGAIN cheering TO REVERSE THE REVERSAL COUNT THE BUCKET IN A TIE GAME WHAT IS happening now Shrewberry is losing his mind on the play Shrewberry was imploring his defender to give the foul That was the intention coming out of the timeout that we are going to give a foul We are not going to let them hit the three It was not given immediately It was delayed and then cheering Ames was able to get into the shooting motion for the lead Day Ames Cows up one Notre Dame has a timeout Logan I was called for the foul WILL PLAY IT IN Here comes Jaylen Harelson Gets into THE FRONT COURT TIMEOUT Irish 24 I Im still trying to process what we saw I dont know if Ive ever seen anything like that in a late game situation But we look at the foul The foul is called there The three The officials arm goes up The foul was I just think that the defender tried to give a foul He didnt get the immediate call He motioned to give another one And just a tap on the arm the call by the officials cheering If you are going to give that foul you have to make sure that you give it long before the offensive player gets into his shooting motion This review is to make sure the clock is correct 24 right now showing the last time out for Notre Dame But in terms of that last sequence now the continuation is new in college basketball this year They brought it back into the game and the continuation there The three was initially ruled a 3 one for daytoday Then after the officials got together they waved it off talked one more time and then reversed the reversal to give the main bucket to Dayday Ames and the and one free throw and the fourpoint play giving Cal the lead Yeah and I dont even know what to say about that We will talk about it more But that said Notre Dame has a chance to win the game here with 26 seconds left in the game Making sure that they get a good look That this is more than enough time for a player to come off of down screen catch it give it a one dribble and a pullup jump shot Shrewberry as poorly as that play was handled not fouling the threepoint shooter Heres an opportunity to win the game Lob comes
