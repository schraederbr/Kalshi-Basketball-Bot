started Those couple are on the bench Well get to the starting lineups for the Pirates in a moment Meanwhile Boston College the same starting five for now all five games of the season Away we go Thanks for being with us on ACC Network Extra on a Tuesday night Getting ahead of the traffic Bartner Coach Thomas said hes going to keep changing lineups till he finds the right one for lead play BC lops it for Aiden Shaw who had to save possession by throwing it off of Xavier Long BC going to a little side pick and roll action to start Coach Grant was working that in a walk through earlier in the day We just mentioned it Adrien Shaw had those 14 rebounds in the win at Temple on Saturday Donald Ham Jr looking to get the outside touch going cheering And now Payne with the shot clock down to three Lets it fly Good work on the glass Thats Jaden Hastings And BC gets a fresh 20 Payne goes right to the rack Super quickness He got from the top of the key to the rim in less than a second So he couldnt hit the three but he gets the two And now he gets a foul Does Fred Payne there at the lineup you see it at the bottom of your screen for Hampton So Daniel Johnson Quinton Cooper and Etns All new entrance into the lineup Johnson its his fourth start of the year Hes their second leading scorer this season But for Quinton Cooper and ETN brothers their first starts for Hampton this season And heres Xavier Long getting the double team now Oneonone against Shaw Got the contact and finished Its going to be a long evening for the Eagles if theyre going to jump on that and popcorn fake as you saw Shaw did in Providence over the weekend verse Both Brown and Holy Cross Hampton wanted to emphasize getting the ball inside to long one four action You saw it there They executed their game plan to a te to start No threepoint play So were tied at two Boston College as mentioned earlier theyve had the same starting lineup for all five games at the outset of the season for coach Earl Grants and that includes their leader Donald Han Jr His midrange game has been phenomenal Just got to get it going from the three which he will do Hes too good of a player not to Yeah I was mentioning hes trying to get the outside shot going Coach how about these stats Hes shooting 53 on twopoint shots Hes 4 for 34 on threepoint shots It Its mindboggling Hes too good of a player for that to continue And I asked Coach Grant that this afternoon in our talk and he said hes a farmer He works hard He gets up at 630 every morning and shoots The seeds are going to grow Unquote You know Coach Grant his analogies laughter A farmer I Im just telling you what Coach Grant we saw the seeds being delivered from on a midrange pullup Thats a tough shot that Ham did Boy and watching him now for the four years that hes been at Boston College Three healthy I love his midrange game Thats for three for Payne So he starts 0 for two from out there Last couple of games he was six of 13 from three Knocked it away Freds doing a bit of everything Hes got the steel Euro and a finish Nice steal by Payne I tell you Struts hes quick as quick can be Fred Payne with four of the six Boston College points Each of them layups Two and a half minutes in This is a big man whos an old guy Josh Ogandelli Shot clock at five for the freshman Quinton Cooper Oh what a pass Oand Deli cheering and applause He might be a freshman but that was a really mature pass by Cooper And thats a big recruit Quinton Cooper out of the D area coming off an 11point game against Holy Cross in that loss on Sunday So he gets the first career start today But Thomas kind of rewarding him Coach Thomas shared what you did Josh Hes going to recruit the DMV heavy Another threepoint try for Payne Hes missed all three of those and a foul against BC applause Payne he looks like hes in pain If you read his facial expressions hes used to the ball going down Pain super quick hands is great euro step textbook hero step in fact And then Cooper look at this Mature behind the back delivering it Quinton Coopers been averaging eight points a game coming off the bench I guess they figured why not get him in the starting lineup Coach Thomas said he loves his freshman Close quote You saw it right there on that play Oen Deli spinning left but he couldnt finish Got it back Missed again And now its Xavier Long on the third break on the possession Oandelli is a large human being Definitely getting the Eagles ready for ACC playing against him Oand Deli by the way turns 25 next month coach Thats a grown man playing college basketball for a sixth year And hes back home cuz he played at Worcester Academy PAYNE TRIES IT AGAIN AND that one goes down And wow hes already taken four threepoint shots in the first four minutes How about seven of BCs nine points belonging to Fred Payne You highlighted him right at the outset coach Hes been playing so well And you mentioned about the starters Coach Grant says he has eight starters but the rules only allow him to start five Shot clock is at five This is Daniel Johnson talented sophomore is not going to get it off Before we go to break party that play was made by Paynes quick hands Boston College thanks to Fred Payne with an early threepoint lead Her chest Boston College has taken seven field goal attempts and Payne has six The only other player to take a shot thus far is Donald Ham Jr All right some some subs Heres Luca Taves the backup point guard They couldnt finish It will Its going to count Theyre going to count that They say it was goalended Whoa Somebody must have hit it while it was still in the cylinder Correct Thats exactly He hit it basically through the cylinder We might see the replay Taves one of the eight potential starters Taves started his career at Northfield Mount Herman and then finished at the Newman School Followed John Carroll when John went from left Northfield Johnsons in attendance this evening What a program out there in Western Mass He ran Daniel Johnson the fadeaway Thats a big mans offensive rebound by Ogen Belly That sixyear senior has made some big contributions for the Pirates early and now he gets it oneonone against Bowden Katki Johnson ball and jumper No Big time rebound by Hastings Hampton true to their mantra trying to get it inside outside Theyve done a good job of executing their game plan Boston College has the last five points Largest lead of the game Payne finding Kapky Kapky the sixth man Jaden Hastings on the follow from Boston College I think Hastings is the X factor just tipping the iceberg His motor is at a superior level and he can dominate both ends of the floor on the glass And its interesting you see Hastings and Kapky playing together which Boston College has not really done much in the early going this season Coach Grant after the Temple game in this afternoon continues to talk about finding the right combinations and gives the team credit for adjusting to the lineup that he puts in Now theres the Texas State transfer Elijah Kennedy off the bench hadnt played all that much this year He hits the three to get the deficit to four Second shot Donald Ham And again he finds that sweet spot from about 10 ft out What I like about Han today partner he hasnt attempted a three Just trying to let it come to him Into the corner and the rebound for Donald Hans Jr Hes also one of the best off the boards for Boston College Hands quickness is superior to most athletes Boston College is seven of 11 from the field Tapki for three Well theres Cody Williams the Hawaii transfer who had started the previous couple of games Oen Deli Nice defense by Capky forcing a turnover on a backboard violation Kapy just found the scatter belly associate head coach and the coach specifically asked me to get a shout out to Ed So thats the third time Ive mentioned Ed Coolies name in this former BC assistant we might add Hamilton out of the timeout there last basket Elijah Kennedy a three that time inside for two goes Michael Elie and he was fouled on it Elely another one of those guys whos been a starter on this road trip up at Brown coming in off the bench tonight and another experienced guy who came from two lane Whats really impressed me about Elely and Hampton theyre much quicker than they appear on film watching them for today Elely got into the paint quickly forcing Capy to foul him applause Elely didnt score in the loss to Holy Cross Sunday Before that hed been redot Hed been averaging 15 points a game the previous three As you said Coach Thomas is just mixing and matching trying to find the best combinations Oh for two Everybody just won some food coupons Coach love it When an opponent misses two free throws on a trip and hand dipped the shoulder into Cody Williams Id like to see that one again Cody Williams did filed the scouting report on hand spin He fell but I question Were going to see this right here on the replay Coach Simons curious Good job by Williams Nope Great call by the official Little too much contact Oh no Now its textbook Took it right the shoulder Right between the zero laughter if you will Not even between the numbers On the numbers Maybe a lot too much contact Yes Uh great Good call Officials usually get them right despite what coaches say laughter Its much easier to say that when youre sitting on this side of the court The miss by Christian Watson Marco Roanovich the freshman out of Montenegro cleared the glass for BC Coach Ray was praising Redovich for his play in Philadelphia Marco has struggled to shoot of late Hes got a really good allaround floor game Josh I think the whole Eagles team has struggled to shoot of late Lets see if he gets his FIRST ONE YES HE DOES Marco Redundovich Coach Grant was saying its just the time and coach Thomas was hoping it wasnt tonight Well so far its been tonight for Eagles to find their stroke They are nine out of 14 and thats out of bounds off of Asamoto So Hampton will keep it Marco Roanovich before this shot Coach how about this He had been one for his previous 16 on field goal attempts But Coach Grant is a trusting man and he knows that he could shoot it Same way with hand his players have the green light And again the good thing about that that was in rhythm Nothings been forced so far this evening from the Eagles Last Tuesday you mentioned Central Connecticut The Eagles shot a little too quick which led to some of their demise And as a coach you love seeing that the growth your team responds getting better every time on a out Hampton needs an answer Duck under move Thats a travel Dragged the pivot foot that time And unique rink The sophomore out of Newark New Jersey Another large body for Hampton The Pirates are going to be very formidable in the Coastal Unique Turned it over though He did He made a nice play before We were just praising BCs shoot Thats not going to count Got him out Yeah he had to step there Asamotto was very quiet in that Temple win on Saturday Was given a spark to the Eagles I think thus far when theyve made the substitutions into the bench Thats BC picking things up a bit as opposed to normally you know you get your starting five off the court things might fall off Asamotos strength is his length and his energy And coach Grant mentioned second time we said this he believes he has eight starters Were seeing that so far this evening Daves made a poor play hitting the ball on the net on his inbound pass He defended himself Its hard to do Ultimately a turnover for the Eagles That that that possession was doomed Yeah you dont see that often when the inbounds pass hits the net Caleb Steager freshman on the court for Boston College Offensive foul Thats going cheering to be an illegal screen against the big man Oandelli Oandelli Good call where you teach your players on the moving screens to run into them and that way you force the official to blow the whistle That was textbook defense there by the Eagles Thats a big boy too setting that screen 7 foot 275 lbs A very large human being There uses the same tunnel that we do to enter Theyre large And Oandelli this again And this is a homecoming We talked about this earlier Played at Worcester Academy for Coach Sullivan and also played for BABC for the legendary Leo Papil And now hes been at four different colleges in his six years Hes had a journey THES COULDNT HIT IT And they say thats off Asimoto going back to Hampton And you mentioned four colleges Six years the very end of young men that got an extra year because of co most men have done finished playing So thats why we still have a couple 24 and 25 year olds Yeah he played his first three years of college at Iowa He was a Big 10 athlete bounced around since 12point game still Cody Williams Hampton ice cold at the moment EC another chance to increase its largest lead Caleb Stagger getting playing time Freshman from Dallas Stagger scored over 1400 points in high school Its pretty impressive Oh nice dish again Luca Taves finding Bowden Kapki Ill tell you what Taves has looked fantastic distributing His vision has been spectacular Right now hes keeping Chase Forte on the on the bench Fort coming into the game partner over Oh yeah no problem Three assists for Luca Taves Well he knew John Carroll was here so hes trying to be impressive today His mentor cheering and stepping on the sideline There was Xavier Long for the Pirates Ta cheering just getting into the paint keeping his eyes away His head was forward so the defense had to play cheering him leaving Katki wide open Nice crowd Nice ovation from the crowd That unit brought great energy for the Eagles This game was tied at six just about four minutes in Ever since it is 173 So Josh all year the Eagles have defended very very well They have not shot well Well today so far theyre shooting well Long way to go See if Steager hits his first Nope and and Steers reputation as being a fine shooter In fact he was the last one to leave walk through today making sure he got his shots up Love seeing a young man work You mentioned it out of Dallas Starting freshman point guard Quint Cooper back in there for coach Thomas Looking for any kind of offense right now as Hampton Can Cooper give it to them Yes he can Nice penetration by Cooper Play was made though by Oandelli just clogging up the middle not allowing the Eagles to get out and help Lead is 12 Cant blame anybody for not being able to move Oandelli Chase Forte lobed up Couldnt tell if that was a shot or a pass Uh got me as well Thats something well have directing what ails them BCs gone back to some of the starters Hastings and Shaw on the front line Forte and hand in the back court This is the only reserve in there Redunovich fading and firing and hitting Hes two for two Another young man thats found his range today Its been balanced ever since Payne had seven of the first nine for BC Theyre getting contributions from everybody Long shot that off one foot and big Oandelli could not secure the offensive rebound Nice play by Strugs keeping the ball alive Aiden Shaw attacks and hell get two free throws So Josh great ball reversal right there by Marco Rodunovich But youll see Rodovic making a jump shot on the ball reversal when we see it He bounced it If thats a direct pass Aiden Shaw gets a dunk And were talking about it on Sports Center but doesnt need to be a bounce pass when theres nobody on you So you want to move that thing quick I think its worth revisiting what Aiden Shaw did at Temple on Saturday Seven points Yeah Okay Seven points Hell take that But 14 rebounds and five block shots Thats otherworldly unheard of Otherworldly hes a a great one I mean he would have had a double double or a triple double without scoring Thats very impressive When you get somebody thats going to clean the glass every time you can do a lot of things The teams able to run out on offense not give up second shots Again Coach Grant keeps talking about how were just still trying to find ourselves SH the Missouri transfer Hes got a nice touch at the free throw line too hit both of those purely Seven minutes to go in the half and Rodanovich a bump and a foul Nonshooting Too much body Good call Rodanovich forced Im trying to see Stuthers to step on the line So you have to call a foul in that situation You can see the bottom right corner of your screen Six against Boston College Thats a team this half So the last one thats nonshooting Theres Fred Payne reemerging Cooper Tough shot over Forte And Ill tell you what Quincson Cooper the freshman he may have been the most impressive Pirates at this point Well you see why Coach Thomas said he loves him And Forte is one of the best defenders in the nation Not just in this game in the nation Forte loves defense so much When you watch him in walk though he tries to steal the ball from the managers doing the laughter walk His hands are that quick He laughed when I said I was going to tell him that on the air today Jayce Forte was the Summit Leagues defensive player of the year last season And thats turnover Watch out Josh I got you buddy Yeah I took some fire right in the noggin before the tip Well that was Christian Christian Watsons the one and he came right away and apologized which was nice of him And you see Yeah Otherwise I I had his name circled laughter Just kidding I I love this view See Hampton in his zone Forte chased his miss got it back cheering And thats a thats a big man trying to be a point guard He was destined to turn the ball over cuz he might have traveled on his pivot because the player wasnt there where he thought he was going to be but that he had to let when he didnt hear the whistle he had to let it go So you could argue he turned it over twice on one play Boston College at the sixminute mark holding this 14point lead Xavier Long finish his transfer Hes been quiet Be keyed on him Thats on Forte Thats a block One and one coming up Did you see Fortes expression He takes such pride in his defense and such a good defender that hes incredulous that the foul could be on him What do you think I think thats actually textbook I was teaching it yesterday in practice His knees were bent You take it on the chest and then you fall on your back and scream The only thing you didnt do textbook you roll over so you dont get fall on So thats what I think Long answer for a short question Yeah Well thats why were paying you the big bucks tonight Might have to renegotiate laughter One and one here for Daniel Johnson Hell get the bonus sophomore out of Chicago and an allca rookie team selection last year No stranger to New England Played for the great Jason Smith at Brewster Academy in Wolfboro New Hampshire You saw Earl Grant in Scott in conversation with the official Mark Schneer there I I think Coach Grant agreed with you Coach Shinman about that blocking foul And the ironic thing is yesterday in practice I was teaching that and it was pretty hilarious at my age for in practice at New Hampton School where I volunteer coach First time weve seen the 221 press We were joking around so much I forgot to mention Hampton does that a lot of lot off free throws Theyve cut it to 12 Hampton usually goes back to manto man off that press First time all year Ive seen him go to the zone Forte penetrates the zone Aiden Shaw nowhere to go Oh that pass got to Donald Hands And theres Shaw Plenty of time on the shot clock Ham got the step and lost it on the way in cheering Its off Donald Han Jr going back to the Pirates Little momentum change here partner Stopping the score Things happen off free throws Four in a row scored by Hampton cheering Boston College cooling off just a little bit 5 minutes to go before halftime at Kanti Long lets it fly and thats over the back on Oandelli applause Six against Hampton as a team this half Thats not traditionally Longs game maybe a little frustrated not getting the ball inside Both teams are going to Nope Thats the fifth on Hampton Boy they put that up so quickly laughter I jumped the gun And Long is four of 13 now from distance on the season Tapy touch pass Ham Jr just still cant find the range from out there you know but in in rhythm And the problem with that is that allows teams to stick around You mentioned momentums now in the favor of the Pirates And no pun intended the Pirates are trying to steal a couple of possessions and get back in the game LOOK OUT OANDELLI DIDNT SEE FRED PAYNE And Payne will have to earn it at the line Payne making it hurt that Ogdenelli turned his back Turn your back Thats automatic That was a perfect replay This I feel like televoyant Turn your back Go for the steel Automatic laughter In fact Coach Grant was emphasizing that today in a walk through for his team when you see back turn Did you see his reaction there too Fred misses the first He had that look on his face I cant believe I didnt get a threepoint play As I said he had one I still have it in my memory Two minutes and two seconds left in Central Connecticut Baseline drive from the right side One of the best finishes Ive seen in a long time Almost was a gamewinner Almost applause One out of two Eighth point to pace the Eagles The first seven of those game in the opening four plus minutes Forte still guarding the freshman Cooper now Long blowing by Oh a good drive by Xavier Long Great job Long set up the three the last time Throw right by like there were no Eagles there Its a six to one run for the Pirates cheering Pay penetrates and had it poked free Thats going to stay with Boston College Going to have a media timeout right now Partner Eagles got We need to play guarantee games Its as simple as that And uh you know they were at Virginia theyre at BC Yeah theyre learning the ACC Thats what he said He also said Virginias really good cheering Shot clocks at three Asamot got a good look Looks great Thought that was going down Partner cant ask for a more open shot but the shot clock buzzer sounding BC has only one point in the last four minutes Six to one stretch for Hampton Kafky got his hands on that pass Ford say trying to track it down He does Ster going to the cup No foul Good defense there by Xavier Long Long can play Very impressed by him Cooper in attack mode He traveled Oh yeah No he did I thought he right It was a little It was a little cheering wonky I mean you look at Xavier Long and I think of Mo Ali Cox that played at VCU and never played football and played for the Colts for almost a decade Its funny Yeah When he played for Shaka Smart everybody was saying Oh he could be a tight end but he was only a basketball player Moali Cox Well it worked out in the NFL As Simoto tries it again And my point Long has that same skill level STRS blocked by Asamoto but theres Elely on the follow And weve got a ninepoint game The run continues is that 81 8 to one indeed And its 6 minutes Whats also struggle has made Eagles cause problems excuse me for stuttering is Hampton switching defenses Boston College is over for its last seven from the floor And now a foul whistle Thats seven against the Pirates One and one coming up Ivan Thomas is incredulous and has his hands together like hes in church A great block right on the screen by Asamoto Hes doing so much for the Eagles Boston College now with one point in over five minutes So as good and efficient as the offense was at the outset of this game now thats kind of quieted here over this stretch And thats why the coach Grants mantra defense is your identity and it carries you when the balls not going in the basket One and one and as Samoda hits the front end So they needed that point Front end is huge I have a graphic in the America East Missing the front end is like a turnover Wasted trip and he gets them both Nice job Lynn native back home after spending some time in Texas at Balor ETN Strs made his first start tonight and he got right by Asamoto to the basket That forces Earl Brandt to call his use it or lose it timeout with 154 to go in the half Our halftime report Minute 54 game seconds Boston College at the stop play there Well see what coach Grant talked to the troops about Maybe looking at hand midrange Ksky in there in the middle in place of Hastings They find him Wow cheering what a play Or how about letting Cap just dunk it and get the crowd back in the game Yep Great timeout by Coach Grant As a coach you just have to love when you use a timeout and draw up a play when it works to perfection cheering Thats another textbook charge That time it was hand That was an easy one And its a good thing we dont have the announcer cam on cuz I gave the signal before it was called And look at this Great seal by Capki If we could see that one one more time His seal was phenomenal And great pass Great recognition by the Eagles BC had missed its previous seven field goal attempts Heres Ham driving and dish Good ball movement Luca Taves Everything but nice possession They got penetration ball reversal just couldnt get the shot to drop Johnson out of the corner Daniel Johnson and weve got an eightpoint game Great answer by the Pirates Closest theyve been in a long time Coach switching his zone Coach Thomas continue to try to keep the Eagles at bay 13 to5 stretch Payne from the foul line The leader Fred Payne in double figures in the first half Made it look easy Pirates would go two for one College teams dont do that as much as NBA teams And they get Ele cheering direct line drive to the basket His second bucket here in the last couple of minutes Eagles are going to hold for one Daves got jump trapped Help from Asamod Clock at 10 A lot of coaches trapped in this situation not to let the other team have the last shot Thats what coach Thomas chose to do Pay as Samoda out OF THE CORNER FOR THREE TO END THE FIRST HALF and get Boston College momentum heading Eagles got hot at the end to weather the storm that the Pirates created So BC led by as many as 16 Hampton got it as close as eight 11 point margin as the second half gets underway at County Forum Josh Mau John Shinman our entire ACC Network extra crew with you Cooper misses for Hampton Big man Ogan Deli though cleans it up Finds himself at the charity strike I was going to say before we had the whistle Oh I think he got fouled It was a little slow Big man Oandellis made his presence felt Cooper not being able to get to the rim Great defense by the Eagles on that one He is a behemoth Josh Oandelli sixyear senior from London applause As is often the case with those 275 pounders they dont have the best touch when it comes to free throws You know Oandelli is now five of 10 on the year So thats 50 if youre scoring at home Yeah right It is average Pirates get the first point of the half They played three straight games in New England two of them at an invitational hosted by Brown down in Providence Rhode Island Theyve had about a week up here in these parts Coach said hes enjoyed some food at Federal Hill back at his old stopping grounds in Providence where he was an assistant music for Kulie Donald Han missed the first shot of the half for BC but Chase Forte rescues Not used to seeing Han miss the midrangers Donald only with four points tonight Fred Payne leading the way for BC with 10 Forte lets it fly out of the corner BC missed a couple of shots Good possession by the Eagles Payne imploring Shaw showing great leadership imploring Shaw to go to the glass Chase Forte yet to score tonight I think if you were looking at BCs two true point guards Forte and Luca Taves Taves has been the more productive one offensively Forte is an incarcerator on defense partner Nobody gets by him Quinton Cooper talented freshman Thats a tough shot And that was on Taves Im having a great day predicting things Im going to have a might PLAY A LOTTERY TICKET OH cheering PAYNE THROWS IT UP SHAW THROWS IT DOWN AIDEN SHAW JUMPS OUT OF THIS GYM Great combination right there We featured those two young men in the opening I just say Wow He was a skywalker on that one and the delivery from Fred Payne was on the money Paynes plate game Fadeaway for two by Strs ETN Strs gets his second bucket in his first start of the year Very impressed by Strs Hes going to have a great career for the Pirates 10point game two minutes into the second half Twoman game again Payne and Shaw That time the duck down to Hastings And backto back high flying slam dunks for BC Great pass Eagles precision against the zone that possession Daniel Johnson just inside the foul line and curled off We have to clip that rebound up Shaw contested the shot and then jumped and got the rebound Hard to do but he made it look easy It was his fourth rebound of this game But remember what he did at Temple when he had 14 Oh four He just proven hes a mere mortal Hastings he wanted another dunk and Oandelli said No sir Theres a lot of LBs on that play right there Look at this pass The finish was even better Bench is enthused Saw it again Shaw with the exclamation point Tough catch by Shaw in the inbounds And it leads to numbers for BC but Paynes passes behind Donald Ham Jr Did you put that camera in the backboard by the way Good work That was very impressive that camera right there That wasnt you No it was not I knew you were here early today I was here early but nope Didnt get on a ladder That last possession was doomed to fail on the original bad pass The great catch by Shaw Look at Taves defending Forte almost had the strip and the three misses for Strutters cheering and applause Aiden Shaw hand Now Forte to the line applause So another great possession hand You wont see this on the stat sheet He got the ball from Shaw and never touched almost a touch pass like a hockey player to advance the ball forcing the foul Coach Thomas shared with me before the game transition defense was going to be a key for his team this evening Cant be happy with that play We talked in the first half about how Josh Ogandelli the big man for Hampton is a sixyear college player So is this guy Chase Forte and theres his first point of the night had a similar journey to Ogen Deli in that hes moved around although hes actually played at five different schools says Chase Forte Five schools in six years I believe he was a walkon at Asheville and only appeared in two games Great story That was back in 2021 applause and cheering Heres the full resume if youre ready for it Yep UNCC Asheville two years at a junior college in Panama City a year at Northwestern State They got a turnover I dont have enough time to finish his resume I didnt want to interrupt you but first time Eagles have done that half court trap and Forte couldnt hit the leaner 14point lead Oand Deli on the dump down and Hastings commits the foul to give a couple of free throws to the big man So we talked about a lot of pounds between Oandelli and Hastings I would not want to get fouled like Hastings like that He just came across as that has to hurt Theres no way that doesnt hurt Which Boandelli and we talked about 50 free throw shooter So his arms might hurt to force him to miss the shot One of two a moment ago applause front rimmed it Hampton as a team tonight is just three out of eight on its free throws Austin College seven of eight Not a good formula for success for the Pirates That was Pacings second personal foul Ogan Deli 36 rebounds and again a 50 trip Hastings because of his potential and size and body frames is getting looks from NBA scouts in a few for the future BC leading by 13 How do they attack the zone on this possession Ham for three Donald tonight full of three from threepoint territory That one was a little forced cuz of the shot clock All the others looked clean Just havent got to go Jumper for two by Elie And thats a foul against Oandelli in the back court Thats his third He got it about 75 ft from the basket Zephridge 12 total turnovers for the Pirates BC ball They had a three They matched their largest lead of this game Staying in that zone of the Pirates and attacks for the baseline Didnt finish Shaw saved it and Payne drills the three You called it partner Largest lead out of three Big time drive by hand I thought he thought he was going to get fouled Seven to one stretch for Boston College Got to be pleased how theyre starting the half as coach Grant all the things youre supposed to do in your home games versus a team from a mid major conference So far check plus everything Well Ill tell you thats clean Textbook straight up in the air outside the restricted circle But they didnt clean up the glass And Aiden Shaw who had that offensive rebound already cheering in this second half coach Aiden Shaws got four rebounds Wow And a block now Tapki was there helping Shaw A three by Aiden No thats maybe a little bit of a heat check I was going to ask you that very question Our mutual friend Kyler Murray loves saying that I was going to ask you that Payne in transition right to the rim cheering Boy he is quick You had mentioned that earlier You watch Fred Payne and maybe seeing him on television it doesnt do justice to what your eyes tell you when you see him in person Well said And he is superior quick and strong A slight frame but strong as all get out He has an NFL wide receivers or defensive bat type frame is what he does We jinxed him talking about him and he missed the free throw He struggled from the line today which is not like him Yeah One of three in this game on his free throws Came in made seven of his nine this season Like I said we Well hell adjust and make this one Sure did Hes got the last four points in this game and BC by 17 for the first time Eagles coming with the zone music press again after the last free throw I think Long might have got away with a travel Thats a tough shot and the fade away but an offensive rebound underneath and the bank shot is up and good for Daniel Johnson Josh sometimes when you trap you dont get back to rebound and off the miss Eagles did not clean it up Sure that will be pointed out in film session tomorrow 15point game The start to each half for Boston College has been terrific His hand misses another three cheering Johnson a transition triple and he hit the heel Nice rebound by Fort Donald Jr by the way 0 for four tonight from long range He is 4 for 38 on threepointers this year Its almost unheard of him He just couldnt believe it As good of a shooter as he is Capy thats tough on the move Its like you know we both do baseball Its like when a guy starts the season 0 for 20 of just cant get a hit and when you know hes a good hitter and Hans a heck of a shooter You think its mental at this point He can still play defense and and the rest of his game is spectacular Time he blew the layup cheering 15point game still Cody Williams Oh that hit every part of the iron and popped out Surprised that didnt in drop Nobody more surprised than Cody Williams Cam did a good job in transition defense that time off the Williams mess Each team is one for its last nine from the field Forte got the contact That was a hard bump by Christian Watson on Chase Forte But you know when youre not shooting well from outside you got to get to the free throw line And thats what the Eagles have done See Forte just quick forcing the contact Theres an art to that right You throw your body into a defender and you get the call from the official Correct We use SGA as an example earlier Donald Han does that very well Uh that time if Christian Watson would have played it better um with his hands straight up he could have actually taken a charge on that one because Forte initiated too much contact in my opinion We saw the replay and he had tremendous art form In my day nobody did it better than Walt Frasier I know Im dating myself Many people just thinks hes a color commentator laughter with the suits With the suits and and our mutual friend second Talon Murray reference Yeah Tough enough Second shot splits the trip 16point lead Chase Forte now three out of four at the line as Luca Taves comes back in In the first half Luca Taves had three assists and a couple of points in eight minutes Thats pretty impressive Three assists in eight minutes Marco Rodanovich the freshman from Montenegro also back on the floor for coach Grant Unique rink guarded by KFKY Unique rink with a unique name Another large body for the Pirates Try a three from the top Watson couldnt find the range Rebounded by Aiden Haskins Cody Williams misses again Theyre going to keep at it Spinning Watson THERES SHAW DENIES right at the rim cheering Hes having a block party Payne couldnt pay it off on the other end But theres Rodanovic for Boston College Shaw for three This is getting a little wild A little sloppy Wild is being polite We need this under 12 timeout which is coming when the whistle blows right now It looks like a little lunch game laughter at the rec center Yes sir Williams got away with a charge and the back rim three from Long Xavier Longston quiet Theres the whistle Hits the ground 4 and0 Matt taken off over for his father Bob McKillip Legendary coach In fact the courts named after coach McKillip at Davidson Oh yeah 33 years for Bob McKillip He coached Steph Curry Coach McKillip gave me my first job in 1980 to be a camp counselor at Long Island Lutheran High School Yeah Hes a Long Island guy Bowden Kapki for BC had it poked away Got it back again Tries it and that time got the contact from Oandelli And for Oandelli thats his fourth Oandelli The first time he did great The second time hes like reading his body language What else do you want me to do Just got to stay straight up and move the feet Big fella By the way weve got that Shriners Childrens Charleston Classic for you on the ESPN family of networks Those games that begin

West games I Im with you Insomniac Great great lead Johnson Hampton is one for its last 14 before that follow from Daniel Johnson The the clipping the clips of the shooting is not going to Springfield for this game laughter cheering And a takeaway by Daniel Johnson Oh he couldnt hit Luca cheering Taves was back to bother him See that great pass by hand If he doesnt score it doesnt matter His game still just plays Katki has cheering the block Oandelli puts it back Another miss Both coaches have a complaint cuz either Ogan Deli traveled or got fouled but its got to be something And they missed three shots to the Pirates and Donald Han Jr gets the run out cheering Wow Boston College by 18 applause Timeout Hampton And as you see made two of the last 18 The Eagles have only made one of the last eight but the Eagles have increased lead because theyre getting to the free throw line Hampton is also over the limit look for the Eagles to take advantage the rest of the way And that basket by Donald Panda was only his third field goal Long cheering driving right at Jason Simoda and Xavier Long finally puts one home Nice timeout by coach Thomas music drawing a play for his best player getting a getting a deuce Get to see Asamoto the Baylor transfer back out there for BC Gave them some big minutes in that first half He really helped turn the game around I thought with that threepointer they beat the buzzer Khaki from Taves and Taves delivers another assist Great point on Asamoto partner local guy coming back from from Massachusetts from Lynn Really had a huge impact in the first half on both ends and Taves just dropping dimes Leader in the game with those four helpers Cody Williams Hawaii transfer as out there overplaying against Xavier Long Now KKY helps on Long Got to get it out screaming Almost hit it I thought that was going in And that was good defense by the Eagles Good job switching on Long and you know his name was all over the BC scattering board today Got to handle Long Takeaway there by Oen Deli whos playing with four fouls Freshman Quinton Cooper Thats for three Great rebound by Asamoto Came a long way not letting the ball hit the floor Rebounding high Daves finding Kapky He can hit that Made three of those at Temple Saturday Oh boy And Xavier Long just fumbles it uncontested You know the second half has not exactly been a Monae and I have Let me Were having a little bit of fun here but both teams are playing extremely hard Both teams are extremely well coached I do think the Pirates are tired from being on the road for a week and the Eagles theyve really rebounded from a tough loss last week and playing very well Heres Luca again Tries to do it himself this time No assists needed He hits the jumper applause Coach Grant shared with me 12 years hes had like three point guards Hes just used to having a point guard forever Might have great chemistry with Luca over the years First time tonight 20point lead and an illegal screen knocked Donald Ham Jr to the ground Good job by Han Jr going 30 illegal Unique was not quite set You know Luca Taves is playing so well thats really eating into Chase Forte the sixyear seniors minutes And I dont blame Coach Grant for leaving Luca out there No And you could do a lot of different things because I dont care how good Luca Tay plays offense Forte is a superior defender for anywhere in the nation And you know I do a lot of GLeague games I mean Forte could guard anybody on a professional level Thats how impressed I am with his defense Marco Redonovich out there for BC Shaw Nice dump down for KKY Aiden Shaw And Kafky the big man playing catch Catchbook extra passing That tape can go anywhere Boden Kafki in double figures again with 10 Ky scoring in double figures for the third time already as an Eagle Another miss Daniel Johnson And out of bounds is Hampton Donald Han missed the box out kept the ball alive and good sportsman picked up Mr Strs Yeah Out of bounds Actually look at this Shaw saying hes more than a rebounder Hes more than a shot blocker Hes more than a defender Hes an assist man I think Shaws had a really impressive half Would you agree with that A game Jack Hes phenomenal Just owning the glass I referred him to Mr Rodman in the opening and thats high praise for a rebounder Jumper hit by Elely Tain and Sienna his previous colleges before coming to Hampton Michael Elie Six minutes to go Boston College by 20 points You talked about rebounding from that Central Connecticut State loss a week ago music Trying to go two and 06 Rodanovich No and Kapki couldnt get the tip to the rim And its one of the results theyve defended Theyve also been energized and much more together Not that they werent beforehand but coach said its hard We have a lot of new players trying to figure it out Long out of the corner Xavier Long You can see why hes the heart and soul of the Pirates Has 11 His average is 12 had that game against Holy Cross the other night where he was 21 and 13 That was the Crusaders first win of the year Coach Dave Paulson got off to Schneider with his club Five in a row for Hampton trying to make this interesting late TAVES ANOTHER ONE FOR LUCA cheering TAVES His midrange game is coming to life So Josh youve seen more than I Is this his best game as an Eagle in your opinion Well he had a huge game late last season as a freshman that cow scored 14 points probably Other than that the answer would be yes Thank you Youve seen more tonight Thats why I asked it as a question Heck of a move Strers I from the minute the balls been thrown up I have been very impressed by ETNs No hes not Daves had it knocked out of bounds with four and a half minutes left In Florida they win that game any one possession scoring a basket vers Central they win They defended well enough to win vers Central Said it all evening they just shot too quickly So but theyve recovered from that Rodovich from Taves shot it over the rim But you know if thats the loss that wakes them up and brings them together I think Coach Gran will take that You have a great season Great seasons are built on certain moments Yeah And you can speak to that better than most in here as a coach Are are there losses sometimes that are actually in the long run beneficial for a team In the long run you dont admit it to your players You know I mean the famous one in New England is the Patriots 160 but gave the Giants confidence in the Super Bowl Thats a big global one But thats just an example in in coach Grants case Maybe the guys okay now hey were not as good as we have to do the little things So they listen more And he coach BR said music the whole Wednesday was nothing but meetings and they really came together Oh and Marco Redanovich called for the foul on the jump shooter Michael Elely on a threepoint shot A rare defensive mistake this evening for the Eagles If Elely hits these three you dont know if he will or not Heres the foul on Rodanovich Got to give him room to land And you cant hit him in the arms That Lets start there Yes youre right You are 100 correct But it didnt even come to that So theres one If he hits all of them this game is not quite put to bed yet Oh nothings put to get to bed partner Hes a 66 free throw shooter Misses the second So So by percentage by percentage hell make this one at 66 Yeah pretty good at math Actually thats not true I am not good at math I That was spot on And you know what they say you usually end up at the average on the back of your baseball card That is well said We both love baseball That was very well said Perfect There he is Nine to two run here for Hampton I was taught never to do math on the air Kellen Lewis in for the first time defending Daves and a foul whistled and thats a one and one coming up for Luca Coach Thomas has a very legit argument They uh I think Taves might have traveled Ivan Thomas doing a really nice job Edward Joiner for 15 years had been the head coach for Hampton before he took over last season What do you think I think he got fouled first Yeah I I I walk back The first was fouled then he traveled but got to call the first one One and one I know you had flight troubles today partner Maybe the officials have flight tr Who knows I mean I dont know Yeah spoken like a true coach Tays played unbelievable today You can make an argument hes been BCs player of the game I could make that argument Eight points four assists three rebounds two for the little guy Those were big ones Back to a 17point lead Foul on Catkkey almost there for Christian Watson And you know that drops Threepoint play Clock stops Hamptons got a lot left in the tank Well lets go back to the conversation we were just having about a loss being beneficial One of the things that hopefully those Florida Atlantic and then Central Connecticut State games do for Boston College over the long run is you you learn better how to close out games and and thats another chance here How do you close out a game where youve got a pretty big lead 100 You you know this ACC games are going to come games at BC going to win going to come down to the last minute You have to make plays So in the portal era in the free agent era of college basketball each year you have to redo your team and know whos your best free throw shooter who to play at the end of the game whos your person to inbound the ball who are your best defenders All these things have to be relearned by each team Empty trip for Watson An offensive rebound and a kick out Elely couldnt hit it and its going back to BC They dodged some bullets Wow The door was open there and the Pirates just couldnt go through Even in the Temple win for Boston College Saturday if they held on BC was winning by 13 points with under three minutes left and Temple got back into it They got as close as four Thats still a great win down Temples a very good team Philadelphia not an easy place to play And a road win too I mean road wins are like gold A road win Theres two a road win in a conference is gold personified Any road win is a great win And Luca Taves is going to get another one in one Nine team fouls against Hampton in this half So this will be the last one and one Told you his career high is 14 did that late in the season a year ago as a freshman at Cal Oh good hit Hes stuck on eight Leaving that door open partner Xavier Long had it poked free but saves by Christian Watson Watson right to the rim Thats tough bank shot He was high on that one Nice take by Watson So 245 remaining Lead is 15 The largest was 22 Thought maybe Watson was trying to get the foul there As did I Now you got to play it out Already had half of the shot clock elapse Yes she knew Caves the closer at point guard tonight Payne has to get it off A 30footer The Pirates with Christian Watson attacking and throwing Big shot for three No good That was up there by Aiden Haskins That was a good long possession by the Eagles and free throws What we what I used to do Josh So right now theres two minutes two minutes and 3 seconds left in the game You see Watson thats great technique and how high he got it with the English But theres basically four possessions left in the game 30 right Its just simple math So for the Eagles you really want two good stops and two 30 second violations and you walk away with a nice victory Donald Juniors first free throw attempt of the whole game which is rare for him Yeah hes we compared him to SGA He loves getting fouled and has a great knack at it But again he doesnt he hasnt forced the action tonight to his credit Its only his seventh point and one out of two Seven points for Donald Han He had scored double figures in each of the first four games for BC this year So the Eagles are switching everything and they just want to guard without fouling Elite Caleb Steager in there fighting and the arrow belongs to Boston College Aiden Shaw made a a rare mistake Hes playing a great game Did a great job coming to close out If we see a replay he did not run back and get the rebound letting the smaller guys battle Thats his job And Caleb Steer showing he doesnt mind getting his nose dirty in there They were they were battling So a 16point lead and possession Pirates not given in and a turnover by Payne Taken away by Daniel Johnson Johnson at the rim able to finish That was a big boy finish by Mr Johnson 14point game and a timeout by BC as we go under 90 seconds remaining That was getting close to a five call It was high IQ by hand calling timeout Afternoon No sir 330 So an afternoon tip off Friday All right BC inbounding They have not put this one away as yet Theyre close Might just need one or two free throws just need two 30 second shot clock violations Its mathematically impossible to lose the game Yeah it feel like Hamptons got a foul here right They didnt do it Or coach could just decided to play it out as I broke down the math for you And now Stager was out of bounds when he caught that pass in the corner Was there three on his shot clock Yeah about that But it still increases your margin your percentage to victory Boston College only has five points in the last 6 minutes for three is Johnson Oh it was halfway in It popped out Aiden Shaws rebound puts the capper on this one Another long trip even possible shot clock violation afraid the pain and now Ham Can he hit the three No he cant Thatll have been nice to see He needs to see the ball go through the net This is Kennedy Elijah Kennedy hit an early three Hell try this one and hit it to get it to 11 with 20 seconds left Its a 165 stretch here over the last 6 and 12 minutes Yeah Best play in basketballs coming up right here Victory formation partner Itll be a win for Boston College A game they had a 22point lead in applause Again it got a little dice here in the closing minutes But all that matters if youre an Eagle is youve gotten it done Backtoback wins for the first time this season BC
