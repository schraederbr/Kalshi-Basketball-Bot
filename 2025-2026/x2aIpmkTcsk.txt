Tip music Cor will tip for the Panthers against Tyler Robinette And the Panthers control the tip And the season is underway The best time of the year basketball season Basketball season This the most exciting time for the young guys at their chance to prove they can play at this level Roman Suipa unable to finish down low Got a little off balance Ball knocked out of bounds It will be YSU basketball And I like the aggression from Roman Early Hes a bruiser You know if you think he has a history playing rugby in Australia hes going to abuse the defenders down low Jason Nelson has it for the Penguins The point guard to Ralph as Youngstown State works it to Robinette looking to go back door to Dawkins but stays at it stays up top 11 on the shot clock and a foul on Witherspoon I like the aggression from Witherspoon playing defense but you know you cant play with your hands at this level especially these refs early on in the season Theyre going to be calling it tight Inbound for YSU Penguins first possession Panthers had turnover just underway to start this season Chris Carroll they trying to get it to him but theres Witherspoon Eight to shoot Carol drives in has the ball knocked away Miner tries to save it but cant Itll be five on the shot clock Can already see the physicality I talked with coach before the game He mentioned physicality being the strength of this Panthers team Inbound for Youngstown State Thats an elaborate inbound with a lot of movement Ralph with the three No good Corhen the opposite number two with the rebound Marco Miner back to Corhen Good head fake spin move in the lane Corhan then kicks it back out Still 16 on the shot clock Miner his final season and second turnover This one a turnover on Witherspoon Ethan see Jeff Cable eighth season You see the difference Nick in these last three where hes gotten his guys in and his system established Hes done a great job recruiting bringing transfers in bringing good freshman in Thats a lot of success youve seen these past three seasons Little fullcourt pressure by the Panthers as Miners trailing Dawkins will drive it in kick it out Carol open from three in the first points of the game A threepointer from Chris Carroll the senior from Tallahassee One thing about Youngsttown State they are not scared of this stage Theyre senior laden team Uh theyve last year they played Syracuse to double overtime at the beginning of the year last year Theyre ready to make a splash and the lob attempt is knocked away by Youngstown State So Panthers havent been able to establish a shot yet in this game A lot of that is jitters Theyre still trying to see what works for them work through the system They need to calm down Dont be afraid to take some shots later in the shot clock Robinette guarded by Corhan Good back door feed Ralph has it Unable to put it up the first time but grabs his own rebound and its five nothing Penguins Thats just a good read and react Pits been overplaying Youngsttown they felt that pressure And the best thing to do against pressure is to cut to the basket especially back door Gets it to Witherspoon Witherspoons going to drive Big Euro step Kicks it out Biva Cummings Panthers first point is a three from Brandon Cummings And thats what Biva Cummings does He can fill it up quick Usually if he gets taste blood on that first three you can expect a barrage coming soon from him Boy hes a guy that they need to kind of step up offensively as Carols three is no good Fight for the rebound Friendly fight And here comes Witherspoon He spins in the lane and a second turnover on the Panthers Traveling turnover You can see here thats just a classic read and react play They saw him overstepping BA out of position Thats just an easy backup if you have high IQ Good driving and kick there Witherspoon they think hes kind of like you guys remember Bub Carrington The scouts are really thinking he could be that type of player a distributor drive and cheering kick from the same area And its fitting because Bob now plays in DC where Omaris from Crossover by Carol Spin move in the lane Lefty shot Pretty move by Carol And hes a preeason first team And hes built like an ACC player 66230 cheering He built like a linebacker Yeah And the first foul on Youngstown State is going to be on Carol Ethan Falner is the head coach of the Youngsttown State Penguins in his second season as the Penguins go for a fourth straight 20 win season I love his coaching style Saw him and shoot around Likes mixing it up with his players He was in there with the pad mixing up with the bigs They could tell they respond to that You can see how hard theyre playing right now They really really respond to him Youngtown State with the 73 lead gets it to Miner 10 to shoot Miner working on Ral Good defense Kick out Su Lia for three No good Ball tipped around and grabbed by Miner Miner gets it to Cummings Cummings drives in Gets some contact Nothing called Corin gets the offensive rebound He goes up and a foul called cheering on Youngstown State Thats what you want to see from Corin Crashing the boards established himself in the front court Theres a lot of questions about the front court Great hustle play from Miner Good awareness And Cummings took it in strong but Corin seeing Robinette out of position going up strong Foul on number four for Youngstown State And the free throw rattles out A rare missed free throw from Pit Pit typically leads one of the leading teams in the country in free throw shooting percentage Surprised to see the first one of the season miss Emanuel Zorgville in for Youngstown State Transfer from Northern Kentucky Sat out last year due to injury Corens second free throw is good 74 Something a little different from a cable coach team picking up full court full court manto man beginning of the game Typically you play half court defense I think thats a testament to the tone theyre trying to set this season They want to wear you down defensively Pocks in the game He drives and nice shot up and over Cam Corhead Pock uh hes home Hes comfortable Steel Valley High School standout Once hit 11 threes in a high school game Was a standout at CalU Division 2 school in Pennsylvania was a little welcome home floater How many people told him he couldnt play at this level right And this is his chance to prove it So Alipa drives in uses his muscle kicks and Cam Coran finishes with the left hand Thats a great play If you can have a fourman taking a defender off the dribble and creating like that it really puts a lot of pressure on the defense Foul on Biva Cummings for the Panthers but Pit draws to within three as the freshman Su Lipa Great drive inside and Cam Coran finishes from being down in the first half but you cant dig holes just like this game Slow start here Cant be doing that all season You see Carol drive and get the foul on Dunning and a threepoint opportunity for Youngstown State Well he got that step on the transfer for the Panthers and just took advantage of it Thats what Chris Carroll does He just puts constant pressure on the defenders Low man wins Thats what they say in sports The low man wins And he gets under you puts a pressure on you you got to foul him to stop him He is in the game as well as Noas Indraitis Got to be honest when when I first saw Noyas transfer to Pit I was scared of the name but its its its growing on me Yeah You know I thought he was yet another PIT for player coming in but no hes hes from Chicago area And shot no good from Coren Youngstown State at 126 lead cheering Carol looking to get rid of the basketball Miner grabbed it but had his foot on the line is what the officials are saying as Jeff Cable crosses his arms to score first McDonalds allAmerican in pit history Youngstown State with the lead here in the first half King drives in his floater to alley Youngsttown State theyre getting into the paint Typically when youre the team thats getting into the paint more it puts pressure on the defense and it creates better shots Theyre taking better shots and thats why they have the 146 lead cheering The seven foot Zorgo with the finish now The pressure on the baseline driving in Oh Neyas gets it to Cam Coran for the flush Crafty little play there Took a little euroep dropped it off to Corin cheering again getting into the paint It does good things for your offense Drew King had it Has it back from the Phoenix area King drives in tries the same thing That time the shot goes and it was a good box out by Corhan to keep cheering the Penguin Zorg Ball from going into the lane Donning will try a three Back rim no good Ball runs down the player You got to put a body on him cuz hell be able to jump up and get rebounds that nobody else can Youngsttown State shooting 60 early on and just a little far was the pass for Cam Pocket Look at this play here Driving in just thats just another replay He saw Corin drew him up and no just good little Euro step there He has a European last name A Euro step to the finish Nelson is back in for Youngstown State and the first time T Blackshere has entered Its another dangerous player for the Penguins Pick and roll Papa Keante in as Dunning drives in misses the shot Kante gets the offensive rebound and Noas Indritus Indraitus is a great player in exhibition games He was in double figures both games He can really shoot the ball fill it up very fast plays at his own speed Great shot from him Tyler Robinette is see a lot of back door cuts from Youngstown State And again thats cuz Pit is theyre overplaying on the wings Theyre denying everything cheering and its leaving a lot of room for these back door cuts Nelson as the shot clock is running down hits it over Dunning 1711 Penguins These Youngsttown State Penguins theyre playing with no fear right now Playing loose They feel they belong here Witherspoon has it with 13 to shoot Drives in Oh his lefty shot is blocked by Carol Will be pit basketball with 10 to shoot And again not mad at this take A good aggressive take from Witherspoon but Carol timed it up perfectly put it off the glass Hes able to get around Nelson but Carols just waiting for him Minor five to shoot Kicks it out and has to launch a long three No good air ball but Papakante puts it in and they count it And that is his role on this team He has to be able to rebound offensively and defensively If he does that hell see his role increase throughout the season Now is that an assist That Thats an assist in my book Thats an assist Nelson gets it back Trying to find Robinette Good defense by the Panthers Kante out on Nelson We saw that Nelson can launch from there Five on the shot clock Nelsons going to drive and pick up the foul on Papa Amadu Kante So Papa with the foul there but the good play on the offensive end right here grabbing the pass and putting it up and in Its 1713 Youngstown State after review successive basket The ball was out of his hands Well the officials Eric Lewis Rob Tyberki and Jeremy Moer looked at this to make sure it wasnt a shot clock violation I mean were probably talking thousands of a second but it just clears Kantes hand and the bucket stands Thats a masters class in clock awareness there from Papa Kante Inbounds for Youngstown State having a hard time getting it in and a 5second violation Thats great defense from the Pit Panthers there We talked earlier about how theyre trying to establish themselves and bring the pressure and that time the pressure wore the Penguins down 500 violation 5C So Alia in for Dunning Nick whats that feeling like the first game of the year It definitely jitters especially for the young guys I mean the returning guys trying to get your stats up you know theyre theyre mad youre not passing them the ball uh for these type of games but for the young guys yeah for the for the young guys its definitely jitters You want to prove that you can play at this level Papa Keante with the three and Su Lia was battling down low to get position I love that he had the confidence to shoot that three I didnt think we didnt see that from him last year Wonder if coach Capo have given him the green light Well I dont know if this is a sign that hes an there That could be your sign Although he got a high five from the coach So so Corin back in Its 1713 Corin gets the inbound looking for Biva Cummings Brandon kicks it out Situs has it knocked away but out of bounds 13 to shoot Weve seen a lot of dangerous passes from the pick guards so far this game They got to use their ball fakes Drive draw two and then kick Mari Witherspoon to inbound right by the Youngstown State bench Witherspoon 10 to shoot Steps back and its a deep two Robinette grabs the rebound Here comes Nelson for Youngstown State Im impressed with how many guys Youngsttown States been able to roll into this game Yes And definitely theres no drop off Blackshire misses and a fight for the rebound and a jump ball possession arrow to Youngtown State Suipa against Carol takes it in and misses the layup Jorge slams it home though Thats why you always run to the ball to help your teammate out especially when you know they have a tough fast break layup going Run to the ball You never know what could happen now with seven points at 1715 Dawkins driving on Witherspoon High arcer Some good drives to the right side from Youngstown State tonight Seems like every time Pit is going to start a run Youngstown answers with a big bucket Corin has it 15 Cummings was open Good move Drives in His shot is blocked by Robinette Loose ball grabbed by Youngstown State Nelson a stutter step and goes out of bounds He wanted the foul on Corin Just couldnt stay in bounds Jason Nelson 510 senior transfer from VCU I thought Ba could have took the first shot I think he was open on that jump shot A little bit of a overdrive there Great block from Robinette How about for Robinette Nick This is his 159th college game Yeah I think he was playing back when I was playing I dont know 159 games Thats a lot Its a lot of games Thats experience Isnt that crazy Played that many games in college Played at the College of Idaho before Youngstown State Cummings has it Panthers down by four Witherspoon against Hlock And nice up and under move with the left hand using that big length hes got Using that frame Hes a big strong guard Eventually youre not going to be able to guard his drives every single time with that frame He keeps driving relentlessly taking what the defense gives you Hes going to see success Good cut in the lane but Dawkins takes it all the way out Andrew Situs closes but the three is up No good Good positioning for Corhen for the rebound Thats his fourth Corhens doing a great job on the boards keeping these scrappy Youngstown front court people off the court And a foul on Youngstown States going to be on the big man Emanuel Zorvall Drive there He had positioning was patient pivoted through it Off the inbound BA from the corner around and out No good Witherspoon fought for the rebound but Suipa cleans it up Anditis loses control Cummings 12 to shoot Spin move by Andraitis Up and under Oh big block and down hard is Zorgvall Oh he got high in the air and then lost his footing His head is at the rim every time he jumped in the air Watch this Again another good drive Yeah has to know there theres two on you Theyre coming from the backside Thats probably the third or fourth block weve seen on a drive Really the good thing for him is that he landed more on his side and not his wrist That his wrist didnt get caught under him It looks like hes going to be okay Might have a little bruise tomorrow Hes a tough guy forehand tries to work on him and gets the foul picked up on him Thats his second foul Theres five on Youngstown State and four on the Panthers I like Pit there Actually throwing it in Hes seen a lot of action from the guards Throw it into the big fella Hes been working for you rebounding shooting at a high percentage today Lets get him some inside touches Corhand gets it to Witherspoon Witherspoon working on Robinette Crossover move It cant finish but Corands there for the rebound and the foul What a great move there from Witherspoon And again Corhand not giving up Timing it off the basket And thats some of the plays we were missing from him last year Im glad were seeing it this year Its not giving up showing he still has fresh legs Even though his minute load will increase this year he is bringing it on the boards today So a threepoint opportunity and the lead for the first time for the Panthers at stake here And it indeed happens as we see for the Panthers Mari Moore the freshman from Michigan So Pock Ralph Robinette King and Dawkins for Youngstown State Coren Miner Suipa Moore and Dunning for the Pit Panthers who hold a onepoint lead here with 810 to play Dawkins drives in tries to flush Su Alifa got the block Here comes Pit Great block there Mimi up at the rim Ari Moore drives in the lane Tries to work for a little space but Ralph able to get the block So blocks on each end Ralph 67 Were seeing some physicality in this game as Dawkins drives and loses it And a foul called on Mari Moore 21 Well were seeing some offense but also some rim protection in this game Get that out of here Hit up one music music Harping on making sure hes taking that leadership role 10 points He has half of what Pit has Five rebounds as well Pull out gets the inbound and misses Su Alia with the rebound and showing off some dribbling skills taking it over half court Panthers a onepoint lead The scoring drought is nearing three minutes for the Penguins The Penguins they started off running their sets cheering Su Loopas missed a couple around the rim ISU a chance to take the lead back Would like to see the Penguins continue running their sets and take better shots They kind of got out of the rhythm took some riskier shots And thats a good shot there right on the manlock having a homecoming party so far Saw maybe a little glare at the pit bench for a second 2220 lead for the Penguins and he steals it Here comes Pock and hes able to get it up and in Five straight for the senior from Steel Valley YSU after a scoring drought with a quick 50 run Miner cut off Plenty of time to shoot Dunning Hell stop and pop from three No good And an offensive rebound but we have a foul or a dribble out of bounds Dribble out of bounds on Suipa Andrew Situs back in getting cheering risky passes Su Lipa When youre making that pass to the wing you really got to look at the defender before you make the pass Good job from Pock playing the passing lane Cow and Westchester before here and stepping up to a whole new level D2 to D1 jump Proving himself so far today And it has really been feast or famine for Youngstown State Its either in or off Yeah its probably the third air ball from three Ball knocked loose Theyre typically a good threepoint shooting team Youngstown State Drew King now going to build on a fourpoint lead Oh nice drive by by Ralph and he is fouled going to the hoop Two shots Kind of been running that handoff action all day and Ral did a good job recognizing that theyre still overplaying Faked the handoff took it to the basket Andrew Situs the foul So two for Ralph Red Shirt Jr out of Centerville Ohio by Dayton cheering cheering transferred from Charlotte Had a 10 rebound game against Temple Really a big bodied wing Can rebound shoot you know three and D kind of guy Definitely a reason hes put into that starting lineup Brings him a lot versatility Witherspoon and Dunning in for the Panthers cheering and second free throw is good Witherspoon now with the basketball Freshman from Maryland Panthers trail by five Give and go opportunity and a foul Box shot right here Box right here And its on Black Shear It makes it hard for the refs now with some of these numbers You cant just use two hands You got to Yeah you need five hands You had to flash it twice 77 Black here Quickly head back out Carol is back in Dunning is at the line Dunning really a prolific scorer at South Alabama His first team in his conference last year he can shoot it and fill it up Slow start from the field today but like all great shooters if you get to the line sometimes that can open up the can 15 points a game just over seven rebounds And you see the numbers got so much better when he got into those big conference matchups down the stretch of the season in February March averaged 20 He can play well in big time games and really adds to the depth of this cable roster So two free throws Panthers cut the lead to three Youngsttown States shooting 53 from the floor to 31 for Pit Ralph you can tell he doesnt want the basketball and its stolen by Cummings Cummings drives in on Nelson up and under No good but a foul and the Panthers go right back to the free throw line And last year Cummings role was to come in off the bench provide a spark scoring shooting We know he loves to score but talked to Cable at shoot around today What he wants from Cummings is why not precede your offense with some good plays on defense You know were going to play more minutes Youre going to need to take that step defensively to have an impact on this team Yeah How many times you hear from coaches that offense can come from defense Hear it all the time Sometimes thats the best way If you have those jitters its the best way cuz defense is all effort really You know sometimes those jitters help you on defense Panthers made the last three free throws Theyre living off the line Only eight field goals so far in the first half Second free throw is perfect And the lead is now one Getting to the free throw line is a big part of Pits offense Get this fullourt pressure by Pit cheering Ball comes to the ball They get it to Ralph Ralph looking at options against Corhan and he dribbles it over himself as BA goes in for the steal but Nelsons able to re wrestle it away Robinette gets it back to Nelson Nelson goes up for the shot hits the floor nothing called Rebound to Corhand Here comes Witherspoon Spin in the lane Witherspoon gets it up and under to Conte who misses the shot from close He gets to the floor for the rebound and a jump ball that will be pit basketball Pitch just outworking them right now on defense and offense Theyre getting loose balls getting offensive rebounds They could just take better shots They probably be in the lead this game Youre going to look at that shot chart after the game and youre going to see a lot of zeros right around the rim things to work on Its the opening of college basketball season Big day Weve got games everywhere all the time Bound to Papa Coran Theres a size mismatch down low and the Panthers a block on Nelson as Cummings drove the lane Not that Nelson loved that call Started 32 games excuse me played 13 game 32 games Started 13 last year did Nelson play at a high level He transferred from VCU snorts No stranger to bigtime basketball One of the returners and leaders of this Youngstown Penguin team Kind of a silent guy Leads by example but Coach said when when he does speak up the team listens You know those type of leaders you dont talk all the time but when they do theyre going to listen Panthers are getting it done at the free throw line Seven of eight and have tied this game at 25 and announcer Jinx He jinxed and missed the first free throw of the game made seven straight The rebound King now guarded by Cummings who seems to be hobbling a little bit Ball is loose Zorgvall gets it to Ralph and hell stop and pop from three and make it Rich Rolf Ral there saw the mismatch Papa kind of played it thought he was going to drive and he just hesitation shot Great shot from Ralph Situs to Cummings Cummings calling out a play Papama Dukante Cummings screen there Cummings drives He goes in Oh with the lefty Brandon Cummings You see what Im saying though He seems just a little Yeah hes still hobbled from that blocking call earlier but great drive there And a foul on Coren as Youngstown States Zorball was trying to establish position Rough seeing a mismatch Eyes turn green Hand down man down So R hits that and music then Cummings comes the other way Look at that shot up and under And tell you what seems like theyve reloaded from losing their top four sports Theyre winning program This is a testament to what Fulker Fulner is able to do Hes able to reload every single year Plays in a tough conference You saw what Robert Morris did in the NCAA tournament last year They were one of the best teams right there with them So predicted third in this conference Theyre playing Pit to Nail right now Seventh turnover for Pitts Bound to King Panthers fall back And theres size from Youngstown State too at the guard position What they may lack in size in their front court They make up four in size in their back court And a turnover by Youngstown State Ba goes behind the back Stops The Panthers have set up an offense Witherspoon back to Coren Corhens open three is good Today is his day I love to see the green light from the bigs He was one of four all of last season Well thats something I K is one of the biggest one of the hardest workers on the team Hes always in the gym getting up shots He can make that shot Off balance shot I think Witherspoon got a hand on that Witherspoon has it now His step back three is no good Witherspoon goes to the floor Ball knocked around and Ralph is open deep They get it to him deep Bolock over in the corner Dawkins thought about it Got Kante in the air Gets it back Plenty of time to shoot 15 on the clock Penguins need a good possession here Olaf against Corhen Front rim no good And Papama Duante with the rebound Thats good defense Big stop there Hopefully can continue this run that theyre on It is a plus 12 on the boards but only up two Witherstone as we approach the twominute mark Cummings Shot clock now at five He just looks up Cummings in trouble Kicks it and a three Even if it would have been good wouldnt have counted A shot clock violation Good defense from Youngstown State Great defense from Youngsttown State And its not even like theyre doing anything really special Theyre just great help defense playing solid and letting Pit take bad shots All for inbound Cummings goes out Miner is in Black Shear in for Youngstown State And King has the inbound 150 to play here and what has been an entertaining first half Great first game of the season Love seeing action Two teams that want to have a good season loading Well pop the three and no good Here comes Demarco Miner Miner is bodied by Blackshere and a foul on Black Shear Thats his second YSU is four of 11 from three The Panthers are three of 10 from beyond the ark Miner will go to the line 10 fouls now on Youngstown State Talked to coach Cable about Miner Hes really the vocal leader of this team He runs the show Hes going to be the emotional leader You know hes a a lot of experience started at Oregon State averaged double figures Miner 98 points a game last year You see the assists and rebounds in game number 100 for the Chicago native and its been quite a journey for him and the steal here Miner tries to throw it lost control and a turnover by the Panthers Here comes Black Shear the other way Ball knocked loose by Andrew Sidus and will be Youngstown State ball Yeah that was a a play that you typically would see from a leader when you need a stop jump the passing lanes Good defensive stop just couldnt hang on to it when he was trying to distribute to his team started his career at South Suburban College where he won a D2 National Championship and then it just was onward and upward from there and the ball knocked free but grabbed by Robinette Six to shoot for Youngstown State A look up at the clock by Dawkins Dawkins stepped back three front rim no good Indraas good position Great rebound Got above the rim there for a rebound Great to see from Mard Hand off to Miner Miner His 15footer is good for the baseline Thats a big shot Thats what leaders do They make big time plays when your team needs it Like to see the ball in his hands more 3 See Nelson who is back in the game Carol is back in as well as YSU will hold for a shot This is a big possession here for Youngsttown State They want to go into the second half with a little bit of momentum cheering Nelson gets the screen A switch Corin on Nelson Nelson drives in and tries to throw one off the big man And Kante picks it up As we get set to start the second half you see that face from Jeff Cable He was Hes not surprised I dont think that this is a battle He knew it was going to be coming in Definitely did coming in He said he wants to establish himself I kind of like the defensive identity thats being shown on this team Holding a good threepoint shooting team a good scoring team to 28 points in the first half Robinette Carol just wide open flat foot three Bunny 11 points for Carol He can score on every single level Cant leave him open There was a little bit of miscommunication there Left him open Knocked it down Lead cut in half at three here early in the second half Panthers and Penguins here at the Peterson Event Center Jeff Hawthorne and Nick Rivers Drive by Cummings Ball knocked away Out of bounds and a foul call on Youngstown State I didnt catch the number Looked like it was on Robinette cuz they initially said number three and number three is not on the court Hes on zero Okay Got the body and free throw short Brandon Cummings with eight points one three three free throws couple of field goals and a second one is good Jason Nelson red shirt senior How nice is it to have a red shirt senior as your point So nice Just another coach on the floor Another wealth of experience When the game gets close you can rely on kind of relay that message Cumins tracks down the basketball after the miss by Carol Witherspoon Witherspoon cut off And Miner tried to go back door but good defense by Nelson 10 to shoot Miner fakes the three Kicks it out Cummings Cummings trapped on the baseline to Coren Coran three to shoot Two from the foul line No good And Kante fought for the rebound And well theyre both four there So is it four over the back or four State And it is on Robinette So a couple of quick fouls for YSU and an inbound Pava Aadu kee and that goes off of Cummings knee and out of bounds Again rough pass right there Kind of tough coming off the handoff Felt like he could have been a little more patient there 10 turnovers for the Panthers so far this game Turnovers thats something thats came to haunt the Panthers even last year Kind of had the turnover bug Top 31 in the country in turnovers Got to limit that especially before you get ACC play Robinette gives it up to Nelson Nelsons runner is no good in the first foul on Pit in the second half Thatll go on Brandon Cummings So two fouls for Cummings Thats the only Panther with more than one foul Three on Nelson two on Robin Ed two on Carol two on Zorg Ball and two on Black Shear cheering And Nelsons free throw is pure Before coming to Youngstown State Nelson made seven starts played in 35 games as a sophomore at VCU Had a 19point game that season You can just tell hes just a poised leader cheering So King comes in for Nelson A little more size in King Thats exactly it What theyll probably do is put Nelson in for obvious offensive possessions and keep King for defense Miner thought about it Kicks it back out Kante may have traveled it to Cummings Cummings creates a little room and gets fouled And thats going to be on Carol and thats his third So fouls becoming a little bit of an issue Its a big time issue Carol has to be on the floor if they want a chance to stay close down the stretch of this game Fulker needs Carol out there So Viva is back on the line Hes four of six from there as you see Carol sit down I like what Im seeing from coming Hes getting to the basket not settling for jump shots getting easy free throws Seemed like his rhythm is getting his feet under him in the second half There you see those fouls Carol obviously and Nelson both huge players for them You see that a lot from a team that kind of on paper might be a little undersized Theyre playing their hearts out playing aggressive but those first games of the season the refs they called a little tight in the first game of the season Its a known fact Pock to King King Cam Pock wide open and misses that time The tip attempt by Rolf but grabbed by Corin Panthers got to be careful Colock doesnt miss many of those And that runner cheering So the goalending called on Youngstown State and you see Ethan Fner I I didnt see it initially Looked like it was outside of the cylinder Thats tight And were going to see I think its worth a review Here we go Its come to college basketball A coachs challenge You know its a big possession You know theyre down six 3 minutes into the second half Got to keep it close That that could be a big possession there You got to use your challenges if you have them Panthers with a sixpoint lead Youngtown State challenging a ruling on the floor Passing interference Yeah to me it looked like the ball was outside the cylinder After review its a successful challenge The ball was off the rim when he tapped the ball And because I blew the whistle when they had possession Youngstown State would get the basketball back And welcome back to a new era of college basketball The challenge worked The call was reversed So that means Youngstown State will receive a second challenge But that will be it as we see the play here and it did appear that the ball was off the rim and because the whistle blew with Youngstown State in possession Youngstown State gets the basketball Again a great use of the challenge from Fulner I mean its a sixpoint lead is different than a fourpoint lead In a game like this every point every possession is going to matter Miner nearly got the turnover but Youngstown State cheering able to grab it Only down four here YSU see Panthers playing tight defense but Pock able to get it off but misses it Feast or famine from the threepoint line for the P And now Witherspoon is caught and throws it over the head of Brandon Cummings 11 turnovers for the Panthers That one just another avoidable turnover You never want to pick up your dribble down the baseline like that when youre getting doubled If he would have kept his dribble he could have dribbled it out and swung it around They could have got actually got a shot off instead of yet another turnover Here is one thing that has been surprising Tay Blacksheres only taken one shot in this game Yeah we talked before the game and Faulner was seeing high praises of his shooting ability seems one of the best shooters hes ever coached Maybe they can draw something up for him Robinette to Nelson Nelson with three and Carol with three fouls Theres Black Shears three No good Biva Cummings the deep rebound Cummings just going to take it the whole way up and under and in Cummings Hes pointing at his calf Wont be a timeout Yeah it looked just like a little cramp Well he hung there for a while Daniel Anthony and the trainer and thats good sight for Panther fans Barry Dunning will come in Maybe uh take him down to Pamelas and get some banana pancakes Look at this That was a crafty move Took off from the other side of the basket Very athletic and explosive play They got to get the all the muscles in game shape This isnt practice anymore Theres Nelly Cummings to help pit to the NCAA tournament Step back three by Dawkins is no good But off the fingertips of Dunning and out of bounds Pit leading 3933 Theres Nelly Cummings Nelly Cummings the great guards to be at Pit the past decade transfer from Colgate brought life into this program I think its going to be harder for him to beat little brother now Yeah little brother keeps scoring 30point games are definitely going to be harder Carol against Conte and Contes little too much contact with the hands and a foul on the Panthers Pit holding a sixpoint lead Thats great defense by Pit Nelson gets it to Black Shear Designed play off the front of the rim but a rebound by Carol If Youngtown State want to stay in this game they they got to start getting to the basket like they did in the first half off back cuts and driving Cant settle for threepointers against this team right now Seen Blackar be a lot more aggressive after one shot in the first half Couple of misses here on that possession and the Panthers come back with it Suipa back in the game We havent seen a lot of him recently He drives the lane and scores Thats a great train coming down aisle seven and not want to get in front of full head of steam to a leap Great drive Great touch Blackshere a quick pop and Blackshere scores for the first time tonight Now one of four from three Hes not scared to shoot it I think hes probably shot the last four possessions for this team I think coach has said something with an adjective about shooting the basketball the second half Cam Coran drives in has the lane and scores with the left hand over Robinette Hes banged up lower leg injury as well Wonder if he went knee on knee Might be a little Charlie Gordon Well the last time a player left like that Eva Cummings is now back in the game Yeah the potassium from those banana pancakes at Pamos has really got him back in the game It is hard but you know youre nervous for that first game Maybe youre not drinking as much fluids as you want Yeah youre just exerting muscles at a different level Its really hard to simulate practice Even in exhibitions its hard to simulate game day Kante and Cummings in Nelson Blackshere Zordvall who has the basketball there Carol and Dawkins Blackshere tries to hand it off Zorg ball loses it to Inditis Noas down low to Papa Papa head fake Oh and back from behind is Zorg Ball but Su Lipa grabs the lead rebound and he has a chance to finish the threepoint play Youngtown State they cant get anything going in the paint Everythings been tough fadeaway shots threepoint shots but there great block But again second chance opportunities Pit is dominating on the boards right now Typically the team that wins the rebounding battle is the team thats going to win the game And this is really the first time in Su Lipas life where hes just dedicated himself to basketball Hes also a very accomplished high school rugby player in Australia as you we could see that Definitely could see that I think the Pittsburgh Steelers could be in here watching them as well You know theres a retired jersey up there Number 15 Hes not quite that size but it kind of reminds me of the type of game that Sam Clancy played He didnt play any football And then the NFL said Well take you Youre built like a football player Had a great NFL career Yep And is is a Hall of Fame person here at the University of Pittsburgh and how he represents King with it Zorg ball 13 to shoot Youngstown State now down nine Biggest lead for the Panthers Nelson loses it Gets it back Five to shoot Nelson will stop and pop Big three for YSU That was a big shot But again if Pitts force those shots every possession theyre not going to make all of them That was a great defense possession but better offense Nelson hitting a big shot keeping his team in the game Nelson must have felt like that shot clock went about a minute and a half Miner grabbing it as Nelson was overplaying 13 Oh nice head fake Three is good Great jab step Youngtown playing aggressive defense Thats taking advantage of aggressive defense using ball fakes using head fakes using jab steps Thats how you create good shots Nelson with the hesitation goes all the way through to Carol Suipa closes Now he goes around Suipa Good switch to the left hand by Chris Carroll Brandon Cummings from the corner at three After a slow start for both teams shooting has picked up here in the second half And its all started from Pits defense finally wearing on him and Jorges going to pick up his third foul as he is trying to keep Zorgvall out of the lane Good little jab step Wow great head fake jab step Hes too good of a shooter to leave open Great shot from Noas Craitis Cummings pouring it on These threepoint shots starting to pull away a little bit Youngtown States going to need some good offensive possessions here to keep it close If not Pits been known to cheering blow the leads Sword ball shot is perfect Tante and Witherspoon are back in Miner sits down Su Lia Andrew Situs Witherspoon Cummings and Conte Zord Ball King Nelson is the missed free throw comes Su Liva Blackshere and Carol YSU Pit pushing the pace here on miss shots Theyre trying to get baskets before Youngtown can set up that zone Witherspoon Oh he has Su Lipa in the corner Suipa not bashful to shoot it Misses it fight for the rebound that Blackshere comes down with YSU down nine as we approach the 12minute mark Nelson has the ball nearly taken away but he holds on I think that was actually a good coaching decision by Falner to just change things up change momentum to switch to his own Finally got to stop the bleeding Defense by Popa Ball is loose Seven Ball on the ground Black Shear has it Gets it over to Nelson Nelson three Oh what resilience for Youngstown State to find a way to get that ball and then get an open three again Just another clutch shot at the end of a shot clock situation for the red shirt senior Nelson willing this team back into the game Bodies everywhere Cummings kicks it out in through Now thats how you beat a zone drive knife your way through it Its going to create gaps miscommunication and when youre hot youre hot And the Panthers are hot Four of five from three but the Penguins are four of four in their last field goals Starting to pick up here Panthers lead at 5445 1117 to play Been a second half team Nelson quickly breaks that pressure YSU shooting overall 42 The Panthers 429 Thats how tight its been A plus seven at the free throw line A big difference in this one Nelson is stopped Double team Kicks it out Voids the three Second call Blackshere Inveritis with the defense But Black Shear Wow How long can they keep this up these late last second shot clock threepointers Black Shear hes starting to heat up Him and Nelson trying to will their team back into this game Six in the second half after nothing in the first Kante Witherspoon drives in about 10 ft falling away No good Su Alipa tips it but numbers for Youngstown State Pock three No good But in recitis fights for it but Carol grabs the rebound puts it up and in and Youngstown State within four Now will you give Pock an assist for that one Yes we got to be consistent He is not bashful of putting it up Hes going to put it up Maybe a depth perception thing Thats the maybe his third air ball Ive seen Typically a incredible shooter Hes right up on Cummings The screen ball is loose and we got a ball off the foot and a kick So it will be Pit basketball Thats working for a three Thats working for a three Thats great defense from Pit You cant even Thats one of those shots you cant even really be mad But you can be mad at that Looks like the bigs are a little tired there Got caught slipping Carols hungry for some baskets Havent hasnt had quite the amount of minutes hes used to playing So he wants to make a difference on the team right now Jim Corham back in Good anticipation by Ralph He thought Cummings touched it but it will be pit basketball Situs will inbound seen a lot of this lineup in this game I think coach Cable likes this lineup Likes Witherspoon with the ball The size advantage So Alipa cutting but Ralph able to knock it free Here comes Black Shear gets it over to Pock Pock to King King Blackshere looks good in and out And rebound fought for and controlled by Cam Corin That one looked good could have brought him within one Tell the bench entire Youngsttown State bench theyre on their feet right now Cummings drives right side and then I think Black Shear is going to get the foul Thats big right there Thats big Yeah Black Sharers been their offensive spark that they really needed to stay into this game but the foul trouble and having to guard Cummings I mean Cummings has been relentless driving to the basket Got to put your hands on him How you supposed to defend him Miner just came in in the game and misses the shot Dawkins is in for YSU and a held ball Su Alia able to get essentially what is that right there second opportunity Thats a winning play right there Thats not giving up even when you know Ralph thought he had it Thats not giving up on the play Still going after it causing a tie up and give your team another possession And rolling in and fouled is Coren Cam Pock is going to pick up the foul Pock one of the only players not in foul trouble for Youngstown Got caught with his hand in the cookie jar Imagine one night youre scoring 35 on Clarion Then the other night youre here at the Peterson Event Center and Incitis misses bodies on the floor Oh he missed him there And Situs was open early Thats why when you have the ball on the top of the key you always got to scan when youre about to change it and rotate the basketball or move the basketball to the other side of the floor You always got to scan Dont get caught on the strong side Indraitis played 15 games at Iowa State averages just over two points a game cheering Play has played a lot of international ball for Lithuania Even though he grew up in Illinois as just another top 100 guy that Cables been able to bring into the program Cable does one of the best jobs recruiting getting transfers in getting the buy into his program and a near steel and weve got some indecision I dont think either official saw it So a jump ball which will be Youngstown State balls I dont know about that one cheering And I I appreciate the honesty instead of the ref just saying you know one way or another If you dont know you dont know Yep They didnt see it Oh it was off of Youngstown State So the Penguins get the ball and a break but lets take a look at it here That is well its not over Yeah I dont know if is there conclusive evidence that right After review successful challenge it should be this ball on the baseline Shot clock 20 seconds Red was last to test the ball So there you go And Ethan Falner is talking to one of the officials right now Were kind of navigating through a new rule You know youre trying to pull an upset Yeah At a ACC school an hour from you could huge win for the program Plenty of time Every possession matters this point of the game Theres not many left Miner has him with 10 going up against a much bigger player A step back 15footer for DeMarco Miner Thats just a dagger Winning the successful challenge after your team think you got to stop Miner hitting a big shot cheering Brandon Cummings with tight defense on King Nearly reached there Like the defensive effort Im seeing from Cummings cheering Hes really putting pressure on these guards Wearing them out Miner gets the steal Kante has it Gets ahead to Andrew Situs Thats an electric play Good hands probably Good hands for Miner Thats team defense having the wherewithal to look up Advance it up Anditis slam The Oakland Zoo excited the Panthers Good hands here And look at the big man with the assist Andrew Sight is showing he can get up Show out boy Show out right now is hes such a great allaround athlete Sometimes that gets a little overshadowed because hes such a great shooter but look how high he gets up runs the floor twostep bangs it out Hes having a big impact on this game Hes had double digits in each the scrimmage and the exhibition game and double digits again here tonight Panthers shooting 60 in the second half to 44 for YSU YSU is going to get back in this game Theyre going to need some defensive stops Luck with Kante on him Robinettes got a size advantage but Miner comes away with the basketball Anditis walks Great steal from Miner We call that pull in the chair Sometimes you have that bigger guy on you You feel like theres a mismatch he thinks he can overpower you pull that chair rip it right from him As a small big man tell you nothing infuriates you more than having the advantage down there Either falling down because of the pulled chair having the ball taken from you Definitely Robinette kicks it out Open three Pock no good Kante with his ninth rebound for Papa All right seven minutes left in the game Those are going to have to start going down if Youngstown wants to make this a close game cheering Eva Cummings in double figures as well Noas looking and losing the basketball out of bounds 14 turnovers by the Panthers They averaged last year 10 a game Yeah a lot of them unforced turnovers too Bad pass bobbling the ball I know when they watch film going into the next game thats going to have to be a point emphasis Got to take care of the basketball Carol you would think would be a guy thats got to do something here for YSU Black Shear has got four fouls Carols got three Stops and pops and hits the three over Cam Is he on his headset Did he hear you just say that I think he felt it cuz he saw the mismatch Its a good little screen action to get that mismatch get the big on him and shoot it right over him Four times last year Youngstown State came back from doubledigit deficits to win They were down 10 now down seven Coren just being hugged down low Theyre not going to give up Theyre a senior laden team Not afraid of the big stage Good defense by Nelson Cummings goes down and Nelson gets called for a body cheering Thats Thats a tough call Fourth foul on Nelson cheering Cummings has been doing a great job of getting to the line Yeah kicked his leg out a little bit there draw the foul but whatever works I mean you got to give room to to land Yeah he did kind of lunge forward into his landing zone but there also was a little bit of showmanship little kick Its a tough call with all the physicality weve seen today And you can see it on the face of Ethan Faulner All great scorers They can they can draw that foul They know how to sell it And Im going to guess that Ethans going to point out in his post game that the Panthers have shot 20 free throws to eight for YSU but the Panthers have taken it to the rim more often Yeah theyve been more aggressive And look at Kante Double figure rebounds The offensive look Three from the corner No good That would have been a dagger Here comes Nelson Nelson driving with Carol up and in And Nelson goes down hard Theres a hardition there Yelling and the officials call a technical foul on Ethan Faulner I understand Faulners frustration there It looked like there was a little bit of excessive contact there Maybe could have been and one kind of has been a little bit of a foul disparity in the game Just frustrated cheering As a coach youre trying to scratch and claw get back into this game I dont blame him Marco Miner will shoot the free throw Take a look at it here Get up strong A lot of Yeah a lot of body contact there Cant fall down aggressively like that on a There was some contact there Like I I get what Falners saying here I mean definite especially after what you called down here Yes I get his frustation for a little bit of little bit of tip for tat Thats always happening Quick pro So the Panthers have the basketball in a ninepoint lead 556 to play Bound to Miner Four fouls on Black Shear four on Nelson Both are on the court Papacante and a foul on Carol That will be Carols fourth State defense be playing defense on eggshells right now The three of their biggest contributors in this second half are all in foul trouble Corin gets the friendly roll 16 points for the senior Make it 17 Go with eight rebounds Nelson drives the lane and just had nowhere to go but gets it back Blackshere high arcing three from the corner No good Anditis with the rebound He gets it to Cummings That was a great contest from Apocante cheering Cam Corin driving the lane Just couldnt finish Ball knocked free again Here comes Cam Pock Nelson wanted it in the corner Pock will go in contested and the bucket Yeah thats one of those plays if youre Nelson you tell your teammate you better make that shot if you dont pass to me Better make it Pock did Tough finish Youngtown State still hanging around and a steal by Ralph Thats one way Youngsttown States going to get back in this game if Pit continues with the loose turnovers Take care of the ball Black Shear behind the back I think Pocks always in set position to shoot Aliu popante and a whistle Great fast break I dont know what the whistle was but its a threeonone fast break cheering Three passes in a bucket Simple basketball All alioops dont have to lead to a dunk Didnt have his footing He had like some baby deer legs there Nelson has it Hes being serenated by the Oakland Zoo cheering Cam Coran now with a nine rebound game to go with 17 points That threepoint shot was crucial to get it to single digits Kind of running out of time here We approach the fourminute mark Cummings stops at the foul line and travels Jeff Cable looking for his He never had shoes playing basketball at home and he wants to help out kids that cant afford them So a shoe drive againstm So if youre a Pitts fan make sure to remember that theyre looking for new shoes anywhere up to size 14 because you could be a kid and wear 14 if youre papa Definitely Im sure he has some family members his size Nice to see him using his name do a little good Hes hes very passionate about it when you talk to him about it like and there you see some some different shoes Doesnt matter what the design is Just looking to help out some kids especially this time of year Black Shear has it And may have gotten away with the travel ball fought for amongst Panthers And another offensive rebound and two opportunities there for YSU to get within single digits but unable to finish And theyre playing hard I mean getting three offensive rebounds there three good looks couldnt go through Thats just been the story of Youngsttown State second half Ball knocked away Pock has it but Miner able to get it back Doyas to Cam Coran 19 points for the senior Thats what I like to see in a game like this First game of the season both teams are still playing hard and theres still a lot of teach tape down the stretch Even when theyre Youngtown States down double figures there are still things that they can pull from Miner first You look at the ball on the floor and Miner able to keep his hands extended A no look pass and a great feed from Noyas to Cam Coran Blackshere has it Spins in the lane Fires one up No good Double double now for Coren We know the ball was knocked away from him by Nelson And again every shot state looks like its just so tough Everything has taken so much effort its not really sustainable when youre trying to come back into a game YSU needs a stop cheering Miner driving ball knocked free Balls on the ground but Miner has it No stops pops but Coran gets the offensive rebound and is fouled off the Andrewitis miss Another offensive rebound from Corin and another opportunity at the free throw line to add to his stat count Panthers are 20 of 25 You see Corens night but 20 of 25 on the free throw line YSU is five of eight This is just a great game Great first game Hes going to build his confidence Hes going to slide into that leadership role of this team Bid expected a tough game with Youngstown State and they got it Its been a good game Both teams have played hard the entire game You know been sloppy at times but I mean theres going to be sloppy games when each team gets into conference play as well So got to get used to dialing it out in the trenches Scoring drought is over three minutes long for Youngstown State Its not like they havent had looks Theyre one of 0 for six One of its last eight are the Penguins Picked third in the Horizon League Nelson has it back Witherspoon on him Black Shear spins in the lane and gets it into the corner Corner three is off the side No good Miner comes down with it and Miner as Dawkins was trying to get the push off Witherspoon fakes drives the lane kicks to Corhan and Corhan dribbles one that hits the baseline Just another turnover It looks like its going to be a pit win A pit win and teach tape Mhm A lot of teach tape here They did Theres a lot of great things I mean the defensive effort is something Cable is going to be able to hang his hat on when hes talking to his players I think they played great defense today and that thats what ultimately won them the game Their defense turned into offense Theres always something for coaches even up 15 135 to play the frustration of the foul from a freshman Yeah I mean thats something hes going to have to learn You got to learn to play defense without fouling Thats something Coach Cable he knew how physical this team was cheering early on in the summer and preseason workouts He knew how physical they were So one thing he did during practice was bring in some referees to actually simulate how games are going to be called because thought is kind of unrealistic You guys are playing hard We like it But I mean this isnt the Big East back in you know early 2000s This is this is the ACC Theyre theyre going to call those fouls cheering What are you saying I know what youre saying I remember those games Versitis is going to kick forehand who flushes Thats just an unselfish play He could have laid that up but cheering get your boy 20 points You know you want to run clock but when its that obvious you want to run clock but you also want to win by 20 You know Nelson cheering will pop front rim no good ball knocked off of Zorgvall and hit basketball again injuritus unselfish play gets him up in gets the shot blocker up in the air so he can guarantee his big man a dunk Panthers will win the first game of the season And next up for Pit is Thursday or excuse me Friday against Long Longwood for the Penguins They get to go to Arizona Theyre taking on Grand Canyon And Nelson lays it up and in Grand Canyon And thats also a team theyve been to the tournament a lot over the past couple years They always bring in some good guys Should be a great battle for Youngsttown State Another test for their nonconference schedule So Cam Corham with 23 points Brandon Cummings with 18 Noitis with 13 What are some of the things that really stuck out to you here Nick as the Panthers are going to dribble this out in a 7459 win over Youngstown State Was stood out most for me was the defensive effort today I mean defense it was so hard for Youngstown State to even get a good look the entire second half Even the shots they made were bad shots And then rebounding I mean that was a big question Can our front court rebound Are we too under size Are we going to be able to compete with some good teams that can rebound We showed that today I like the effort They play hard You can tell they like each other
