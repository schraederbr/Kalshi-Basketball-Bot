guard is on point especially when the Blue Devils invade Blackbird Well Duke with two guys under the weather Caleb Foster will not start this one Dame S also feeling ill Nicholas Amenya starting instead for the Duke Blue Devils They win the opening tip and we are underway They come in 191 Virginia Tech at 166 Camboozer his first touch backing his way into the painted area and a kick to his brother Kaden who cant knock it down The tip on two occasions wont go for Duke but great spacing Kaden Boozer going to have a number of opportunities throughout this game Ben Hammond was the original double team on Cameron Boozer Now the Hookies with the possession at times looking very much like an NCAA tournament team In fact it would be tough to imagine they wont make the tournament at this point They just knocked off Georgia Tech this week End of the corner for Ben Hammond He really makes him go but a turnover But OB a lot of that has to do with the positional size Youre talking about a 64 point guard and Kaden Boozer Defending Ben Hammond is different when youre playing against that type of size for a Dominion guard Duke the second tallest team in the country Boozer leaning inside Contact He wanted a whistle did not get one there Virginia Tech on the attack A Dallas cant hit and thats been a big problem for the 69 freshman from Athens in Greece One of the finest passing guys in the conference but hes having a lot of trouble making shots He really has And defense have adjusted They saw what he did earlier One of three ACC players with multiple 30point games as Boozer goes up top to Gumba throwing down the first two of the game 611 sophomore with the slam And Duke strikes first cheering Heres Hammond coming in averaging 13 points a game 511 sophomore from Manasses Virginia Had a 20point game against Georgia Tech We talked to John Shy the Duke head coach about him He said I think hes the key to everything they do as he gets inside and leaves it short He really is He had high praise for Ben Hammond Of course John Shy saw a lot of Ben Hammond in high school as well as in EBL because Ben Hammond was teammates with two guys that that John Shy signed Darren Harris Patrick Gumba All three of these guys played together for both PBI and team takeover So John Shy very familiar with Ben Hammonds game Hooks as always very good hanging on to the basketball They rarely turn it over Lal up top Got a good look but its in and out for the 68 senior Hes just now 4 for 26 from threepoint land Yeah this been a struggle for Toby the Wild shooting the basketball from the perimeter Thats one of the reasons he came back out of the NBA draft as Boozer is able to take him off the bounce And one of the things that we hear a lot about is that supposedly Cameron Boozer struggles against athleticism Well hes not there Hes not going to find a better athlete to play against tonight So well see what his production looks like against all comers 24 points 10 rebounds a game You can make a very strong argument hes been the best player in America up and over And the slam by Lal Well we talked about the best athlete on the floor And thats a great example of Tony Lal looking down at the rim catching the lob That gets him going inside Castle Coliseum Evans with a fall away Cant hit it Our officials today Pat Driscoll Chase Shaw and Lee Cassell Hookies cant strike on the other end Nice find by Dallas but give Patrick Dumba a lot of credit getting back defending that opportunity by Hansbury cheering And again a very quick strike gets Isaiah Evans slithering inside Hes been so good the last six or seven games He really has But Obie how about the pass from Gumba Top of the key John Shier talked to us pregame about his best three players could possibly be all in the front court when you consider Blueser Uhoh Uhoh is right Jaylen Bedford going airborne Bedford doesnt want to hear anything about the best players for the Blue Devils He just wants a bucket and gets it done emphatically So a couple of monster slams for the Hokes and it has gotten loud in this building on a snowy Saturday You talk about elevation couple of times Sensational ducks screaming cheering Theres a feeding up top from Malik Brown Lets fly and hits it We had this conversation earlier John Sire just wants Malik Brown to shoot the open ones He says hes more than capable of knocking down threes Malik Brown checking in and taking the first opportunity and taking advantage of it And they left it behind Nearly picked off Abdales scooped it up Shot clock down to eight Into the corner for Hansbury Got it And somewhat of a slow closeout by Boozer not respecting Hansbury who made three three field goals against Louisville which is a careerhigh for him Shooting the basketball better from beyond the arc One of the best players in the conference this season 15 points nine rebounds a game And a pick stolen away by Lal with the quick hands Kobe almost wish he didnt mishandle that one I wanted to see what Toby Law was going to do in the open floor with that much base Yeah you werent alone here Bedford on the drive Quick hands of Elite Brown Leads the world in deflections Abdales catches fires got a great look but again couldnt bury it Hes just having a really hard time Last three games he is 8 for 40 Hes only shooting 188 from three as Isaiah Evans lines one up and is able to knock it down But you talk about Abdales who got off to such a great start earlier this year 33 against Providence but he has really struggled in ACC play to score the basketball not even in double figures Well talk about him being an NBA lottery pick when the season got underway Dallas with the feed Hes an excellent passer The wall with the spin running into traffic Boozer came over to help He got it anyway And thats just athleticism The wall was walled off by both Boozer and Malik Brown Two elite defenders stopping him from getting to the basket but the athleticism just allows him to jump over top of both defenders and get a bucket Brown left alone for the triple Cant connect Now Dallas around the back Hanssbury rolling to the basket but its the wall open Hes had a sensational dunk here in the first half Cant hit the threepointer cheering Caleb Foster under the weather but now into the game Duke on top 119 Quick moving cheering Foster will line one up Got it He looked fully healthy there Yeah great sign to see Kayla Foster knock down his opp first opportunity from three Shooting the basketball better and with more confidence as a way 34 ACC play for Foster He knocked down one against Louisville on Monday as well Took six out of 11 from the field Hanssbury with the high post A Dallas already under 13 minutes Expect this game to fly today Hammond to Hanssbury A Dallas will swing it The open shooter Bedford Well they did everything they wanted to do there Great ball movement OB You said on point with that one However if youre going to beat the Blue Devils who are number two in the net rankings you got to make those opportunities Youre going to have to make threes to beat Duke because theyre so difficult to beat on this end of the floor Still havent had a timeout Now a foul Lwal will get hit The 68 senior trying to contain Cam Boozer Toby Lwal the 68 senior You talk about skywalking on a Saturday Look how high hes up Hes a foot and a half over the rim on that slam here in Castle Coliseum Best win so far Triple overtime the thriller against rival Virginia on New Years Eve and a quick inbound strike for Duke The great touch by Gumbbo was unable to get to the rim and Patrick Gunga going up against his former teammate Gerdock Christian Gerdock checking into the game These guys were also teammates at Paul V 6 before Gerak transferred to Gonzaga College Pretty number two for the Hokes Former Duke Deml now into the fray Fight for the rebound And look at Brown going into the corner hustling for it Its off him and out of play But just one of the great defenders in the country Over 100 deflections for the Duke Blue Devil And Obie you talked about Jaden Shu He was part of John Shires first ever recruiting class at Duke As a matter of fact he and Caleb Foster were in the same class at Duke So you think about two guys who have been teammates before And nearly stepped out Heres Shoots who can really fire it off the back of the iron there Hes hitting 41 from three Virginia Tech Chile so far beyond the arc One for seven Dar also into the game who is normally a starter but under the weather So both he and Caleb Foster who are two of their better perimeter defenders cheering now checking into the game and giving it a chance Im not sure whos feeling 100 these days Duke certainly not on that turnover as they kick it back and they lead it 169 And well take immediate timeout here 1132 to go in the first half at Blackburg Hookie students the big event returns on April 11th And this is your chance to join thousands of other Hookies as they embody Frozen Be part of the largest studentled service tradition by registering as a volunteer or a homeowner today helping out Its rig that Cory Alexander who knows his way around Virginia in the snow Thats me in the front seat He handed me a manual He said This is how you get into this rig OB Take your time Dont get hurt OB that vehicle is aptly named after my niece Kendall Brooks who is a graduate of Virginia Tech in 2020 And again it is perfect for the weather and what we were seeing Our bosses asked How many how are you going to get there I said Im going to drive Dont worry Ill be fine Made sure I got my guy to the game That was awfully sweet of you When you showed up in that thing Im like Were going to be just fine today Were going to make it to the arena Thats job one Foster up top to Gungbo And looking inside Darren Harris the sophomore from Virginia now into the game for the Blue Devils Gunko will launch one Had a great look Its been a trouble spot for him though just four for 27 for the year at the three And thats the only area where hes had any issues Had a great year thus far for the Blue Devils And as a playmaker is trying to attack the paint as well But Obie think about that possession alone as Malik Brown comes up with the steal his tip Second effort up and good But John Shire told us pregame quite possibly our three best players could be all in the front court You talk about Boozer of course but then you start talking about Patrick Gumba who could be a first round pick as well this year and Malik Brown who was really the leader of this team both on the defensive end of the floor and locally So you think about those three guys how much they have the basketball in their hands as of late cheering Maybe not the most fluid lineup offensively when those guys are playing together but defensively they can lock you up What a lot of it has to do with the versatility of each and every one of those guys Sar off the fake and takes a hit along the baseline We are already under 10 minutes of the first half 18 to later today but we will absolutely be locked in Great action on the ESPN family networks ESPN1 has a great lineup on his own Twopoint guy Sweet move to his lefts And again he has the ability to score against even bigger players on the block because of his strength Strong lower base Reminds me not of his dad but one of my former teammates by the name of Tim Duncan who you could not move off the block Hammond got tied up Shoot off his hand Shot clock to eight Heres Hammond cheering Theyve done a good job quieting him so far on the drive Hell scoop it up and in So that gets him a little bit noisy He was huge in that triple overtime win against Virginia with 30 points in 42 minutes And he really has been the key to the success of this team We had them in Atlantis where they lost their last two games with Neil Abdales playing at the point guard position Another beautiful find by Gumbbo But Obie that goes back to the point One of the things that John SH used the week off from the return from California was was to work on playing his bigs at the top of the keyboard cutting and spacing Perfect example of Gumba dropping the dime Oh so impressive to win both of those games in California come home and blow out Louisville Tough shot from a difficult angle Wont go but the Hokes will head to the line But even with Dorne playing so far off hes able to find his former high school teammate current Duke teammate Darren Harris on the back cut I talked with Darren pregame and just playing against Ben You know that these guys are going to have a little extra juice going up against one of their former teammates and still very good friend Sar picks up the foul and thatll put Bedford to the line 64 Recently reached a reached a 1000 career point total graduate out of Austin Texas stops at a junior college Oral Roberts and UNLV And Cory he talked about playing junior college basketball and in a very respectful way He said it made me in the right phrase he said It may be the dog I am Well and a lot of that has to do with accommodations The resources arent the same as they are in Blackburg So the travel isnt going to be the same as it is when youre taking the private plane to trips But I agree wholeheartedly You consider and Jay Befford has really played his best basketball in ACC play Hes grateful for this opportunity to be here in Blackburg and has shown it on the court Just picked up the foul 2213 Duke and the ball Boozer with the kick to Kaden Boozer inside the onehander for the basket And a nice job by Kate Boozer Not a great threepoint shooter So still driving the close out from the nice find from his brother out of the double team in the post These two look for each other very effectively They better CCs not have it Everybody talks about Carlos No Cece Mom is the one thats making sure everything goes correctly Lal gives it up to Hammond Hammond tries to feed inside for Lal again rolling to the iron It never got there Boozer tiptoeing through and slams it down cheering 2613 Duke has doubled up the Hokes And great play We talk about looking for each other Is Cameron Boozer coming up with the ball Finding his brother and his teammate who gets it back for the nice euro step And then the finish as Toby Lal tries to tackle track him down and OB When you talk about that rivalry you get an opportunity to go up and see this young man Cameron Boozer play against Caleb music Wilson Those two guys were teammates in winning the Nike EBL Championship Peach Jam as Carlos Boozer looks on as CC sits to his left But you think about the fact that Caleb and Cameron the two best freshman in the ACC going at it next Saturday Cant wait for that Carlos by the way still has one of the great beards youre going to see anywhere Phenomenal So envious Obie I need to see you with the beard Wait wait If youre envious I need to see that Do not want to see that believe me Bank shot wont go for Hansbury And Duke has locked in a 2613 lead Tech started out shooting the ball well but since then one for seven after going 4 for9 out of the gate Boozer and another slam and this time its Malik Brown But Obie its two 69 guys playing pick and roll action And more importantly its Dukes leading assist man the 69 Cameron Boozer making the nice find to Malik Brown up top Thats why I think hes the player of the year right now I I agree with you all that separation Hammond with the shot the ability and the willingness to pass And I think thats where people need to be able to differentiate I dont know that hes the number one pick in the NBA draft but I do think hes the best player in the country and thats based upon his production every aspect of the game And even on the defensive end Cameron Boozers making a difference for his team Foul with a kick out for Evans Evans to the paint goes to the left hand and lays it in Isaiah Evans continues to improve his game attacking off the bounce not just a shooter anymore as hes able to show that he can score at the 10 as well You said some great games 28 against Florida State in the top six in scoring in the conference So the Hokes falling behind by 15 at home cheering Ansburys open and knocks down a triple And thats where the Hulk is going to have to make more of those Theyre going to have to be able to compete from beyond the threepoint line Dukes defense keeps you out of the paint And when you do get to the paint they resist you at the rim You got to make threes to beat the Blue Devils Duke has beat him in the paint 228 already to this point Boozer outside and yet another thing he can do to beat you And in reverse now its Malik Brown finding Boozer for the bucket So both these guys are adept at passing the basketball and sharing on both ends of the floor Now Buzzu with nine 3318sbury running right into Brown will pick up the foul of 515 remaining We figured this would be a fastmoving half It has been and Ansbury down on his back and in some pain there after that collision These teams dont foul a lot and they dont turn the ball over very much So that usually leads to a rapid pace and thats what weve had Well see if Hsbury is going to continue Theyre going to need a trainer to come and take a look at him Womens college basketball on Sunday and a couple of terrific games Baylor and West Virginia at 1 Number 10 Oklahoma against number four Texas to follow at 300 on ABC Oklahoma playing great basketball Leah Chavez those guys are one two combination one of the better ones in the country and going on the road trying to get a win over Madison Booker who at SEC media day you should hear the coaches both mens and womens coaches raving about Madison Booker and how she may be the most talented player in the country in either side of the game tapped away Another deflection there by Malik Brown Gets his hands on everything Hes had as many as 12 deflections in a game this season 3318 Ammani Hanssbury back in after a quick sit on the bench So a great sign for Mike Young as he returns fast from that collision And Dallas swinging it outside for Bedford and a triple looked good coming off the hand A foul on the deck against the Duke Blue Devils Rare to see Beford miss a wideopen look that badly Nice find by Hansbury to get Beford to look at the top of the key Unable to get it to go but Ammani Hanssbury continues to be aggressive attacking the offensive glass That was truly the key to when Virginia Tech was able to beat Virginia here in that three overtime game They dominated the offensive glass Great game Maybe the game of the year in the conference so far His would win in triple overtime Hokis with four overtime wins this season which ties a school record Dallas again a really good look with that elbow jumper Just cant connect Yeah And again getting to his spot at 69 He can shoot over the majority of his defenders but it honestly seems as though he may be hitting that freshman wall right now OBs got to find a way to push through that Meanwhile Duke has made eight consecutive shots They finally missed one Foster knocked out a play off him And Duke looking very comfortable on this snowy day 3318 in Blackburg music Duke 301 in their last 31 ACC games In fact they have the best record in college basketball the last two years 54 and five over the last two years I mean youre talking about elite and honestly a play away from making it to the national championship game last year the last two seasons alone 30 and one in ACC action last year with Kanipple and Cooper Flag who just went toetotoe in an epic game in the NBA Bedford with the pass That shot wont go out of the corner by Hammond Another offensive rebound by Hansberry Dallas with a shot clock to 11 Chase to the baseline Gets the pass free Hammond again Good range and sticks it But smart play by Ben Hammond Great job defensively to get out and run him off the threepoint line where hes shooting 70 in his last two games But going to the midrange it still counts Obie I dont care what they try to tell you The midrange is alive and well Left wide open Gunga And this one he will nail from threepoint land And Gungba capable as is Malik Brown Both guys reluctant to shoot the basketball as right now Mike Youngs defense is daring both of those guys to shoot it from the perimeter Now Duke with all the shot making and a reach and a foul by Jimena with 313 remaining in the half We talked about these two former Duke Blue Devils going after each other Look at Cooper Black 49 Continental with 34 John Shy says it should be a tie for rookie of the year I think I might agree with coach SH just this one time Were going to learn how work This is something that people are lost in our society Looking forward to the rest of it too Duke right now looking very commanding a 3620 lead and the Hokes with the basketball trying to win their 17th Its going to take a major come from behind effort here today on their home floor Obie to coach Greens point often times when you leave guys open as Shar picks up the foul running into Dallas along the sideline But when you leave guys open and you say Were going to dare them to shoot Were not going to guard them You also dont have any pressure on the basketball which makes those passes even easier And see right now whats happening is Malik Brown Patrick Gumble these guys are standing on the perimeter but they can survey the entire music court because they dont have anyone there pressuring the basketball making it very easy to make those back door passes etc And they have 10 assists already you know with three minutes to go in the half resulting in a ton of dunks Dallas swings inside on a nice feed there for Hansbury And great execution to get Hanssbury the look the back screen by Van Hammond coming up and just allowing Abdollis to look over his defender and make the nice find Tough to score in the paint against Duke with their size and their athleticism Boozer draws the double Foster has to go and chase it He gets to it right in midcourt Shot clock to seven Boozer turning on Hansbury over the top and another slam This time its Gun Bud But thats the problem when you try to pressure Boozer because he can beat you off the bounce and more importantly he can find his teammates for his third assist He has three assists himself Looks like a pro doesnt he Oh no He He doesnt just look like him He is one OB And again hes played the exact same way for a very long time as Hansbury is able to knock down his second three of the game And the Hokes are going to need much more of that OB notice how open they are Duke is going to pack the paint keep them out of the paint force them to have to beat him from beyond the arc Well if they can hit those threepointers they make about 35 cheering Only turning it over eight times a game So theyre very good with the basketball Well the hookies always are under Mike Young You see the difference But Obie okay Christian Gerock is up defending Gumba on that possession and it ends up being a turnover because that pass is much more difficult when you have a defender in your face Bedford yes leaning inside for the onehander and the Hokes making a run as they cut it to 11 cheering And that brings a timeout for John Sh So they were sailing to halftime Not so much anymore because the Hokes have come alive offensively 3827 and a 20 to go Sh Obie we talked about pressuring the basketball and how it makes it much more difficult as a passer Christian Gerach now takes away the air space of Patrick Gumba And look at the pass Its different than the lob he threw to Evans on a previous possession This one is a beyond the outstretched hands of Isaiah Evans Ends up being a turnover and allowing Virginia Tech to score on the other end of the floor A change defensively on the fly by Mike Young to press those bigs when they catch the basketball has resulted in a positive stop cheering in for Kaden Boozer Gungba playing up high Gives it back off for Foster whos coming off the bench today cheering Gungba trying to get close Loose ball scooped up by Foster and another slam Its Camboozer And the Blue Devils done a tremendous job keeping their eyes up as they attack the basket But more importantly theyve had outlets guys going to the rim catching those lobs Another great example of that by Bruiser loser with 11 Duke with seven dunks here in the first half and a whistle stopping the clock at 49 seconds before the break And thatll go against Aaron Harris of the Blue Devils the sophomore So the Hokes to check it in from the baseline Down by 13 of Dallasos and he will be shoved on the baseline and picks up the foul Takes the hit by GBA will pick up number one And thatll be the seventh team foul against the Duke Blue Devils So Abdales to the line 468 before halftime latest mock draft have Neil Abdales as a the 25th pick So a later first round pick in the first round of this consider the fact that this young man was in the NBA draft last year withdrew his name and decided to come to Virginia Tech He has absolutely increased his draft stock from what he did earlier in the year but at 68 69 his ability to shoot the basketball more importantly to be able to make plays off the bounce His passing is really what makes people look at his potential You get an opportunity to see at the 2026 NBA mock draft of course which means absolutely nothing right now Stolen away by Ben Hammond Hammond on the attack Yes went right at the big with the body Now the closest the Hokes have been since the opening minutes of the game cheering Dan Boozer 15 seconds before halftime cheering Boozer on the wall backs it up to the logo and a whistle off the ball with 74 seconds to go Yeah theyre going to get Jaden shoot impeding Darren Harris trying to come up and set the screen However the Hokes are not in the penalty So that ends up being a pretty good foul because you stop the momentum of the Blue Devils It allows you to set your defense once again Just a 14 foul cheering Dan Boozer into the corner Foster No rebound tapped And thats the end of the first half Virginia Tech with a late run to get to within nine of the number four team in the country Small adjustment for Mike By the way one of the best bands in the country They flat get it done here at the Coliseum Now they want their team to get it done on the floor They open up with a basketball Dallas will feed up top Hanssbury down low Lal who had a spectacular dunk in the first half of Dallas outside again An open look He cant hit the shot but theyll get another chance Shot clock resetting at 20 They will not wait and in and out for Hammond Great look from Hammond on that possession Great look from Abdales Neither able to knock them down And again for the Hokes to be able to compete in this game theyre going to need the threepoint line Evans catches fires not there And Emanuel will knock it out of play Itll be Virginia Tech ball His eight and 21 against Duke since they joined the ACC And you talk about spectacular fashion We showed all the Duke lobs early in this game But that one the one to Toby the wall may have been the most impressive as hes eye to eye with the rim He was up in the rafters here at the Coliseum of Dallas Asbury wants to get closer banging with Boozer Duke coming into this week number eight in the country in offensive efficiency Number six in defensive efficiency Evans couldnt finish it Hammond comes away with the loose ball Abdales on the attack takes a hit and hell be headed to the foul line Best thing that could have happened for Abdales Its a nice find by Ben Hammond Get ahead to get him to the free throw line He had a great look from three Unable to knock it down Let him see the basketball go through Give him an opportunity to see it go through Build some confidence at the free music throw strike 0 of five from the field for Abdales thus far Two of two at the free throw line So maybe a couple more free throws and get them going Played two years in Greeces top professional league prior to Virginia Tech Listed as a freshman drops in number one to make it an eightpoint game Closer look at Abdollis Our first look at him was at the 2025 draft combine where really his size jumps off the chart for a guard And you talk about elite ball handling and passing ability but one thing he does struggle with is pressure And so by blooming Ben Hammond into the starting lineup Mike Young was able to remove a lot of the pressure that he sees from point guards defensively Hbury rolls that one back for Bedford Jaylen Bedford 11 points per game Hell launch one off the front of the iron and Amena cradling a rebound He got the start with Caleb Foster feeling ill today Also true of Dame Sar the talented freshman for Duke So thats making its way through the locker room Kane Boozer nice hesitation there and drops in two It really was And as the second defender left Boozer finds himself at 64 with Ben Hammond whos listed at 511 and an opportunity to shoot right over the top Downstairs An easy shot there for Hansbury Another nice find from Abdales Weve seen those two connect on a number of baskets right at the rim They share the basketball extremely well This a Virginia Tech team that handles the basketball much better than they did last season Dallas almost five assists per game and swatted away by the Skywalker Lal Well this time Lal didnt throw it into the stands but its still in the same direction Toby Lewal comes up with a huge rejection OB in their last game here at home against Georgia Tech Toby Lewal literally blocked a shot into the bleachers into the first row above that 10ft wall behind the basket Toby Lau today cheering Mike Young said hes the best athlete Ive coached Foster pounding that one into the corner Amena with the dish Out it goes Deflected by Virginia Tech Lets see if theyll take a look at this 14 on the shot clock and and Mike Young making sure that Ammani Hanssbury and Mike Young having a conversation Mike Young looking at his players and saying Are you positive Are you sure Ymani Hansbury is saying yes It is off of them Hanssbury touches it but he says it hits Malik Brown on the way out Of course the new rule this year coaches get one challenge per game and they must have a timeout If the challenge overturns a call that team gets one more challenge Mike wanted to make sure they were sure Im not sure Castle tomorrow for our womens basketball game versus Virginia at 2 pm as we celebrate our 50th season of womens basketball and we honor womens basketball alumni at the game Early arriving students commemorative rally towel Were ready to win some money here It is time for the Virginia Credit Union half minute to win it where Stewart here has to make a layup a free throw a threepointer and a half shot in 30 seconds Okay were going to hand it off to the North Jersey kid here Come on Steuart Line it up in three two one go 25 points Stewarts got the height Free throw is there 75 150 Come on Almost got the roll Lets go Stewart Almost All right You got it All right Swing it over to Stewart Top of the key Oh its all right Chase it down You got eight seconds Lets go Stewart Three on the way Yes cheering All right one chance for 350 Lets go Stewart Thats all right Give it up for Steuart though Winner of 150 Obie Mike Young trusting his players He asked Ammani Hensbury Are you sure that it went off And then he decides to challenge Well when you look at it its going to be an unsuccessful challenge music Hansberry touches the basketball but it does not hit Malik Brown going out of bounds And Hansberry looks at his teammates and his coaches The call on the floor is confirmed The coachs challenge is unsuccessful Virginia Tech will lose their 30se second timeout and have zero challenges remaining of the game It was an interesting time to do it It was originally 14 on the shot clock They reset it to 17 but a tiny amount of time It really is And it puts Duke in a tough spot So Im not sure that you use that challenge at that point but and again its easy for me to say that now after its unsuccessful Foster trying to get a shot up there Heaves it It wont drop and Hammond with the rebound Okis in need of a run here Hammond on the wing But Ill tell you this and theyve done a lot of NBA basketball in the last four seasons and one thing that coaches rely on is for their players to make it up afterwards And Imani Hanssbury makes up for costing his team that challenge going to the bucket and getting a basket Mike Young using the Reggie Jackson reference He says hes the straw that stirs the drink for the Hokes Hes doing it right now Deflection picked up by Foster Hell lay it in But Hansbury did get a hand on that lob attempt from Foster which hurt the Hokes in the first half That time Hansbury getting a hand on just unable to throw out Hookies playing their way back into this thing in the early minutes of the second half They trailed by as many as 16 in the first half Amena hit the deck Foster has it knocked away by Lal and stolen Hammond had a whistle with 16004 to go here in Blackburg Shot clock reset but it was it did reset It was supposed to reset to 20 because the basketball was in the front court So it doesnt go back to 30 seconds Duke the number four team in the country Theyve tasted defeat just once Theyre coming off a thumping of Louisville 83 52 They have eight quad one victories this year most in the league Asbury wants the ball every time down Boozer bodies up on him Odales swings it Hammond with the long one in and out That was in the cylinder It really was And Ben Hammond whos been shooting the three so well comes in seven of 10 in his last two games cheering but yet to be able to see it go down 0 for three here this afternoon cheering Brown left alone Cant connect Rebound tipped Boozer battling everybody for the board Brown down the lane for the slam Once again sharing the basketball between the bigs Boozer with the offensive rebound Finds music a cutting Malik Brown for the easy two hand slam Eight or nine dunks today already for the Duke Blue Devils They have eight officially Shoot off a great fake Gets open Yes that was confident over here You got You could tell Jaden Shu practices that often Similar to you out in the backyard shoveling snow so you could get a bucket Yeah in my in my dreams laughter Foster shoots sticking to him cheering Brown finds the lane again Kaden Boozer jumping in the paint and finishes And the Hokes wanting a foul on them It felt like Malik Brown pushed Toby the wall in the back taking him out of being able to contest the layup from Boozer Boozers played a very steady floor game He really has and thats who he is Obie He doesnt get rattled Hes again he understands all the attention that his twin brother gets but he stays the course and goes out and does whatever he can do to help his team win Shot clock to six Abdales will try another long one and he just does not look like a confident shooter 4839 Duke cheering Kaden Boozer with the feed to his brother and not to be denied and the foul as well He is off to the foul line That was just a classic matchup of strength versus athleticism and strength won in a major way Boozer attacking the basket But you see Malik Brown recognizing how the defense is guarding his teammate cuts to the rim and finishes above the rim Duke sharing the basketball extremely well here this afternoon in Blackburg You know what this is This is music fans One more round of applause for your highest Okay it is now time for show user Lets see those faces Its like we got our winner Visit the final booth to claim your prize Visit go to Montb to plan your stay right here in Christiansburg and Montgomery County Very interesting Few minutes ago Mike Young saying Are you sure were going to challenge to Omi Hanssbury who said Yeah that went off music for Duke But then he apologized when it was overturned Since then hes gone to work He really has gone to work OB the first possession after the unsuccessful challenge goes to the block Go gets music a bucket Monty Hansbread with 15 points leading scoreer in this game thus far has been up to the challenge music of going up against possibly the national player of the year and Cameron Boozers at the free throw line music looking to get to 14 and an efficient six of seven for the field in this game already for Boozer who continues to be the most productive player in the country How about this With 1349 in the first time Duke has gone to the foul line in the second half 1349 to go and the first time theyve gone in this game because they didnt take a free throw in the first half The last time the Blue Devils did that was two years ago at Boston College where they did not shoot one free throw in the first half So Boo with 14 SHOOT AND BANKS IT IN Gets a triple and not even a smirk but Shu fortunate he didnt get called for offensive foul on that possession He kicked that right leg out If Boozer hits that leg they could take that off and cause an offensive foul So going off the glass was the least of his concerns Boozer with the kick into the corner and the shot will not fall by Sar but a whistle with 1317 left and a foul against the Hokes Christian Gerak 610 freshman gets hit for that personal Second team foul against big matchup for Kentucky Really trying to get back into the mix in SEC action Caleb Foster shot clock to seven Got off the pass to Camboozer Tough catch out of THE DOUBLE HERES BROWN AND TAKES A hit as well as he makes the shot But how about the wherewithal of Cameron Boozer to recognize hes under the basket OB and hes got two defenders around him which means someone has to be open Who makes the smart play Malik Brown gets into his vision and all of a sudden a chance for a threepoint play Look where Malik Brown comes from He comes from the opposite wing doesnt stand waiting for the basketball and now is unable to convert the threepoint play But another offensive rebound How about that board Thats just effort Beating everybody to it and give him 16 Theres never a sense of panic with Boozer No No And and and its really with both of them We talked about Kaden and his presence on the perimeter With Cameron hes always in control Boy Hanssbury is hot And they need his hot hand He gets him back to 10 Yeah His fourth three of the game Hansbury really having his way offensively But the problem for the Hokes isnt on the offensive side is they cant right now stop the Blue Devils Kayen Boozer feeds his brother in the paint Back to Brown Great ball movement Its Foster open Well he got the shot he wanted Thats going to be tipped out of play and itll go the other way Its going to be Hokes basketball Just relentless effort OB way back when we were playing basketball everybody played hard In todays game having a motor and playing hard is actually a skill One of the many skills that Cameron Boozer has 16 points eight rebounds five assists so far on the afternoon Tommy Sars third foul Started the day not feeling well anyway Ben Hammond at 511 looking to drive trying to seal him off He made it tough on him Rebound comes out high for Bedford Got it You can feel the momentum shift in the building And the Castle Guard getting involved in the game The crowd here trying to encourage their team to pull off a win versus one of the top five teams in the country cheering Foster the drive and kick Sar cant hit it Taken away on a hustle play by Foster But this is whats hurt the Hokes Theyre getting theyre giving up the shots that they want They want Sar to have to beat them from the perimeter from the outside Theyre round and out by Sar but they give up another offensive rebound This time Malik Brown unable to keep possession but the Blue Devils get shot and shot after shot And thats how they built this eightpoint lead But right now the momentum is on the side of the Hokes trying to cut into this lead with 1108 remaining here in Blackburg That you can imagine from a basketball standpoint However he needs to be in the philanthropic hall of fame as well for everything that hes done And youre talking about from the B Foundation My wife actually thought that the B Foundation was for Vital Im telling laughter you And and again she was so familiar with seeing you know all the work that hes done And I had to had to explain to her it was actually Valano but at the same time Dicky B was on the stage with Jimmy V when he gave that famous speech Legendary speech Camboozer a little bit too strong and on the line Its going to be a turnover for the Hokes Ben Hammond was on the line on the rebound 1026 to go So Duke catches a break Ben Hammond concerned about he felt like because it went over the backboard it should have been called out of bounds Check it back in for the hook 13 Meanwhile chilling out beyond the threepoint line that missed their last eight triples but its not something they really rely on They rely on scoring in the paint And right now an opportunity for Boozer to go oneonone against L Surprised he didnt take that one Tough shot for Evans Banks it in and takes a hit And maybe the reason he didnt take it is because he felt like Evans had a more favorable matchup And Isaiah Evans attacking off the bounce Beford does a great job defensively but once he leaves his feet Evans smart enough to lean in and get it to go off the glass Last season that basket would not have counted This year with the change in rules and continuous motion allows Evans to be able to finish that shot and come up with a threepoint play Pedfords second foul You saw hes averaging about 19 points a game the last seven So hes become a big time scorer 66 sophomore from Fagville North Carolina Drilled a dagger three to beat Florida in early December So hes got that clutch gene as well He really does An elite scorer in the high school ranks and now starting to find his way for the Blue Devils Their second leading scoreer Hammond gives it to Bedford This is the man they want shooting it every time down Ammani Hanssbury Hes on a heater Hes got 20 And and Mike Young searching for Hansbury making sure they get him the basketball in his spots The Hokes making a ninepoint game But this is the issue defensively Pick your poison When you leave the bigs they throw lobs And when you dont Caleb Foster gets a bucket Hard to defend the Blue Devils when theyre playing this well on the offensive end Yeah very KG shot there to make it 6049 without Toby the wall They lost both those games but this is a team that has had some quality wins on the season Not just an opportunity here but also beat Virginia in a three overtime game on this home this home floor The wall bodying up against Boozer Its been a good battle all day Boozer picks it up But Obie think about the comparisons Ben Hammond is able to get in and come up with the steal Great job by Hammond stripping the basketball away from Boozer Hanssbury again gives it off and knocked down by Hammond So they pull within eight Hammond responsible for the defensive theft there to come up with the ball and knocking down three cheering First made one today and a whistle at 845 to play The question has been for the Hokes all afternoon Can they get over the hump and really make this a tight one And again trying to get the job done on the defensive end of the floor Mike Young looks like hes about to get into a stance OB encouraging his team on the defensive end Hammond picked up the foul Heres Boozer cheering Evans pulls up and pops The wall wants a long one And I understand that he can make shots but you got to understand the time and score the situation youre in Thats one Toby Lwal probably would have been better served to go triple hand off on the opposite side and see if he can get it back going to the rim Evans wants it That was short and theyll let it roll out of play and itll be Virginia Tech ball with 813 on the clock John Sh perfect 8 and0 in the conference conference that has seen a major uptick this year Friday in the net there were 11 ACC teams ranked in the top 75 Kicked out for Bedford Hanssbury again Hanssbury draws the double out of that A long distance shot rolls away from Hammond I mean have those be seen Obie those momentum builders where you can knock down a three get back into the game The Hokes just havent been able to take advantage of those opportunities in this game so far Young Bo at the high post Kaden Boozer Cam Boozer has it knocked away and stolen away by the Hokes Dallas looking for a shooter Bedford cant hit Hammond the weak side rebound Hammond has been everywhere OB coming up with steals getting offensive rebounds knocking down a three here in this second half Hes done everything Mike Young could possibly ask Dallas shoves it up there That one goes And dont look now but this is his sixpoint game Just under seven minutes to play cheering Evans on the wing 10 to shoot Evans on Abdales cheering goes right into him strong and banks it in Those arent plays Isaiah Evans makes last year You can see he really put the work in not only physically in the weight room but also on his skill level and the patience that he has once he meets that resistance in the lane A very high level of play here in the second half for these two teams A Dallas Bedford Bedford midrange He nails it 6256 Give him 10 cheering Gunbo looking inside now Evans again And he wants another That one too strong Hope hes trying to turn that into another key basket Duke has missed their last 10 threepoint attempts A Dallas trying to dunk it downstairs and threw it too far Not a play So 6256 Its the Hokes trying to knock off the number four team in the country Brackettology Joe Lonardi liking the ACC a lot more this year as he should with Duke a number one seed Virginia a number five and then North Carolina Well the Hookies need help Been a clean game very well officiated game each side with just seven turnovers Yeah and when you consider that both these teams as physical as they are the officials have done a great job being consistent on both ends of the floor allowing them to be able to play through physicality Gungba up top for Kaden Boozer Eight to get off a shot on the drive Got airborne It rolls off the 10 What a tough rebound by Hansbury Hes been everywhere Well and more importantly itll be to get rid of that basketball before he lands and gets called for a travel to be able to have the wherewithal to get rid of it Abdales trying to make an impact in this thing before its too late Under five minutes to play Hammond driving it Swatted away by Gunga Thats not the first time these two guys have done that Im sure these guys were in practice playing oneonone time and music time again Thats what gave Hammond the confidence to think he could go up against Patrick Gumba But Gumba since high school has probably lost about 20 to 30 lbs has gotten his body together Does a great job defensively stopping music his former high school and EBL teammate Dukes best rim protector Top shot blocker had a five block shot game against Florida The inbounds taken away Batted back Whose basketball Thats going to be on this end Its going to be Virginia Tech Obie How often has Ben Hammond cleaned up his teammatess mistakes Thats just a careless play by Abdales on the out of bounds play He threw it right to Boozer But Ben Hammond and his effort has made up for a number of mistakes throughout this game A Dallas Hammond now A Dallas again Fall away shot That did not touch anything cheering So 430 to go Duke with a basketball leading at 62 56 NBA tip off coming up on Saturday Mavericks and the Rockets at 830 It is tonight Cooper flag playing against Kevin Durant I can remember a few years ago talking to Cooper about him coming to the Nike Academy and the one question he asked me was Is KD going to be there Foster with the leaner Rebound tipped right back to him cheering and a whistle at 407 to play call will go against the Hokes here How impressive has Duke been attacking the offensive glass throughout this game though They continue to put pressure on the Hokes Now both teams had nine music offensive rebounds but it seems to me that Dukes offensive rebounds have been much louder Theyve turned them into 11 second chance points only six compared to the Hokes Ben Hammond picking up the foul Duke with it again cheering And Boozer closing in on a double double going for the slam Hits the deck and a whistle as he went strong to the rack Denied but picks up a hit as well by Lwal So the difference between the NBA rules and the college rules In college basketball you cannot challenge fouls But if you could this would be a great one to challenge because Toby Lewal got all ball cheering Okay its cold out there Youre probably going home after this Three foul shots in the game cheering and another one coming for the 69 freshman from Miami Hes already won the Rookie of the Week award in the ACC eight times 76 foul shooter Makes him both And his dad taught him that outstanding form at the line Im going with mom Okay probably correct Under four minutes to go Hammond for Hanssbury Watch the triple and a foul in the paint This will go against Duke with 346 to go Speaking of the paint Duke has just dominated there Theyre going to win this game Its going to be in a painted area where they have outscored Virginia Tech 42 to22 And thats the way they win OB They dominate teams music in the painted area And more importantly its a point of emphasis from John Shire to be able to get the ball into the paint But its not always by his guards penetrating Often times its more with his bigs is the ball handles Boozer reaching and committing a foul So the freshman fourth team foul Yes the fourth team foul for Duke So the Hokes to put it in within striking distance against the number four team in the country undefeated in the ACC And another shove and a foul That one on Jimea the 68 freshman John Sire telling his team to be smart Three fouls on this possession alone And all theyre doing is getting it closer to the bonus for the Hokes Trying to be aggressive defensively and get through those screens but its resulted in fouls Now five team fouls Shoot back for Bedford Bedford looking to drive and fire off the front iron They get a second chance Hanssbury Heres shoot from the corner Another one of those opportunities to get right back into the game If you knock down that three it makes it a fivepoint game But now its an opportunity for the Blue Devils to turn it into double digits On the other end Virginia Tech has been running into that speed bump over and over unable to get over it today Duke has made sure of that Boozer down the lane of the left hand and he is not going to be denied Fivepoint swing You dont take care of the three and then Boozer gets a bucket on the other end and compares to a fivepoint game that becomes 10 And now the Blue Devils have a little more breathing room Boozer 20 points 13th game this season with 20 or more He has had a fantastic season Answer trying to get him a little bit closer Hes been the man in the second half Had a whistle with 228 to play with just 7 seconds on the shot clock there Yeah bail out defensively Cameron Boozer on that possession Boozer reaching picks up the foul But between the last two music possessions thats four fouls on the Blue Devils So the next one the Hokes will be in the bonus First of the day for Camboozer Time starting to run out here for the Hokes in their upset bid on their home floor Out for Bedford Not there Theyve had a chance with a couple of threes theyve not been able to make and theyve missed their last five from threepoint length But theyre getting good looks And you got guys who are making the right plays and making the right pass Its just unable to knock down those threes and the timing of them hurts so much because youre trying to find a way to get back into the game The Duke Milkinson clock amenia back for Cam Boozer Shot clock to six Boozer attacks leaning inside Its tipped back out Shot clock resets to 20 cheering And again precious seconds coming off that clock here for Virginia Tech Duke closing in on their 20th win of the season Foster Heres Boozer Got it That felt like the dagger Huge bucket but more importantly a huge offensive rebound coming up with the board and finding Boozer for three to make it a 13point game And Boozer with a big big shot Timeout 6956 Duke Lets get it back to the studio and Kevin Connors God Heat Kevin thank you very much A minute 27 remaining here in Blackburg music We take a look at who is in the zone brought to you by AutoZone And just an average game for Cameron Boozer 23 points where he averages 23 and a half but so efficient Nine of 12 from the field Obie two of three from three three of three music at the free throw line to go along with eight boards and five assists Im not sure weve seen his best basketball yet but what were seeing is pretty good which is saying a lot The first Duke freshman with a pair of 35point games this year Indiana State and Arkansas 23 and eight today along with five assists Thats off the foot Shoot hitting the deck trying to get it free Tied up on the play Possession arrow will take it to the other end of the floor with a minute three to go Great sportsmanship between Malik Brown and Immani Hanssbury on that possession Malik Brown diving on top of the basketball Hanssbury grabs him from behind but both of those guys make sure hey were good Just getting you off my teammate They dap each other up and keep playing basketball Love to see that with these young men competitive but at the same time keeping their cool Well you and I have been in this building many times where Virginia Tech has given Duke a very very tough run But Duke built a 16point lead in the first half And although they got it into single digits Virginia Tech has never led in this contest But Virginia Tech continued to make it interesting they just had so many opportunities from three that they were unable to knock down in those crucial moments that could have made it one possession or two possession games And then you hit from the paint So Duke about to go to 9 and0 in the ACC and win their 20th game of the year and improve to 20 and one Also looking to win 31 of 32 ACC games That has been quite a statement Virginia Tech Virginia Tech taking the timeout with 29 seconds to go Obie theres not much that the Blue Devil program has not done However I do believe that they he knew he was good He knew he was great but he didnt know he was going to be this good just never seems to get rattled Hes got it across midcourt and draws the foul with 238 to go So Duke salting this one away Virginia Tech making a couple of runs in the second half to get their fan base in it and get the Coliseum pretty loud from time to time But Duke being Duke they made big shots made big plays when they had to They really did And they get the job done defensively allowed Louisville 59 points on Monday Right now Virginia Tech at 58 These are both teams that average over 80 points per game So it really shows you how special the Blue Devils are leading the ACC cheering in scoring defense I think youre right That doesnt get enough of the conversation how good they are how elite they are on defense Coach Kay had so many teams like that too So Hammond across the half court line Final seconds here from snowy Blackburg Virginia We were able to get here because Cory brought his monster truck laughter this morning Called me in a hotel said I am going to get you there partner Hey listen The game can happen but its not the same without OB The game cant go on without OB Yeah that is quite a rig man And quite a win here for Duke They win it on the road 7258 Despite a couple of guys under the weather they win it against the Hokes and improved to 20 and one Mike Youngs team dropping to 16 and seven A final thought at this uh a dominant performance
