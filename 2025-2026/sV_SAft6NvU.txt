That never happens at the big position Well Duke has shown off its depth Theyve shown off their defense They havent had very many good starts to games That was a message from John Shy to his team The Blue Devils begin with a basketball on a Friday night here in Durham Same starting five for the Blue Devils taking on Niagara tonight for the first time ever And then Sunday brings the first ever matchup against Howard This is Caleb Foster for three I guess theyre going to start out better tonight Starting five for Niagara Theyre coming off a sixpoint loss to Le Moine a team Jim knows something about up in Syracuse Nice little school in Syracuse Thats not a good loss for Niagara No But a new beginning today Theyll take on Howard tomorrow in the second game of the brotherhood run Justin Paige with a shot clock winding down Trenton Walters forced to fire Catches iron but it doesnt fall And the rebound for Gumba Thats really a good first sequence by Duke They didnt allow the dribble penetration And thats what Niagaras really looking to do is attack inside on the dribble Officials tonight Lee Cassell Isaac Barnett and Kellen Milliner says a lot that Cameron Bruiser I felt like he had an off night on Tuesday and he finished with 18 and 10 against the JayHawks Yeah thats thats pretty much his off night Boozer excellent position and before the shot the foul goes against Justin Hawkins This what you were talking about Jim when you have your two big guys Yeah averaging almost seven assist more than six assists a game Almost seven Thats almost not only unusual its almost never done Foster passes up the shot brings it inside kicks it to Boozer Evans hits the cutting Cameron and hes rejected What a block That might be the first shot hes had blocked in a few years Will Short swats it and then Paige gets his own rebound after the miss Someday in the NBA when the Boozers up there that kids going to be talking about that block shot Everybody he knows Block is going to live forever Five to shoot Walters kicks Prudum at the buzzer Cant fire and hit Blue Devils averaging over 10 made threes per game so far this season and theyve done a pretty good job taking care of the basketball Only eight turnovers in the win Tuesday up at Madison Square Garden Cameron Boozer finds his first points Thats the Thats the difference with his father He makes that jump shot His father was mostly around the basket Carlos was a great player too Carlos in the house again as is coach K Duke has a tremendous size advantage at all the positions and Niagaras looking to drive and kick out for threes but its just very difficult Walters knocks it down and gets the Purple Eagles on the board And thats what they have They have to make some shots to have any chance in this game And thats a good shot against good Blue Devils were down 10 last Friday night against Indiana State early gun taken down and free throws coming But despite the fact that theyre much bigger than Niagara Duke has been doing a pretty good job staying in front of dribbers But that time you know just uh and heres what were talking about with the passing and the officials are going to look at this to see if that was a flavoring foul Didnt look like it but I didnt get that great a look at it Well this does give us a chance to talk a little bit more about your initial thoughts on the Duke Blue Devils and where they stand in the ACC and in the national picture Theyre number one in Kemp right now Its very early and and it its been funny cuz Tuesday against Kansas for instance they felt like they never pulled away and yet they felt like they were in control Well they didnt pull away but again thats a really good team and you know they win the game and they think they can play better They beat Texas They think they can play better Thats good to me looking at this years Duke team Obviously they dont have Cooper here five here but they got a a little bit I think they got a little better team around them I think that the improvement from the big guy Banga I think that you know Boozers I think hes one of the great power forward prospects that Ive seen cuz he can play inside outside he can pass the basketball but it a lot depends on how their guard play comes along with Foster coming back thats a big thing but thats going to determine how good theyre going to be So theyre going to upgrade that to a flagrant one What do you think about that Dan Well you know sometimes you say well you know if you make a play on the ball its not a flagrant foul But one of the things that they look for is are you really making a play on the ball And he never got anywhere close to the ball and he just grabbed him by the arm and there was a there was a lot of force there The definition of a flagrant foul is contact thats excessive andor unnecessary and that certainly looked excessive to me Probably in todays world in the old Big East days that might not have been a foul That would not have been a foul at all Yes I understand that I can see him calling that but its its borderline Gunga drains the free throws and Duke will keep the ball And John Sher told us little over an hour ago the 17minute mark his four subs were coming in off the bench Here they are So Cameron Boozer stays Jims old big man Malik Brown is in the game along with Darren Harris and Nicholas Himemena and Kaden Boozer Millie Browns a really team player He does all the little things you love from a player Screen and rebound do the dirty work stuff Kayen Boozer from the corner That was great ball movement And theyre going to press a little bit which this could make it it could help Niagara in a way that they get some easier shots or but its going to speed him up too Niagaras first turnover Cameron kicks it to his brother Kaden gives it back Malik Brown tips the rebound but to the big man for Niagara Will Short But one of the problems for Niagara is Justin Hawkins is their leading scorer number zero and he does most of his damage on the inside Hes going to have a hard time on the inside tonight Trying to take it inside on Boozer Paige kicks it out and the entry pass looking for short Knocked away by Brown Just over four minutes gone first half in Durham Duke by seven Thank you cheering Heat cheering Heat Heat Heat Couple threepointers already for the Duke Blue Devils and some really nice ball movement from the Duke offense Well you double team Cameron Boozer that leaves somebody open and he really does a great job getting it out quickly and because it comes out quickly since his teammates continue to move it quickly They get a wide open jump shot Great passer Big guy Hes willing to pass Its not just that you can pass its that you want to pass And thats not easy to instill in a young player Its been almost two decades since someone had numbers like Cameron Boozer through five games in ACC play More defense leading to offense And its Darren Harris with a hand in his face Thats what he does Thats what hes in the game to do He has now attempted a lot of threes Well thats thats what hes hes in there to do Hes attempted 19 shots 17 of them have been threes And hes shooting better than 50 from beyond the ark Blue Devils three of four from deep Paige into traffic No chance Jamemena outlet Camboozer didnt notice the double team and it will stay Duke Fall Yeah this is this is what Malik Brown does He just makes plays for you on both ends Kind of gets up in the air but blocks it anyway laughter Quick release on the three ball too Thats a Thats big time when youre a shooter Hit it off quick Well when you get it down the court that fast the defense has no chance Block shots lead to baskets Inbound pass denied Jim what do you remember about recruiting Malik Brown You know he was a quiet kid and not many people recruited him in Virginia right near Virginia but he played two year He was a really good player for us and just does all the little things you have to have done and a great kid Harris fouled this time Well they hit him on the one he made and they let it kind of let it go I guess And they did the same thing again They didnt let this one go ACC Network mens basketball matchups Well be right back here at Cameron on Sunday for Howard and Duke Monday night Louisville Cardinals up to number six in the country taking on the Eastern Michigan Eagles Thats Monday night at 7 Both games available on the allnew ESPN app as well as live here on the network Harris we talked about his shooting ability Jim that free throw he missed He was seven for seven coming in and so its still early in the season but he hadnt missed a free throw before that one At least we didnt jinx him We didnt Yeah we didnt say anything Thats good Thats good Not that this Who would ever blame you for jinxing somebody like that Oh theres a multitude of people laughter 10 straight points for the Blue Devils These 100 runs have been a common uh trait for Duke so far this season And its this team that he substituted that John Sher substituted with uh 17 minutes left in the half Particularly Malik Brown being able to get out there on the point of the press Its a Its just a hard job for Niagara to get a shot let alone make a shot Walters beats the crowds buzzer Cant get it to go Good hustle on the offensive glass by Caba Shabbangu And that leads to a second three for the Purple Eagles Walters has them both Harris to Jimena and he was out of bounds There is nothing worse than being out of bounds when you catch the ball because this court has been the same for 100 since Nay Smith put the peach baskets up Thats where the out of bounds has been And it just as a coach it just is crazy Does it still bother you It bothers me Yes No it doesnt bother him How can I Why would you think that Im pretty obvious You know what I think An air ball from the Croatian Vita Zanki cheering Harris quick release Zanki rips down the rebound And Harris has no doubt what his job is Yeah Im shooting this And you know that would be a pretty good job to have You just go in the game and shoot threes and hes going to get threes when hes out there at Duke because theyve got a lot of guys that are going to draw more attention You guys feel Duke has approached the start of this game with the right attitude the right mentality 100 You know its everybody says Well its a nothing game this and that Theyre playing just like they did against Kansas and Texas And thats a great thing to have You dont want your team to come out here and say Well this is not a big game You want them to come out and play like this and thats how theyre playing And it helps to have extra guys who now get in there and theyre fired up to show that they can play more So thats a good thing Cameron kicks it Sar back in the game Heres Isaiah Evans Kaden Boozer Oh Gongba on the glass Hit hard Some ball but a lot of arm too Kungba going back to the line Why does it take them so long to blow the whistle He just didnt he he made it until I mean he was fouled right there and he just blew the whistle now So I mean its a foul I think sometimes they think well if he makes it well let it go but they cant I dont think you can ref that way Number two on Caba Shabbangu Well Gungba he had a very limited role on a very good team last season and hes really done a nice job Hes playing you know is hes number three on the team in minutes played So hes been in there Hes shooting the ball very well Of course hes 0 for seven from three And I think if I were John CH would tell him not to shoot anymore but he has rebounded the ball very well Hes shooting free throws well Hes just hes had a really good start to this season At least nine points scored in every game so far for Gunga Hes four for four from the line so far tonight cheering Only the third home game of the season here at Cameron for Duke not including the exhibition they play Heres a steal for Cameron Boozer leading the break Isaiah Evans cash money How many times does your power forward get it Steal it Rebound it go down the go down the court whether he can rebound it or block the shot or steal the ball and then make the pass for the three Not many power forwards No not many But Jim here at Duke thats sort of old hat Thats what Cooper Flag did Well he wasnt a power forward No he did all those things but he was never a power forward This guys a legitimate power forward Hes got a on him now I think this is going in there Yes indeed That wasnt hard to read but Waters is 59 And that might be generous Yeah So Boozers at least a foot taller than he is In reality Nigers got two good shots and they made them both and theyre down 16 Short fade away goes Well Short doesnt give you a lot of offense and most of the offense he gives you is right around the basket and thats where Niagara has had a tough time getting tonight So thats got to be an encouraging sign Sar misfires but the rebound finds Camboozer Duke with its starting five back out there Gunga triple teamed Not a bad defensive possession here from Niagara and they get a stop Nine minutes gone first half Oh Sabino was looking at his coach and he wasnt looking at his teammate and its a Niagara turnover Camboozer has had a special start to his Duke career averaging almost five assists per game And Evans is pure and Welcome back Welcome back And heres a proud car Heat Heat Hey two Hey hey hey Heat Heat Well unfortunately Greg Pace at least partially responsible for another turnover here at Cameron an indoor stadium He was a twotime ACC tournament champion distracting his guard and uh the Purple Eagles give it away But he turned 39 this summer Hes led the the Purple Eagles since 2019 And Jim you youve known him what since he was 14 15 years old About 14 He came in and we talked about what he wanted to do in my office and he were talking about school and hes talking about Im going to coach at 14 So he knew what he wanted to do twoyear captain threeyear starter spent three years as a teammate of John Shiers and it was a special homecoming Todays the first time that Greg was able to bring his children Preston Whitney and Landon to Cameron Indoor This was shoot around earlier today posing with his wife Megan and Coach K Figure hes got an appointment somewhere Jim Hes checking his watch I know hes checking Hes probably past his bedtime Thats the problem Hes got one of his 100 grandchildren with him Im sure Yes he does One of the twins But yeah hes uh he comes to the new games but not a lot I think its cuz Paulus is here I think hes coming Sunday Brown inside Yes indeed And that was a great pass by Evans And Evans last year was like that threepoint specialist but this year hes done a much better job driving the ball to the basket getting to the free throw line Well and hes again Coach R was talking about you want to go to the NBA its not just shooting you got to play everything You got to be a basketball player You got to do everything And hes doing Cameron Boozer the steel the stop Now speaking of doing everything thats what he does Jay Bilis said on Tuesday he has to work on his steals He took it to heart Hes leading the team in points rebounds assists and blocks Pretty soon hell lead in steals too Well through one quarter of this game were basically on pace for something like 100 to 32 or something like that Well see how things transpire Cameron Boozer three of six got a couple assists a couple of steals more fullcourt pressure from the Blue Devils and its going to be Duke basketball Now clearly clearly Duke has an advantage both in terms of size and talent but sometimes you get a team with that kind of advantage they dont play hard enough to make it operational But boy Duke is really getting after it today Playing hard Very different story than a week ago when they were down 10 against the Sycamores through a few minutes Evans outside for Foster Clock at five Foster pivots and earns free throws Boy Griffith did everything you had to do until he fouled him at the end and he did a great job keeping him out of the lane He did a great job keeping him from getting to all the way to the basket but he fouled him on a very tough shot The end of the day the best player wins And you know its just got the best players and Nigras doing what they they just cant turn it over like theyre turned over That just makes it it gives them points that they cant afford to give Tomorrow morning 1000 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be in Atlanta to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show Game previews expert analysis music featured stories and more right here on ACCN in the allnew ESPN app It was a treat to visit with West Durham and Steve Adazio and Dana Bole We were arriving to Cameron right as they were arriving to meet with coach Diaz and his staff as they get ready to call Duke Carolina football over in Chapel Hill tomorrow Duke by 19 and Malik Brown gets his hands on another pass The nice outlet to Jamena Foster passes up the shot Jamemena will take it and its going to be an offensive foul on Harris Waving off the shot attempt and its Niagara ball Many likes that because now he doesnt get a missed shot Thats right Oh thats good Thats a Thats a good foul for him that they called it on Foster not Harris It is hard to get the ball past Malik Brown Hes really good defensively Hes good Great hands He gets I think he gets his hands on more balls than anybody in the country Just always right around the ball Well two years ago he led the conference in steals Yeah Well he when he was a freshman at Syracuse he was second I think second or third as a freshman He just has a knack for getting his hands on the basketball Why wasnt he a bigger recruit Jim Why do you think it took a while for everybody to realize Well he didnt score you know a lot in high school Three from the corner Justin Paige That has to be it because he physically is a very very good basketball player And the Paige I said before that Hawkins was the leading scoreer Hes not Hawkins is the leading inside scoreer but thats the first basket for Paige who is and no problem scoring for the Blue Devils Second three for Foster You just want Niger to handle the ball and then if they get some threes make them they can hang around and make make it a little difficult on the drive and a foul going against Duke here goes against him Well this is this is really interesting because theyve got Foster and Boozer in the game at the same time Kaden Boozer that is So your two point guards playing at the same time Penetration into the lane Get it to Brown Brown finds the open man Well I think these guys are all willing passers and they all can play together You can play two point Sometimes its better to play two point guards together You have you can have a better team that way The thing Im seeing here that I havent seen as much from Duke so many more driving kicks this year Last year I think they drove and finished more This year theyre kicking a lot By the way that last foul they gave to Brown instead of Jimemena Both could have been called for it Paige makes a pair Hes got five under eight to play in this first half Gungba defender goes down and he will get to the line after missing the short one More free throws coming up for Gungba when we come back to Cameron program after neurology and neurology right here both here cheering at least cheering cheering going forward inspiring Ladies and gentlemen You can see the early free throw disparity for John Shiers team in attempts number 10 and 11 are coming This has been a familiar theme for Duke basketball earlier this season Well theyre just so physically strong and they when you get offensive rebounds usually thats where you get fouled but theyre just you know theyre just very strong They drive and they get to the basket When youre plus 60 from the free throw line against all your opponents not even five and a half games Yeah that thats not bad But thats the kind of pressure that this team can put on you They have guys who can take the ball to the basket and then if you cut take that away Theyve shown theyve got guys who can make threes Theyre hard to defend Theyre very hard to defend because they get in the lane and if you get in front of them they pass it out and they got threes Why And they got guys that can make them And theyve got guys that can offensive rebound So theyre not an easy team to guard And I think theyre getting better because theyre so young and they got so many guys that are have the potential to get better right now How about Gunga Six for six at the free throw line to start tonights game cheering Oh we talked about him before the game Hes having a great year so far Its early but hes really doing the job they want him to do Made big strides May have misdirected that shot Rebound finds Jimemena Theres a chance to take his a threepointer there and he passed it up wisely You know when youre 0 for seven from three the advice would be to get closer Yeah at some point you have to say lets get not shoot that shot anymore Amen to the corner for Kaden Boozer Buckets What a pass that was really good pass and they hit a little screen help on the weak side too Get him wide open Amen Made that type of pass Made that type of play Hes been a nice solid roll guy off the bench as a freshman Yeah it is hard for freshman unless youre a boozer I mean its hard It takes time but you hes got all the tools It just as the year goes along hes going to get better and hes going to be able to contribute more But its amazing when you see Banga Heres a guy that everybody said was going to be great and hes not playing good last year He should leave and he stays And look at him now Hes a big time player This is why you want to stay sometime Youre suggesting folks should be a little more patient Well its not 2025 Its not a bad thing And you know the same thing with Foster He you know he stayed Hes a hes a good player and a good team Harris from the wing It goes down but it hit the shot clock and theyre going to wave it off Why Thats a Why not That helps Talk about a shooters touch Hes Hes really squeezes it off No hes looking for threes Hes Hes going to get it up there He only shoots it when he has it laughter This is a perfect illustration of how hard its been for Niagara to get the ball in for a lane Theres nobody in there and now the ball doesnt go in there either Sar the deflection Jamemena unable to connect Heres Paige the other way going right at Kaden Boozer and Gunbo is there waiting for him applause and cheering I dont think hes quite figured out that Duke has big back there and you cannot do that Hes You know again Niger in their league he can go to the basket Hell get that shot up there every time but not against these guys Well hes a good shooter and he drives the ball to the basket very well but theres just no room tonight Thatll be a basket in his league but not here Prudum trying to get around Harris Thats just a great job staying in front Walters Its a kick ball Its going to reset the shot clock to 20 I mean to their credit Niagara is trying and theyre moving Theyre trying to move the ball Theyre trying They just cant penetrate this defense And Duke theyre doing such a great job They basically are switching everything And even a guy like Gumba hes can move his feet well enough that he can stay in front of a smaller guy When you can switch everything you end up if your big can switch it takes the pick and roll offense out of the game In the Olympics when we found when we won our first one Chris Bosch was probably the most valuable player on our team with Kobe there LeBron there because Chris Bosch played center and switched and helped us to win the Olympics Walters looking for his third three cant find it Jim were you responsible for engineering the pick and roll coverage I had absolutely nothing to do with it I was the zone coach and we didnt play zone so I didnt have a lot to do Dame Sar for three Eight different Blue Devils have scored Were back in 30 Well Dame Sar is a really special freshman as well overshadowed by the Boozer brothers at times But if he can make this shot consistently like he has so far man with his defensive skills and savvy and instincts hes going to have a really promising season and career ahead Well the European League that he played in is tough as hen So he should be ready for this Niagara breaks the pressure and then almost turns it over Malik Brown knocks it out Whos there I mean its Malik Brown Hes coming from the point all the way back And thats something you stress when youre a pressing team And most big guys never get there And thatd be an open three And thats why you dont press sometimes because you give up open threes He didnt let that happen into the back court So Jim back to the Olympic conversation Tell me about the meeting where you suggested to coach K I think we should run some zone tonight I dont think I mentioned that more than No we we did practice it two days and we used it in one exhibition game Thats all But international balls different You have to almost have to play manto man Just too many good shooters cheering Wow Trenton Walters Speaking of good shooters they make four or five more of those shots which they wont Theyd be in the game Tough teardrop Kaden Boozer Pretty Thats really a good drive in transition and to recognize that everybodys sort of playing him for the pass and so you go right through and make a shot Kadens the leading scoreer for Duke right now with eight A lot of balance behind him Thats going to be a foul on young Kaden Those are good fouls Thats an aggressive foul trying to get to the ball Thats thats thats good But you know whats the f Niagaras made a couple nice threes and theyre only down 30 I mean you know theyre only down 24 and he theyre not playing that bad You know Duke is just too strong too physical We asked Greg Paul at shootaround what do you expect tonight And he just kind of laughed and hes like theyre really good Were going to try to play hard maybe win a segment here and there create some positive things on film to like they got Howard tomorrow and thats the game they feel like they can really get Walters not this time Well theyre theyre his guys are playing really hard Yeah gets clobbered Walters shaken up Hopefully hes okay We got ourselves a timeout 358 to go in the half with Duke in control Welcome to the court our very own We are ready Put your hands together for Huge Saturday of football coming up tomorrow on the ACC Network work noon Eastern 7 and three Wake Forest hosting Delaware with George Sedano and Rodney Mloud Then West Durham and Steve Dazio will be at Keenan Stadium for Duke music and North Carolina And then the 128th big game between Cal and Stamford at 730 Chris Carter Max Brown on the call You never know when the band might wander onto the field when Cal and Stanford get together Duke by 24 here at Cameron Indoor Eight of the nine players who have taken the floor have scored and Jimemena has a couple assists despite not having any points so far But to get points you have to shoot and hes only taken one shot Well the thing is nice is they have nine guys and theyre all playing and thats good What a pass that was But you you dont make that pass unless Malik Brown does a great job creating space inside Its the receiver as much as the passer sometimes High percentage finish for Malik Thats an air ball and a rebound for Brown And here comes Foster Another thing that this Duke team does really well is they get the ball out quickly on rebounds Malik Brown Malik Brown does that Hes really good at that He just gets it and lets it go Talk about rooting out some space on the inside Sabino had no chance in there Hes trying desperately to get around but thats really some pass but its a great job making yourself available for that pass I mean these guys look for each other Thats what their first thought is I think from watching them play Theyre big guys Their first thought is to pass And thats really almost completely opposite of what most big guys do Their first thought is score These guys are looking to pass and make a play out of it which is its great for your teammates Its a great chemistry thing for your team Cameron Boozer rebounds the miss sets up Evans and then you got his hand on it but Niagara comes away Well youre not going to make them all but they continue to get wide open shots They make the nice they make a lot of them its going to be real hard cheering Crazy is reminding Zanki of his air ball from that left wing earlier Prudum trying to get it inside Nowhere really to go Clock winding down Hawkins to beat the buzzer Did not catch iron Well Hawkins hadnt made any threes on the year He was 0 for three coming in His game is on the inside applause But again when Prudomes trying to drive the ball in there Malik Brown steps in and totally disrupts the whole thing Theres no theres really no place to go there And theres been very little lackluster effort or any lapses from Duke in this first half None really Coach I know you you expect your guys to play hard all the time but in a game like this when youre expecting a mismatch do do you build in a little buffer for a lapse mentally You know I mean you try to understand that if you work hard every day in practice and push every day in practice well why cant you play hard in a game even if its whoever it is because four four or five days a week youre practicing as hard as you can pushing So I think you can avoid that as long as you always practice hard If youre having off practice days that leads to games like where you dont play hard But you dont see you know a Duke team you dont see a Rick Patino team a Louisville team not play hard every game because thats the way they practice Timeout taken here by John Sh with five on the shot clock to diagram something out of bounds Monday night ACC Network featured womens basketball matchup the nations leading scorer Hannah Hidalgo and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish number 24 in the land to take on Central Michigan 900 Eastern Thats Monday night Its also available on the allnew ESPN app You guys know Hannah Halago had I think 44 points and 16 steals in a game I saw that I saw that Thats She is She is a good defender She gets after it Whoops Its a double dribble He did I didnt think he was going to catch it but he caught him Gungbo with a little grin on his face heading back down the floor Well I think that thats if youre a defender that has to be the best thing that you can have is trying Gungba drive it down from the top of the key Absolutely Closing in on two minutes to play in the half Duke shooting almost 60 Niagara just 5 for 20 25 And that number dips as Paige misses another three Evans beautiful move to the bucket And again thats what hes doing this year Hes just not settling for threes twothirds of his shots are still threes but hes doing a much better job getting the ball to the basket 16 points on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden for Isaiah Evans Another guy that talked about leaving and he stayed and its much better Hes a much better going to be a much better player because of Prudum for three Well hes a very good threepoint shooter He comes in at 50 He hasnt had many good looks Boozer always looking to pass Dame from the corner Rebound to short cheering Little transition attack from the Purple Eagles and itll stay Niagara ball Niagara about 25 minutes north of Buffalo right along the US Canada border cheering First ever meeting in mens basketball between these two programs Prudum zips it to the corner attacking Dame Sar is a hard thing to do Scott with a decent matchup or short rather kicks it out and a good rebound for Gumba You got to make Duke pay for those switches particularly when you get your 69 center on the inside matched up against the point guard Of course Fosters 65 so yeah Im not sure who has the advantage there Great position for Camboozer and a great pass A great catch in traffic as well Final seconds of the opening half cheering Zanki over Sar and Duke takes a 28point lead into the halftime locker room Separate runs of 173 and 153 And the Blue Devils in control in their third home game of the season Lets send it to the ACC Network studio with Sam and Malcolm Heat Henry thank you Are you bringing more flavor while you catch all the downloads Thats right And you know what happens in the second half if the opposing player free basketball game after the game basketball Thats on December 2nd and we support the classroom and beyond your generosity Im more All right probably Dave Mars Thank you All right Maybe I dont know I can help out off the bench Theyre going to try to outplay the first guys and that that means you dont have let downs in a game like this Well Niagara Jim were just talking about the defense Niagara was only able to take eight twopoint shots So twothirds of their shots were threes And it wasnt because they were concentrating on the three Greg Paulus thiss guy just could not get the ball into the lane And when they got in there they got it blocked So you know it was there was no chance Hey Jim what do you remember when Greg came to Syracuse to play his final season of college athletics at the dome on the football field You know he was really a good quarter We didnt have a good team but he was a good quarterback He had good numbers after not playing since high school He had really good numbers and and did everything you want a quarterback to do They just he didnt have enough help Orange under Pauluss stewardship went four and eight But yeah he had some skill Hey when you havent played since high school thats amazing Yeah Justin Hawkins trying to score inside That has not been a winning recipe so far tonight for the Purple Eagles out of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Well Hawkins still hasnt scored And I think for Niagara to be at their best he doesnt have to be their leading scoreer but hes got to be able to score inside Cameron Boozer about to take his first free throws of the night Jim I wanted to ask you about the transition from Coach K to John Sh I mean thats weve seen in a lot of different places Its not always as natural as Duke has made it look Youre replacing the best coach of our time 80 1980 to now By far the best coach of our time And some say maybe forever You I dont think you can go by John Wooden but hes the best of our era And usually when you replace a guy it just doesnt happen But John Shrier and the reason I think that coach Kay wanted John Shrier in there and it wasnt that easy It wasnt a done deal but he knew what kind of recruiter he was He had his ear right there to the ground and knew where the players were And when you get players like this obviously it makes the transition easier but hes also a very good coach So now you have the best of both worlds And thats hard to do in this kind of transition UCLA looked for somebody to replace coach Wooden and theyre still looking right You know that was 1975 because I was there at his last game Hard to believe but I was there 50 years ago Theyve tried to get back since and I dont think theyll ever Well theyll never get to that Well 41 consecutive years Duke has had at least one McDonalds AllAmerican join their team which is a pretty incredible statistic It helps you win games when youve got those guys You know when you have good players that usually makes you a pretty good coach especially when you get two or three of them at the same time laughter Well both Boozer brothers and Nicholas Jimena were McDonalds allAmerican last year Heres Gumbbo in transition Thats exactly what were talking about That time they didnt switch They double team the screen and Sar as soon as he picked the ball up hes looking ahead and makes a great pass Yeah And thats when they double team youre talking 69 611 Double teaming a 65 Thats pretty uh hard to do Sar rebounds the miss from Prudum Now theres there the scrambling defense Theres an open shot but its a rushed shot Yeah its its not easy to make those shots Theyre under pressure the whole game Foster burries another And thats not a pressure shot In rhythm Absolutely You know when you get up 40 Yeah theyre a little easier to make Theyre a little easier to make Seven straight for the Blue Devils to start the second half Largest lead of the night Its 35 points Shot clock winding down again Extra pass to the corner Three wont fall Boozer grabs the rebound Its his fourth and outlets it to half court Theres a lot of Kevin love in Cameron Boozer The way he throws those outlet balls and Brown Theres And the thing that makes that happen is the great job by Gunga getting out there and stopping the dribbler And then he gets down the court He doesnt even hesitate and and they move the ball on offense to get a wide open three Yeah Evans Why not 10 straight for Duke to start the second half When they make threes theyre very Yeah theyre going to be hard to beat If they make threes like that many or any are going to beat them Timeout for Greg Paulace Blue Devils have extended their lead Theyre now 53 from deep tonight Heat Heat cheering Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat cheering Heat Heat Well Greg Paulace probably wishes that Calvin Murphy still had some eligibility laughter He was the greatest player in Niagara history Led him to the Sweet 16 in 1970 His greatest game ever was a 68point game December 7th 68 against the Syracuse Orange men I didnt guard him and I wasnt on the team but we held him to his lowest total and then he got a little mad and had 68 against If he was playing tonight in his prime hed still get 40 against Duke Im telling you thats how good he was at the time 68 was a then NCAA D1 record Theres a nice possession out of the timeout for Greg Paulaces bunch Well he played in the same era as Pistol Pete Maravic and he was such a great scorer that he actually led the country in scoring over Pistol Pete Maravic one year Yeah hes phenomenal scorer We double teamed him every play and the other three guys played zone He still averaged 45 against that Thats 6869 season when he dropped 68 That was one of the few years where you werent directly You became an assistant the next year The next year I I had nothing to do with you were busy playing for the Scranton Miners and the Apollo then werent you I was driving down to Scranton and playing in the winter time I didnt want to see any part of those games Did the Apollo run the two three We did not We did not run the two three Well then he struggled when he started as an assistant coach at Syracuse cuz he tried to recruit me Yeah that was a I see I was early and I didnt understand why then when I saw Bonner play I said why was I bo what was I recruiting him for I got a little better in my recruiting after that luckily Luckily Dan did tell me that you gave him a tour of the Syracuse campus He said it was a really detailed energetic tour Pretty Yeah I mean I was all right I was starting out I was young We didnt get him So obviously I wasnt that good at recruiting but obviously he was very good at recruiting because that set the stage for all the success he had later Im going to take some credit for that Yeah I mean you know you have to practice and then you get better players We tried to recruit Jay Bilis and I tell Jay all the time we we really wanted you We just couldnt get you in school It was you know of course Jay doesnt like it when I say that but he had a role at Duke too He took the ball out of bounds and stayed out of Johnny Dawkins and Mark Allers way Just let them do the work that they needed to do Thats right For the Hall of Famer Jim Beahheim the great Dan Bonner Evan Lepler with you from Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham Adam what did you do with the SPACC Network people to get stuck with two of the oldest people in the business I mean you must have really got somebody upset up there It is a privilege to be alongside such knowledge and experience charisma Is that how you wrote it Dan Is that what you wrote for him Im going to check here Style words wrong Did you call me Adam by the way Its Evan I No I would never do that I never would do that unless I was thinking of Adam Shine a norable Syracuse graduate who talk radios it Heres Paige on the drive Kicks it out Sabino loose ball out of bounds to Duke cheering 1515 to play The Duke Blue Devils on their way to 6 and0 Everyone music award What do you want this Friday night How about Heat Heat Lets go around the ACC Look at some of the early season headlines Four current teams in the top 25 NC State under Will Wade back in the polls And the freshman have really been a story Boozer Wilson Brown and others Neo Abdales in Blackburg has been special for Mike Young Theres a ton of freshman in the league and in the country and thats why one of the reasons college basketball better The other one all the guys coming back and the other one all the international players who came over because they make so much more money here than they can in Europe Bob Dallas is one of those guys As we look at some of these marquee wins Kansas has been on the wrong side of a couple I was really impressed with Louisville against Kentucky although the Wildcats have some issues right now No issues for Duke at the moment Malik Brown adds two more to his total Well its you cant really overstate for the ACC in terms of the number of teams they might get into the NCA tournament was a struggle last year because the conference team s simply didnt perform very well in this the nonconference portion of the schedule 100 Wake Forest could have had two monster wins Yep And they just missed out I mean onepoint loss to Michigan in Detroit onepoint loss to Texas Tech last night in the Bahamas Kaden Boozer has knocked down a bunch of open good looks tonight Hes been able to get those open good looks because Duke is doing a great job getting drawing the defense and kicking it back for for scores You cant overemphasize that Dan Its just really good penetration passing looking for each other And with a guy like Evans Jim you know you got to play him for his three so he can go by you if youre not really careful No question cheering Evans surprised he missed it but it comes right back to him Extra pass to Harris cheering Evans will create a third chance Jamemena will try and now everybody whos played for Duke has scored cheering 63 of the season for Jamea cheering Niagaras barely looking for points in the paint but Walters when hes got a little bit of daylight hes knocked him down Whats that His fifth three tonight Yeah hes five for 10 Theyre really moving the ball well and they got 27 points When you dont make any layups and you dont get to the foul line its hard to score a lot of points Amen Same spot same result No pass Totally unselfish And now 12 for 23 from beyond the ark Five of eight since halftime And another line change with Gungba Foster and Sar all coming back in off John Shs bench Well these are the type of games and this is the time of the season where you sort of have to blend things together and you got to play the guys to see what they can do and how they blend together I mean theres I mean theres a lot of really good players here and its going to be you know its always a challenge to keep all your players happy Always Thats why these games are good Everybody plays Jim is the Blue Devils getting to conference play You think John can continue to play nine guys Well I mean hell play them He will he will you know play a couple guys Cameron Boozer probably Banga Theyll probably play more but the other guys will play But those two guys will be in more I think And it depends who else Evans or who else is playing well Its hard to play nine Seven or eight is eights good They dont have a lot else either They got nine Theyre trying the zone just to see I think they did it cuz Im here No they might have No they played a little bit Nobody stopped the ball Boozer missed the layup Kungbo there to clean it up and hell go back to the line Well Duke had five different guys make a three in the first half and here in the second half Nicholas Jmena joined the scoring party Backto back threes for the Los Angeles native Duke rolling location Please be sure to stop by field on Sunday with your second season They will host Kansas in the third round of NCAA tournament kickoff tickets Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Help me What the is Back here at Cameron Indoors John Shy studies the iPad Hes not looking at the upcoming schedule right now like we are but these are some of the highprofile opponents that the Blue Devils have to come in the months and weeks ahead Well Dan said it right Theres two or three Final Four teams there Florida uh Michigan State Michigan those three and Arkansas and Texas Tech are good So obviously Duke is uh is going to be tested going into the conference Wow I mean seriously thats thats probably as tough of five games as you can really get you know in college basketball cheering On Thanksgiving theyll play the Razerbacks in Chicago and then Florida will be here for the ACC SEC challenge in early December That will be some game Going back to Madison Square Garden to take on Texas Tech Dupal put its current uh winning streak at MSG in the line Theyve won nine straight in the worlds most famous arena including Tuesday in the Champions Classic over Kansas Thats well done And more points in the paint which have come sparingly tonight for the Purple Eagles That is the first time we have seen Niagara break down the Duke defense like that and get a layup Great dribble penetration Duke did not rotate or switch effectively that time Thats the first time weve seen that all night long Whats the coaching point from that possession defensively so it doesnt happen again Uh I think it is Dont worry about it cuz it only happened once this game Foul on Sar in transition Its his first You got to credit Niagara They continue to try to move the ball and its not very often theyve been able to get out and get passed out on the perimeter And Sar didnt get back in on the weak side to help but you know again hes new to this country Well hes long and athletic and talented though Boy he is Been playing since he was 6 years old in Italy went to a basketball academy when he was 134 And heres good hands Foster the steel Boozer the big guys really run Dozen points now for Cam unable to finish but free throws coming for the Croatian Vuiti after he turned it over the previous possession Its always great when youre going down the court and you look behind you and theres your big guy right there They all get up the court Thats you cant make mistakes against this team They just theyre going to turn them into basket dunks usually Zonkey has been very quiet tonight and I think hes going to be a key guy This is a an interesting roster construction Greg Paulus has nine new guys Yeah Four of them are junior college transfers Three of them are division 2 transfers Theres one freshman And Zonke is the lone D1 transfer He played at Eastern Washington where 65 of his shots were threes but he hadnt had any opportunities tonight Well when youre at Niagara and you have a good player like they had last year a couple theyre gone Theyre going to bigger schools You cant blame the players but you have to start over every year and you have no money to do it Its not easy Preseason favorite in the MAAC this year is Quinnipic Of course Jerry McNamera Sienna Saints were the preseason pick second Yeah theyre theyre good I think hes got a team that can win that conference Hes taken a couple of threes As we said 65 of his shots at Eastern Washington were from three In fact this year thats still his percentage but hes airalled a couple tonight Well he was six for 11 from three in his last two games and hes missed the rim and missed everything for two of his three shots tonight Boozer He might have got his second shot blocked I dont know Hes Hes going to think about that His fathers going to say something to him Not going to think about it too hard though His father will probably kid him a little bit about it So this its early and these types of comparisons can be a little absurd But if youre curious the first five games of Zion Williamson verse the first five games of Cameron Boozer Here come the numbers Pretty close if we get him up there Zion has the edge in field goal percentage He dunked it a a handful of times I recall but uh points rebounds assists Check mark go to Camboozer Certainly no complaints about his the start for his career here Zion was so good He got layups So he shot 70 on 10 layups 70 for 10 But you couldnt keep him out of there Hes and you cant really when hes healthy in the NBA Hes so physical Loser Cameron plays does a few more other things and and hes obviously been healthy Jim didnt you have a guy who took a couple charges against Zion Curves One guy 185 lbs took a fullcourt charge Yeah Who was that I forgot Correct Do thats right Which I couldnt pronounce his name until his senior year but he took one right here at the foul line He ended up in the section under the basket and his whole front was black and blue for a week But as he said to me he said Coach we won And we did We won the game So I said Yeah okay but dont ever step in front of him again What would be the difference for preparing a team to play against Cam Boozer at the top of the scouting report versus Zion at the top of the scouting report Zion you just would pray that he would shoot a jump shot because you cant stop him cheering Boozer you can can bother a little bit under the basket when as good as he is But Zion no We actually beat them with Zion and when he was out that year the second game in Syracuse they beat us He was a force of nature when hes on the floor healthy which unfortunately has been far too little Two free points there for Dame Sar Well Dame Sar gets him but the guy who kept the ball alive was Malik Brown He does that a lot Well he does And heres a deflection for Dame Sar No look pass Foster for three Malik Brown keeps it alive I think Brown is going to be such a key component for them as the season goes on Theyre really going to need to keep him healthy He was not hurt I mean hes been hurt both years here So going to the line You just hope hes healthy because the little things he does are so important to winning basketball games I mean you dont notice it that much but its just the tip ball the secondary pass the outlet pass helping on defense being there all the time Those things you just they add up and they dont always show in the box score but coach knows Coach SH was talking before the game Thats was one of his main points We got to keep Malik Brown healthy this year Gungba is nine for nine from the line now I hope I didnt just jinx him Well if you did you will be pay the price that all announcers have to pay You have to take us out to dinner I can do that And you did Oh my goodness And you did I apologize Were going to the steakhouse Were not going to McDonalds But hes 9 for 10 But Im telling you that is such a weapon to have a big guy who can shoot free throws Very very important Mike Jaminsky Yes He was a really good free throw shooter when he played here Well he was a very good shooter period Yeah Oh he wants to prove Hello First three for Patrick of Heard you that 0 for seven Now hes got one I told you I could shoot is what he said 14 for Gungba cheering Im still okay if Im the opponent with him shooting from out there Oh 100 Thats Niagaras 16th turnover And well get ourselves a timeout Gungba music missed the free throw but hes on the board from three to the delight of his head coach Probably not Okay Hey yall You got me Hello We do You got us We do We do You can hear us Yeah I can hear you Okay I know Welcome to the Lord 2 3 Lets go Tomorrow a full day of college football begins at noon on the ACC Network work The Blue Huns of Blue Hens of Delaware excuse me take on the Wake Forest Beacons Theyre coming in fierce Uh Duke and North Carolina in Chapel Hill at Keenan Stadium at 330 and then the game for the 128th time Cal and Stanford the final game in the triple header It all begins with a huddle at 1000 am on ACC Network and the ESPN app See Dan I thought Evan would never make a mistake He did He made one That was your first mistake right there was thinking Well that thats true Thats true But maybe people would be more intimidated by them if their name were the Hunts The Blue Huns The Blue Hunt Absolutely I like that Warriors The Huns might not like it though and it would be the name would not be allowed Shot clock winding down Hawkins turnaround over Gungba comes up short and Jimemena has the rebound Now in in the MAC Hawkins will make that shot You think hes going to be happy to leave behind Bunga and Boozer and not have to ever see them again laughter Well I tell you what I think he would like to see them at least one more time and thats in the NCA tournament Yeah thats true But this is just I mean what Greg Pace is trying to do at Niagara is just very interesting in terms of you know what hes dealing with You mentioned the lack of funds Another great move by Gumba but everybodys you know you look around these other schools theres all these transfers from other major schools Well hes got guys from junior college in D2 Thats what he has to do Have money It has been proven the guys from D2 can play Bennett shirts you know proved that to everybody But thats the exception You used to call the D2 tournament right I did 15 14 15 Division 2 Elite Eights And I I mean theres really good players in D2 Careerhigh 17 for Patrick Gungba II good players and really good coaches in division two cheering Paige Tough shot And I I think you could say that all night long Tough shot Thats what theyve been dealing with I think to their credit though theyre still out there playing incredibly hard Yeah Yeah theres no give up Theres no fall off Theyre trying to execute Theyre trying to run their stuff And on the other side Duke still playing hard and trying to stop them every play While the score has really never been close it was 133 153 early Its been a pretty compelling entertaining back and forth up and down game Yeah And theyre you watch Duke play its fun to watch them They got a lot of good players that know how to play Its fun to watch the game Sure is for Brut that time was able to take advantage of Jimemena and Jmena just not quick enough there in the transition This Duke team back in action on Sunday against the Howard Bison led by another Duke alum Kenny Blakey Nate James also on that Howard staff And on Monday on ACC Network Pat Kelsey is Louisville Cardinals hosting Eastern Michigan at 700 And of course Evan we will be right back here with you on Sunday Looking forward to it But we will go to El Toro Pizza again before Sunday because its the best pizza in the South It was incredibly delicious today Jim Its Its your spot and you youve youve done well Who would think you could Whoa Chance for a fourpoint play for Isaiah Evans Who would ever think you could find a great pizza place in Durham North Carolina Youre going to get yourself in trouble No I mean it its unlikely not impos you know Greensboro is just an hour drive away if you want to check out some of their fine dining They have a great place possibilities there Ive Ive changed my whole tune Im very pr and by the way when I said that a 100red years ago about Gro I was joking cheering and applause but I guess the reporters didnt take Do do you feel you have mellowed quote in retirement unquote I spoke at Greensboros main banquet one like three or four years ago and they all applauded so Im I might be forgiven How many pitchforks did you see while you were there No no no Dont go there Dont go there Uhuh Great to be sharing the crows nest with Jim Beahheim Dan Bonner Vantage point unlike any other in college hoops And nobody wants to be in this vantage either Its not that easy And its a hard walk down Well there used to be a ladder Now theres a stairwell So youre getting off easy Well its a hard walk down but Isaac Newton at least helps you with that Its harder going up Yeah no doubt That was the first old man comment from you two tonight Done a good job staying away from that laughter Complaining about the stairs Come on gentlemen If I was young I would complain Great athletes I would complain about if I was young Its not an easy walk up here Come on Just cuz you play pickle ball Jim you were telling us about your squash uh sensational abilities earlier today First of all nobody listening knows what squash is so dont go there How about he findu for two swash that is a you know he caught the ball well inside hes not going to play very much this year but Jamena really made a nice pass the block theyre going to count the basket for the moment Dukean created its largest lead of the season at 57 Seven Very close Well its just its its hard to take a charge anymore And I like that You know you just you have to have your position your defensive position established before the the shooter plants the foot before going airborne I would like it to be out of the game I would like to be a foul every time on the defensive player Try to block it Try to make a play but dont just stand there and get try to get run over I think its the worst play in basketball and it should get it out of the game Jamemena for three I think he got some confidence tonight Things are always easier when the balls going in the basket but it it does help you a little bit confidencewise when youre a freshman to make something matched his season high tonight with nine Hawkins turned away by Ufuku Uachuka could be a valuable player for them once you get into the tough games Nigerians got size got experience Transfer from Rice Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Lets go Lets go Lets go Lets go Lets go You got it cheering From the very opening tip tonight Niagara has been overmatched and Duke leads 9235 We saw the first points of the night for Ephine Ufachuku Previously scored in the Western Carolina game a couple weeks ago Niagara is going to play tomorrow on this court against Howard the team that Duke will play on Sunday Its an interesting mte that theyve created here with the brotherhood Yeah it is But its its going to be really hard for Niagara to try to get over this and come back tomorrow But theyve kept playing They played the whole game Theyre still playing And uh you know Duke just doesnt have bad players to put out there against them from a Ken Palm ranking standpoint Niagaras 316 Howards 320 coming into today So it should be a good game Yeah I think so just got to get over the hangover real quick Its not good when you get beat by 50 So cheering Dukes going to improve to 6 and0 Its another bad miss for Zaki Jack Scott can he find his offense Nope not this time Scott transferred from Princeton Grew up in Colorado Springs Colorado Beautiful place Scotts got himself a rebound cheering The crowd wants Scott to score Instead hell zip it outside Cameron Sheffield unable to connect I think Scott was a pretty good player at Princeton but he doesnt fit here the way he plays Chance for a threepoint play for Will Short the Australian but he also says he hails from New Zealand He was born in Australia but he kind of considers himself a Kiwi Its a little confusing Ive always wanted to go to New Zealand but its just too far away right now That was El Magguires favorite place He would go there every summer ride his bike around the country You were coaching in the Sydney Olympics though right No I dont know what year was No that was way long ago Come on No I started in 08 in China Thats right Beijing Beijing London and Rio Well China is not across the street either No that was a long trip Trust me I once I did it but that was to try to help win an Olympic gold medal Thats okay I didnt go for tours How was the pizza in Beijing Pizza Hut right next door Pizza Huts a fancy pizza My kids were eight years old They went there every night for dinner in China Thats where they ate dinner every night They were eight and six Now theyre playing pro basketball Now theyre playing overseas and in the GLeague Loving loving basketball And you know Coach K we saw him earlier You got to visit with him before Duke shoot around today Retirement doesnt mean the same thing to guys like you and Coach K cuz both of you still seem like youre doing a million different things A million Im doing this working at the school Coach is working here at the school Coach K still got his radio Hes speaking all over the country and hes doing stuff for the NBA Hes busy six days a week I mean he has and he has 17 grandkids so hes with them too So he looked good I saw him this morning But its the key is keep busy Dont sit around Keep busy Keep doing stuff Thats what you have to do But Im glad Im really not coaching right now Are you particularly glad youre not coaching Niagara right now Yeah I was on a couple of these Its 30 point Theyre No theyre not fun down 30 or 40 really not fun What if youre on the right side of it Is it fun then Yeah I mean yeah winning is fun anyway Absolutely but not when youre on the wrong side of these things Two shot foul here Niagaras got one more I think your points a good one though Jim This is a Niagara team thats theyve been cheering made to look really bad today but theyre not that bad No theyre not Duke is really good And you dont want this one loss to become two because youre playing a team thats more your equal and its going to be hard I think itll be hard I hope they can do it But Howards rested Theyre going to come up come in all ready to go and you got to give the edge to Howard even if Nigers a little bit better team Second three of the season for Jack Scott as he gets in the scorebook too Thats a foul You cant just jump on topuku I mean he hadnt played that long but hes got already got three fouls Two Thats two fouls No thats that thats number three You were right Okay I think hes theyre playing on him in emergencies at the backup center but they probably will need him But when theyre playing against Michigan in a daim mara they could use those extra fouls 30 second timeout with 119 to play 12 different Blue Devils have scored in this game See if Cam Sheffield can get in the scorebook to make it 13 for 13 And I thought it was interesting what John Shy said after the Kansas game They won by 12 He said I thought it was the epitome of our team All nine guys scored All nine guys contributed and they were able to pull away from the JayHawks music late Well I think after talking to him this evening before the game that hes got to be pleased with this His team accomplished what he wanted them to accomplish specifically really started the game on a strong defensive effort and then they just never let the foot off the gas No And he got some guys going that you know will help them Uh even even with the you know Kaden Boozer he had a nice night This is going to help him Romania this is going to help him I mean its this is a real good night And uh with their schedule coming up theyll be tested enough Its it its kind of nice to have a couple games like this Well in a minute 19 Duke will join St Thomas cuz when you think about the great homecourt atmospheres in college basketball St Thomas one of the first that come to mind new division one program in Minnesota Nobody even knows where it is in Minnesota And you probably didnt either till the game Remember when he remember when it used to be an 88 game home winning streak to 50 or 60 Thats hard to do Duke about to be 51 and4 in this building under John Sh Johns going to improve to 95 and 22 since taking over for coach K Sheffield Can he join the party Yes sir Well he forced his way in there Wasnt pretty but its true Scored over 500 points in three seasons at Rice and hell remember that basket for a long time Well think about this now Theyre trying to put a team together but theyve got a guy who was a good player in Scott in the Ivy League a veteran guy Hes coming in here as basically a practice and bench player Theyve got Ufuku who you know transferred in two who was a solid player and hes basically a bench player And youve got Sheffield a guy who scored 500 points You know that I I think that says something about the depth of your talent And its also says something about the whole transfer portal thing And they they may be perfectly happy but you could go someplace where you could play the whole Amena One more Hes gained a lot of confidence tonight And its an even 100 for the Blue Devils Scott the rebound The shot clock is off and a pretty good Friday night 58 point win for Duke applause and cheering Pretty impressive Really impressive Six different blue devils
