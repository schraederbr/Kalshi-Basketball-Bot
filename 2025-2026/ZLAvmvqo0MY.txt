McCrae leading the ACC in assists A lot of dribble drive and kick very active dribble handoff giving good looks McCrae nice penetration to kick out to the baseline The extra pass on top Were going to see a twopoint shot I think No maybe not Theres a three by McCrae Got it Bad announcing laughter You know they dont settle Okay So I messed up the first possession All that prep down the drain Ten Boozer And this team can really get after you Florida State have spells where they sort of disappear on that end of the floor Good closeouts Both teams going to have to do a good job sound closing out Cameron Boozer crosscourt pass the extra one to the outside of Foster and he buries it How about that ball movement Poise under fire Caleb Foster with a three Ste does a great job on the offensive glass Dribble handle does a solid job screening McCrae spin move but he ran into some trouble and turn it over Nice shot by Evans with the read the dig The three goes up immediately for Duke on the other end Good hustle Jones here Jones with a board I dont think therell be many violations here Clockwise Nope Duke takes about 17 seconds per possession to get the ball up and Florida State more like 14 and a half So its going to be up and down Got to really dig and recover Thats the key Nice dribble drive here Boozer spins and loses it Good job by saying giving it up Jones the lefty with a three Got it Wow Jones played at Bonnies He is a tough kid cuz he can really put it on the deck and be creative as well So Florida States got two threepointers already in the first less than two minutes Whats your over and under on three I dont know Yesterday at practice you and I were laughing I said I have never seen more threepoint shots taken in my life And and nobody was upset about him either No just extraordinary Well thats that NBA philosophy espoused Thats what Luke Lock brings coming as an assistant coach in the NBA here to his first year as a head coach of the seminals His alma mater inside thats tipped Dumbo with the big hands Nice read Great scouting preparation Little shuffle cut or curl Evans lobs inside Theyre making it tough on Boozer fronting him and behind him Really Solomon McCrae in the front with his good understanding defensively of helpside Heres what were looking at Highest percentage of shots from three Only Louisville is ahead of Florida State right now And you look at some of the other teams in the past 40 of their points for Florida State come from threepoint land Nice extra pass with a clean look Gumba can pass Thats what makes this Duke team tough They pass The bigs pass well Evans the dish inside and Cameron Boozer scores for the first time How about that adjustment with the left hand Had the traffic on his right Powered up McCrae working against Foster all the way in The kick out The three for Somerville Yes it goes They relocate beautifully because they know theyre going to be unselfish get a piece of the lane and find a little nickel dimemer here early We talked about Boozer on the open His ability and talent just extraordinary Great feel Look at the adjustment right here Sees the traffic switches hand and again the other end of the floor Get a piece of that lane Get those puppies organized Somerville driller Here goes another from Duke And that one goes as well from Evans He can make him Big Texas game early in the year Wonderful shot preparation Florida State three for four from threepoint range for their nine points Dukes got a couple threes as well This is a drive There is a twopoint play How about that Knock that one down 410 I think you got to mix them up You know we weve talked about that That ones an air ball I think you should take this to break Well youre youre in shock but once in a while I heard bathtub Seven threepoint attempts a game They play make about 11 and a half When you go around the country as we both do and watch these practices they really share the coachs responsibilities Its not like the old days Yeah Up in the tower Wasnt Bobby B used to be up in the tower with you I used to come down here and go up in the tower with him during football season Bel good offensive rebound They can finish at the rim Someville is going to try another His arm got hit That could have been a fourpoint play Drill it They stretch it out Now this is going to really open up a little more of their ability to get in the lane and be even more selective and creative This is where they have to sustain it against this powerful Duke team where they use the floor Great Baseline three and it goes Thats David Sar They havent been patient enough on the offensive to get Boozer involved Cam that is automatic switch all five spots The luxury of his mobility McGee is gonna try one Wow Kobe McGee What a start Catch and shoot three Five out of six from threepoint land Heres over Nice drive kick Long rebound Thats over back Yeah cheering International rules didnt prevail Yeah thats right Dam Kane Boozer just looked at him and said Dammy thats not how we do it here cheering Oops Hey yoops Had a few of those in my lifetime A sixpoint Florida State lead here early And theyve been redot from outside the ark Yeah Duke has to control the tempo of the game just a little bit on their offensive set when they dont get a run out Offensive foul Got to get the bigs involved at the other end Mentioned how they pass But right here that arm goes out Left arm traps very easy visible The Boozers bring it up together No back screen pop and then a lock Kmenya in the lineup Oh not a good time Duke turnover Great help by Jones Alert Cam Miles in the lineup for Florida State He can shoot it too You notice how far you have to go out and guard on the perimeter That opens up a lot of passing lanes driving lanes You got to be 35 ft away just to pick somebody up McGee try to reverse layup and lets see Its going to go over to Duke Nice job by Sar helping out Slow starts for Dukes been a problem Texas Tech they started slow then they had a 17point lead in the second half and they let it slip away Thats their only setback this year 82 to 81 And John was saying that the lamenting the fact free throws which are normally pretty good some key turnovers but Texas Tech is pretty good Oh they almost had another over and back This is where they post them up They got him if they need him Giveaway belute I believe Join host Nate Berles center square Drew Barrymore and her wild crew of celebrity friends for a brand new season of fun and games Hollywood Squares returns CBS Wednesday and streaming on Paramount Plus Boozer plays within the philosophy Wont do anything silly They got a mismatch right now Thats for Hes patient too But they nearly The Permuda defense is so good Oh he walked He walked and he slid with it Did he not Yes he did Thats called intimidation Its like being around you Some of the great stature right here the aggressive defense on the perimeter has been tough Its discombobulated using a fluid offensive flow for Duke Little handle strip Yep Nothings been easy for the Blue Devils so far And were 7 minutes in Foster now is going to run the point And Cam plays wherever he wants Exactly I say that as a compliment And they finally got it to him but got a foul out of it And thats a second on Somerville Johns really good at finding little spots to take advantage of this great talent in Camp Boozer We thought that Johny Wiggins for the most part would be the guy to try to handle him early but that really hasnt been the matchups theyve had so far Foster three Scramble for the loose ball Put back in by the big fella That trip they handled all that action well defensively Got a great clean look John was saying we got to shoot the ball a little better than we have been of late Gungba his first basket The two guys he thought he wanted to get more involved were Gungba and Isaiah Evans Tough match here Oh what a settle Tough shot I know Over the big guy Kept alive though Kick out Thought he was going to try it again from there Underneath instead and he scores and a chance for an oldfashioned three Now we open the telecast with the graphic and talk about rebounding getting second opportunities Just extraordinary This kid is good gets 37 offensive rebounds a game but here hes in position to dominate Steen Just solid One of those whatever you need coach guys That 37 offensive rebounds for him is tops in the ACC out of Panama City Beach Florida And a chance for Alex for a threepoint play Hes a 67 free throw shooter and got it Ever saying they come over here in a van I think Yeah they tailgate outside Its great Not a bad Did you stop by or I havent I should have It was a little rainy post game Well check on him I got little nickel dimemer Im going to call it on McGee Yeah cheering I got to take it easy Just play a little body up There is contact Cause the walk Dont get too hyped up Nice little plop Little trap out of the timeout And Duke is answering three for three on their end of the floor Thats Sars second He can make him He did it early in the year Really good defender too See that help and recovery by Sar Lead down to four with 114 Theyre going straight up man And Duke at the end of half has done it Miles a guy that can really put it on the deck and be nice hands Sar broke that up Hes a terrific defender I think Look at him give ground Hes long Rebound off to Foster and Duke looking to push it Yeah this is where theyre dangerous A hold on the back there So again they tried to get it inside Picks up the foul Working on my French here my delivery Tomas basically And right here no way the one way of stopping them though But again theyve been very alert weak side And they try to get him to on the baseline inbound Its knocked out of bounds by Simos You might see John just play one center and put him on that foul line boozer where hes really tough in an ice Jimemena the kick out gave up a three Extra pass back to Jimemena Thats way off the mark Cam Miles an easy rebound Good crossover and find for three in and out Young with a rebound Watch Boozer I thought they might find him in the there again A little late but they thats what they have to do He goes up and under that time Gumba is a excellent passer Nice look Thats what happens when youre run the floor Possess your man Miles fadeaway three Its off the mark and Fosterss got another rebound Nice rebound huh Yeah hes doing a nice job on the board Averages about three and a half a game I think hes got three or four already Nice cut Camber boozer The drive knockdown blocked Sounds beautiful And the follow by Steam Thats what he does Doesnt give up on a play Big time effort Five for Alex Stein The lead stays at four midway through the first half Look at how they are collap fronting and weak side protection Florida State crowd chanting defense and theyve defended pretty well so far today You just cant get the ball now Nice help side Oh alert McGee Twoon one leave and the flush McGee to Mash cheering Cameron moves through one up and it goes in And hes right Hes looking for the foul He does a great job turning ripping through Should have been a threepoint play or an opportunity So muscle shot Unbelievable Well you mentioned the legs yesterday and hes got great base Base A big base Heres Amanda with a steal Hes going to take it coast to coaster Try draws the foul And it looks some pretty good defense on Florida State got them going a little bit but right here just a hustle play on that little ISO with the post Theyve scattered it and theyre prepared Dont give up The nice run out the finish at the rim But this is where he rips through Now thats definitely a reachin foul You got to be attuned to that as a a referee Amena at the free throw line Nicholas a freshman out of Los Angeles Another McDonalds AllAmerican You can say that just about every time you see a Duke player at the free throw line or whenever you want to talk about it Absolutely incredible Both teams going to their bench Cameron Boozer getting a breather and his twin brother Kaden back in the lineup Harvard Westlake Collins brothers pretty good players out of there So those free throws cut it to two And heres the guy I think could surface for Duke the rest of the season Harris Darren Harris Talking about shooting you know he can do that Good solid kid See if he takes advantage of the opportunities Again automatic switch so you youre prone to a slip and a fine McCrae goes right back But the reporter on the way goes Wiggins Wiggins How about that He does have some range some ability Thats his 27th of the year Only around 30 Good enough for that one to go and give him a fivepoint lead again Tayden Boozer against McCrae and McCrae rejects it They stayed at home on the shooters in the corner and McCrae lost it off his foot going the other way So a turnover each way And Brown great defender too Always got his hands active the flex Eight minutes to play first half Yeah spreading the wealth here without Camboozer on the floor Evans in some traffic What a dish and a stop by Jones Wow Jones pushes it ahead Threepointer Wiggins And a push from behind on Cam Mills The handle in the middle of the floor by Jones was like hell be able to come back because hes the leader of the pack and the leader of the ACC and assists at over seven a game Thats his shooting hand too Yep So at the free throw line is Isaiah Evans He doesnt miss many from the stripe What a great stroke this kid has Four points for Isaiah Sophomore out of Fyville North Carolina His ability to shoot deep certainly opens up things for Cam as well 88 center from the line so far this year and buries both easily Five for him and the lead cut to three Theres little 212 Youve got some shooters on the floor Harrison Evans obviously on the perimeter can knock shots down Florida State started five out of six from outside the arc They are one for their last six Nice hands Oh didnt come up with it though Jones in some traffic and turns it over Kaden Boozer will bring it in for Duke This is where the brother is tough I think Cam at the game Theyre both on the floor now Lob underneath Easy And that was poised settled Didnt force the issue both sides of the floor in the lock low by a tough out Robert McCrae did come back out of the locker room so hes back on the seminal bench right now as their leads been cut to one A nice reaction on the pin down by Wiggins What a luxury Look at the footwork Somerville trying to dish underneath The last two times theyve done that has been a turnover This time they get a foul out of it Yeah Malik Brown trying to help out Theres McCrae back and hes coming back in So much for the reaction that pretty good medicine medical staff Now hes got tape on the wrist though The right wrist Getting everything situated uniform wise Wiggins on the inbound McCrae fade away to the right hand Drew a foul How about that little body up by Harris trying to contain that turn They really handled the baseline out of bounds beautifully Just couldnt get him turned So now well see if whatever happened to Robert McCrae has any effect on his free throw shooting because as Raph said hes got a sweatb band on his right hand Hes got tape on his right hand We thought he was looking at his shooting hand So well see because he can go right too I mean they did a good job forcing him to that left He knocks that one down March 1st a new Casey Dutton journey begins Luke Grimes stars in the CBS original Marshall series premiere Sunday March 1st on CBS And there is the top boozer Carlos Great player at Duke in his day Watching his sons playing here Not a bad player huh Id say great pro career as well We did a lot music of his games and now were watching the kids play Tough match for Steen here The dribble drive looking for a little gap help Cameron Blizzard leaves it inside to his brother who got mugged underneath Oh theyre going to call jump ball Possession arrow goes to the nose But Cam just cant get going with their weak side preparation and sniffing out things pretty good Heres brother gets jammed up in traffic Nice job by Steam Yeah good hands McCrae back over Jones gave up a three Loops it around to Steam Steen little drop step trying to wait And Ill tell you his Kaden got a hand in there They are active around that ball Its going to be on Harris again I think like an opportunity for Steam to just power up and all of a sudden just these hands in here swipe it away Kaden Boozer got a hand on it and then Harris fouled him as he was going down So Wiggins will inbound Brown really gets after with those long arms Eight on the shot clock We havent worried about the shot clock too much We didnt expect that Wigans going to go straight up with it and got it Wow that was a quick release Thats absolutely better offense but pretty darn good D as well Little high low How about that entry pass from almost half court That was a beauty He does it all Malik Brown one of the only guys in the world thats leading his team in scoring rebounding assists and steals Cameron Boozer nice help Theres a block Brown is so active Things you dont notice Sometimes the block you notice but just the preparation to be there help his teammate out Just lean them in Sar leads him in Just great activity Goodness Tough Martinville So this is Martin Somerville at the free throw line When he knocks it down hes 23 out of 83 right now Hes got that three thing going too right Yeah Consecutive Yeah hes hit 43 straight games with at least one three Hes got two here in the first half Hes the leading scoreer for the Seminals as they stretch it back to five with five to go in the half cheering Dukes had a little better rhythm on the offensive end They use the floor dont they And they knock down the three right in front of the semol bench And thats Evans How about him What a great look diagonally Somerville He used Catquick Plenty of room inside The way theyre defending JONES ON THE DRIVE WITH A screaming STOP WHOA WOW HELLO LE He can do some things cheering And a collision out on top with Cameron Foster Boozer rather That is going to be three fouls on Somerville Everybody in the family is going to get a snapshot of that one Youre not kidding How going to the right strong What an effort for that lefty His dad played at Oklahoma This is Hes going to remember this one for a while and so will the fans So do I amazing ability to get to the rim Just a tough kid So the only thing we havent seen Cameron Boozer do so far is go to the free throw line And here he is Oh yeah His last six games hes averaged 26 points almost 11 rebounds four double doubles and shot 61 from the floor We always talk about that point forward mentality He could play the back court easily Hes got a good enough handle for it and hes in double figures now at 10 A nice little rest period now Johns got him The next TV timeout They know Duke when they come to a bill everybodys giving them the best shot Absolutely And John talked about that yesterday That means youve got to be as prepared mentally and physically as possible Got a target on your back every time you play And Wiggins now coming to the forefront a little bit offensively for the seminal He may get cut shooting the twopointer Hes got eight for the game And we got a whistle and a foul on the inside 355 to go till halftime Well this is for the family The Jones family rejoicing Bonnies contribution The big fella sending it in Michigan has really been impressive late of the last couple of weeks Obviously Arizona I saw them beat Yukon I mean youre talking about really high level Iowa State against Purdue You you would agree that a game Wow You were incredulous when it was over Uhhuh Definitely Thats Florida State has 10 fouls right now Duke with six So were shooting free throws as we go through the last 345 Twopoint lead is all right now And theres a push on Gunbo Yeah thats the problem when you pop out All five are switching You get a big guy to a Ly Vet with the bounce enough Hes got to give ground knowing they cant hurt you out there Never really got it turned unless wanted that switch in that particular area As I said were shooting free throws the rest of the way And were shooting them right now with Robert McCrae who was one for two his last trip Wake Forest first and Jacksonville Yep Native of Columbia South Carolina They missed that one too Open and a chance for Duke to take the lead or tie They had not led in the game We did have a tie earlier at 33 Pick and pop and a back screen on the popper They got what they want now They just got to get the ball in the right spot And look at all the weak side help Thats a mile off on a threepointer and chased down by Florida State And then a bump foul on Evans Two really cheap ones Survivor 50 is coming to CBS Wrapped I thought Id let you know that if youre not music watching the greatest reality show on television this is the season you cant miss Light Your Torch February 25th I shouldnt ever say light your torch to him on CBS and streaming on Paramont Plus Oh yeah the torch is generally lit laughter with the statement of one more Thats why I didnt want to go there Air Maloo has not shot a lot of free throws so far Yeah And he misses that one So Seols left a couple out there on the last two trips Some with the foul problems out of the game Theyre going to get some miles some game out of miles now Cam holding off Just cant get it in the right side Evans launches a three Little bit strong Nice high rebound again for Maluke Now lets see if Florida State can get a clean look A little bit of a dry spell from the floor Got to move the legs and get the hands out of there Miles the kick out Jones didnt quite get to him fast enough but hes going to take it anyway Tough Rims it out Great challenge Foster going baseline Hes cut off there Cameron Boozer now going to try to drive Long step left hand doesnt go and one of the smaller guys on the floor gets the rebound And Luke did a pretty good job Wiggins going up and in with it How about that McGee with the pass but getting down the floor not connecting defensively by Duke just when it looked like maybe Duke could take the lead instead its Wiggins for three are key how do we get the big guy better touches and better located approaching the twominute mark run and jump Evans trying to get it into Cameron Boozer who draws a double team good cut thats what they have to do they got to walk on him I Huh Yep A tough catch for him but that was an ideal response with the dive to the rim Everybody really doing a solid job Weak side Heads up Well maybe he was on He might have stepped on the baseline I think Yeah At two minutes and Kaden Boozer at the scorers table set to check back in for Duke as well Closing the half Robert McCrae had a threepointer early and then just one free throw since Boy nobody home on that one Yeah theyll give him that one Great recovery though defensively That three goes from the corner for Star Thats a welcome sight Refreshing Hes got three threes in the half Well they got a Maloo not getting set And thats the one thing we talked about John yesterday They do a great job screening without fouling Conversely this particular play little extra mobility probably not set early enough Yep Well unless they got the feed too wide too That could be possible Either way its his second foul And Saru hit the three on one end cheering Look at these high lows Eliminates the help Beautiful Great design Everybodys spreading the corners Tied for just the second time of the ball game With one minute to go first half here from Tallahassee Cam Miles taking his time on the dribble Now were under 10 on the shot clock Hes going to try to do it himself What a shot by Cam Mills And I think that definitely a two for one maybe a three for one Luke was thinking about with that delay Youre right Circus finish Cameron Boozer to his brother Kaden in some traffic Nice pass And the extra pass What a great boy You step up and the fine Well John said hes playing better much more confident Ive watched him with a pullup jumper of late looking for his game a little bit This time a dribble drive and fine Just under 18 Their best shot and were right there Exactly They trailed by as many as seven at 20 to 13 Heres that zone look I think Lets see Dont see that from Duke much once in a while It is the zone look and the run out McGee long three Nope Might get another chance He will That one doesnt go either So were right where we started Only 42 points later Cant keep giving him open looks though Thats Dukes first lead right there Isaiah couldnt drill him This is a similar game to earlier in the week with Duke and Florida State Uh uh Georgia Tech I should say Georgia Tech was hot in the first half and he had a fivepoint lead early in the second half before Duke took over Bad mistake there in Look at this look Oh and a block by McCrae at the rim Out of bounds What a great look though Youre right You go you make shots We know about Isaiah Evans but what an unselfish look Does get a little over one assist a game What a great run out excellent defense move again being in the right spot Little help side Staying at home on the bounce Not a good beginning right here A little raggy Yep Nice crossc screen Brother to brother That was a pretty good look by Cameron Boozer And it is going to be a foul on Jones Nice help by Jones too Nice read Welldesigned play crosscreen Get your big in that block area and just solid And then the ability to cut from the top Excellent designation Gnaba going to the free throw line for the first time today Dukes perfect from the line Still perfect from the line Nine for nine as a team Yeah he gets going And uh those two inside are just a load Working on that threepoint shot Starting to make a few Great rotation Got them both So in the first minute and a half of the second half all of a sudden things have changed dramatically A fivepoint Duke lead So they seizing control Do you have that feeling Everybody staying at home on the shooters You got to contain the bounce Theyre doing that magnificently You notice theyre not getting free looks because of that McCrae trying to go to the rim They got Cam late foul on Boozer Thats his first Just stood up a little with the dribble and couldnt contain Once it comes down to this left side you got to turn them back and they never were able to So McCrae had the opening three of the ball game and now hes back on track from the free throw line He missed his last two Got them both Six You were worried about that hand Looks right huh Yep I think so See they they dont attack cheering Kayen Boozer Hes going all the way in He got fouled late Got hit pretty good but they fell asleep too Not expecting him to take advantage on the bounce They cleared out that side for him Just a good read here And thats going to be on Somerville Thats bad news Somerville was their leading scoreer earlier and hes got four now Just that clear out by Wiggins by his brother opened up that opportunity Kaden Boozer at the free throw line His first trip All those two have done is one right Replaced the two brothers in bed Summit games state championships Four straight straight championships cheering Got them both His first two points of the ball game The lead goes back to five One two two here Make them use a little bit of clock Well they got a perfect trap Oo he split it He split it though Its got to be every all all the luggage has to be across You had a perfect view is right in front of you McCrae nice crossover and scored it Wow that was tough in traffic Big time finish Oh hes hurting that right arm though Right hand Hes grabbing it Boozer missed a three cheering Steen I believe What they get Gumba Uh theyre going to call it on Steam Crowds not going to like that call holding that hand there Nice coverage on that baseline What a nice little play Nice inbound Oh pretty easy one for just post up in the corner by Cam Just an excellent play Little extra pass to boot McCraes been the second half scorer and did it again Pretty good challenge too Cuts the lead back to two McCrae all of the seminal points here this first three and a half minutes Nice cut Good D by Steen too McGee ahead McCrae can he make another one Theres Steens effort Theres his offensive rebounding outside of Wiggins for three Got it Wow Give two of those points to Ste Yep What an effort cheering Nice cut And a flush inside by Evans Go get it big fella Oh yeah Theres one of those assists from the two bigs that Gungba little zone look for you Brad Yeah they played a little bit of that their last outing and Wiggins underneath now And thats the problem when you do the zone Nobody seems to check out or identify Nice follow Got to give Florida State credit They could have gone away and hidden when Duke got a fivepoint lead and that done anything but that Evans long crossover off the window No good And McCrae Well they got numbers here at the rim too Got it me and Kobe McGee What a run out encounter underneath Kaden Boozer Left hand score it Brother to brother but what a great look with that open middle Everybody drawn out The pace slowed down for just a moment Hes been back and forth and up and down in a hurry McCrae working against Cameron Boozer Right hands it How about that Hes putting on a show right now He is clever Great individual ability Cameron Boozer Long crossover and going to be a foul on McGee Thats the first time theyve been able to give it to him on top Didnt look for a three Just put it on the a ceramic dolphin figurine without a price Thats seven a game roughly But he Cam knows hes a lefty Im sure trying to block the left hand What a clever move with the right knockdown So Cameron Boozer 10 points on the game averaging 23 and a half and hes three for three from the free throw line This kid is non plus I mean just goes about his business Look at the numbers on the assists Seven for the game Theyve taken away a lot of what he does and hes all about winning You know I asked John Sher yesterday I said Are you concerned John about your free throw shooting He said Yeah it is a concern Well not today 14 out of 14 He did say Were good I dont know whats going on laughter Nice show So a little nickel dimemer to reach in Brown so good with the hands though Anticipation Is that number three Yeah it is number three Look at the length defensively when you got Brown Sar Evans just huge Something Florida State doesnt have No What a cross What a crossover Oh threw it away though And going coast to coast is Foster Smart Good strength Jones trying to get involved offensively Hes got some nifty moves He sure does And that was in traffic That was a difficult maneuver but Foster does a great job Helped out on that last trip Evans three Got it Cant leave him alone Back and forth we go with the lead changing hands Were under 14 minutes to go Miles theres a mismatch Oops Almost walked Jones thought he was going to take a three No post up game Finally elbow delivery Wiggins on the baseline Going to try to back in and its swatted away from behind by Brown Who else Right Yep up at Syracuse Perfect in that little philosophy came to Duke and just excellent defense that the helpside defense by Duke is just extraordinary So whatever coach Locks has for an inbound play they need it right here 18 and they dont have a lob guy really So its going to have to be a catch and shoot McCrae backs out They got it inside to Wiggins off the window Well they zoomed up and nobody talked Too easy an entry Going to harass the pass Force it wide Evans going to take a three again Heat check Got it What a great call from the sideline A flare and then a pin and then a knockdown Hes got five threes Three of them this half Offensive Wow Foster Great defense Theres this little miscommunication here on that Everybody covering scrambling This is just off a great pin Gets him organized at great length Can elevate knock him down Boy he can be unhurried Evans last year 19 points against Florida State which was his careerhigh at that point Rebound off to Brown Seven lead changes this half First half there wasnt one because Florida State had the lead throughout until the 4242 halftime score in traffic Lot of hands above that rim Whos going to come up with what Finally loose What hands McCrae up under no foul cheering Duke comes back Extra pass to Foster for three You got it How about the ball movement Extraordinary Really made it difficult to rotate and cover I had my head on a swivel I couldnt quite figure where it was going How unselfish Just like that Duke back in front by five Nice slip Look at the recovery McGee with a left hand They needed that one And they needed a solid possession there after Duke had a run going Boy every trip The physicality the extra effort the cover the distance you have to run I wouldnt leave Evans alone No And right now hes got a mismatch with Miles where they got an offensive foul on a cheering screen and detention Thats right Isaiah Evans this half Unbelievable Three threes and he leads the way for Duke right now with a threepoint lead with 1115 to play And hes driving it more not necessarily today That set his game up a little bit too And his elevation once again that zone They were able to find the offensive rebound out of this They did that a little bit against Georgia Tech because Tech shot so well through the first half So they have some practice playing it Well you got Cam under there Kaden Boozer ahead and underneath Stripped away by Jones Hes another guy theyd like to get a decent look Mhm Obviously Dukes defense knows that too Somerville by the way is back in with four fouls Here is Jones Theres your wish He does have a great stroke Yeah he does Evans though pulls down the rebound Cameron Boozer back in Kaden Boozer running the point Evans has been the hot hand Shooters in the corner Stretches the D Knocked away by Somerville They should be able to camboozer the music ball now in the lane if they want with these great shooters covering each SAR on one side Evans on the other Itll be Camboozer on the inbound to his brother There he is Loosening the game up a little bit Thats going to really help coming down the stretch Wiggins picks up the foul So Camboozer will inbound just to our left Evans feeling it Tough save What a save Hayden Boozer three Rims out Followed in by Brown What a great look to give the open look and then the follow at the rim Brown McGee got his man to fly by Hell take the jumper midrange Something they dont do much Uncomfortable Nine and a half to go Duke by five Earlier in the game you said uh now that youre into the league schedule this is what makes you good Games like this right Come March Camboozer kicks it out Evans three rims out Jones with a rebound Somervilles going up with it Nice rebound Didnt squeeze it though Now Duke ahead long foul Yeah cheering lets see A little bit late Uh get it out and punish you Lets take a look at our ATT Fast Analysis presented by ATT And great passing by Camboozer too Uh theyve really been solid getting the ball side to side slip passes finding one another and around the horn Huh You saw that Of course that was just a simple back cut Duke 15 for 15 from the free throw line And that is the difference in the ball game right now And John was saying its its almost you dont want to get to the point that its a mental problem Yeah The free throws Im sure they just did their usual drills confident in their concepts and strokes As a team they came in shooting 70 today 100 And this is the biggest lead of the ball game Roly Masamino used to call these zones hands up Harry It worked Yeah the hands up were good And the three goes as well for Sar Timeout Sars fourth three The wrinkle is health Slowed the pace down First double digit lead by either team GoPro Doesnt mean my kid wont give me that No pressure kid Just add 10point advantage but still the biggest lead of the ball game And you mentioned Sar Hes at the top of that zone with that wingspan too Take away pass entries Challenge a shot See if McCrae can get some offense going He was the early offense in the second half for Florida State Six on the shot clock A little bump like I think inside Oh they got it on the floor Wasnt much to that one No Im looking a little reaching with the hands I guess S Yep I guess so Thats a penny and a nickel Not even a dimer McCrae working against Boozer Fades on a three and he got it Nice step back Oh theyre going to call that a two as well So Florida State trying to work their way back in this thing Theyre showing a lot Duke has got a rhythm going right now though Nice slip You can see rims out and Wiggins with a rebound Yeah they dodge one Every trips a big trip right now for Florida State And McCrae draws the foul from Foster 727 remaining in regulation Six ranked Duke on the road Could learn a little from that laughter I didnt want to bury you Totally Sure So you take a hit yourself too Yeah exactly Thats good Just has a nice style about him Yeah As as does Luke as well Theres a Florida State turnover they did not need Now Duke can slow it a little bit See if they can work it to Cameron Boozer Now its going to be Evans Was right on it too Boy it doesnt take long to release it Nice kick back McCrae thought he was going to take the three Instead he takes it inside to Steen and he had it knocked down by Gunga So flat underneath the backboard cheering Fans thought that Evan stepped on the baseline letting him alone This is where hes tough Yeah hes tough You You got to do something quick like a dig at least or double Shouldered that one in Hollywoods biggest party is now bigger than ever with more stars more glamour and more chaos Nikki Glazer host the Golden Globes Thats live CBS Sunday January 11th and streaming on Paramont Plus So the big fella going to the free throw line Been kind of a quiet day Four for four from the stripe Part of 16 for 16 from the free throw line for the Blue Devils as a team And theres the first miss I just realized Ive been living with Duke all week Sun Oh thats right With the football Sun will win And are you offended by that or No not at all A lot of nice people Got the second 13 for Cam The leads eight Make you think all the time though A little wrinkle here again Back to that one 122 Use some clocks Settle into their zone They do a great job collapsing if the ball does go around the hole Wiggins inside that zone Thats wide open That little logo ACC that area decided to take away the threes Give them a couple of dues Massachusetts Its 20 for Wiggins Nice ball movement by the Blue Devils And the bumps going to be on Maloo I mentioned Evans earlier with that dribble drive Well get back to it in a minute But right here we got a little high low going A nice elevation but you got the ability of Evans and now Sar to drive it a little bit It really a big time advantage in their arsenal This is Sar at the free throw line sitting on 13 points Came in averaging 61 a game So hes more than doubled that today But he left one out there but hes kept alive by his teammate Pretty good save huh Oh boy Thought that was going into the crowd Great job by Kobe Mills all the way Blocked by Boozer Got numbers now McGee got it Good hustle play Wiggins deliver it Whether its the twopointer or the dish cheering McGee with a three The leads cut to three And Duke wants a timeout The crowd cheering at crowd at the Donald Tucker Center into it right now in Tallahassee Six music ranked Duke with the lead but the Seinals wont go away I mentioned a couple hours ago at the top of the show that unranked Florida State teams have had some success over the years with highly ranked Duke teams and seven wins over that stretch of 20 years is not too bad Thats most better than a lot of teams can say against Duke Of course we music were both talking to Pat Kennedy former coach here talking a little about the Carolina the opening game in the ACC when he was coaching And what did Sam Cassell say about the Smith Center Something like uh whatd you think of the place He said Wine and cheese Wine and cheese Thats right That was Sam I wonder if Duke comes manto man the next trip down because once a little high low right out of the gate What a good call Easy one for Cameron Boozer Two good passes to one another No theyre still staying in the zone and they go right back to Wiggins He hit the last one from that spot or very close to it but this is a Duke rebound instead by Foster Well the mentality of a threepoint team as well This zone has been impactful taking away that game forcing him to deuces Nice jump into the passing lane by Miles Next Saturday college hoops Conference play heats up in the Big 10 Wisconsin pays a visit to number two Michigan right here on CBS and streaming on Paramount Plus Dan Boozer out on top working against Jones Shot clock at six Evans its going Its going up and its Dont leave him Oh boy They got a mantoman trip No no Back to the zone No man theyre just switching automatically Somerville A lot of dribbling going on Not much else Piece of the lane and find somebody McCrae in some trouble Right hands it and draws the foul from Foster How about the back defense too Not giving up on the play Gumba what a presence So McCrae draws the foul Were shooting free throws the rest of the way and has has had its impact on the offensive end Counter that Make sure you guard Evans at the other end and that high low game Robert McCrae is the only seminal to go to the free throw line this half and he knocks that one down making him three for three this half and 16 points for the game So he continues to be their leading scoreer the leading assist man in the ACC and hes trying singlehandedly to keep these guys in it along with he and Wiggins at least When you have 17 assists against Alcorn State that sort of helps your average right That is crazy School record in the season opener Under four to go Straight up man I think its got to go through Cam at some point Theres that cross screen Evans long drive and lays it in Again the mix in his game so attractive Hes just matched his careerhigh with 23 Little switch there Wiggins Well he didnt have to foul him either Not really you know But when you can shoot the ball you own the defense Two run out to protect big time Number three at the rim Staying honest for the lob Opens up Clark Blanch wanted to get number three going John Shier and hes got number three going today Nats Wiggins at the free throw line 20point day Hes been solid Really solid Kobe McGee hit a couple of big shots but if it wasnt for McCrae and Wiggins I dont think this thing would be as close in the second half They like that 221 full They do play some zone I dont think the zone is dictated now Things just got to be perseverance Get after people Heres that 221 A little more assertive Caleb Foster out on top for Duke Hayden Boozer trying to feed his brother down in the low block Just elevated Big right elbow Nice extra look and it goes for three How about that brother to brother and oh brother deep look lead back to six Wiggins by the way with those free throws The last trip down has matched his careerhigh too for Florida State Just being patient on that offensive end A little kick out and then the extra look and that is getting organized Nylon has he been tough Mr Foster And he says Thats how I taught those guys how to play McGee gave up a three Going to drive up and under instead 13 for Kobe Twopossession game cheering as we approach two minutes Hayden Dan Evans for three That size there Not too bad a cover by Kobe but Evans on the money too much Big time delivery Two minutes to go And hes at the top as well to negate the threes Theyve just forced the change in the mentality of Florida State Very tough to get a good look at three Forcing him to make dribble drives Jones got a look Didnt go Rebound McGee Jones again Well he wanted to take another one Evans was in his way McCrae way over on the side of McGee for three again He got fouled Yeah followed through Cost him Now theyll get an opportunity to get three points in a different fashion Boy McCrae can handle that ball Can he No doubt Just extraordinary with the dribble This catch in response to his terrific look Kelby McGee hasnt been to the free throw line today but is an 82 free throw shooter 83 Excuse me Im sorry Brad I didnt see the feet in the landing area We didnt see the finish That was almost an on call you know unless he did land in the the shooting area Hey they need every point they can get right now Oh he left two of them out there That hurts Still two possession game with a minute and a half to go They dont have to be in a rush Good poise Evans way out in front of us near midcourt Kayen Boozer Eight on the shot clock Got to go That over the overload theyd like to run cheering Oh hes I thought he had steps Lost it out of bounds either way Pretty good design Faulty in practice Well when youre down six with a minute to go and youre a threepoint shooting team thats good news if you hit them Oo a nice cut but good hands up top Again look at the challenge Deep ball How did he have vision with Evans right there Down to three by three cheering Got to get free Crowd on its feet Theyve enjoyed every minute of this Theyd enjoy it even more if they got it to overtime or pull an upset cheering Either a post up or a drive If youre Duke you want to get to the free throw line Theres the post up cheering Now everybodys got to stay honest Boozer looks at the shot clock on the other end and now on this end And he goes to work against Wiggins Camboozer trying to muscle his way up there and draws a foul Petty just baited him Hes persistent Nice turn All the hesitation just bites guys Enough contact Cant argue with that Well could have called it on either Jones or Wiggins So boozer to the free throw line Six out of seven on the day from the stripe Gives him 16 points applause Sar comes back in for Duke cheering Amber Boozer Second of two Got them both You need quick hitters now Down five Two or three Got to hustle and they call a timeout 247 seconds remaining Well be back in 30 seconds in a fivepoint thriller in Tallahassee They look like theyre going man right now too It might be camouflage Going to be Jones to trigger it with Camboozer on him Nice screen to get him free McGee around a Oh my goodness How did he hit that shot over Evans Half turned drilling it Wow Fourth three by Kobe McGee today Now youre going to have to give it Shot clocks off Boozer bringing it down against Jones Doubled in front of us They stretch it out Should have given it a long time ago in the back court even trying to gamble for the steal But this is magnificent This shot halfway turned and able to convert Nyla deep in traffic Unbelievable And no foul too Thats over a formidable obstacle with the length of Evans And now Evans on the other end has already had his career high as we told you And hes shooting two here And to kind of talk that one in 87 free throw shooter It doesnt surprise you with that stroke Hes hit all five of his free throws cheering a onep possession game right now He can make it two and does 124 and make them use clock is what Duke is doing right now You dont want to foul Dont give up a three and a quick timeout Get a quick timeout That took about almost 3 seconds to get it into the front court to get the timeout Sound dont foul Dont give up threes Now they want a three Theres that little elevator play they like to run McGee over a double team Almost got another one to go And now Dukes got the rebound and a foul on Jones A little magic McGee trying to go once more Pretty good look for him though It was not bad considering he hit the other one earlier from the other side but as far away rimmed out not challenged and and you notice the insertion there saw another guy long guy again long just take away vision opportunity Caleb Foster his first trip to the free throw line is successful hes got a dozen well he does a lot of little things this kid he covers is on the weak side guards like heck great competitor Matts going to ice this one as here comes the inbound and McCrae might get the last shot weaving through traffic he will
