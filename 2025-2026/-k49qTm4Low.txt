Golden for this big tip off coming your way Louisville flew to North Carolina this morning because of the storm And were underway as Duke wins the opening tip at Cameron Gung by at the top of the key and a hand off for Foster will bounce into the corner and Camboozer with the touch She is the leading scorer in the country And what a way to get it underway averaging 24 and 10 rebounds But a miscommunication on the switch When youre playing against a lethal threepoint shooter which Boozer is you have to switch up Make sure you take away his space cheering Conwell will let fly from three and looks to answer and does Hes taken 264 shots 184 of those from three Thats his game Thats Louisvilles game And hes making close to four per game 378 which leads the ACC Sar outside with a misfire First time they met January 6 at the Young Center in Louisville Duke won it 8473 despite the fact they were down nine at halftime Boozer took over in the second half He went for 27 and eight rebounds kind of going to turn that over Give you a look at the Duke starting lineup That includes Isaiah Evans and Gunbo who stands 611 He is one of the best rim protectors in the ACC And on the drive the back up and in by Evans who comes in 214 a game Hes been very hot lately And thats in addition to his game going off the bounce this year as we get an opportunity to look at the Louisville starting lineup You mentioned that game on January the 6th The biggest difference number zero was not in the lineup Mike El Brown makes this Cardinal team a different group Gets a look turns and fires And off the front of the iron on Saturday 51 seconds into his return game he nailed a three Theres Boozer who once again is the ACC rookie of the week They should stamp that the rest of the ways Went at eight times Evans on the money He has five quick points Yeah And this is of course a huge game for the Cardinals coming into Cameron Indoor Stadium when you consider the fact that they lost to the Blue Devils at home wanting to get some get back in this one But the Blue Devils up to the task meeting the challenge early Thats going to be knocked down by Javon Hadley at 67 The sixth year man his third stop on the Louisville campus coming in averaging 11 and five rebounds This is the leading assist team in the ACC over 17 a game When you talk about the Louisville Cardinals they share the basketball extremely well and even better with their point guard back on the floor Foster rolling and kicking Good ball movement Sar getting into the lane spinning Nothing there He finds Foster and another cheering long distance shot goes down So thats seven in the game already for the two teams And this is a team when you talk about the Duke Blue Devils they dont rely on the three as much as they have in the past They normally destroy you in the paint but a great shooting start for Duke here at home Michael Brown with the miss Sar will attack cheering and lay it in Going right to the 10 to make it 136 cheering Dumps it off for third Theyll swing it Heres McNeely cant knock that down He was just one for five in the first meeting One of the best shooters in the Atlantic Coast Conference Hobie we had a chance to talk with Coach Kelsey pregame He made it very clear youre going to have to withstand some runs in this building You got to be able to meet the adversity and his team is seeing that adversity in the first four minutes Good swing for Sar One dribble down Wont shoot it gota right in cheering his grill taken away A collision and a whistle right on that near side 25 AC coach of the year But the job that John Sh did was outstanding and what his Blue Devils are doing in this game early is outstanding from beyond the ark only to be matched by Ryan Conwell and the Louisville Cardinals who make more threes than anyone in the ACC per game And both teams getting off to a great start behind the arc Weve already had I dont think he has a problem with them shooting the threes when theyre shooting 75 from beyond the arc No sir So Louisville trailing 136 and the ball Brown will penetrate slashing inside Took the hit and hell head to the line to shoot two Tough scenario Of course going anytime you go into the KFC Yum Center its going to be a hostile environment Duke going in I believe they got a little out of character in the first half of that game Settled in at halftime to get an opportunity to see Mike El Brown Jr who we are all happy to see back on the court Change maker for the Cards on Saturday vers And they just looked like a different team with him back in the fold A much different offensive team They were 500 team without 10 and one with him And angles Boozer right through everybody to lay in two Obie this is why Booer is such a matchup problem This is 69 230 going to the basket off the bounce the ability to handle the basketball and hes not always looking for his own Averages 41 assists per game So he finds his teammates making the right play as well cheering Alley to the foul line Gives up the dribble Felipa back for Brown cheering off the fake The sevenfooter gives it back for Conwell Shot clock is down to two Conwell will cheering drive it The scoop is up and good Great recognition by Conwell knowing he had more than enough time to get to the rim Didnt settle for a contested three Attacks the basket and gets a much needed bucket for the car They had 24 against Duke in their first game He can run very hot and cold but man when he sizzles Brown with it Shot clock to nine into the corner Foster over the top Swung around in the corner Evans cheering and slammed down by Malik Brown as he covered it But Malik Brown no one there to box him out because Duke offensively by moving the basketball puts the cards in rotation No one there to put a body on Malik Brown who gets the easy put back slam Outstanding pass So thats really his game and a terrific job there between OSU Khalifa the leading assist man for the Cardinals in ACC games Hes been dropping dimes Thats his 20th assist in ACC action Lucas has hit six of seven shots and a whistle and a foul on a drive by Caleb Foster and back to that last one But you see how Louisville is in rotation scrambling to get to the threepoint shooting and no one there to put a body on Malik Brown who gets a free run to the rim to the line He only makes 59 And the first one on target Duke coming in 291 in their last 386 win at Louisville 20 points 16 of those 20 coming in the second half of that ball game where he got to the rim at will So when you consider the points in the paint and he didnt make a three in that game he was doing the majority of his damage attacking the basket getting to the rim and finishing the free throws Now both of these teams had a full week off before they played their games on Saturday both winning pretty handily The kick out for Willie He will lift a long one and knocks it down A nice touch by 64 sophomore Adrien Woolly as he hits a three And Woolly returning to a reserve role with Mikel Brown now back in the starting lineup But great experience from Woolly Even playing a point guard during Mikes eightame with 21 against Cal So he can get it rolling offensively Final speed and cheering off the hands of Evans and numbers for the Cards Downstairs will slam that one down 1301 to go here in the first half and Louisville closing the gap against Duke Almost didnt recognize Sander Fu cut the hair since the last time we saw him get something off of the court but Isaiah Evans took a hit on that last possession and was slow getting back allowing the Cards to play five on four on offense The nice find gets Fu the easy dump to make it a twopoint game He had a strong one Saturday F did against Virginia Tech A double double 13 and 10 cheering Heres Boozer left fly and off the front of the iron One and done on that possession So a chance for the Cardinals to grab their first lead cheering Fully back from McNeely Hes been pretty quiet so far Khifa can hit that shot Im going to go a second try He wont try it from three on that occasion But what were seeing now with the absence of Kai Roots you see the two big lineup which has already led to one offensive rebound on this possession for the Cards But now with Fu and Khalifa playing together this is something that Pat Kelsey discovered after Kai Roose missed his first game with cheering the flu Roose not back in the lineup as of yet And Kelsey adding this to the dimension for the corner Bley looking to penetrate Tried to dump it into the paint and deflected Nicholas Amenya into the game now for John Sh and a whistle at 1207 to go in the half Obie often times players want to see through the eyes of a great where you get a chance to see Cameron Boozer attacking the basket And again he could be selfish and take the shot but he has great core vision great passing ability dropping it off to Patrick Gumble for the easy layup Part of the reason why Boozer is 12th in the ACC as a well call him power forward 12th in the ACC in assists at 41 per game There are point guards a lot of point guards including the one on his team that dont average 41 assists per game So youre talking about a young man with elite vision leading Duke in four of the five major statistical categories Not to mention hes hitting about 60 of his shots in traffic Tough shot by Gumba and Hadley trying to win it in the corner and chased down by Brown What an effort have started off hot from the field The Blue Devils started six of seven The Cards have now picked it up Four of six since start has spent a number of games here in Cameron Indoor He understands what to expect bringing his team into this building and hes talked to them about making sure they weather the storm and absorb those punches and continue to fight back each time Mike Brown trying to use that window That one tapped out Itll stay on this end and Kelsey engineering a dramatic turnaround at Louisville last year to get them back to the NCAA tournament He now has his full team back with Mike Kell returning over the weekend and they are going to be a major problem for sure I believe so And I believe that this team grew cheering without him Even though they were four and four they found different ways that they could play the two big lineup Also the ability to get some experience for Wooie as well as Kobe Rogers back into the lineup this year Blue in the blue but cant connect Young stay right on his back Thats going to be a traveling violation What his offense looks like without Cameron Boozer on the floor Now Mike El Brown hes got a great freshman but he also has one of the older teams in America as part of that rebuild Expectations always very high in Louisville to miss Kaden Boozer giving up the dribble He finds his brother They were raised in Florida Theyre not used to this kind of weather That one way downtown off the mark by Evans whos hitting about 35 out there Got off to a quick start Brown swings it here for Hadley Mike is on the line and turns it over The most common turnover in the game will be 1816 And coming up next were going to be sending you to Provo on ESPN and the ESPN app Number one Arizona taking on number 13 BYU Weve got two of the top six draft prospects in our game And coming up after us weve got two more elite freshman AJ Deansa the second leading scorer in the country1 points per game right behind Cameron Boozer at 236 Boozer shoveling that one up Well that should be an excellent matchup as well Boo and Fran waiting to bring that one to you after this one is done on a big Monday Mike Brown in the corner cheering Freshman on freshman there dunks it off of Fu and interrupted Pat Kelsey looking for a call on that one Felt like there was contact up top on Fus arm as he was trying to follow through with the slam off the nice feed from Brown Boozer stepping in the lane not to be denied but cant get it to go Hadley quickly up the other end of the floor cheering Adrien Woolly steps back fires off the back of the iron out to Kaden Boozer on a high board Obvious plays like that though they come back to haunt you That should have been an attack to the basket by Hadley He had a step ahead Should have challenged at the rim Instead it becomes a contested three that becomes a strong defensive possession for the Blue Dame Sar cant connect Freshman from Italy pull cheering up puck ground around and out So all of a sudden there was a lid on both baskets after a sizzling start and Gungva looking inside for someone to make a move Heres Boozer The swing for Foster Under eight and a half to play here in the first half at Cameron position there And theres no way youre going to stop that as Camboozer hits again But how about the patience of the Blue Devils They move the basketball around the perimeter Everyone looking to get the basketball inside Even with Hadley whos the best matchup against Boozer Boozer using his body to seal off Hadley penetrating No and they missed eight straight shots So all of a sudden the Cardinals are looking for a hot hand cheering May I suggest Pat Kelseys son Johnny Ball game was getting cheered on by the Cameron crazies earlier today as he was knocking down threes and Cameron Indoor Foster the corner jumper No Dunba had it but takes the hit 743 to go Well weve talked a lot about Boozer and his vision He signed an NIL deal 743 to go here in the first half and Duke on top 2216 And Foster the junior Shot clock to seven Camboozer launching Got an excellent look A lot of iron but it wont drop Louisville trying to find their offense again and it is an outstanding offense when they really get rocking and rolling Kobe you see the difference when Khalifa catches the basketball at the top of the key Theres a defender there Johnny Sh told us earlier that he was able to get off but that was his fault the last time knocking down those five threes Rogers on the drive Kipa is on the line And its the second time theyve turned it over by being on that line You have guys standing in that corner Theres not a lot of space and most of the players over there have pretty big shoes And when you consider that theres no room for a retreat step You have to understand where your spacing is on the floor and making sure youre not standing on that line when you catch the basketball Ali Khalifa 7 foot Foster tying booer Great job by Zugus there to be able to come away with that steal the hustle to keep it in bounds 68 Junior from Greece starting to get a lot more minutes Poked out of play Another deflection there by Malik Brown He leads the team with a hundred of them One game earlier this season He had 12 in a game No Can I ru for the fourth straight game for the cards So Zugers getting more opportunities as well as the two big lineup for coach Kelsey Roose who plays a similar role as does Malik Brown His last game against Boston College had 11 rebounds and two blocks So hes an energy guy off the bench that makes plays on the defensive end of the floor Oval needing desperately to break through Theyve gone 6 and 12 minutes without scoring They give it to Brown He cant hit on the layin Boozer putting it to the deck Foster up ahead and a tip and a foul 621 to go Our great friend Dicky V every for cancer Its been a lifes work for Dicky V Please get involved if you can Boozer on the spin wont finish it right back up Draws the foul No basket on the dunk but hell be headed And you mentioned this earlier This is a guy who has done nothing but win I know we say that about play He has literally done nothing but win championships since the time he was a little tikeke OB titles Cameron and Kaden Boozer have won their last game They dont know what its like to not be the champion Yeah And so which makes it even more interesting this year with the Blue Devils who went to the Final Four a season ago as you get a chance to look at the high school accolades Cameron Boozer may have the greatest high school resume of all time Yes And that is not hyperbole Think of all the great players we have seen over the years off the threepoint line Knocked down by Javon Hadley and they needed that in the worst way The second three of the game for Hadley who continues to do Ymans work on both ends of the floor Pat Kelsey relies on him so much especially defensively as hes often guarding guys much taller The question now has Duke done a good enough job taking advantage of that long drought by Louisville Second chance by Boozer up and in for two And the second straight possession where hes gotten his own rebound back from a missed shot HADLEY WHAT A TOUGH ANGLE Laid it in and took the foul Boozer trying to get back And we have to remember Boozer only got about 40 seconds of game rest When he sat out on the under the under 12 timeout John Sh did not like what was happening with this team offensively So got Boozer right back on the floor And cheering you can tell he needed a bit of a break as Sh gets him out of the game most likely until the next media timeout Hadley with nine points by the way Once again Louisville within a couple Lets see what Dukes offense does now with Boozer on the floor Where do they go for scoring looking for help Still looking finally hands it off for Evans who will launch and a high rebound Second chance right back to Evans Foster will set it up on the dribble trying to take advantage of McNeely there Got the pass downstairs Brown couldnt finish the rebound and a save by Brown right on the sideline but back over to the Cardinals Here they come A chance to tie take the lead Conwell wants the lead gets it with a triple cheering Once again the Cardinals are able to fight through the adversity weather the storm and now taking the lead 2524 cheering Boy they went forever without scoring but played some really good defense And now theyre on top 25 24 at the 4minute mark Evans way downtown but way too short Brown Gungba Yes cheering And to the line to shoot Looking for the threepoint play Nice find from Malik Brown whos had five assists in the last two games But on the other end its Ryan Conwell taking matters into his own hands The step back three ball to give the Cards the lead However Duke takes music it right back by one But when they play the nonman Doug Bub knocks that one down to make it 2725 Evans by the way hit 23 against Louisville in the first meeting And that is something that absolutely got the attention of Pat Kelsey You had three 20point scorers in that game for Duke when you consider Boozer Caleb Foster and Evans cheering Conwell shot didnt get there And now it goes And Mike so far with just one point and 0 for five So theyve done a great job on him Duke started out really hot from threepoint distance They have missed their last eight cheering And Louisville they had a sevenminute scoring drought then scored six straight to take their first lead Duke by two Foster working on Hadley Evans to the paint slicing inside for the bucket Thats it Thats what the Blue Devils need They need Evans to be aggressive but not just look searching for his threes Brown flips it up and a whistle before he hit the deck as hell draw the foul Potential basketball then number seven Louisville taking on Stanford Great action this year on the womens side Outside of Yukon you really havent had a team thats been dominant all season long So which makes March even more interesting to see who can contest Gino Arya and the Huskies cheering Well see if thats a wide open tournament A lot of people love to look ahead to the mens NCAA tournament Much the same way Right now you really dont have a dominating team do you Oh you dont I mean well you you have Yukon and they theyve been dominant but outside of that you really dont have much But I can tell you I watch much more of the womens tournament than I do the mens tournament until the final four Conwell airborne ran up against he stopped him He just shut him down Possession arrow will keep it on this end But a great job by Guma going straight up and more importantly getting two hands on the basketball which means that it cant be a foul He stays vertical gets both hands on the basketball Great call Roger right there along the baseline with both thumbs up But as you mentioned the cards retain the possession Excellent crew Roger Ron Groover and Bill Cington Jr for a big Monday which should be a national holiday by the way The first big Monday the penetration Shot wont go and another whistle Mike Brown starting to get very active offensively but having it or twohanded which makes him even more dangerous going to his left but as you said 65 Yes hes a big guard so he can be a real problem He absolutely can especially when he gets ahead of steam getting downhill You look at Mikel Brown and his ability to shoot the basketball from beyond the threepoint arc You give him space he takes advantage of it but also the 65 frame attacking with his speed He can often be a force at the rim Duke has done a great job of contesting him each and every time hes driven throughout this game So onepoint game Kaden Boozer to his brother He finds Evans for the triple Got it It doesnt take much Obie It just takes Its very simple with Isaiah Evans A small spark and start a big fire Ali wants the paint Crew in traffic Got it up there and missed He was right on top of the 10 So Duke by four and the ball at the twominute mark Boozer to Boozer and Kane laying in We watched Duke work on that exact action in shootound earlier today John Sh told us I have not coached a player that sees as many double teams as does Cameron Boozer They worked on it and his brother takes advantage of the opportunity the nice cut the nice find and the finish from Kaden Boozer trying to make it a threepoint play the oldfashioned way Kaden both of the twins McDonalds off Americans Duke has signed 95 of them all time I think by now Coach K should have been awarded a franchise laughter including cheering the guy watching them from Alaska who asked him earlier today Hey with all this snow we have going on here have the Twins ever been to Alaska and he told me No theyre Miami born and raised They are about the warm weather Theyre not about that Even though they would take them snowboarding but the older brother Carmani has visited Alaska a couple of times So minute and a half before the break Dan Boozer gets himself free for a triple but cant hit that cheering Adrien Woolly out of the pack with it Cardinal looking to make a late run They survived a long drought to hang in here Cameron Indoor Mike Brown will fire but no hes had a rough first half A loose ball and a big scram for that And out it rolls Itll stay right here Itll be Cardinal ball But this is no match up that from deep in the corner Back for Conwell cheering Well a little floater and off the iron 50 seconds before halftime and a timeout Duke will take the break Back in third See whos heating up Brought to you by Direct TV Its Isaiah Evans with Cameron Boozer on the bench Evans starts to attack the rim going off the bounce which normally sets up his long range bombs but Isaiah Evans added this to his game over the summer being able to attack off the dribble and has kept the deadly threepoint shooting alongside who is playing off the ball finally with Mike Brown Jr back in the lineup and thats one of the things that Pat Kelsey told us it does with Mike back to puts everyone back in their normal spots Evans with a full pump and hes fouled on the play So hell be headed to the line and the act of shooting a three Take another look Look at the right leg Does he kick it out in order to get contact No I believe thats part of his normal shot I think that is that is going to stay three shots for Evans That is part of his normal at the line at 88 Hes had some big moments already this season 28 against Florida State He drilled the dagger three to beat Florida in early December So to that discussion you were having with coach earlier about you know whos the next guy after Cam Boozer At times this season he has been that guy He really has been that guy and hes he is really the true threepoint threat that they have to shoot the basketball from anywhere at any time cheering You have to prepare against a guy like that because he can get hot in a hurry So about 11 seconds between to be versatile allows this Blue Devils team to do so many things on the offensive end of the floor His screening his passing music his rebounding everything about him spells winning And you see him dropping Dime finding his brother on the cut Often makes the rebounds as you mentioned An outstanding passer making about 60 of his shots The number one scorer in the country and he has Duke up by 10 Cardinals with the ball though Heres Conwell cheering Brown looking for someone Conwell again Hes cheering averaging 19 and a half points a game McNeely Zigurus with a catch Bad spacing by the Cards You got two guys right there in the dunk spot Brown straight on and barely cheering beating the shot clock So Duke with time with 4 seconds before halftime Kaden Boozer bodies up with McNeely flips it up there And thats the end of the first half Duke actually ended that first half on a nine nothing run to take their biggest lead the final four And getting ready for the second half here Duke with a basketball and on top by 10 Caleb Foster looking for a cutter Evans gets his first touch of the second half Over the top got position worked play a couple of times What Louisvilles doing theyre guarding Gungbo with a smaller player in Hadley Gunga has about a 5 in height advantage over Hadley and the recognition by Boozer to throw it right over the top and get Gunga the easy bucket Hadley stops with a foot in the paint Heres McNeely cheering Conwell will launch right there and cant hit it He gave them life offensively in the first half Conwell did as he wound up at 10 points Fortunate thats the second time Sar lost Conwell on the same defensive possession Dunwell with the spin will draw the foul And no baskets now with the the way they did to start the first half I dont know if Louis W can survive that one They were able to get right back into the game when Duke started off shooting the basketball so well from beyond the arc Made three of their first four threes but Louisville can ill afford to spot Duke A large run here to start this second half Senator Fu stepping off with his third foul So Khalifa on now for Pat Kelsece and Gunga made the pair 4228 Danger zone right away for the Cardinals Theres Brown to slice inside Took the hit Every time he attempts to make a move they put a body on him And he was doing this in the first half He was attacking the basket but was unable to really get much going as far as the calls going to the basket And you see Mike Brown off the basketball And the play design is to set to allow him to get downhill This time Patrick Gumba unable to get his body squared which is the reason why he picks up the foul cheering 83 foul shooter got back on the floor on Saturday against Virginia Tech for the first time since December 13th against Memphis They went 4 and4 without him 10 and one when he is in the lineup and he said back in high school as a junior he had back trouble as a high school star in Florida So it wasnt the first time he went through something like that But what a difference It was probably growing at the time when he went through it as a junior in high school If hes growing more hes going to be even more cheering OH THE TOP FOR Gunpa who slams it down Give him nine So its Duke by 14 Conwell way downtown Probably an ill advised shot Duke continues to keep Louisville to one and done Not giving up many offensive rebounding opportunities Guna again working hard with a right hand Hits cheering it and the lead up to 16 And Louisville has to take a timeout cheering Three points in the first half but really getting going here to start the for the Blue Devils Cardinals in dire need of an answer Who do they turn to here Khalifa up high McNeely has been walled out of this game so far cheering Khalifa off the fake trying to get a bucket out of the timeout cheering Conwell cant negotiate it Khalifa launching a triple and nails it Khalifa who was five of five from the for Louisville in the first matchup between these two teams John Shier said that was his mistake Theyre not going to allow him to have those looks again in this game but able to get free at the end of the shot clock Foster followed his own miss up and in and its Ga again and they cant keep him off the rim Conwell takes a hit Knocks it down No whistle Nice attack by Conwell though going at Boozer not settling for the jump shot Putting the pressure on the officials to either get a bucket or make a call He had 24 against Kentucky 25 against Cincinnati He can fill it up He has 12 here tonight Foster again on the baseline Heres Sar Dante Saw the freshman from Italy Foster hell fire it up and drains it Obie I had the opportunity to coach Caleb Foster in high school and he was a knockdown shooter Hes only shooting 30 from beyond the threepoint arc in ACC action But I believe thats a dimension that he can add to this team become that other guy that steps up and gives them big scoring performances Ham Boozer actually their two best threepoint men from the corner That glance is off by Hadley A second try and Millie around and out Hes been a nonfactor tonight Yeah And again was a nonfactor in the January 6 meeting between the two teams Yeah One for five six points Even though they had a lead at nine at halftime Louisville did that disappeared the second half Look at Boozer just conducting traffic just showing everyone where it needs to be Gunga step by knock tries to knock down the three ball Everything else is gone for him in the second half Why not Five for 21 from three So maybe feeling a little too much Heat check OB Heres Kyle again downtown But no And again he can get very hot but boy when hes cold 5135 Well the problem for the Cards is everyone is cold right now but you got to credit the Blue Devils defense for that being the reason This is one of the best defensive teams in the country and Duke flexing his offense and get these guys more touches whether its on the block or at the top of the key Guna and Camboozer are roommates on the road Boozer stopped got it up there and draws the foul and Camboozer to shoot His dad Carlos in the stands here as well The family so supportive National champ at Duke in his own right No one under coach K and drops in the pair So the league guy supposed to be up here with us today Jay Will unable to make the trip in because of the weather We miss you Jay Wish you could got got a chance to be back home today J better safe Im glad to hear that Swished in by McNeely see if he can get going as he buries a triple and Kelsey getting McNeely right back into the game for the offensive possession and we talked with coach Kelce pregame and we asked do you try to exploit certain matchups if you get a certain person guarding McNeely as Boozer picks up the offensive foul Zuger stepping in absorbing the contact itll be number two on Our starstudded ESPN NBA Wednesday double header coming your way Cavs hosting the Lakers at 7 And the Spurs are in Houston squaring off against the Rockets Ernie Kenny Sir Charles and Shaq tipping it off at 600 Been great having that group inside the NBA group on ESPN this year Emmy awardwinning legendary broadcast Well here are some guys who want to be included in that phrase legendary one day including Darren Peterson number one projected in the mock draft out of Kansas Tell you what theyre having legendary years You consider Boozer leading the country in scoring AJ Devons of 43 on Saturday Kingston Flemings 42 on Saturday Saturday was the day of the freshman Boozers 32 was probably about fifth on the list of scores That spectacular year for freshman trying to curl underneath and thats going to be a hook and a foul Thatll go against the Louisville Cardinals and Adrien Woolly Yeah the right arm of Woolly Had Boozer hook You see the right arm come out wrap around Boozer right there Great call Roger right along the baseline on top of it and goes for the offensive foul Willie cant believe it but I never fouled a person ever in the history of basketball You you aced that look too when you were like two years old Yeah youre supposed to laughter really good at it and a tremendous player in your own right Heres the bounce here for Cam Boozer pulling his way inside Just unstoppable on plays like that And Zubris is strong Boozer is just stronger I mean youre talking about a physical specimen with skill that very few players half his size have Well is on the line and for the Cardinals thats like the third time theyve stepped on that sideline tonight Its getting very frustrating But a lot of also has to do Obie with Dukes defensive pressure Theyre not allowing Louisville to have much room to operate especially when they catch the basketball on the sideline They use that sideline as additional defender And Duke is physical defensively They make sure to put a body on a body and that time force another turnover to a comfortable lead here for Duke at home And many of the freshman out of LA over the top for Cam Boozer right there for two more Zubris just isnt tall enough cheering And when Cam Boozer gets position the night is over with that strong lower half you were talking about Hell pick up a foul here 1323 to go Be his third Six for Duke Brown off the fake threepointer Nothing but nets His first basket of the game And now it doesnt take much for a guy like Muel Brown A little bit of confidence goes a long way for superior talent as Brown is Look for him to be more aggressive Malik Browns pass barely got there to Foster Foster on McNeely to the blue Got a bank shot Elite Brown cleaned it up Foster with a second chance Drives It wont spin in Foster beat everyone to the board Kaden Boozer Amen Young He can really shoot it 60 41 cheering Time out Those are put You look at the points in the paint You look at the second chance points Duke is winning all the 5050 balls in all the gritty dirty work plays They about rebounded Louisville as we showed you there 32 to 19 13 of those are offensive rebounds Mike Brown trying to do it himself but short Rebound tipped out and itll be Duke ball And Im sure coach Kelsey wanted to go to Brown out of the timeout I dont know that he wanted a step back three ball I thought short preferred to see Brown attacking getting downhill to make a play at the rim or to be able to kick it out for one of his teammates for a three As weve said nobody lives and dies quite to the degree the Cardinals do they keep 35 threes a game and they came out of the shoot tonight really hitting those shots Evans will fire a line driver Hes hit a variety of shots to give him 15 points really impressed with the way Slim has gone off the bounce in this game whether its to the rim cheering or to find a midrange jumper Crowd with a spin in the misses Hes not going to wait A hustle for the rebound and its tipped out Itll be Louisville to have it with 11 and a half to go Showtime slim at the top of the key The nice right to left cross to get enough space for the midi And hes admiring his own work on the back pedal Obi damaging 19 points a game the last six games So hes stepped it to another level He really has And again Seth Greenberg asked us the question right before halftime who has to step up and become that offensive threat for Duke And its not just today This is for the remainder of the season They need Evans to be that spark club to make sure that they can advance not only throughout the ACC season but in the NCAA tournament You got a superstar in Camboozer You get that second star and it begins to feel a little bit like last years Duke team A foul here with 1115 to go Yeah when you consider the fact that youve got the two guys right now neck andneck in the running for NBA Rookie of the Year who were both in the same lineup here for the Blue Devils last year Khan Caniba has had a spectacular season thus far for the Charlotte Hornets and of course Cooper Flag what hes done in Dallas has been nothing short of amazing So those two guys right now are probably one and two in the rankings for NBA Rookie of the Year Those two Duke going to the Final Four last year Heres the handoff for Willie Cardinals desperate for a hot hand Will it be McNeely Not this time Duke with an opportunity with 11 minutes to go to put this thing out of reach with another run Totally out of reach already in huge command Brown up top for Kaden Boozer Shot clock to 10 Gumball crosscourt Amena launching Duke coming in as the number four team in the country Jmena with the pick and will slam that down And that is the biggest lead of the night for Duke cheering Up by 23 McNeely Yes A triple That only cuts it back to 20 Yeah the Cards going to need much more of that but they also are going to have to find a way to put pressure on the Blue Devils allowing Duke to be comfortable bringing the basketball up the floor offensively will not allow them to get back into the lead The Blue Devils are more than content to work the ball offensively and kill some time and get a great shot at the end of the shot clock Such a tough defensive team as well A spin and a turnover by Gun hasnt done much wrong as Hadley goes there Barn and he will draw the foul I tell you what regard foul or not that was unbelievable effort from Caleb Foster the longest tenure Blue Devil He did not give up on the play Sprints back and goes vertical trying to stop Hav after the turnover Watch where one is And he sprints back gets out in transition Not much of a foul on that possession But because he was going from point A to B and making contact I agree with the call But I do love the effort by Caleb Foster who has really grown as a point guard and is a leader under the tulage of John Sh now in his third season Second one off the 10 and rebounded away by Boozer Obie That effort saves one point It may not matter much in this game but it matters in the case of the season because Caleb Foster just showed the younger players on this team the type of effort you have to play with to be a Blue Devil About to say it matters to his teammates in a big way Emanuel looking for help Gamboozer looking for Gumbys tied up and draws the foul who are both in the rotation on NBA teams right now Seion James with the Charlotte run it And then youve got Tyrese Proctor playing in the rotation for the Cleveland Cavaliers who go up against another Blue Devil by the name of JJ Reic coming up on Wednesday night You could shoot it a little bit Last two season last two years now 291 in ACC play That includes the ACC tournament which they won last year This will put Foster to the line being Louisville in the championship game of the ACC tournament But you and I were having a conversation off air talking about and comparing this team to last years team The team last year lost the best player in college basketball 10 minutes into the ACC tournament and went on to win the ACC tournament Thats how good those Blue Devils were I dont know if this team could sustain an injury to Cameron Boozer Brown going airborne Itll roll off the iron Its been that kind of night cheering for a freshman Thats a great point I mean they lost Cooper flag and yet at the time you didnt sense a panic with Duke He would eventually come back of course and play in the NCAA tournament Play very well but the ACC tournament effectively they didnt have him They didnt have him I mean and but Khan Caniple took over and you had guys Patrick Gumba stepping up making big plays Malik Brown who was also injured in the ACC tournament And so you lo you lost two of your top rotation guys but the Blue Devils have more than enough talent to continue to move on and carry home another ACC title Alli with a hand off for Brown 8 and 12 minutes to go This floater No another miss Hes just had a dreadful night here at Cameron like his return on Saturday against Virginia Tech John Shire slowing the Blue Devils down content to take time off the clock make sure they get the exact shot they want on this offensive possession Foster Foster off the dribble with the kick The man is open threepointer on the money Boy hes come off the bench and hit eight McDonalds AllAmerican OB and I had an opportunity to talk with him and Cameron and Kaden Boozer sitting in the room and he talked about he was going to be able to provide shooting around Cameron Boozer cuz he knows how special of a talent hes playing with And if he can step up and make shots like this on a nightly basis thats another area where youre going to have to defend the blue double out of famous Harvard West Lake in Los Angeles Conwell spins gets it free to Hadley and its off target But how about the job did defensively going up against Conwell on that possession Im sure thats what gets John Sh even more excited than him knocking down threes John Sh 38 years old got to a final four last year on the cut menu and made it and he has hit it for the line 10 points for the cheering sharing the basketball Everyone getting involved in the action Its been the Nick Haminia show as of late Second half a double figures in the second half Duke with four players in double figures in the game But the second half it hasnt been the usual suspect It hasnt been Boozer It hasnt been Evans them getting help from others and that was one of the areas of concern for John Sh coming in He knows he has five solid guys that he can rely on when you include Malik Brown off the bench But who are going to be that six through nine that helped them win a championship Conwell will fire and got it a threepointer But so little offense here in the second half Duke has just shut them off He has 15 points So Duke comes in as the number four team in the country They moved up one spot in the poll that was released today the AP top 25 Purdue falling off out of the top five The whistle here with 628 to go So how good are the Duke Blue Devils If they win this one and theyre well on their way they go to 191 and 80 in the conference They are one point away from being undefeated A loss to Texas Tech who they has shown us they are a very good team at Madison Square Garden But when you consider the fact that this Blue Devil team is one of the youngest teams in the country when you 888 years of experience on this roster when you consider you got a sophomore a true sophomore and Gungba at the free throw line theres no one outside of Malik Brown getting rotation minutes as a transfer for the Blue Devils And of course he was here last season so hes now part of the brotherhood screaming Gungbo with 15 cheering 7248 Hadley rolling inside A wild shot that wont drop cheering Blue Devils have won 26 consecutive home games And we since John Sh took over theyve done it with their defense This team is leading the ACC in scoring defense at 651 points per game This is a strong defensive team because Boozer is so good offensively cheering We forget about what this team does on the defensive end Khalipa cant connect Rebound comes out high to Conwell Hes wide open and drains another triple But that only makes it 74 to 51 But without any type of zone trapping pressure or really a pest defensively fullcourt manto man theres not much Louisville can do right now to speed the Blue Devils up Duke just bringing the basketball off the floor casually running their offense and down 23 You cant afford to allow them to do so Tie up here with five Texas Tech with the win over Houston this weekend pushed Houston down to 10 The Blue Devils move up a spot to four in the poll Louisville hanging at number 20 but taking one on the chin tonight here in freezing cold Durham North Carolina Theres Woolly from the corner and Evans with the rebound But thats the right play by Markeel Brown He attacks the basket He creates an opportunity for a teammate Willie unable to make the three but thats where Mel Brown is best Attacking the rim making a play for himself or one of his teammates averaging close to six assists per game Camboozer with the spin Yes How pretty is that Now cheering that reminded me of another Boozer who played here 25 years ago 19 points for the Sunwell again thought he got fouled on the play and thats going to roll out Still complaining about that 7651 and it has turned into a runaway for the Duke Blue Devils about to win their 19th game out of the first 20 of the season as you mentioned just one point away from being undefeated with that loss back on December 20 against Texas Tech Evans Camboozer again toetotoe with Fu and the fouling violation But Duke leads the ACC in rebound margin plus 96 per game They are absolutely destroying the cards on the glass And John Sy told us pregame he was impressed with the way that Louisville rebounds the basketball and he got the message across to his players prior to this Duke has had a lot of impressive wins this season Tonight beating up on a top 20 opponent that has their point guard and their best player back and leading at 7651 No Cington whistling a foul there with 329 to go Will be on Zuberus Duke comes into this game tied as the national leader with eight quad one wins with Louisville being ranked 17th in the net rankings This will be the ninth quad one win for the Blue Devils which will allow them to momentarily take the lead I believe the team that may be tied with is playing in our next match Thats correct Heres the shot by Evans It wont fall The pick by Brown to lay it in And they are outeering Louisville particularly here in the second half right down to the final minutes and this will wind up being their seventh win over a top 25 opponent cheering Mike Brown with another misfire on a really tough night A long night for the freshman He is one for 13 and a whistle stops the clock at 243 So John Sh continued to coach right down to the last seconds And coming up we are off to Provo and ESPN and the ESPN app The number one team in the country Arizona battling number 13 BYU So stay right where you are What is probably a cold and maybe a snowy night wherever you are jumping into the paint Kaden Boozer and rolls into Kaden Boozer Cameron Boozer Ka Peep AJ Iansa Mike Brown teammates on the US USA basketball hoop summit team that needed overtime to get a win last April But all these guys very close spend a significant amount of time together in the summers before they get here rivals once they get to college basketball But this freshman class cheering will forever be linked as one of the best freshman classes weve seen in college basketball Darren Harris sophomore out of Virginia with the theft Continues to play gripping defense Just 51 points for Louisville One of the best offensive teams particularly with Brown as is the case tonight in the country And yet they have been turned off by the Duke defense AJ AJ Devasa coming your way next We did on Saturday against gives Utah 43 points And we know Ace Deansa is watching right now because hes constantly sending texts of me and you and trying his best to get us to come to Provo Yes we wed like to go We got to get Dicky V out there Ah I like the way you think Yeah we we we got to get Dicky B on board talk to our bosses see if we can go to Provo do a game Rolling that out Its a great family by the way A very a great family Get a chance to take John Madrey out there with us And you know hey Salt Lake City is a Delta hub Obie you laughter then were in If theres a great Delta Lounge Cory and I are in cheering Were not too proud 126 to go and Hadley drops in a foul shot 69 at the stripe Patrick Guna was tremendous in the second half Nicholas Amen also came off the bench and delivered some big shots Yeah both those guys had individual runs of their own and scoring in double figures in the second half of this game It was Evans and Boozer who carried them in the first half but this is a recipe for success for John Sh in this team to find more guys that can help them win games Arrows with a misfire on a run out lost control of it Got it back Maybe Obie did Boozer just jump over Woolly Did he actually did I wasnt expecting to see highlights this late in the game We may need to see that replay again Well they have jumped right over the Cardinals as a team Roman with another one from way downtown He has 14 and a lead up to 31 Im not sure a lot of us had anything like this on the bingo card cheering tonight but a total blowout for the Duke Blue Devils cheering The number four team in the country Wouldnt shock anyone if they wound up as a number one team in the country at some point Now they let the kids in the Cameron crazies about 3 hours early and man did they get a show tonight Duke sails to an impressive win against the Louisville Cardinals here at Cameron Indor on a freezing cold winter night here in Durham North Carolina 28 8 seconds to go and Duke will win their 27th consecutive home game Take a look at this This is literally what happened today Duke just flat out jumped all over the Louisville Cardinals in this game as Boozer clears Woolly who loses the ball in transition And Duke less than 3 seconds away to going to 30 and one in their last 31 ACC games Obie weve always heard the old adage is tough to be the guy that replaces the guy Hasnt been that difficult for John Shire to this point Hes done a tremendous job replacing arguably the greatest coach this game has seen Now Coach K won his first of five national crowns when he was 44 years old cheering Sh is 38 now with eyes on his first AND THATLL DO IT ALL Duke tonight they run away and hide from the Louisville Cardinals
