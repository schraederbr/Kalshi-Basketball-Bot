couple of games ago Well he gets the job done Hes such a complete player He can score it obviously but his shooting percentage is 40 plus from three and almost perfect from the line Keep your eyes if youre Cal on trying to stop or slow him down Child controls the opening tip TT Carr You see him on the floor First career start for the freshman No Justin Pitman today as he has a minor injury and hes listed his dayto day but is sitting this one out into the corner for Camden AND CAMDEN CONTINUING what he did the other night against Dominican Knocks down the three Well you cant leave him But guess what TT Carr knew how to find him Great job by Carr finding his sharpshooter And by the way look for Cal to exploit Northwestern State in terms of the three because Northwestern State 356th out of 365 teams in D1 at defending the three Except they cant go 1 for 16 today which they did last game in the first half A little bit of an aberration Uh theyre a really good shooting team but they didnt get off to a great start uh from the threepoint line but youre right Uh Rick Saber talked to us about that Hes going to have to get some defense on this Cal team He thinks its the most talented offensive team hes faced And he does think that uh defense is his his team strong suit though So well see They come up with a deflection there Yeah theyll play aggressive Theyll get up high on the high side make it tough to get it inside Camden did a good job not dragging the pivot for it but couldnt knock the shot down And here come the Demons who did play here a year ago Camdens going to get a foul here to the floor for Northwestern State is Miles Well I like I like Dave that they get it out in transition Theres some contact He was aggressive Got to the basket and that was set up because they got it out and they they play at a fast pace Miles one of six transfers to Northwestern State from a season ago Came in from Tarlton State And interestingly enough coach Northwestern State they played here a year ago They have four guys that will play today that played in that game a year ago Cal only has one Yeah Well thatll show you a sign of the times That doesnt happen very often You know that you got guys returning let only you know one or two and let alone four But theyre going to need those guys to step up against this Cal team By the way Cal won that game here a year ago 8466 Day Ames was quiet in the first half the other night cheering not unable to knock down his first shot attempt here this afternoon Cal doing a good job scrambling defensively Bell came over to contest that threepoint try Carr leading Balor leaked out after the contest and gets rewarded Those are two good passes now by TT Carr That was a great pass in stride full court for the layup to Bell Bears really like what they see out of this homegrowing talent Car from not too far away over in Marin County just across the Richmond Bridge from Berkeley cheering They get it out top of the key Nice little fake to get the defender laughter to go by but unable to knock down the threepoint try And the team still looking for the first made field goal Carr gets the screen from Dort into the corner for Bell Cannot knock it down Williams loses the basketball Camden draws some contact and will go to the line for a pair Well I like what Cals doing off of a missed shots And you can see TT Carr with the left hand I mean hook pass down the floor to Bell Theyre so good in transition Thats been a real improvement on this years team TT Carr coming in local product Marin County player of the year and theyve got a couple other guys on that team too that that are playing locally But you know Cal if you look at their team Dave one thing theyve done is theyve really decided to play with uptempo but theyre doing it now off of their defense which is a great sign Camden knocks down both free throws Had a very good year at the line as the Bears push the lead to six Northwestern State still looking for their first bucket Theyve only taken two shots Just credit to Cals defense Theyve been really putting some defensive pressure cheering on the defense Williams into the corner Miles with the attack and the finish Thats a tough finish You know thats again shows you how tough its been to score on on Cal But Cals put a put their defense a notch above what it was Theyve really concentrated on it and theyve done a nice job Keep an eye on Miles Hes kind of picked up his offense 27 points the last two games for him coming in Gorch bounce pass is taken away Northwestern State has already played a number of tough teams on the road this season They opened up at Texas AM and were going to get a turnover in the back court by Ames Now you mentioned Miles Dave Watch you know how tough he is He gets a ball gets to the rim I Hes going over the top of Lee Dor Not easy but hes explosive He He can do that Miles gets it inside for Williams Williams playing in just his fourth game of the season And going to be a call here going against the Bears Theyre going to get the foul on pushing Williams out of bounds Well thats a good aggressive play but I thought a good call I thought that that it was a good job by Dor forcing him to the baseline screaming side but just using a little bit too much body Fish was right on Willie Williams He had a Jones fracture that he he endured early in the practice season for North Western State So hes only playing in his fourth game but theyre happy to have him back Hes a a guy theyre kind of big things from in that paint cheering Camden able to bring the rebound up court And a silly foul there as Bill Bell is hit by Mubaroo And thats going to take us to the under 16 music timeout The Bears a fourpoint lead and a lowcoring one so far Back to last year they won their final home game Tens alongside Ben Bronn and you know Mark Madson hes got this team on a roll right now looking for seven straight win Coach the last time the Bears won seven in a row is the last time they went to an NCAA tournament And thats good news if youre a Bears fan and if youre Mark Madson but 8 and0 at home you want to dominate on your home floor and hes done that And hes done that playing basketball the right way They play great defense and they played well at home Uh no place like home You win your home games you do 500 or slightly better on the road youre going to have a good season especially the way the ACC is shaping up this season Out of the timeout aims an attack No And the rebound is pulled down by the Demons Frederick Turner into the game came up with that four Nice job by Lee Dorton transition He guarded about two or three different guys And I mean that was a good job the big fella down the paint Stopped the basketball big time That ball last touched by Camden 17 to shoot for the Demons Cals done a good job Dave You know the Demons havent had very many good looks so far this half Thats been a credit to Cal defense Demons are coming in here off of a win in their last game They work it inside and Turner able to get a bucket and its back to a one possession game That doesnt normally happen They put two on the ball and they just allowed the basket to be open Usually thats the one area that cows cover down Usually you let the wings open Dor guys are poked away able to GET BACK and then throws it away Second turnover of the game for the Bears Northwestern State looking for the lead That wont fall applause and cheering Mark Madsons going to bring in a couple of subs on the next DEAD BALL OH DOR FOLLOWS FOR THE JAM Thats the problem you encounter when you drive the basket and your bigs help out against Days and you must help Dors there to clean it up Hes been doing it all year cheering Dor size going to present a lot of problems today for the Demons Three for Miles is no good Camden able to pull it down TT the drive and the finish Hows that for reading the the floor Nice job by TT Carr just driving the lane No help He takes it all the way to the rim Yeah And you you feel like Justin Pitman being out today Thats a little deflating if youre Cal but TT Carr is like Yeah Ill take the minutes Players never worry about it today Yeah I I can promise you that Uh they dont worry about injuries when they get an opportunity Contested three Able to somehow rattle in Thought he might have shuffled his feet before he put it on the deck to take that shot Camden back to Carr and TT Carr FEELING IT RIGHT NOW But you talk about a guy being ready for that moment TT Carr getting the shot to start in place of Justin Pippen and hes doing a whale of a job First career start Hes already halfway to his careerhigh for scoring And well get a foul here Lets go back to Car I saw Lens This is actually Dort coming up with the rebound Well thats Day Ames going there And you know theres three guys around him Youve got to put guys around Day A And theres Takar all the way to the rim splitting defenders going through three guys for the score Hes been playing really really well I I mean he deserves to start the way hes been playing Hes been rewarded by the coaching staff for good reason Williams puts it on the deck cheering trying to feed it and instead its taken away Great anticipation to come up with the basketball by Dorsy Carr for Elich cant get it to go from inside Another nice dish by TT Carr Elich just couldnt finish cheering and Bola will give it up from the free throw line The rainbow jumper for Micah Thomas finds nothing but net Thats a tough shot I mean Cals been in there real and thats just a tough shot Thats the kind of shots the Demons are going to have to hit against this stingy Cal defense NORTHWESTERN STATE HANGING in right now with the Bears Campbell fading away Cant get it to go And here come the Demons A oneon four break And it doesnt matter The finish is good for Adbola Well Coach Matson not happy that one guy beat four down the floor in transition cheering Theyve been playing pretty good defense but they gave up transition basket Carr surveying back for Ames Day Jump ball is going to be called as that is a pretty good job of verticality there by Loom The basketball going to the Demons on the other side of music this timeout A really nice job by Rick Sabr He plays a lot of guys Dave He plays 12 guys or has played 12 music guys double figure minutes Not many coaches and teams in the country do that So theyve got fresh legs Well we asked him about that before the game today We said you know youve played so many guys Is that kind of your MO or are you trying to figure it out still And he said honestly Ive been trying to figure it out Yeah when that happens I mean so you want to get in your rhythm You have time before your conference season but by then you want to be locked in and with a regular rotation As I mentioned they did win their last game just their second one of the season as they get a bucket here to not this thing up Yeah Mike F want a little help side there Oneonone spin move in the paint with no help Hardest thing in basketball Dave guarding the ball oneonone So the Demons have made four straight Well I was going to say coach they made their last seven shots the other night against Southeastern Louisiana to seal that win So theyre capable of stringing things together Ames finally puts Cal back in front Yeah One you know its its tough Uh Cal started out so tough defensively now that Demon Demon have gotten their their role going again Its so funny that you know coach Im with you You want to see Demon Thats the way thats thats later The ACC is coming up Not yet Lets not get ahead of ourselves Well get a whistle here underneath I believe theyre going to get Elich with the foul Thats tough Smith move right there Thats what theyve been missing out of Williams And then the answer Great great back there Cut by Ames and delivery Bish Nice passing post player Both Illich and Dor double figures on assists this year Their bigs can really pass Cal mixes it up Shows you a little zone Now back to man Out of bounds under Williams able to get free and cant connect for well get a foul Yeah a little surprising that the Demons were that open out of bounds under General you want to play inside out Make him go to the top but that was a direct pass for a shot cheering Williams who was awarded the teams summer toughness Tims They they give away Timberwolf boots every so often to players that earn the the toughness Tims coach I love it I mean you got to create hedges cheering for your players We used to have those kinds of awards Funny what players will do for little trinkets or whatever it is but they want to win awards uh you know many awards as the year and the summer goes on going to whistle here as Carr was trying to dribble to the top of the key Theyre going to get that foul on Loom to stop Aloom Now the Demons are very aggressive defensively but theyre going to have their work cut out for them to try to contain TT Carr whos really done a nice job for the Bears this season Dortel Bell contested jumper wont go Dort able to get a hand on it The Demons fighting for it and they do come up with it into the corner for three And the Demons go in front Well they gave up the chance to attack the basket for two and opted for the three Nice decision and nice finish in transition Just the sixth three of the season for Omar at a level and cheering the Bears turn it over Well the defense has stepped up Theres no question that the Demons are really turning it up But watch the transition defense Youre on the floor for a loose ball You kick it ahead and now youve got a drive to the basket Three Bears four Bears converge and what do you do You spot up in the corner You get the wide open three But how about the play of Justin Redmond there cuz he dove into this into the first draw to save the ball and then he goes down Hes the guy that gets the assist on the other end Usually works that way You basketball guys reward you Hardman into the corner Williams trying to work his way in Addict Bola has that shot blocked by Bell Nice defense by cheering Chris Bell going straight up Dor running the floor was looking for the highlight reel but instead hes going to have to go to the free throw line That would have brought the house down I Ill tell you TT Carr has really done a nice job of feeding his teammates He is finding everybody Watch this Look TT Carr head up hits his teammate Lee Dord in stride which would have been a nice two hand or one hand slam jam Great job by Carr finding his teammate Its the second assist thats been taken away from Carr because of a foul But I Ill give you this now and I agree One Roxy Bernstein used to say this our friend Why is not an assist if you make the free throws right here Im not going to argue against that I I like it And I think I think Roxy and you and and and people whove been around the game as long as you guys have and covered the games youve covered thats a legitimate question And as a coach I agree that should be an assist because it led to two points But officially as of now it does not But yeah TT should have four instead of two I agree You know I also think they should count not block shots but effective shots THREE OH THE BANK IS WIDE OPEN FOR THOMAS I thought it was after hours Maybe not on a Saturday but banks open Yeah you might actually be able to find one open still except if youre watching this on the East Coast Bell out of the corner No And the rebound pulled down by the Demons Better job that time transition from the elbow and cheering Carr able to pull down the rebound Car little hesitation moving Let it go Had it poked away from behind Got it back And now a reach in foul as Carr goes up And we will have a timeout A tough one right now here in Berkeley Just a fourpoint And how about Micah Thomas My goodness How many players music could say they have done that I mean two separate school I mean separate sets of schools um and and putting some points on the board Micah Thomas one year at Northwestern Florida State University one year at Indianapolis State two years at Nickel State and now Yeah make it three Yeah its uh hes hes hes bounced around a little bit A heck of a high school player I was reading something about him uh when I was doing my game prep about his between his junior and senior year he more than doubled his scoring average his his senior year Going into that year his coach told him Youre going to average 30 a game for us this year And he was like What I havent I barely aaged 15 And he he finished the year with exactly 30 a game Ball deflected Last touch by the Its amazing how much confidence you can give your players when you make those types of statements and and every player wants that coach or that father that figure in his life to give him that confidence but you know its nice to get it because you you need it and it goes a long way Yeah great defense by the mayors forcing the Demons way out on the floor Miles gets cut off on the baseline so hell just fade away and knock down a jumper Yeah tough shot I mean Izzy Miles with the step back you got to respect his threepoint shot shooting a little under 50 for the year So you you got to respect him Hes able to get the medium range as well An eight times the Bears have gone three minutes without a bucket Theyve missed eight in a row Chris Bell unable to end that drought Williams Bola finally getting into the corner MILES Still plenty of time on the clock Now it is getting low Miles recognizes attacks and finishes Thats twice that Izzy Miles has finished to the basket against setup because of his ability to knock down the three You respect him so much from the threepoint line You crowd him and now he turns into a driver cheering Were going to get an offensive foul here going against Chris Bell and the Cal Bears Back to the drive by Miles Yeah Well Miles is really effective to going to the basket Dave because hes such a good shooter that you have to crowd him But now as soon as he puts it down Cals been doing a pretty good job of closing out closing down on the drivers But thats why theyre effective Chris Bell got called for the foul there hell take a seat So the Bears now playing with a deficit are going to have to come back out and play the defense that they play They came out in the second half against Dominican with really outstanding defense Theyre going to have to step up now because you got the Demons getting a little bit of confidence on the offensive end Although Mark M would like for that to start now not necessarily after the intermission Demons have hit eight of their last 10 shots to build this lead Great defense Elich comes over and takes the basketball away Camden got a whistle here away from the basketball Thomas is going to get called He was holding Camden You talked about defense on the back end the other end Dave Cal did a good job defensively Elid showed his ability to help out on a ball screen and then roll back in and poke it away defensively Thats really doing the job defensively when youre a post guy Help out on ball screens get back in and help on post entries Great job HS will take a contested three Mark would love that shot with the hand in his face like that Here comes the Demons the other way Miles has it deflected away Last touch by the Bears Got a little fortunate there Thought it might have been a little contact but Muel did a good job Dave of just getting in and crowding you know really crowding there Uh thats on the ball and hand hand part of the ball Now Mark Madson wants them to take a look at it He thinks it should be Cal basketball Well he might be right about the whose ball it is and they usually dont go back and call the foul So I think its a safe challenge So Madson calling the timeout asking for the the review out of bounds play is under review Were getting Well the call on the floor Dave is Northwestern ball but heres the play Theres the It doesnt change And it doesnt change direction Does it hit right here Maybe Yeah the ball the rotation of the ball doesnt change Uh lets see That does look like Oh yeah Boom So thats a good call a good challenge Mark Madsons eyes better than me Will not need to go to Meredith Morgan Eye Center Coach Madson music hes still got 2020 or somebody on the staff does But you know those are good those are really I think good times to challenge when youre pretty sure your video guys on the bench Uh you know they they they can give you an indication which way its going And then the other thing I like about the challenge Dave you get timeouts Youre Mark Mansons talking to his team now about continuing to play this type of defense And and then what do they what do they want to do offensively But lets assume that this is going to go back to Cal Its got to be overturnable Its got to be definitive evidence It cant be uh you think its got to be we know Were just waiting for the official word Mark Fulton Matt Rafferty and Randall Wells the officiating crew here this afternoon And if they got the two angles we got I think theyll overturn it And they did Looks like theyre pointing the other direction So yeah good call by the officials Good piece of uh officiating and and give credit to Mark Manson and his staff They gained another possession there Thats an important possession Well especially when all the momentum is going against you right now Just needs something to try and turn things around Camden deep three wont go He had a wideopen look at it Carr out of the corner and he does drill the triple Uh usually Day Ames is taking over at this point but its TT Carr thats giving an opportunity alongside his running mate Day AS and hes just keeping the Bears in good position right here Cars matched his single game career high of his young Cal career with two threes in a game cheering Ames trying to stay in front does Miles cuts unable to get the finish And now the Bears can get it back to one or tie it on a three Carr going for the tie Elich gets a second chance try and hell have a chance for the tie on the old school threepoint shot Theres the advantage and Elich is making a lot of use of his playing time Hes really tough on the glass as he goes up puts it right back on the rim Chance now and this is his only area that hes going to have to really shore up is his free throw shooting Hes struggled for the line but hes had a hell of a game Uh Dave hes really been aggressive passed the ball well Hes been tough defensively and hes really been aggressive on the offensive glass Hes been a real I think great addition in this game for the Bears Great things have happened when theyve gotten the offensive rebounds Theyve theyve got three offensive boards so far in this game Theyve got seven points off those three offensive board but now that makes Elich three for 11 on the year from the line So again hes got to work on that aspect of his game But hes an aggressive player and you know hes got time to improve Williams fumbles the ball Demons able to hold on to it though Jumawan takes the three Hes going to have a chance to go to the line for a trifecta But not before we take a quick time out Tight one here in Berkeley You making the coaches look good When I always felt when you gave a guy an opportunity to start they played well I always I always thought that was a great sign because you want to reward guys that have earned that and he has earned that Hes been playing really good basketball Meanwhile Landon Ju uh Jam uh Jumawan excuse me is at the free throw line with three free throw attempts and Mark Matson was trying to say Hey he kicked his legs out to get that foul The officials werent buying Yeah And thats a point of emphasis too Theyre trying to take away the offensive players ability to draw cheering a foul with the kick out And generally uh cheering officials can go and theyll look but uh that was the point of contention there But as it stands count the count the three free throws And now Cals got to dig dig deep here and try to get back in this one The cut by Camden Nice deflection by the Demons to break it up Landon Jumawan coach basketballs kind of a hobby for him Hes a professional boogie boarder Havent grown up in Hawaii Go figure Hes he boogied cheering three points in the last possession Thats what I know Uh you know nice job again by Helix Shes cleaning up the glass for Campbell The drive and again the Demons come up with a stop Rick Cabera telling his team I know were a good team in spite of a record We can win games And the way theyre playing defense here today cheering you you see why hes selling that to his guys Well this is a good game for Raber cheering And hes now played Cal two years in a row but he likes coming out to the West Coast playing really good competition He knows the South Conference uh for them to get back in there and be competitive Hes got to have a good nonconference schedule So this is a really good game but I like the way his teams playing Theyre playing aggressively He knows that Cals a good offensive team so hes challenging his team to play the best defense they can And theyre playing good defense right now Except for there where they you get the foul from behind by Turner and it allows Ames to get the threepoint opportunity and back to a onepoint game I like the fact that Cals now going to extend their defense Theyre going to have to turn the tide themselves defensively You want to dominate games on the defensive end Cal has the ability to do that when theyre playing it on all cheering Northwestern State taking a lot of time here The drive the dish and stripped away by Campbell underneath The Bears come out of there with the basketball Theyre going to blow it dead with the shot clock violation Yeah what a great way to make your mark defensively You exhaust the shot clock You dont give any opportunities Good challenge inside Good help down by DJ Campbell I mean Dort does a good job of leaving his man to help And how about Campbell doing whats called cracking down the defensive end to help the helper Nice picture book defense by Campbell One of those coachs though where the the whistle might have actually hurt Cal because Carr might have been off to the races had they not blown it Thats true But theyll take the stop Cal trying to go back in front Ames misfires Thomas from Miles straight away for three and he connects Well theres a transition defense Cal did a good job getting down the floor in getting the ball stop and then was a little bit slow on the rotation And you got to do it all I mean transition defensive transitions always a challenge Izzy Miles came to play today 10 points on four seven shooting James into the corner Dorsy drills it Yeah another good sign by Nolan Dorsy Maybe Cals best allaround defensive player but he has only been two of 15 from three Make that three And what a what a hustle by cheering Dorsy He wants to review it Mark Madson is saying Hey do we review it Hes checking now The video guys on top of it And if they say Lets review it I mean look at Dorsy Look at Dorsy Hes on the floor Oo hes got a Hes got a Hes got a right decision Theyre looking at it And now Mark M I love it You know you you got to trust your players and Dorsy was closer than anybody but we just talked about Dorsy Dave and how tough he is defensively You know he hits the threepoint shot but his team is under review out of bounds Yeah theyre going to have to review this one Theres the dive Theres the contact Dorsy never touches it Oh but but he doesnt have to touch it because his diving on the floor caused helped cause that turnover and and I think thatll be Cals ball again Thatll be two for two with Madson again uh and his staff Really good job Theyre decisive You cant guess when youre on the sideline because you dont want to lose a timeout for pretty sure And guess what leaders the first half against Dominican a little bit better today than they were against a lot better but the problem has been offensively its been defensively that the the Demons have done a really good job if you look at the stats theyve done a really good job now uh of scoring and so Cals got to go out and find a way to stop the Demons Demons shot shooting 55 from the floor and Cals been holding their opponents on the year to 40 In fact were in the 30s until just recently So thats going to be the challenge for Mark Madson Uh and the Cal Bears has come back defensively but I I expect to see this overturned and it has to challenge a successful cow ball So Mark Matson two for two today on going to the monitor and I love the the real time the assistants were watching it because the second the replay came up and give Nolan Dorsy credit You got to give him credit cuz hes the one that came up and said challenge this You got to trust your players Nolan Dorsy wouldnt have yelled out if he if he knew it the results were otherwise Campbell gets it into Camden Camden gets free AND DRILLS THE THREE You know Dave I was just going to say John Camden has been relatively quiet this half And as soon as I thought it he steps back up hits a huge three And Cal continuing to keep the pressure defense on Last touched by Ames They could actually call a foul on Ames Yeah I dont mind that You know I know you say Well dont commit a foul right before the half But you you know what I you got to like Mark Madson saying Look thats an aggressive play But theres Camden coming up behind the screen He does such a good job of waiting Hes a really smart basketball player a veteran guy Talked about John Camden He thinks he might be their most valuable player The way he plays a veteran player from Delaware who does everything right on the floor And its only a one and one So you know I mean if he misses here its as good as a stop cheering Hell get one more And theres a one thing now that Calwell to decide Hes got 51 seconds Do you go down and get a quick one and get a two for one Most teams now cheering especially Mark Matson with his pro background probably will take advantage of that Lets see if they push cheering and probably want to shoot it around the 40 mark you would think Yeah hes trying to get him to come cheering up now You see a zone defense Theyre looking at the zone defense The Demons are just to change things up a little bit Camden for Ames Now youre the Demons Now you can play for one and leave about two seconds left And they might even use a timeout because Rick Cabrera has a timeout Use it or you or lose offensive rebounds and you dont want to foul Northwestern State does not have an offensive rebound in this game but coach theyve done a great job of getting the glass on the defensive end limiting Cal to three We got a technical fouls just been called applause I believe theyre going to call it on Rick Cabrera Not sure what exactly he did to get a T Yeah thats a thats thats a a questionable Yeah I dont know what that was either I I dont Unless hes a good lip reader I I dont know Mark Fton calling that all the way from the far side of the court So Camden goes to the free throw line here to try and add two to the Cell Point total Well back in the day officials you know used to call them if you question their ancestry or something Those are reasons you got a technical But no I I dont understand it I I you know Im sure there was a reason Were not going to know it because its all the way on the other side of the floor Now if youre the Demons youve got to try to get a shot and not allow Cal to come back with any time maybe two seconds differential You want to take the last shot Absolutely Exhaust the full shot clock and maybe get one fragment offensive rebound Dorsy stay right up on Thomas The three nothing but twine for Justin Redmond Mark Madson wants a timeout Well I like the cut timeout by Mark Madson Youve got 56 and youve got plenty of time to get a shot or draw a foul but theres the threepoint shot you know with about 5 seconds to go on the shot clock Uh you know really good basket if youre the Demons but youre not out of the woods if youre the Demons yet too Youve got to defend And Mark Mansons got some guys that can get it up the court So you want to race it up there get a shot to the basket If youre the Demons you do not want to foul Do not go for a steal And I wouldnt be surprised Dave if they go back into that zone They played a zone in the very last possession And looks like they might extend and go back to the zone Lets take a look They dont want them to roll it up So theres going to be one defender back Uh looks like they might match up here and go man but wouldnt shock me to see him go back in that zone Cal this is obviously something theyve worked on Late clock situation at the end of the half Yeah I like I like DJ Campbell back in the game Lining up in the eye formation Lets see something to the basket You dont want to go east west You got to go north south They get it right back to Ames Pday OH WHAT A DRIVE AND A FINISH DANA HAMS AMONGST THREE DEFENDERS GETS IT TO GO HOW about presence of mind Like Jared Jackson said the the coach that has a scout weve got to respect the game respect the way we play respect our opponents play the right way How about Car right on coming out of the line and talk about paying the playing the right way That came right out of a timeout meaning the locker room timeout And TT Carr just does what hes done all game long Its a new careerhigh for him with a dozen points Well now theyve got to couple the score with some stops And thats been the order of business respecting the game respecting your opponents getting some hands up and cheering getting rebounds like they just did They force a tough contested three that pass offline and the Bears will give it right back Well well how important is what we just discussed when you respect the game you respect your opponents the score is insignificant its tied youre up one or two irrelevant How are you playing Dave How is your defense reacting How are you playing with one another Are you getting assists Are you making hustle plays Those things are what dictate the outcome of a cheering game And this was the part of the game where they came out of the locker room Tuesday night against Dominican and just dominated to build a lead Last touch by the Bears Yeah and they did I I think thats what Jared Jackson was saying and the Cal basketball staff You respect the game Thats how we should play all the time It shouldnt vary half to half shouldnt vary coming out of a timeout or a locker room uh uh discussion So thats how you want to play Kell in his zone right now Theyve been very successful playing against zones Little loft under that shot He gets it back and drills the three as Mubaroo finds it Well the zones effective stopping the team from scoring on the out of bounds play but now you got to scramble back out and match up Its the first three today for Thomas Camden gets three right back for the Bears Yeah hes able to do that And John Camden has probably hit more significant baskets for this Cal team than any other Bear I mean all season long hes hit some huge baskets this season Miles Thomas draws a couple of defenders Then Dor drops back down low Thomas picks up the dribble Shot clock down to three Jumawan out of the corner drills the triple We got a shootout I mean both teams are just putting some some some barrage of shots on each other Uh whos going to flinch first Landon Chumuan in this building a year ago put up 15 including four made threes Dor Williams does a great job defending without fouling to come up with the stop Three for Thomas Well thats what Cal can do They can defend and rebound with Jordan underneath the rim They got a mismatch Yeah they do They can find it Juman comes over to try to help out Hes going to get called for the foul Nice job You talk about threepoint garage There is a good ball movement and John Camden again just spots up knows how to stretch the defense has his feet set and he just you know and then its its the Demons answering the call Theyre not going away Dave I mean if Cal thought they were going to go away theyre not And but thats again what Coach Jackson was saying about just respecting your opponents because everybody you play is here to win Theyre here to take something from you and theyre playing at a high level and and thats And thats the level you got to play at But if thats how you play you dont worry about your focus You play to your level Northwestern State this is their second trip to the Bay Area in just a couple of weeks They played San Francisco uh back November Yeah its a thats a very competitive game Theres Cal extending the defense trying to really push the Demons as far back away from the basket as they can But I like the attitude of playing aggressive defense goes a long way Miles takes the three and hes going to have a chance for a fourpoint play as Carr ran into him I dont know what Izzy Miles had for breakfast or pregame but Id like to know because hes hes been on fire Dave from the moment he stepped on this floor Hes playing with aggression Hes playing with focus and hes been a thorn in Calside this afternoon 16 is his season high cheering for scoring and hell have to wait to try to get that bodys fallen to the floor and no whistle Thats his only kryptonite is at the free throw line Hes only a 66 free throw shooter Camd and contested three John Camden knows no limits in terms of his range Hell step out on the floor and hell shoot it with confidence and hell nail it cheering Wow Camden was one of five double figure scorers for the Bears there on Tuesday The Bears get a hand on the basketball Off and running AMES FINISHES AND turning points off of turnovers into the scoreboard Well Ames will get credit for the basket but give me TT Carr on the assist My goodness But how about Cal You know they just do a good job of finding John Camden and hes nothing but net And now you got Ames on the break Find him score it off the music great great uh cause Jimmy V one of the alltime greats Was fortunate to know him Dave And uh boy the motivation he gave his players maybe well get into that later but hes something Heres another turnover it looks like Or was it tipped No it was tipped out of bounds by Northwestern State Thats a good Cal defense Well thats a good sign You come out of a timeout and you right away you force a turnover Thats Thats good basketball Cal needs more of that Their last bucket was off of a turnover See if they can do that again Instead they give the basketball back Thomas drives into the paint and the demons able to hold on to the basketball Second chance try is good for Miles Yeah you dont want to give Izzy Miles too many open looks We just talked about what hes done this game He has been and Fuego absolutely stunning this game The lead changes hands again as does the basketball Second consecutive turnover Jumawad for three Back tap into the hands of Ames Dorsy for Bell And Bell cant connect Chris Bell still looking for his first three He has gone cold the last couple of games cheering Miles able to rattle it in Where hasnt he scored from Dave He has scored from the the corners the top of the key in the paint off the glass Yeah Id love to see a whole chart for him Hes been all over the place Hes dotted the court tonight today Seven of 11 shooting Ames and Northwestern State careless with the basketball That was a little bit of a settled jumper jumper there by but hes had a heck of an afternoon for the the Demons Seven of 11 shooting as the Demons continue to have the lead here Dorsy into the corner Carr wide open but wasnt open for long Now Carl takes the three on the wing Leaves it a little bit short The rebound is controlled by the Demon A little bit of zone defense It looked on that last look by the Demons Changing it up a little bit Fredmond Redmond drives to the paint Pulls up just in front of it Cant get it to go Well that was good defense by Nolan Dorsy I mean Redmond a really good threepoint shooter Dorsy all over him That foul on Redmond his first second team foul on the Demons here in this second half Cals only been whistled for once since the intermission And the corner Ames and thats a find by Carr Well you got that Dave I Ive been saying it all afternoon TT Carr finding his teammates in rhythm I dont care if its Camden Day Ames I mean hes getting the ball and distributing it to his teammates And a new careerh high for Carr with six dimes in this game Yeah thats and again we should mention again that Justin Pippen is out and he leads the team in assist Thats usually something that Justin Pippen does but TT Carr in his absence really stepping up getting a starting role in delivering for the Bears Yeah if youre just joining us Justin a minor injury that they dont expect to be anything too long term but daytoday but theyre sitting him out today You can see Dorsy just not letting Redmond breathe at all Breman falls to the floor and were going to get a jump ball The possession arrow does favor Northwestern State Well how about the defense that Nolan Dorsey you know the Kell coaching staff will tell you that he they think hes their best defensive player and the way hes defending hes going to come in this is going to come in handy for the Bears They need to find some guys that can get some stops Northwestern State Wow High off the glass for Mubaroo Yeah that was a great out ofbounds under play We should mention too Dave that Rita Petritus is out again for his fourth consecutive cheering game and he also is one of Cals best defensive players Carr Camden Oh YOU THE WAY HES BEEN SHOOTING you just expected that to go down and it did everything but Yeah I I really thought that was down and under Wow I mean this thing look at this This thing I thought that was I think it tickled the twine under there Rims not kind to Cal on their home court I dont understand that Now Camden puts it on the deck Hangs in the air and hes able to draw a foul Yeah did a nice job Really nice job keeping the ball tight to his body and drawing the foul Really a smart move Not only do you get the two shots but you put yourself to the line Dave and youre shooting on the year Just a cool 91 Foul on Addict is going to be his third health to check out Yeah 91 You think that wouldnt you coach Uh any day Even I couldnt jinx it I mean theres nothing superstitious about good free throw shooters They might make miss one but theyll make the next 10 Uh you you just what a luxury it is to have Cal Not only do you have Camden that can shoot free throws youve got games at about 80 youve got some guys in the team Chris Bell at about 90 and Justin Pippen well over 80 So theyve got guys that can knock down free throws cheering Thomas controls for Northwestern State Now he gets it back Cal doing a nice job switching out Theyre really aggressive defensively Mubaroo trying to get it on the baseline Knocked out of bounds Last touch by Cal Northwestern State will have just 5 seconds on the clock Thats a short clock Now Cals got to go back They gave up the quick score on the last possession Theyve got to play inside out Force the Demons away from the basket Anything away not two Thomas able to get it in and theyre GOING TO CALL FOUL HERE ON DORSY WELL thats a tough call going against Dorsy I wouldnt mind seeing that one again That was tough Heres Dorsy trying to get through the screen and he gets hipped out I I dont know about that one Im usually going to tell you the officials get it right I think that was a tough call going against Dorsy He got hipped on that play First on Dorsy third on Cal here in the half Well now doing a good job aggressively on ball screens Really jumping the ball screens Short clock again Takes the hand off AND THEN ATTACKS AND FINISHES Does Loom Yeah I think Kell and and and Elish might have lost track a little bit Dave about the shot clock Not a lot of time You got to just play solid and and of course a post player thats not used to shooting it They can make a shot but he screaming just got beat on the dribble Mustafa Aloom sophomore out of Sagal cheering gets it back to a twopossession game Well thats a big free throw He was one on 11 on the year Excuse me Gets him back to a threepoint lead Still just one possession Its only his second made free throw out of 12 So thats a threepoint play for the Demons High screen from Elich And then the balls taken away cheering Demons have numbers Thomas puts it up and Mubaroo puts it down cheering Yeah good timeout by Mark Madson He wants to stop this run really good timeout Well Northwestern State arrived to the arena today believing they could win They might have been the only ones that thought they could win but right now theres music a lot of believers that Hans Cal is having their hands full against this team from the Southland music Conference Really quickly Mark Madson had to call that timeout to stop the bleeding A good timeout by coach Mark Madson Yeah you know at the next level when you call the timeout it negates the media They dont do that at this level I wish that would happen Ames no look pass into the corner Camden deep three and he drills it John Camden his head again A huge huge basket for his Cal Bears team They desperately needed that basket Cal now going to his zone Changing things up a little bit Seeing if they can match up out of the zone Camden a season high from beyond the arc with the five makes Williams Dor tried to poke it away Does get a hand on it Last touched by Cal Yeah How deep is John Camden here I mean this is out there Most players should say Hey thats out of your range Thats an NBA three and he has NBA range A solid solid shooter and a confident one Coach again a short clock situation They get it into Moaroo Thomas drives inside DISHES AND THE FINISH THEY GET IT OFF NO And they are going to review They are going to take a look at the clock That is worth challenging Thats a huge basket If youre going to challenge you got to give that one a look Was the le do the LEDs go off before the ball leaves his hands previous play is under review for possible shot clock violation So as of right now theyre not counting the bucket No And Rick Rick Cabrera and he wanted the foul but Yeah So this is the foul This is the read And it doesnt matter when the buzzer went out He beat the buzzer but he didnt beat the clock The buzzer Yeah The buzzer is irrelevant in this play A lot of fans dont know that Forget the buzzer Look at the light and the light definitely was still at the zero in his hands Good call by the officials Now if youre Cal can you take advantage of that and try to get this lead back And by the way if youre scoring a home thats a thats an a review by the officials Thats one they can initiate Thats not a challenge You dont have to challenge that But Rick Go was asking for the foul call which thats a different subject And so you you dont get this call but you want the next one Dave So Cal now with the ball back Chance to tie it or go in front with a three Here the Demons car somehow left wide open and the Demons catch a break there Cal gets the offensive rebound though and Ames a second chance three and that time it does Yeah youre wondering if Cals a good shooting team The answer is yes You give them second chance opportunities they will knock it down Cal back to the zone cheering 12 second chance points in the game for Cal cheering Redmond into the corner for Thomas cheering Williams wanted a whistle Thought Thor was holding it Youre the Demons You better find John Camden There he is in the corner A little bit too strong And the Demons able to cheering come up with the basketball Oh were going to get a loose ball foul going against Dory Yeah Mark Matson doesnt like that call Said he kind of fell But Day Ames you know dont go to sleep on Dayday because hes got great range You talk about his threepoint percentage How about 48 a hair under 50 on the year leads this Cal Bear team in threepoint percentage music Thats five fouls on Cal here in this second half and its three personals on Dort Hell hell uh play through this Mark Madson electing to let the big fella stay on the floor Im Im okay with that Its a close game Um but cheering you need your big guy out there Over the token pressure here by the Bears Cal back to the zone Theyve been in the zone the last three possessions cheering Its a two3 matchup Slowing this Demon team down just a little bit Matching up one guy on the ball cheering and applause Thomas feeds inside Williams No Williams somehow comes up with it and gets it to go Wow How about the second effort inside Willie Williams puts Northwestern State back on top This is a back and forth one here Dave This is just a good oldfashioned Bburn basketball game CAMDEN STOPS ANOTHER STOP IT Stop it big fella Six Can you say threepoint barrage John Camden 23 points in the game for Camden Thats a new season high for him as well cheering cheering Thomas for Williams Puts it on the deck Dork inside on Dort And Dor good job defending without foul Yeah nice job by Lee Dor Verticality Oh man Campbell has the ball knocked away and the Demons come up with it cheering Ames had a hand on it And wow that is a that is a whole bunch of bodies going to the floor Thats a scrum I mean aggressive play by both teams And its Izzy Miles Izzy Miles took a hit I mean good job Cam keeping the ball alive The ball was butter fingers all the way around and then the whistle and the foul Cook gets called from behind as Campbell came over and committed the personal So not the fourth on Dor Im Im here to tell you Izzy Miles is a tough customer Huntville Alabama I mean the junior has taken some hits Hes taken Cals defensive shots and hes still ticking cheering and hes been good from the line What do you expect Tie game No surprise These guys are going at each other Dave this has been a fun one Absolutely Ames for three and the rebound pulled down by Williams cheering Good job in transition by Cal Nice job stopping the basketball Zone defense still employed by Cal Its a two three Theyll match up Play guy in the area A lot of talking a lot of bumping cheering Miles pulls up Cant get it to go A lot of contact and it will be a foul call here against Williams Well take a timeout Dont go anywhere Tied in Berkeley folks You know that youre having a good day John Camden has six made threes already Well David if you have Lee are you surprised The answer is no And I can tell you who else is not surprised Nick caber He told us beware He This was the one player he really worried about Not that the other players arent worth worrying about but he said John Camden worries him because hes an intelligent player that really stretches the floor and if you leave him open hell destroy you And by the way hes had career games He had nine threes in his senior junior year Delaware And he went for 36 against William Mary This is not a fluke Well Bears fans are needing all of it And he was the guy that kept things somewhat even keeled against Dominican in the first half here on Tuesday Well I been around some pretty good shooters I had one myself named Amit Tamir that could really shoot Joe Ship uh another great threepoint shooter that hit eight or nine in a game Uh these guys I mean I mean John Camden showing you just his ability to stretch the floor and shoot it when it matters Ames spins throws it off the underside of the rim And it will stay with Cal Think thats a good call I dont know And officials Think theyre not going to challenge this I I think they want to save that time out They may need it Brook is wondering whether or not to challenge And now now hes hes making a halfhearted signal And now he is going to challenge it Well hes got to listen to his players Im not sure that went off Cal but but its an important call These are all important Lets see it again That looked like it did go off door Maybe they know something that we dont Yeah the ruling on the court is cow ball but that that to me looks like it does go off for bounce call And Dors you know hes 610 Hes got bigger hands and longer fingers I think hes guilty as charged on that play I dont know but but I think theyre going to end up winning this I you know and the officials are okay I I I like this about college basketball You want to get these music rules and you want to get the interpretations and you want to get the calls right Its too important for these players who are competing on the floor And so I like the ability to go to the monitor but youre only going to get an opportunity if youre right If not you lose the timeout and lose the challenge This is our third coachs challenge of the game and so far the coaches have been right Two for two Mark Matching onetwo in the first half Their eyesights a lot better than mine I I thought every call was go we we were going to get I would have challenged every call Yeah I would have at home I just figured those were our calls But um now you have the video guy on the bench Dave His job is to have is to immediately go to the assistant coaches to get to the head coach to say Look I just had this game on on tape Were looking at the review right now challenge but here it is Theres our producer Look at Tim Sullivan on the call Look Well yeah It doesnt even look like uh no Northwestern State got a hand on it But the these are the these are really good plays And Sully could be a criminal defense lawyer Come on I mean we got the master whos done so many pro and college games just as you have my friend Youve been in the NBA games and so has Tim Sullivan You guys do such a good job Im Im learning from you guys Yeah but nei neither of us have ever been on the bench coach So thats true Thats a whole different sort of pressure Thats right All right You still need me I love it Good to be needed So Northwestern State looking to retake the lead AND JUVAN DOES JUST THAT AND hes happy And hes telling the students in the underneath hey dont go anywhere I got something to say about this What a game weve got Well theyre loving that what theyre seeing right now back in Nacades Louisiana Dort underneath with the dunk He didnt get the alleyoop He was smart He waited for it to come down and went right back up Great play by Lee Dor And you can see now why Mark Matson has him in the game Cal going back to the zone The two3 Better find Miles Miles feeds Williams and its going to be Cal basketball Camnick got pushed out of bounds Theyre going to call the foul Heres a look at Dort He stayed with it I love that Lee Dort you know didnt get flustered Alioop goes up and he keeps the ball up Does not bring it down Dave thats textbook post play by Lee Dort really having a year That foul on Northwestern State their sixth of the half Cal also has six So well be going into the bonus the rest of the way here on fouls Thats significant Ames couldnt get it TO GO FOLLOWS HIS OWN MISS THOUGH Hes just stays right with it I love the pursuit by Day Ames He gets denied at the rim Does not hang his head and just gets his own rebound and puts it right back up Cal again back in the zone Miles Loom loses the basketball and theyll stay with saying shoot it big fell at the top passing it Youre at the rim and Dorts got four or three fouls Go at him Look at Ames I mean hes just so strong with the ball Really pursues I mean hes one of the toughest music covers to the rim Saloon checks out and they get Muru back in Kell back to manto mandate Miles Dort comes up with a block NORTHWESTERN STATE wanted a goal I thought that was a good call And Rubber gets a hand on it to knock it out of bounds Yeah I thought that was a good call by the officials I mean I I mean Thor just waits You think thats a layup and he just got it at the apex I I mean what a huge play Again Mark Manson showing some signs here about intuition leaving your big in and hes been huge That was the third block of the game for Dort A new career high James picks up the dribble Gets it right back cheering Shot clock down to five Ames over Thomas and the Demons come up with a stop Cal back to the zone again and switching up that defense cheering Better know where Miles is for sure Lubberu Mubaru with the shot clock at five trying to get it inside for Williams Scrum on the floor and Cal comes up with the basketball Nice defense by Cal Bears defense coming up big when they need it most coach Yeah you cheering need it This team is scrappy in the Demons Youre going to have to defend Theyre not going to go away CAMDEN HE DOES MORE THAN HIT THREES Lead door point forward No problem Big fella with double figures assist on the year finds his teammate John Cam cheering Thomas Mur will try three That is way too strong cheering Another rebound by Dort applause Well Cals got a little breathing room Three points Thats about the biggest lead theyve seen Thats how tough this Demons team has been this afternoon They havent had a multipossession lead since early in the game Ames surveying Gets it right back Ames gets into the paint Cut off Turns around Cant get it to go Youre going to get a loose ball foul and its going to go against TT Carr You like back door basketball music watch big fella door No problem Let me give you a little dime There it is Push pass right off the dribble John Camden for the two The Gal Bears have fought back Theyre waiting You just get in a rhythm and youre excited So TT cars to free throw line So So Ben Rick Cabrera his team was trailing with 5 minutes to go One and 41 all time when hes trailing with 5 minutes to go Well that just means theyre theyre bound to win Theyre bound to get theyre doing their way theyre new I had never looked at stats like that and I would tell my team that you know and I remember going against teams that had those streaks and I said theyre bound to get it broken and we we broke a few Well that was one of those you know you write it down as a broadcaster probably not going to use that No I like that you got that though but I still think you can throw those stats out because the players dictate not stats Williams Shot clock is down to five Northwestern State forces one up and the Bears get a rebound Chance to get a little bit of cushion here Yeah Lee Dort again just monster on the glass Hes been great 13 rebounds this afternoon for Dort That is a new careerh high So hes had a career high in boards a careerhigh in blocks and a whistle underneath I believe its going to be on boo I know that if youre the Demons you got to know where John Camden is Hes been really torching you But Lee Dor has made a huge impact Hes again to go back to Mark Mansons decision to leave him in He had three fouls early in this half There was no hesitation and he left the big fella out on the floor and hes produced Foul was on Mubaru his third Throw it to one and one Knocks down the first applause today Yeah makes five to six Much better looking free throws applause Now Cals got to do what they had talked about doing staying within their game respecting their opponents but playing cheering some really good defense Theyre in the two3 matchup Chumanu corner three way too strong again Williams comes up with it Thomas open for three No And here comes Dorsy with the basketball We got two minutes to play now still You dont have to foul if youre the Demons but you got to still play play aggressive You need to stop Two possession game OH D WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT HIS PASSING GAME COACH YEAH hes really Look at that Theyre excited John Camden jumps up gives the big fell a five I mean Cals big guys really have done a good job all year long but especially in this game Lee Door dribbles out We call that a dribble at You dribble at your teammate When youre being overplayed he knows that your teammates going to go back door and its a push pass You dont put two hands on the ball Its right off the dribble The defense wasnt in a position to deflect it And Lee Door just gives his cheering team one more dime And thats a huge basket Now it is a threepossession game Yeah And how about this Cal defense sparking a 12 nothing run Theyve held Northwestern State to just one of their last eight shots And and Northwestern State has gone nearly music 5 and 12 minutes without a point Well again I go back to the scouting report and the words that were spoken and you respect the game You respect your opponents but you music respect the way you play Get back to your identity I dont care what the score is You play defense music and you get rewarded And they have gotten rewarded They played excellent defense And you know whose name we havent called much lately coach is Izzy Miles Theyve done a nice job taking him out of out of the equation Well they needed to because he was a guy that was really hurting them Muru for Miles leaves the baseline jumper short Dorsy with the rebound And now the Bears and their fans starting to sniff this one And the wind column Yeah youre going to now be able to exhaust Theyre not going to go for anything Theyre going to try to get this shot clock a little bit down if they can Use the possession cheering HS stops Dor but the shot clock running low No could call shot clock violation there which Yeah but you know what Dave they they got the shot clock violation but the time is is your enemy Youre youre you exhausted that time Theres only going to be under a minute to play when they get the ball back Cal does And uh theyll have a chance to to really uh whittle it down again Mubaroo underneath Theyre going to call a blocking foul Yeah I just I was a little surprised because I thought Dor shot caught part of the rim on the underside but I digress Anyway well yeah there is a theres some contact I think Nolan Dorsey took a pretty good hit there Um Cal in the zone This is one thing you dont want to do You dont want to let North Western State score with the clock stopped Yeah with with over a minute to play and and its turns into a threepossession game Thats only three threes and theres plenty of time to get three threes on the glass cuz you can play the foul game as well You can foul Cal Probably the only guy you really can go after is Lee Dor but hes been awfully good today I dont know if you can go after him and foul him Mates are bringing it Muru had a long time to think about that second free throw He knocks it down Well here you go If youre if youre the Demons you have try to get a steal within about 8 seconds and then you foul Carr will get it ahead to Camden Now you got to play the foul game Yeah theyre saying get up there and foul cheering North State A lot of time go off the block Thats a lot cheering James feeds the cutting car applause and cheering And Cal will have it with three seconds on the shot clock Yeah Again its a threep possession game So I dont know if you can make this up Well you dont want to foul now Thats the one thing you dont want to do No youre going to play inside out Kell likes to get Dor to the rim Theres a slip to the rim Ames takes the three MAKES THE THREE AND THATS BLC route Can you say dagger Thats Thats got to be the dagger Miles has it taken away by Camden Cal just needs to get it across midcourt Theyll get fouled applause Camdens going to get a chance to walk it up to the free throw line Well thats a big play Obviously a big shot by Day Ames But good poise veteran players Youre talking Dayday Ames Youre talking John Camden guys that have played theyve played in their college careers a a number of games They theyve loved to be in this situation The ball in their hands late clock with the lead You you you cherish these moments and you got to learn like you know how to win these games when the games on the line Well we talked about it at the top of the broadcast Coach Northwestern State one of their many issues that they need to address is their defense on the threepoint line as Thomas knocks down a three They came into this game today 356th out of 36 any chance to get back in this game Cal gets Dort off the floor here Ames and now its over gets it across midcourt Yeah thats over now They will foul with 105 remaining Well I think they just wanted to see if they get the steal I think they fell three possessions down Thats going to be tough to make that up But again my hats off Your hats have got to be off to Northwestern State The Demons their fans have to be encouraged by what theyve seen and the way they played And Mark Mansons team has shown you lets not forget theyre about to go 10 and one The best start theyve had in years They get to win today without Justin Pippen And I was going to say without Justin Pippen without Reus Petritus uh theyve done this and going a perfect 90 at home Thats a domination at home that that you want for your team to be be a tough out when you play in your home court And House Pavilion has been down through the years a very tough place to play Thomas pulls up cant get it to go Carr pulls down the rebound and that cheering is how its going to wrap up here in Berkeley The Bears they had to earn this one today against a very scrappy Northwestern State team
