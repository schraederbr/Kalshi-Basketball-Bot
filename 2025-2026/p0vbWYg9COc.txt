and to Boston University Batis and Hastings to jump center won by Boston College And we are off here the day before Thanksgiving BC and Harvard meeting for the first time in a couple of years The Eagles got a victory on this floor two seasons ago You can see the Eagles deliberate approach Both of these teams play at the same offensive tempo Hastings no good on the turnaround and a rebound to Tay Barbour the sophomore from Manasses Virginia You know and if youre the Eagles you want to go inside on the first possession So a good look at the basket You can see the same kind of pace at this end with the Crimson have the basketball Two more deliberate tempos in division one basketball Batist getting inside and he draws the foul He got Aiden Shaw up in the air You know this is we tal we thought about this going into the game How will the front court of Boston College match up against some of these smaller yet highly versatile Harvard Crimson players Batist in his junior season now averaging 12 points a game He is still perfect at the foul line this year now 13 for 13 Felt too early for an announcer just risk there So guys nobodys getting in his head But uh Ill tell you what you look at some of these numbers here I think the most impressive thing Eric hes a 50 40 90 guy already through seven games now Well well see how it plays out but pretty hard to find in college basketball Hes been so good from three this year His twopoint field goal percentage actually brings down his field goal percentage for the year Good call Hes exactly right You see back to work Hand kicks three ball Forte is good off his best game as the Boston College Eagles scored 22 against two lane last time out Had a total of 19 points in his prior four Five for eight in that game from behind the threepoint line Something he had done at his previous stop 32 threepoint shooter this year Nice defense from Jaden Hastings who takes away the lane for Hinton in Boston College Again dont be surprised if they try to generate something in tight Heres Fred Payne from the free throw line Fred Payne has been very good recently for BC averaging 15 points a game over his last five How about thats five games in a row for him in double figures Hes never done that before He had one sequence of three games in double figures last year Hes off to a special start as well Heres Batis Step back and he hits There you go Thats what we were saying a couple possessions ago You saw that crossover dribble there The the moves to go at the defender and follow up Hes really talented Won the teams most improved player award last year Up to 11 points a game And he guards Jaden Hastings here 13 to shoot for Boston College And everybody deliberate to start Heres Payne for three Fred Payne picking up right where he left off Thats an early five Great job by the Eagles playing off the high ball screen relocating the ball to the perimeter as the defense collapses Harvard actually did a real good job on that Heres Chandler Pay one of the veterans on this Harvard team Hastings got a piece of the rebound but its an offensive board for Barbour and he has a deep three chance which goes down the sophomore Tay Bar whod be impressive from three at 45 if Batist wasnt on his team than one Talk about worrying about guys who make the jump from year one to year two Hes done a fabulous job doing so Heres Hastings Got the runner Good offensive start for these teams Jaden Hastings with his first two 107 BC and right inside just as you mentioned Barb Bour gets to the bucket He has five just to change the tempo now Crimson are going to go to some zone They are primarily a mantoman team I think Coach Ammer is saying lets just look at another give them another look Maybe get them back on their heels Floater Forte little strong rebound available and eventually finds its way down to the sophomore Robert Hinton and then ends up out of bounds Couldnt control it So BC makes each of their first two threepoint attempts Now this is just a good long corner pass catch and shoot for Forte Just an excellent job there Superior job by Harvard Crimson opening the court utilizing their back cuts cheering Six to shoot for Boston College Payne drives left Payne lost the handle on it Out of bounds It will stay here Just 18 on the timer When we come back music to Kanti Forum good offensive start These two 15 What does BC have Fred Payne got it Simple catch and shoot action by Fred to the short corner Well done coming out of the timeout Well he certainly continues to be in a zone right now Eight points early Eight of Boston Colleges 13 Two of them from behind the arc The Eagles have made their first three threepointers PJ bounces off Rebound Took a little bit of a strong bounce Both Kafky still finds it for Boston College Kafky and Taves into the game for BC out of that last timeout Arbit still with its starting group on the floor Back to mantoman now Shuffling the deck right now with the Eagles Get into the high horns Four and five Capy hands off for Luca Tay Five to shoot Kicks to Shaw Hand got to go for three He got it So valuable Luca Tays in the lane Make the pass and get that pass receiver to make an extra pass The threepoint make And Donald Han Jr makes his first You You kind of are looking at things right His twopoint percentage has kind of been pretty consistent all year His free throw shooting has been much better recently So you hope the threepoint shooting comes along with it And thats a really good look for him Thats obviously we keep mentioning it because its such a huge key for this Boston College team so talented off the extra pass You see the passing going inside out catch and shoot simple basketball good assist for Aiden Shaw Sir Grant said I mean hes here at 600 am Hes working at it He trusts its going to come Hes too good of a player for it not to So a threepointer for Hand Its 169 And on the Harvard turnover a little six nothing spurt here for Boston College Theyve made six of their last seven from the floor Luca Taves doesnt keep it going Goes short from three Yeah he had a lot more room going to his left there before that pull up A little bit more of a deliberate game as you said and its allowed Boston College to be pretty good with their shot selection so far There is Eisendra driving kicks and into the game Austin Hunt the sophomore Nastesi is blocked Aiden Shaw comes in against Luca Ace Nastesi and he blocks it out of bounds possession going to BC You know hes been such an addition as a stretch five and four man and showing great vertical on the defensive end such a rim protector actually playing in his 100th career game tonight Its worth noting you just saw us Austin Hunt on that drive playing his first game since the Nor Eastern game back on November 11th Hes been banged up So an important guy to have back for Harvard Capy right hand Got the friendly roll Again good sense by the Eagles Get it inside Play off of that inside Last time we saw a pass out of the inside feed Here we see a nice scoring move to Caps right hand PJ driving left against Shaw PJ tough effort No good And then a foul on the rebound Possession going to Boston College I think what we saw in that one Eric is Shaws got their attention now at that rim after that shot block You can see how he challenged inside defensively right there See his numbers He has at least eight rebounds in all seven games this year Twice hes gone over 10 Block numbers have been good and then had a season high eight points offensively last time out against Temple And hes never been over 10 rebounds in a game So those are special career marks for him Start of the season and it keeps you on the floor Oh it does with these things Yes Yes Here is Redonovich into the game His three ball in and out But a good rebound by Cany Shonda getting some early minutes today Kapy wide open Oden Kapky no good And a rebound down to Harvard It bounces to Xavier Nesbbit the junior from Chicago Busted Hunt as you mentioned number seven there He can play Injuries have set him back but hes a big part of this rotation Native of Marlboro Massachusetts here Here is Chandler PJ spinning against Nice take He goes a spin cycle on Cammy Shonda and goes right to the basket PJ is such a classic threelevel scorer Its off to such a great start this season He can playmake he can score as you saw there Heres Fred Payne to the basket No good there Ace Neeski putting defense on And here is Hunt on the run for Harvard Ended a fiveminute scoreless drought Now PJ nearly had five points in a row of his own but an offensive rebound Another second chance for the Crimson PJ got his man to the ground and he goes right to the basket and scores How about the hesitation off the move Thats an experienced season scorer Senior for the Crimson 15 points a game More importantly two to one assist turnover MB 26 to1 assist turnover ratio 10 to shoot Retonovich driving right hand red to the basket You know the size factor was huge The first step length was huge for Rodonovich Look at him as a shooter coming in off the bench and he does come in the game jump shot ready But when hes got some size with his matchup exactly what you want put the ball on the floor find the straight line to the rim Native of Montenegro Marco Rodanovich averaging about 14 minutes a game off the bench for BC Here is Nesbbit 10 to shoot around for Hunt Got his defender up and Hunt hits the long two Just got to keep your feet Thats all that was Good job by Hunt Hes an aggressive offensive talent Austin Hunt led the team in field goal percentage last year He had played a ton of minutes over 30 against New Hampshire earlier in the season that second game and then was banged up against Northeastern Here is Luca Taves switches right Taves kicks three ball is no good but look at Roonovich coming in helping with the offensive rebound and then out of bounds possession to Harvard when we come back Little bit of a push back for the Crimson but Boston College music sophomore 13 as a junior and now up near 15 as a senior I was going to say he plays iron man minutes but that disqualified during that timeout when coach Amirer had to give him a blow Most minutes of anybody on the Crimson roster right now in his first 10 minutes Thats a fivepoint Boston College lead halfway through this first half Keenan Parish in there for the first time first year from North Carolina And they stepped out of bounds You can see the energy that Austin Hun has He would just want to attack the baseline get himself going As you said Eric hes a local guy This game means a lot to him Im sure one of his teammates is on the uh Boston College roster as well from Milton Academy coached by the great Lamar Reik Heres Donald Han Nice little fall away Twopointer no good Robert Hinton brings it up This is where Hinton could be good too on the floor Free ball Batist got it You got to know thats his game No matter how you match up if you switch or whatever you got to know thats a big challenge in this ball game Play the pick and pop with Thomas Batist He is 16 of 24 from behind the arc this year Shot a match He did Threepointer of the year Yeah Yeah See the Eagles backing off the ball pressure Just sitting back a little bit Staying packed staying compact in the rim area And a little fake nearly taken away by Shaw He does get it back Now its Eisendra against Forte Got to get it off End of the timer Didnt hit anything Good possession of defense by the guys in the white shirts This is where youve got to get him He sets a screen and then he pops back Seldom does he roll to the rim Likes to pop game Thats number one on his individual scouting report Guard him in the pick and pop Youre going to switch and switch hard Not going to switch Get out there quickly Sh thought about it again after making his first just a moment ago Forte back out there for BC His three ball Pretty good luck Doesnt go down They opened up the corner for him too so he had room to go oneonone if he wanted to reject that Hinton against Fred Payne Hinton is good Boy that is smooth isnt it That pullback shot the high release point very difficult to challenge You know obviously we mentioned the 34 points he had a careerhigh against BU It was notable just because of the number as Fred Payne fights another three into double figures once again Six games in a row for Fred Payne DC by six Lets see Good attention to the from the weak side and did no good on the jumper Here is Forte running A love for Shai Couldnt finish at the rim So tempting anytime you see him to your right or your left in transition to just wait and let it happen Our board little shimmy and his three ball is no good Keane picking up a little bit of pace to it Yep You see by six 713 to go Hastings inside Good sense of where to find the seal player in tight Excellent offense by the Eagles Tommy Anak for the seven opponents this year The last this one has been stronger Keep in mind that one loss was to a VCU team that did very well making it to the NCA tournament Batist driving left against Hastings and Batis cant finish at the rim Williams did a nice job finding the driving angle again going at the Boston College Bigs off the bounce from the elbow area Brad Paynes been very good in the early going Entrance Hastings has a little bit of space Batist does get over but commits the foul Just the third foul total that weve had in this first half That keeps the flow of the game going obviously but its been good for Boston College That has been a trend for Harvard the last couple of years Top 20 nationally and fewest fouls per game They were way up there and thats that last year as well And the other component to that is theyre very successful at the free throw line themselves Jaden Hastings only had the four points against two lane Was very good against Davidson though Season high 25 minutes 11 points first career double double A couple of free throws here He has an early six points Yeah new role higher expectations to be a significant contributor for Jaden Hastings Just got to inch ahead every ball game with levels of consistency Certainly see all the raw brought talent there Its just that consistency piece as it is for almost everybody And and you know he wants to do it Hey red shirt of the year Sat behind post sat behind Venning Hes got another rebound here His fourth of the game after the Harvard miss Forte sees an opening Kicks to Shaw Aiden Shaw resets in the lane A SPIN GOES UP SHAW SCORES Game in isolation on the left side of the floor Had tons of room to make a play for himself Feels like maybe even a you can see a little bit more confidence offensively from him than maybe we saw in the first couple games that we did earlier this year Got a rebound there He was on teams where he had no role Hopefully get in the game Hes on a team now that really wants to give him a significant role to be a contributor and they play a little bit differently These ball screens you see with the ball in his hands or Jadens hands right there Little handoff Hastings Nice job to find the trailer by Forte and Jaden Hastings has eight points Eagles are on an 11 nothing run over the last two plus minutes They lead by 14 Batist wide open Cant leave him there I wont say it anymore You just got to make you got to guard the two man Actually the Eagles are doing an excellent job with their help defense something they had some issues with in the twolane game Harvard is three of nine from three today Two of those makes are Batist Heres Shaw 10 to shoot Kicks for Donald Tans and he traveled Go back to this look earlier from Aiden Shaw Yeah hes just really doing a quality job getting a lot of room and being deliberate in his approach off the bounce As we said this is a new role for this guy He didnt do this at his previous schools school rather Aiden music Shaw came in from Missouri 92 career games for Missouri He was a 64 shooter from the floor when he did get his opportunities last year Averaged about 9 minutes a game for a Missouri team that made the NCA tournament He is a big time athlete Youre not going to find many better than him when it comes to athletic ability Hunt was no good from three but a great save by Barour Oh he did all that work and then stepped on the out of bounds line Here is Tommy Amir Youre 19 now for Tommy Amer at Harvard Its been a Harvard team You know they really got on a run late in the season last year 52 over their last seven Ivy League games They just missed the Ivy League tournament by a game ended up finishing fifth And this feels like maybe his best team in the last four or five years And they have expectations to get back to that IV tournament Kapi to the rim No good And Barbara rebound Hes had an extraordinary career in division one basketball One of the true gentlemen in the game Coach Amar when its all said and done hell be a candidate for the collegiate NCA basketball hall of fame He should get to 500 wins by then too Theres Chandler PJ He has six points Hes at 484 overall in his coaching career Satan Hall Michigan The last 19 at Harvard Heres Donald Han for three Its no good Hinton has the rebound This is the beauty of the Harvard offense They got a number of guys that can push the ball in the open floor Well theres the cutter Hunt He did everything but finish at the rim PJ Hinton Barbour all can push the punt and kicks for Shaw Three ball thats no good The rebound for Hitten and they do indeed push Barbore for three Thats in and out but an offensive rebound by Hitten Barbour gets another crack at it and this time he scores Eights for Tay Bar and a nice little spurt back here for Harvard Little eight nothing run 3428 Barbar so efficient Crimson going to Heres Forte tried to lob it up It ends up working there for Captain Doesnt have to look perfect every time Its just got to go in Lets see Shooting 48 from the floor Hitting a spin to the bucket No Couple of times theyve gotten to the bucket had good looks just have not been able to finish And they were spin tight moves too Heres a lob for Shaw And theyre bailed out with a foul Pay knew it Immediately tapped his chest A good offensive game here for both Eight points for Tay Bar Eagles on offense Shaw 20 to shoot finds Fred Payne You see six of 13 from three Theyve shot 48 overall And Fred Payne connects Continues to have a great first half He has 13 points Very similar play and spacing as weve seen so far from the Eagles Clear out that left hand corner put a twoman play over there on the wing and let the guy go In that case Fred doing a nice job Batist driving 14 to shoot against Kapky Batist needs help Kicks out for hit against Fred Payne Good defense by Payne but commits the foul at the end of it Thats too bad It was good defense by Capy too He wasnt buying any of those shot fakes in tight from Batis Little lob to Hinton GOT IN BEHIND AND SHAW comes over and rejects it I thought he put out a message earlier about that kind of shot Hand gets to the free throw line Donald Han no good and Hunt finds a rebound You can see that Crimson can pitch it ahead Get into anybodys hands Fiveman motion Open up the court Everybody has skill and you find this guy to drive And theres PJ showing a little bit of a burst He has eights You can that is a good illustration of him just being steady versatile waiting going as the lane opens up Forte just missed at the rim So a real chance for Harvard here in the final minute Again you can see down as much as 14 Its an eightpoint game right now Come down and space the floor nicely EJ nearly lost the handle Manages to find Hitten Offensive rebound Batist into the corner with 15 to shoot Bar deep three Thats no good Good awareness to go the inside out pass Never quite had the right rotation after that offensive rebound And now BC can hold for a final shot What a little swing this could be at the end of the half depending on what happens right here This is the guy thats been the most consistent in these twoman plays in the middle of the floor Fred Payne I mean Harvard has only committed three fouls so they have plenty to give here 57 to go And thats still just the fourth on Harvard It is though the second on Batist And so he will come out here for Ace Meski Tommy Ammer just shouting two to give for Capki and going to keep the foul on the floor Looking for a constant 37 to go in the half Boston College up by eight Im sure they will They dont want to take it in this situation Let the ball come in Now get its Payne He gets the shot off too strong and a rebound down to Hunt I think Harvard will take that Absolutely And its an eightpoint Boston College lead over Harvard at the end Three for four from that threepoint line Couple of those early As we said it had flow There wasnt many fouls generated Minimal turnovers with both teams Just had a good rhythm to it So eightpoint lead for Boston College They led by as much as 14 at the 532 mark of that first half Here is Hinton And Fred Payne goes around and commits the foul You know if youre Boston College you got to at least have an awareness in this ball game that this team Harvard wins games at the free throw line They get there and they win it and they dont put you on the line So between their threepoint makes and theyre getting to the free throw line is all very helpful It makes the bucket there I I was starting to say earlier then we got you know sidetracked by the game happening but that 34 points against DU that came after two games in a row where he had kind of struggled a little bit just two of 16 from the field So it was a really important bounceback game for him let alone the careerhigh Heres Donald H and thats good from three Speaking of important oh man you can look at that all day long Fred Payne ball on the floor to penetrate Kick it to Donald Han Jump shot and score Donald two for three from three Nice take to the basket by PJ Thats what we were talking about Eric The quickness off the catch PJ can just move his ball in his body so quickly 10 points for Chandler PJ 10 for Batist eight for Barour Theres another one from deep No good that time And Barbour has the rebound for Harvard Second driving kick for the Eagles Just doesnt go Both teams with their starting lineups to start the second half PJ got caught with Shaw PJ had a lot of room on the right there Look at how the court opens up He had a lot of room to drive the basketball Kick to the corner Eisenrath driving finds Barour Three to shoot Barour off THE WINDOW HE SCORES IN THE FOUL Gutty possession by the Crimson Ball moved nicely Everybody was strong with the ball in their hands Generating in one possibility Look of course nice and spread Extra pass out top Driving kick again or just continue to the goal And because there was so much room there puts himself in such an advantageous position Spacing such a big deal in team offense Harvard has four guys averaging double figures Three of those guys have gotten to 10 so far today after that make at the line 4137 is the BC lead Hand Can he do it again He can Good reaction to the change of defense Crimson go to zone Ball movement by the Eagles Nice catch and shoot by DJ at the top Three threes for Han Thats his most in a game this year Three for four from behind the arc See all that space near the rim to open up the drive on the back A great pass Sure was Pocket pass with his strong hand Maybar Boy just knowing how to find the open lane on the cut 45° cut we call that Three assists for PJ Decent pass inside but its knocked away out of bounds Itll stay here with 16 music on the timer Another threepointer for Donald Drive kick catch and shoot Good rhythm Good awareness of the relocation by Donald Han Just a heck of a back door pass right there Its easy to say it was only a matter of time for Donald and and its probably the truth as Fred Pay nice take to the basket and scores He has 15 But when it had been as many games as it had been you still need to start to see it at some point just for his own confidence That is a wide open three Batis has burned BC three times on that shot today He is 13 And for Donald Han hes always had the green light for coach Grant So I think thats kind of reassuring to know you can keep trying to shoot way out of it Heres Forte for three That rolls off Hastings gets the rebound out Good ball movement Out of bounds Itll stay here Well Donald Han three threepointers today nine points To his credit in a lot of the games earlier this year he was still finding ways to score even though it wasnt the most efficient But if he can get to the line and if he can get that foul shooting back where it was last year that is crucial too You see the struggles early but hes been very good recently Was over 80 last year from the line Thats what all the top scorers do Eric They get to the line and EJ affected at the rim Good work by Capy Shaw in there as well Definitely got some more pace to it than we saw in the early part of the first half Yes And thats knocked away Its an easy one to deflect from the weak side but just kind of telegraphed it over his head 4642 A lot of pride has been generated with the success of coach Amiker and thats for my guys Feeling a lot of pride in whats going on with that program how it got in the NCA tournament His tenure has really complimented anything I left behind for sure And important to note for you that one of those pictures was here in Boston College So 49 on the timer 4642 Boston College leads Nice play Robert Hinton and hes going to get the basket out of it Simple gutty help defense by Hinton Shows his length ability length and athletic ability and sees the value in getting a turnover out of the timeout I imagine its so much easier to jump that when theres so much less time on the shot clock Now BCs lead all the way down to two Cap the inside No but a foul Lets go back to this play by Robert This is just sniffing out real well on the inbounds Went with the right left hand which was the proper hand to deflect an inbounds pass Its just a dangerous angle sometimes to throw it He knew it So stretched out a little bit Since Boston College took that 14point lead Harvard has outscored BC 24 to now 13 over about a 10minute span Five points for Bowden Capy Spent 70 at the line to start the year been such a positive addition to the Eagle lineup being a guy who can play on the perimeter distribute the ball take the open three as we shot in the last game with two lane when necessary but play pick and pop which they dont have a lot of in the front court Six for Capki Pass for PJ It was too tall from Eisenrath Eisenhath has really done a good job for the Crimson Started the last five games Theres three in double figures for Harvard today Hittens the other one averaging and per game Theres a step in Lucaz knocks it down Well you want to sight for sore eyes Seeing Luca do that makes all the difference in his in the world for him because if he can make these shots from behind the threepoint line then hell draw the defense right See the defenders going under the screen had no intention of coming to the top of the screen Lucas going to be effective He has to get those defenders in that case to guard on the top of the screen Taves missed the first two games of the year Excellent job there by Kapy and then Taves goes to the hardwood creates a steal Rodonovich running downhill Rodonovich no follow up by Kafki Not there either Its real good conversion defense by the White Shirts right there That ball came up quickly from the Crimson Bump and a foul Couple guys had to really run the court hard in conversion Foul goes against Capy Now recently Coach Grant has not been happy with their defensive conversion at times There were some easy gets gets by Tain down there in Charleston as there were easy driving lanes from time to time So theyre playing better defense against music a very highly skilled offensive team in Harvard Earls going to get out there soon if theyre not careful You see that four five ball screen They switched on it for the first time Matis gets inside hits Pay for three That was way off from the jump Thats Tapki putting good pressure on defensively and BC can run taves the trailer finds Donald Tant Rodanovich open and no good from three Friendly fire there for Harvard on the rebound Two of their own guys kind of came together and allows Boston College to get an offensive board Good job by the Eagles with defensive balance after the shot that allowed them to retrieve that ball And driving into the paint Double team there Hand makes his move FOR SHAW SHAW POWER MOVING WELL if you want to find your first second chance point first two second chance point chance points of the ball game Its a pretty nice one to look at How little seven nothing run for Boston College They lead by nine Aiden Shaw to seven points Entrance for PE against Shaw PE is affected well by Shaw defensively DC back on the run Taves coast to coast No Luca doing a nice job pushing at the length of the court Hinton goes back in No good Back and forth we go now All of a sudden DC by nine A little bit crowded Theyre all on one side of the court right now to open it up Bad moment to reset here 16 on the timer Entrance Capy got caught underneath but hes fouled Madonovich is the one that finds him This is just a really talented play Find the open man in the perimeter Takes it right into his right hand Attacks the rim violently I would say we we started making this point earlier That was like trampoline layup I mean theyre definitely you can sense an extra level of offensive confidence with Shaw here today Absolutely And its such an important factor for this team They need him They absolutely need him to be consistent rebounder rim protector run the floor as as weve seen and just continue to be efficient with his scoring which right now hes three for five from the field but its the six boards that really have helped the game Tommy Amirer goes with a little bit more size Ace Neski comes in You see by 11 Good The foul line today Six for six Barbore against Rodanovich Kept his pivot foot nicely Heres Austin Hunt against Taves Hunt pulling away and he scores Well contested 64 versus 61 Couple inches there made the difference for number seven Caleb Steager in for the first time for Boston College Eagles doing a good job inside out passing Just kind of came too quick when the cave done that but adjusted nicely when theyve seen zone 1148 remaining in this second half Eightton Shaw following up a season high eight last time out against two lane five points right here with those kind of rebound and scoring seven points six rebounds Id be able to get a double double half 10 minutes left to go in the second half got two assists hes got three blocks today hes been on the floor heres for three right at the end of the timer a little bit short Frankie Manino the first year just into the game for Harvard for the first time he was down the other And punt gets Rodanovich onto the hardwood and a whistle here and theyre going to wipe the floor right where Rodanovich slipped You know as we we talk see Rodanovich there but with Shaw 23 we also see that his defensive versatility is big Hes going to take on this matchup with PJ fine but he can switch on the perimeter guard a couple different positions His versatility defensively significant for Boston College teams Still very few free throws being taken very few fouls in the ball game Grant has to be happy theyre guarding without fouling Five to shoot Hunts Great job by Luc Thats what you do in practice Oneonone and then contest He too was showing some confidence today Number 10 Brendan Danovic too strong from three With Hunt though first game back for a while from an injury and hes definitely been active He had a blocking foul here with PJ who took a hard fall of the ground This game can get physical when youre guarding off the dribble And you see a classic rule 1014 guarding a dribble You cant bump him on his path Dont take the rule book out Im just telling you Its a 1014 We believed you Thats PJ You had about 4 in You know theyve done so so many additions to rule 10 one which is all about protecting the dribbler and the recent changes uh from the rules committee and hence scoring is up Its another reason how scoring has increased Heres a drive to the basket and it just rolls off for Eisendra Still looking for his first points of the day Three ball is good Caleb Stagger Hes here to shoot Breeze Where did that come from I mean we know hes got it but its just been problematic for him Had that really impressive game against the Citadel shot hadnt quite been there the last few but thats a good one right in front of the Eagles bench 5846 and again a wet spot underneath the basket You know sometime that happens when you have a playing surface over ice You got top level professionally padding underneath it but sometimes the warm days like were experiencing today Yeah its warm Its nearly 60° here in the Boston area today Generate some kind of uh film I think both coaches are certainly affirming that theyd rather see this done Well maybe coach Hamburgers not saying lets go I dont think that was the case So 11 on the timer A couple of times its been whistled down during his offensive possession Yeah Heres Hinton Goes to his right Mismatch there with Capy Hitting cant hit Gatsky did a good job not fouling creating some space where he could challenge him vertically Stayed away from the rule 10 fouls of putting hands on the dribble Its a 122 scoring run for Boston College Harvard is just one of its last seven from the floor Look at Taves Strong pass for Donald Tans 14 to shoot for Boston College Good ball reversal Kind of stationary on the weak side but hell find them if theyre there Tis back in which means Ky has the size advantage 10 points for Bowden Capy Kappys got determined low post footwork You can see his dribble drop game right there He can go left as you saw there or his more dominant right hand would be the shot of preference Excellent job there finishing the play After a couple of years at Butler in the Boston College theres Robert Hinton for two And a quick timeout taken 920 remaining in the second Fakes from behind the arc Certainly a difference maker for them but so is this guy with the basketball You know you look at the second half youve got three guys playing with the best plus minus One of them is Luca The other one is this guy with the ball Capy plus eight And Shaw plus one So sometimes we get all caught up with Fred this guy here Why not Donalds hand to the basket An offensive board there for Capki and he hits Stagger in the corner And how about Sneaker coming in and just feeling comfortable These guys are happy for him cuz they know hes got it in him But its been some of these bench contributions that have been really significant as that bench score 214 over the Crimson Theres been a lot of building blocks in this game for BC coming off a tough weekend in Charleston Heres the three ball from Steer Thats all he needs to do Just spot up and catch and shoot That gets the bench points to 214 for the Crimson in the ball game Largest lead of the game for BC Hitting no good from three and Steer has the rebound See theyre going under the screens for Lucer and thats why the threepoint shot becomes important but give him credit to get into the logo Donalds hand for three Might have forced that a touch inside for PJ Eagles got a piece of it Whos it off last Going to Boston College Good job by the Eagle defense As you see the passer put the ball over his head So it was good to read the direction the pass was going Got the turnover Its Boston Colleges final game for a week They played a lot here in a short order Stagger Can he do it again He did That was just one of those days for him Give the point guard credit Knew he had to find him Knew he was in the long corner Drove the baseline to find the passing angle Well done New careerhigh nine points for Stagger on three made threes all in the second half Boy this this to the baseline music get into a long corner Great to see the guard group on that bench showing great respect Most threes this year for BC most since last January against North Carolina That was a miscommunication there So Harvard gets it back Its a 20 to4 scoring run for Boston College over the last 8 minutes Remember Harvard cut this to a twopoint game at 4644 Eagles have been really good since Harvard is just two of 12 from the floor in that time you know and and only one threepoint make one for four at 25 So thats kind of help Boston College that theyve made some shots you can see the value in the threepoint shot for the makes for the Eagles And you can see when the Crimson cant generate makes like that scoreboard tends to move in the other favor 16 to shoot That being said they can come back Heres Taves Taves doing a good job just getting into the paint Gets it to Fred Payne Nice drive by Fred Payne 17 points Fred read that perfectly Came with a little bit of a stampede cut on the catch and just continued to the rim First foul on Caleb Steer It is the fifth of a half on Boston College but obviously quite a hole for Harvard to dig out of right now Largest lead for BC PJ against hand Eight to shoot Xavier Nesbbit is in there Comes inside PJ falling away He finds the bucket We say hes an inside out player That possession perfectly explains it couldnt get anywhere off the dribble DJ Hannah a great job So he went into the post area Showed his ability to finish and a little eight nothing scoring run in the midst of that spurt Here is Hitten Remember he had a steal like that early that kind of got Harvard going and ended up cutting it to a twopoint game Can they do it again Double figures now for Robert Hitten Yeah fourth turnover for the Eagles Fred Payne left alone and hes short from three would have been a new career high for Payne Say this is where Harvard doesnt need a lot of plays They can put the ball in a number of peoples hands Generate those oneon ones as we just saw with PJ A nice look there Couldnt finish Payne has to get rid of it Does find Kapki Eagles cycle around and Stager cant do it this time But it was excellent ball movement He had a couple guys there that could have taken that shot a week ago but they instead passed it ahead Barbore nice little fake but then hes short on the runner Did the work just couldnt convert This is where the Eagles just going to look for some poise on offense Chop the clock down and still stay aggressive thrown away Hinton from the free throw line is jumper is good Too much retreat not enough get out to dribbler in the middle of the floor in the break So BC has not scored in over two minutes Little six nothing run for Harvard but then a foul on Nesbbit Still work to do but theyve cut it from 20 to 14 This is just another great read by Hinton Saw the telegraph pass just a little bit And again you see what Harvard can do in fast break opportunities You can steal it Great offense from the defense You can be the push guy Dill the length of the floor Another one Hastings back in there for the first time in a bit Hes fouled by Batist Forts back in as well for Boston College as is Aiden Shaw Well we are seeing we see Batis there What we are seeing the balanced scoring from the Crimson Batist with 13 PJ with 12 or Bore with 13 Hidden with 12 This is what they do free throws for Hastings Its the third foul on Batis PJ and Hinton both come out for now for Harvard Hunt and Nino back in One thing about that run by the bench of the Eagles allowed some of these older starters get some rest who should be strong to finish this game properly Austin College a perfect 8 for8 from the foul line and their lead is 16 Our board for Batist has bit eight to shoot affected by Forte Good job guarding the twoman play on that side Covered the pop Cover the dribbler See coach Grant saying move He wants them to be decisive with their passing Eliminate some time on the clock Forte driving is fouled And well go to the line when we come back Just 20 Harvard a little spurt to bring it back to 14 This is something that Earl Grant has talked about This idea that okay so lets take it here at 16 Can we push the lead to 20 Were up by four Can we push it to seven or eight You know one of the reasons here that you know the Eagles have lost some of these close games the inability to do it When theyve won they have been able to do it such a key point for a team growing and the idea of learning how to win early in the season and a whole new new group playing together establishing their roles I think were seeing the roles are a little bit better defined in this ball game Certainly the threepoint makes are huge relative to the scoreboard They shot the ball at at the same amount of attempts behind the threepoint line but their accuracy far stronger than 25 up to 45 right now 43 behind the threepoint line and just explaining to the group what a difference that can be in terms of a separator Really felt like the shot selection early was especially good It it kind of worked music its way It was a really kind of deliberate piece early Felt like that actually allowed them to get into a rhythm in their shot selection early on in this game that kind of carried all the way through I dont think you could walk out of that locker room in Charleston when they lost to two lane and say We had great shot selection today It just didnt go No not the case They came in determined today to get good solid shot selection chances at the rim And I dont think anybodys tried to do too much offensively just let the game flow So here is Batist as Harvard tries to get back in Little head fake couple of bounces and it doesnt go Donald Pan finds his way to get a rebound through two Harvard Crimson players TE with the ball Found a very long arm Number 22 contesting it Hard to shoot over That is the sixth foul on Harvard Harvard doesnt do a lot of pressing They play a short lineup So they dont not used to a lot of pressure situations to generate traps and steals Forte with seven Four to shoot Cany Shonda for three Thats no good Had to go with just two on the timer And then Hastings commits a foul Second foul on Hastings and Bo Capy will return Hard to believe only four personal fouls four free throws rather taken by the Crimson at this point You had mentioned it just how good a free throw shooting team this Harvard team can be almost 80 on the year Our board is at 84 They missed game that BC led by as much as 14 in the first half They led by eight at halftime Shondaa again no good for three Was a good open look Harvard had cut the lead down to two at 4644 but DC extended it all the way out to as much as 20 And Barbour who takes a hard fall driving in against Capki Foul goes against Boston College Kapki just showing what he does best and thats wall up Hes playing with shot blockers generally but he can elevate from the floor and try to get the wall up Look makes the offense shoot over him Just picked up the foul there So this one of those sometimes its not game gets choppy at the end Yeah Yeah Harvard hasnt scored in 2 minutes 40 seconds BC hasnt made a field goal in more than four minutes but theyve made their shots at the line And Harvard hasnt made enough on their end to get back really back in How about this kid Nine boards Aggressive play as weve seen 13 points You look at the potential right Just look at where he ranks this year came in second in the Ivy in threepoint makes fourth in minutes 10th in rebounds cheering So its an allaround stop Absolutely We said making the jump from year one to year two in a very impressive manner That ties his careerhigh 15 points which hes now hit in backto back games Coming up on two minutes left 7156 Forte driving explodes to the basket and scores Chase Forte gets a lot of room in that middle third of the floor and takes that to the to the rim nicely Down to just 143 left on the time coming off here Nesbit to the basket Double team there of Shondaanda at 69 and Kapki at 611 So you sandwich a guy in tight with one a shot blocker another a wallup guy and you wind up used to say you wind up in a phone booth Would you would you understand that if I said that He dribbled himself into a phone booth Thats what he used to say to players I dont have any quarters to pay it but I do know what it is Just one to shoot Got to go Dell doesnt hit and Boston College will dribble out Ryan Sullivan in there as well First year from Auburn Mass And Dutch Daell the sophomore from Utah But just 110 to go The Eagles 7356 and Harvard allowing it to play out A little bit of a bounceback result here for BC though thats taken away by Frankie Manino and he scores at the rim One of the things weve seen from Harvard today is excellent offball vision Still a long season and the Eagles now will have a week for Thanksgiving before the ACC SEC challenge will host LSU next Wednesday That will be an interesting test after a positive result today That slips away going Harvards way And the timer off Red Payne just continues to grow and grow and grow Coach Real Grant There is Nesbit who has two and Boston College will dribble it out Its a very satisfying win for the Eagles 17 for Fred Payne Kapki and Hastings both go in double figures 73 60 Boston College gets back to 500 A lot of relief in that hug right there Now they had dropped
