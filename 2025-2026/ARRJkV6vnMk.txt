leading scoreer leading rebounder Hes averaging 15 points eight rebounds on the season but you see right there 20 plus points in his last three outings Hes had the hot hand Jackets will need to check him early And Moila controls the tab for the Yellow Jackets against Andrew Ball And off we go High noon Georgia Tech in Monmouth Just the second alltime meeting in the first in 40 years But Kai Fleming the freshman who started three straight games tries to drive cheering the Yellow Jackets coming off that loss against Mississippi State 85 to 73 They shot a season worst 33 Kesi Reeves was not the problem though He comes through with another three Picked up right where he left off Uh that was good ball movement there by Georgia Tech Clown the shooter late in the clock Reeves now shooting over 40 from three this year Heres a look at Monmouth starting lineup same group theyve used in each of the last three games now And Jack Collins one of their alltime best players as Rivera Torres dumps it off to Collins who was fouled and itll be a charge to Lamar Washington Collins is the glue guy for for the Hawks Hes played over 100 plus games in his career music Uh was a preseason allca selection Uh and he kind of does a little bit of everything Hes good on the defense He talks communicates intangibles guy but he can also rebound and fill it And hes also third nationally in minutes played averaging over 37 minutes a night And he misses both Cam Craft plugged back into the starting lineup for Georgia Tech after coming off the bench Wednesday night Threepoint shooter trying to find a stroke Washington kick out to Craft Reeves from the right wing this time Wont drop and Andrew Ball with the rebound Zipped inside And a foul coming here on Cila That was Stefano Martales the freshman from Greece who has made quite the impression his first month at Mondo Oh yeah He had a couple backtoback 18point outings early in the season Good looking freshman There you see he gets the contact from Stila and Collins sends it to Spartalis on the inbound Monmouth five and four on the season as Collins air balls a long three Washington with the rebound The Hawks played three games last weekend defeating Ball State and Lafayette But with a surprising loss to Le Moine a Kai Fleming in and out Ray wont go for Justin Ray He went seven for seven last time out in the win over Princeton And last touched by Georgia Tech Theres a look at head coach Damon Stoutmire now in his third season at Georgia Tech And John he was blunt in his postgame press conference saying he needs to find five guys who are going to fight If they dont bring that intensity he sees a moment in the game where one of those five arent bringing it he can take them off the floor Yeah I love his attitude going into this one Uh you know got after it in practice Kind of reemphasize the fundamentals of defense and how to compete toughness And a hard fall to the floor for Rivera Torres Another foul Thats three now on Georgia Tech You know were talking about defense Uh you a couple fouls by Georgia Tech right there the ability to to contain the basketball dribble containment Mamas had some success early on getting into the paint or through transition getting easy look cheering So thats the second foul on Moilo Rivera Torres gets Monmouth on the board Thats a big deal regardless John not having by dongo who is out today with maintenance was the terminology Georgia Tech used not available all of a sudden that front court a little thinner yeah by averaging you know just shy of 12 points per game just shy of eight rebounds per game so you know Payton Marshall probably see some minutes and its just an opportunity for for multiple guys off the bench to step up and spell those minutes from by and Fleming gliding to the rim Cila cant finish but Manmouth mishandles the rebound and Georgia Tech will retain possession So far both teams struggling to shoot Combined one for seven Craft three around and out Had a good look at it Square the shoulders Did everything but drop Yeah Craft for whatever reason has struggled in this building this year John and hes shooting below 20 from three at home Away from home hes shooting close to 60 from three in those three games Speaking of three there is Spartalis as he splashes one from the left corner Theyre going to get Spartalis off the basketball running into CilaC Nice looking freshman steps out stretches the floor high release snap the wrist follow through Hes feeling it And another foul coming here on Andrew Ball Spartales He hadnt even taken a three the last four games What was the signal he did there Was that like a Spartan like Greek you know cuz he is Greek you know I think it was the Im just trying to follow along if I you know getting older I dont know the lingo the trends but Im thinking he made a reference to Greece there the Sparta mask And Lamar Washington with a three Lamar senior from Pacific transferred into Georgia Tech Spartales facing up on Cila now This team starting to find their stroke a little bit And Spartales this time from the short corner You know is it Thanos perhaps could possibly be it Uh Georgia Tech gives up the penetrating pass right there into the heart of the defense That was too easy And a turnover for Georgia Tech Number they cut down on here recently but Monmouth they penalize Princeton for their miscues on Wednesday night Good hands from Crab as he dislodges it cheering Washington one hand pass into the corner Kesi Reeves is locked in That was a nice job by Washington finding the shooter in the corner He found Reeves with a lefthand pass Kind of looked off the defense freed up his teammate for the shot Thats now nine threes in the last 40 minutes played for Kesi Reeves Good hands from Fleming Rivera Torres still has it Dribbles into trouble and Cila picks it up Weve got bodies on the floor on one end a turnover on the other cheering Rivera Torres too strong Reeves falling away Doesnt get the roll So far both teams doing a pretty good job on the defensive glass Ball cutting and a beautiful feed Everything but the finish Its a beautiful back door cut movement off the basketball Weve seen a couple possessions now Mommouth having success Georgia Tech got a C man C ball Back to the basic principles Reeves goes down low to Cup and we got a foul coming here Well step aside for the first time Head coach his son saw on the graphic a moment ago played with Spartales as Eric Chadfield Juniors threes off the mark but played with Spartales in Greece last year Xander Rice he had finished five years of college ball here in the States Bartalis had just began his professional career in the era of NIL Chance to come to Monmouth and he could spend a couple years with the Hawks and already making that impression as you talked about cheering By the way Spartalis did pick up his second foul Thats why he went to the bench That was just before he went to commercial break And then Bug Robinson going up against the sevenfooter Pton Marshall whos now double team down low And Robinson gets his hands in forces the turnover on the jump ball A quick smother in the in the post As soon as the ball touched they jumped Haitian Marshall Payton Marshall brought it down trying to be tough with it Its good tie up Good uh effort by the Hawks Yeah one of the numbers that may surprise you for a school out of the CAA but Monmouth is top 20 nationally in blocked shots Theyve got an interior presence Yeah surprisingly Uh Rivera Torres has 17 blocks on the season So its not coming from a forward or center Mhm And last touch by Georgia Tech So the Hawks will have seven to shoot Also seen Doc Mordar come in Hes got 13 blocks The 7 foot one center Three to shoot Got to go up Collins too heavy Offensive rebound Ray No another offensive board That one to Robinson Hell go to the line cheering and applause right now Monmouths winning the 5050 balls I know it was a long rebound Wy but they seem to be hustling and have the edge kind of in the intangible column Theyre really competing right now And that was something that coach Damar was adamant that had to improve Even more concerned about that than the results but he felt like the intensity and the fight has got to improve And He told the team at shoot around the day hes going to have a short leash if he sees any thing that isnt 110 effort Another offensive rebound Georgia Tech catches a break that Robinson missed that easy layup And now a turnover in the back court Rivera Torres battling for it Now Marshall all alone needs to go up Hes blocked from behind by Collins Bordar There it is Senior out of South Sudan transferred in from Cleveland State Pton Marshall got back in the play but kind of just ran right by the action Jaden Mustaf coming off the bench for the first time this year Washington penetrating now Backing up cheering Catch Thats just oneonone ISO It made something out of nothing Robinson trailing Gets Craft in the air And nice touch cheering Beautiful finish using the rim and his body to shield Marshall Craft a long tough three and rising up for the rebound Rivera Torres Thats a tough shot I mean just one pass east to west and its you know youre youre not stepping into it Moving towards the basket He certainly has that range and can drop it but see a couple more passes out of the Jackets with some ball movement player movement screening shoot more in a rhythm Well Monmouths struggle to get even anywhere near inside the perimeter on this possession Rivera Torres tries a three and Lamar Washington another rebound Thats four for Washington from the guard spot And all the way coast to coast he finishes Hes been the spark plug right now the last couple minutes for the Jackets Washington now with seven points And he is a coast to coast guy I transferred him from Pacific over in California Hes the only guy on the court right now for the Jackets that has scored a bucket Yeah only two Yellow Jackets have scored period Kesi Reeves has the other six And a little miscommunication Mustaf ends up with it Mustaf leaning towards the rim That is his biggest strength John He can drive to the hole Yeah hes hes at his best going downhill Uh hes got great size great strength agility He can finish with the left and the right Thats certainly the strength of his game Monmouth shooting below 30 so far today And foul as Rivera Torres hits the floor Yellow Jackets leaning on a couple veterans so far Kesi Reed and hes averaging 26 minutes per game eight points four four rebounds per game and just under five assists per game So his production has been outstanding for minutes played You back in high school he was a linebacker In fact he played for coach Damon Statamires cousin was on the football staff and they told him back in high school said Man if you want to play basketball you better lose some weight cuz he was a little he a little round So a shot clock violation out of the timeout But for Lamar Washington he said I I went straight to meet and fish That was it laughter Im if Im hoop I got a hoop in college Im going to lose some weight And he does say he brings a little bit of a football mentality He he likes contact He says thats the thing he misses most about football is getting a chance to be a little more physical As a a great key addition to the Jackets roster He brings toughness maturity um and IQ And hes got hes seasoned played a lot of minutes And a couple new faces on the floor now for Georgia Tech is Chaz Kelly has come in And Cole Kirowak this is the first time he has appeared in a month in a game cheering All the way to the lane Kirawak looking for the offensive rebound Tries to bat it in and it will be Georgia Tech basketball Good hustle play there by the freshman Cole Kiraak applause Yeah Im really high on his uh his ability Hes got a high ceiling to his game Athletic there You see the extension the long arms Hes been working hard in the weight room Um but hes a guy that just needs minutes and with B um with Bongo out of the game today the opportunity knocks Well see uh if he can produce So three freshman on the floor for Georgia Tech as Fleming left it short Kiraak another board Bust lines up a three Splash Yes Hustle play by Carowak He kept that one alive and the ball found the open man Kwak might be the spark plug that the Jackets need And that type of effort is exactly what Damon Statamire was calling for this morning to shoot around So largest lead of the day Meanwhile for Monmouth theyre shooting just 25 from the floor It feels like theyve gotten some quality shots Not there though as Kiraek blocks it Second effort air ball Rivera Torres Jackets with possession and Kelly calling on Mustaf to get it and a turnover Wow Just when Georgia Techs about to blow it open and pull away a little bit uh the turnover bug hits like what we see out of Kurwax so far on WY uh the long arms the length um you know still raw to his game but hes hes got a lot of skill and right now today hes got a high motor which coach Tarttomire wants Thats what hes looking for out of this roster Whos coming off the bench Whos our spark plug against Mississippi Mississippi State in the loss on Wednesday Very little bench scoring Chadfield down the lane and reaching foul coming here This man Anthony Martinez freshman from France Martinez What I like about Georgia Tech is you know their field goal percentage defense is rock solid right now holding on to 20 holding to 11 one of nine from three and that was the staple in the five wins for sure The Yellow Jackets holding opponents under 65 points and under 40 from the field and theyre trending towards that today Obviously ball screen from Kirwak for Mustaf Mustaf trying to take ball on the dribble Hangs and its swatted away by Andrew Ball but Mustaf recovers from the seat of his pants He gets to Kiraak Only two seconds to shoot Hes got to go up off the WINDOW AND IN COLE KIRAAK WITH the lead bank work out The freshman who had played just two games this year about 10 total minutes Big spark cant finish that time Oh big number eight turned that down Thats about to get fired up for the man His first opportunity getting meaningful minutes this season Hes delivered so far threepoint try for Collins And thats a big shot for their senior leader That snapped a streak of seven straight misses from the floor for Monmouth and a 90 Georgia Tech run cheering And another miscommunication there is Kelly looking for Chadfield And just before Kelly fired that pass Chadfield cut but cold steals but he went on to describe his feelings in the moment last night as disgusted He lost three in a row and he took that personally And I think hes a realist You know hes been there two years at Florida Hes played in bigtime games and then obviously already two seasons under his belt with the Jackets He knows whats coming Hes a veteran guy Hes been there seen it done that and he knows theyre not quite ready for ACC play And you know he just wears his emotion on his sleeve Januk Dubal will go to the line That fouls on Cole Curwag I kind of like Kuwaits approach though You know its a loss is a loss regardless of personal accomplishment Hitting seven threes is great but the maturity in in those words Uh he he wants to rally his teammates Hes a team guy Hes team first And that showed in his words played just those six games last year coming out for missing the season with a foot injury as Mo Caes in for Cole Kirwak Kirwick gets a lot of applause applause and fist bumps as he heads to the bench and by Dongo out and free throw is good from Dubal So he makes one out of two and here comes Kuisa I thought Kirowak was a spark plug off the bench you know just in terms of getting guys active He kept a couple loose balls alive Offensive rebound He was sprinting the floor on both sides Just little things that arent going to show up in the stat book but he definitely was a shot in the arm Got the Jackets buzzled a little bit Wy down low to Cila One on three He corrals it goes up and itll go to the free throw line And for the Jackets Cila uh you know his Achilles heel is free throw shooting on the season Hes below 40 And thats not great for the Jackets because hes the leading free throw shooter So um you know you dont want to say its a turnover but you know if you if youre giving up opportunities to get two and three points from just making one at the free throw line um that can be a bad thing And itll be something he will continue to deal with as he moves forward this season as more and more teams see that scatter report and know how dangerous he can be Send him to the free throw line You neutralize him Misses both Like you said John feels like a turnover Yeah And they know its not coming out Sila on the season five assists Um so you can see Monmouth the Hawks Coach Rice when he touches it hes a threat in there Were going to double down sometimes triple down and lets either foul him or force him to kick out King Rice four years as the point guard for North Carolina late 80s early 90s and now in his 15th season as the head coach at Monmouth Of course he played in this building a number of times went two and two here in McCamish Bug Robinson banging on Sila ball just inside the free throw line Wont fall and CLA brings it up the floor Kelly tries to lob it in and there it is The Hawks went for the deflection and once Cila had it there was nobody in his way It was good early offense by the Jackets They flowed right into it and it was a beautiful pass as well The lob the touch sila great hands and the finish at the rim Man is shooting just 22 from the floor so far cheering Ball carves in at the end of the shot clock Wont go but save momentarily and itll stick with Monmouth deflected by Georgia Tech See Washington back into the game for Kelly Kelly was effective in those minutes with the law pass right there Get give him the assist Cala the high catch the finish the strong hands and thats what he does best and thats why Jordan wants to get it into him Sure Cila on the season hes played in nine games He started all nine averaging 27 minutes per game 11 points just shy of nine boards So hes almost a double double guy Spartilus little off with the touch there Lamar Washington all over the glass Thats his fifth rebound today Cila leaning in and it wont drop Dubal a three after a dribble Bang And the lead cut in half Its a big shot by Doo Yeah hes shooting over 40 from three this year in limited playing time Kesi Reeves sees daylight rushes in pops up knocks it down Reeves now with eight He leads all scores so far this afternoon Dubal with the ball Uh you know hes tall His length is a little deceiving 13 of his field goal attempts coming into this beyond the arc out of 25 total attempts on the season And another three drops Justin Ray had a massive game against Lafayette on Sunday Had 21 points on just seven shots He made all seven Must into the lane Kicks back out Washington shakes Dubal and knocks down the shot Put Dubal on skates Backpedaling Lost him in the paint Washington a crafty move right there Spartus a little too wide open cheering Mustaf wildly tries to chuck it up Acy saves it and itll be a live ball turnover now Rays three cheering An offensive rebound and then Collins fires it down low Cutting in Spartilus Good ball movement there by Manmouth And coach Damon Stannomar wants a timeout as the lead has been cut to two The mom time Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference coach of the year And while they havent made it to the big dance yet you feel like its a moment of time Perhaps most impressively theyre looking for their 10th win over a high major with King Rice as their head coach And they almost got it early in the season Uh they had Syracuse on the ropes and they were up five against Satan Hall at Satan Hall early this season They beat Satan Hall a year ago So empty possession for Georgia Tech out of the timeout Jason Rivera Torres started his career at Vanderbilt now at Monmouth Too strong One of the stories in this first half John has been the extra possessions for Manmouth Theyve got nine offensive rebounds They forced seven turnovers Theyre getting more bites at the apple than Georgia Tech Theyre just not shooting a higher percentage Exactly Theyve got 30 field goal attempts to the Yellow Jackets 25 coming out of that dead ball situation and it you said it Its the nine offensive rebounds Its the seven turnovers theyve forced Its the steals Plumbing one dribble pivoting off the front of the rim and his second chance look doesnt fall either Fleming had a nice look at it but hes struggling today 07 but hes a talented freshman Balls not dropping today but he can do a little bit of everything Collins thinks better The three goes to Rivera Torres Spartilus on the offensive glass No Reeves saves it cheering Washington Under 10 to shoot Craft slips and loses the basketball cheering Rivera Torres transition three drills it And that started with the veteran Collins on the defensive end He just got to the loose ball Craft hit a wet spot and they convert the turnover to quick offense on the other end And M with their first lead now since the opening minutes of the first half Lob to Cila tries to one hand jam Rivera Torres on Craft and thats going to be goalending on Moa Im not sure what Mo was thinking on that one He went straight up and uh you got to pull back on that Ball was above at the top coming down going towards the top of this cylinder You see it right here Its on the way down and he grabs it But it is a nice display of his athleticism That was vertical leap no steps and hes hands at the top of the square We saw him get called for goalending for Mississippi States first points on Wednesday night Final minute here in the first half You know Dongos out today but the the duo down low Thats why theyre having success holding teams under 40 from the field on the season The jump ball will belong to Georgia Tech And there you see Moila and by Dongo Dongo you missed it earlier Hes out due to maintenance Probably just has a few nagging injuries and uh want to get him rested up for ACC play Uh definitely a big loss for the Jackets though Kind of get a head start on that 10day break as well Georgia Tech will not play again until December 16th after finals against Merist Washingtons got to get it in Gives it up to Kiraak Switch on from Harvey to Robinson on Mustaf Now Reeves gliding down the lane and a blocking foul called here King Rice was not happy thought that whistle was late Well get a look at it right now Now I I think Kings argument was Reeves created all of the contact by jumping into the defender and hes biting his tongue Hes biting his lip right there I I dont blame him Sometimes you just got to grimace and smile I suppose as Reeves hits the first free throw Hes got 15 years on the on the Monmouth sideline He knows how to get to the next play He does Im sure he learned that from the great Dean Smith Eric So Eric Chadfield Jr coming in Reef misses the second Mustaf with the offensive rebound and hell go to the free throw line So Georgia Tech gets the 5050 ball That was up for grabs but free throw shooting wy has been a challenge for the Jackets Not only in in this game theyre just one of four So theyre not getting to the line shooting 25 when they get there But on the season its an area theyve struggled in Hits the first Georgia Tech second to last in the ACC in free throw shooting As you pointed out though I mean you can attribute a lot of that to Moilas struggle because hes gotten there more often than anybody and he has struggled to hit those free throws You can see bottom 10 nationally Mustaf hits both of those So back tied at 29 here in the final seconds And King Rice wants a timeout So Manmouth can try to draw something Probably try to collapse the defense Whether thats a dribble iso or ball screen roll replace action They want to get something going downhill North south Jason Rivera Torres their leading scoreer on the season Seven points today Its Justin Ray and he knocks it down Pure shooter Freshman from Greer South Carolina Georgia Tech had the three covered but Ray did a nice job with the rip through to the right Created space Chadfield with three Kicks it out Reeves has got to chuck it and he is fouled cheering with 410en of a second on the clock Thats going to be three shots for Kesi Reeves And the senior Jack Collins is disgusted He is You can see the look on his face is just his momentum is just carried him into the shooter Thats his first foul in the game An errant pass Wrong place at the wrong time for Collins And if the clock isnt winding down theres no chance Kuesi shoots there Yeah Kuwaiti had a play He went right into the shooting motion Uh so he was aware of how much time was on the clock and he has been Georgia Techs best free throw shooter this season Mentioned it earlier Kuesi is coming off that seven threepoint effort in the loss against Mississippi State And today hes the leading Georgia Tech scorer with 10 points Hes three of six from the field three of four from the line two of four from threepoint land and he will give Georgia Tech the lead with 410en of a second Ray does not get it off Chadfield was there anyway And thanks to the heady play from Kasi Reeves Itll be Georgia Tech with the lead as they head to the locker room this season Of course they shot a season low 33 on Wednesday Who are some of those guys Georgia Tech needs to make some shots Yeah I think Fleming and Craft combined 0 for9 and those are two guys that have had some bright spots for the Jackets this season I think they need to get one of those guys going And on the Monmouth end they want to get Jason Rivera Torres going just two for 12 in the first half Now hes two for 13 and Cila walked with it unfortunate break for the Jackets and that where Sila you know the youth comes out and shows uh you know he makes a great defensive play and he should just pick that one dribble and gather tries to make something uh out of nothing ends up in a turnover Ninth turnover for Georgia Tech Justin Ray off the inbound three Fleming earns Georgia Tech the possession Couldnt hang on to the rebound but last touch by Monmouth And Fleming can impact the game in other ways Hes 0 of7 from the field but that that was his fourth rebound Hes a guy that can defend Hes got active hands great length and hes a great athlete Can leap really put hands and deflections on balls and rebound And another turnover in the opening moments of this second half is Justin Ray applause will pick up two points with a goend call there on Kesi Reeves We talked about the half the turnovers leading to easy offense and thats what we saw on that possession Washington overpetrates and the Hawks going the other way Reeves with the hustle a little bit too late And whats been a little peculiar over this threegame losing streak John is that the turnover number had actually dropped by better than half from an average of 167 over the last three games Of course Tech lost all three of those games as Moila flushes it Jackets had a plus six advantage in the first half on points in the paint Uh I think thats also important early on to establish some flow offensively is try to get some drives to the basket or get it to Cila with some paint touches Yeah CE just two points in the first half Spartales off the mark with that hook Washington trying to create a little space Fleming along two kisses the front of the rim and lunging for it Cila itll stick with Monmouth Little more effort there from Georgia Tech here in the early going I love Cilas hustle on that play Just got to be careful not to foul But thats for the Jackets Ball screen action rim rim runs and they can thread the needle I think they just got to get more of that And there was a scoring change at halftime as well Moa now with just one foul He had two assigned to him but after reviewing they changed that foul to Kuesi Reeves Rivera Torres draws the foul Monmouths made a concerted effort You know ball movement Uh theyre setting good screens They have good spacing They have four guys on the floor that can go off the bounce And they also have a nice lineup in right now for shooting three and stretching the floor Torres along midrange wont drop Just 12 of 40 from the field in this game Yeah Torres has taken 14 of those 40 shots Made just the two cheering And another turnover Yeah Torres as we mentioned in the open for those just tuning in hes averaging 15 points per game on the season Hes coming off three consecutive 20 point games and in this one hes jackets are holding him in check He has seven points He does lead Mammoth with six rebounds So has a couple assists as well So hes a big part of everything they do Feeds down low Spartalis missed the chip shot and theres a tap in from Rivera Torres The lefty hand I mean hes got great length quick off his feet Rivera Torres tipped that one in with his left hand Hes got a pretty good Q score too He starred in the Kevin Durant Apple TV series as Moila testing out the rim strength early in this second half Rivera Torres will not fall It seems like the goal coming out of half was to get him going John Hadnt quite happened yet Kuesi Reeves a magnificent play Hell get a breather horizontal on the hardwood And that was good pace offensively Jackets one or two passes at the rim here Well see the flow The rim rim runs We mentioned that the previous possession Like to see him in rim runs transition offense with the senior Reeves getting out Jackets making an effort now to pick up the pace in this game They dont want to get caught in a slow down half court game Theyve got athletes They got size advantage I like those last two possessions for the Yellow Jackets And Kesi Reeves after a 23point effort on Wednesday hes got 15 this afternoon on just seven shots Jack Collins a little quiet today Hes played every minute thus far every second Georgia Tech switching guard to guard on the perimeter Really packing in the defense Spartales taking on Cila Couple international freshman and Spartalis wins that one Spartales out of Greece Sila out of Sagal tries to dive in baseline Now its Fleming Short corner fade away No the freshman Fleming still trying to find that shot today 0 for nine now Perhaps looking to pick up the pace a little bit and soaring in Rivera Torres starting to find a little more confidence here Hes now in double figures with 11 One noted up Just about 15 minutes to play in this one Monmouth Hawks gritting it out Lob entry knocked loose The Monmouth Hawks They put a scare into Syrac Monmouth has seven points on those second point uh second choice second chance effort So hes a guy that can certainly impact the game when hes not dropping shots Cole Kiraak has checked in for Georgia Tech He was a spark for the Yellow Jackets about midway through the first half Shot clocks going to expire and Lamar Washington didnt know Man thats out of a dead ball situation Not great execution Damon starti awareness emotion on his sleeve right there with the facial expression said I Wally he just said I just drew it up I just told them how much time was on the clock and they couldnt execute thats frustrating as a coach now 12 turnovers for Georgia Tech Justin Ray he can stroke it a little bit Georgia Tech has slowed him down today though as Cam Craft with the rebound Craft thinks about a three Mustaf goes baseline reverse No that was great Great possession by the Jackets Four passes wide open at the shot No finish But they get what they wanted Collins a straightaway three Bullseye Washington Tough shot Drills it Weve seen that a couple times in the first half His ability to get in the paint gather and make a strong finish Now thats two miscommunications on the threepoint defense and on the transition offense right there Jackets the last two defensive possessions have struggled today in the ACC New Haven with the lead over Boston College Dayton in a fight against or Virginia in a fight against Dayton Southern Miss and Miami are tied up in the second half UNCC Asheville early on against NC State up 126 So its its a global game Theres recruits coming from all over A lot more parody in your mid major high major classic matchups You look at two of the players on the floor for Monmouth right now Rivera Torres and Spartales Rivera Torres started at Vanderbilt dropped 20 points in Alabama a couple years ago as a Commodore And then Spartales in a lot of ways hes a high major player The reason hes at Monmouth is because he played with coach King Rices son and his coaches in Greece said Ah go play for for Coach Rice King Rice has assembled a nice roster Um theyll be super competitive once the regular season goes Washington top of the key three Hes fouled by Rivera Torres And in conference play King Rices teams in his time at Monmouth Uh 10 out of 14 seasons theyve finished above where the coaches ranked them preseason So great teacher great coach overdelivers There you see the foul off the basketball And in a tight one possession game these are the plays right there Youll look back at 1335 on the clock If hes able to convert came Rice and say Wish we had that possession back And not only is it three free throws for Washington in the last 30 seconds both Stefano Spartales and Jason Rivera Torres have picked up their third foul So Spartales with a few parting words for the officials he jogs back to the bench Itll be Doc Mordar 7 foot one transfer from Cleveland State wearing number zero to come in So tied at 44 We have had four ties and 15 lead changes today Thomas working clock Theyve really done a great job today taking care of the basketball WY only three turnovers in the entire game Rivera Torres spinning in rises over Kelly that touched every bit of the rim and Mordor with the offensive rebound Hell go to the free throw line We get a little replay on it Cila Cila left his feet Uh and thats where the foul occurred if he would have just stayed put Wy with two feet on the ground and stayed vertical Could have been a clean play but well see him late in this play Leave the feet Boom Theres the body You lose verticality You have contact Automatic whistle And Doc Mordar hits the free throw If you take a look at the back of Mordars jersey youll see it actually has his first name on the back of his jersey And he says that in his country they wear their first names on the back And he had friends watching back home and family and they were confused Couldnt really figure out what was going on And so he had him change it to Doc cheering and he hits them both Vonmouth back in front Cila goes up and finishes Love the competitive spirit by Cila You know gives up a foul and some points on one end and he erases that mistake Gets two back for the Jackets Jack Collins surveying gets to Bug Robinson into the paint Had the mismatch on Washington now contending with Cila Disrupts the shot And another rebound for Lamar Washington Hes got seven Cila on the other end Swatted away by Mordar We got a whistle and a foul coming here I love the ability of Kelly to get off the ball You know he just was kind of a onetimer He caught it Eyes were up great awareness and vision and he really made that play on the pass to Cila And here we go Wy down the stretch Free throw shooting will be important Weve talked about it earlier Sila has struggled here Uh well see Certainly I know hes getting the reps in Hes practicing but can it can it translate to games 0 for three now on the day from the free throw line for what its worth Georgia Tech outside of CLS 10 of 11 from the free throw line So theyve done a better job as a team Got that one cheering Coming in at night he was 14 of 36 from the line And today Sea is now one of four But he does have eight rebounds and nine points Hes trucking a double double and a foul coming here Looks like its going to be on CEO And that is his third now Picked up two quick ones Itll be Jack Collins to inbound The senior out of Manisquan New Jersey whos played every second of this one 13 in blue Justin Ray can shoot Penetrating Lost control And now a foul coming here And whos this going to be on Going to be on Kesi Reeves Thats his third 20 on the shot clock Baseline out of bounds situation Rays a good player I mean he can force force it in there Hes strong with the basketball Pick up fouls Hes very good going north and south Hes got range on his shot Hes had some great games this season early on Long inbound but Robinson runs it down Ray finds space to get the shot off Swirls it in You see it right there Hes got another gear I mean more so than most players on the court right now he he can really go Hes athletic Hes quick Hes tight with the basketball Finds his spot gets a seam and his elevation was tremendous Big shot Hes already scored more points this season than he did all of last year And today hes got nine Washington heaves it up and a foul call on Mordar And coach King Rice cannot believe and hes contending that Mordar was straight up And Lamar Washington at 64 Do you get the benefit of the doubt sometimes when youre going up against a guy whos got seven eight inches on you Should laughter Lamar Washingtons saying he hits both free throws and its Georgia Tech now in front But King Rise part of that 1991 Final Four team for North Carolina said his most memorable game against Georgia Tech was here inside MCMA Pavilion when the Heels lost by 27 points as Justin Ray hits the free throw line jumper And he was facing Kenny Anderson a guy he had known for a long time and still to this day says was the best player he ever played against Kenny was complaining that Kenny only had nine points in the win And King said Well you had 17 assists laughter Thats one of the reasons why uh you know Bobby Kremans names on the court here Kremans court He had great players Was a tremendous recruiter story career of Jackets did the right thing and name the court after the legendary coach Bobby Kremens Of course that team that beat North Carolina 102 to 75 would end up in the final four just a couple of months later in Denver as Moila heads to the bench And you know Dennis Scott his number was hung last year as he walked he graduated came back did the degree We see him on TV every week calling the NBA action Came back and finished the degree Yellow Jackets hung the number four in the Raptors He averaged 27 a game his junior year And for Dennis Scott you mentioned Kenny Anderson only had nine points in that game Well Dennis Scott he had 37 So he kind of picked up the slack there from Kenny And dont leave out lethal weapon three Brian Oliver and Reeves goes up climb the ladder with the hammer All of a sudden the energys picking up a little bit as we approach the 10minute mark and this game is still airtight Ray bounce pass Mordor trying to answer Good box out by Craft as Washingtons got the rebound Kiraowak goal give and go Washington the extra pass Kelly dialing up a three and connects Nice job by the Yellow Jackets passing moving the basketball spacing getting back to the roots of the fundamentals and they take the lead by two And Jack Collins is fouled by Craft They do not give him continuation That was an added emphasis this year was to give him continuation a little longer window across the sport So its going to be two shots Came right just whistle got to look at that You all got to look at that Yeah Point of emphasis this year was the continuation into the shot Yeah I beg your pardon free throws at all being continuation or not getting the continuation call Thats what he was upset about He thought it should have been good basket Theres six fouls now in Georgia Tech So one and ones coming Dub ball way off the mark but Robinson scurries underneath collects the rebound and hell go to the free throw line Be interesting here if they have Kurowak or Reeves with the foul I think they got Reeves on that one And if it is on Kaci Reeves thats his fourth John Correct So he and Moil score for the Jackets with 17 He and Moila each with four and a lot of basketball left to play Robinson on the left applause King Rice still fired up giving Anthony Eids his opinion So Kesi Reeves heads the bench with four fouls And back on the floor now Jason Rivera Torres cheering Robinson Jr with the touch Give him seven points now in the game Hes got seven boards to go with it 20 minutes of play Hes made his mark on this game And we are back tied And now Jack Collins incredulous at that foul call Little bit of confusion here as to who the ball went off of Well say it went off of Collins And now Chaz Kelly at the point for Georgia Tech 20 lead changes today Still nine minutes left Cole Kiraak whos burst onto the scene Dumps it off to Washington Tries to feed it to Craft Instead Collins ends up with it Well the Hawks run Ray retreats Boo Robinson Oh he gets the roll You mentioned that touch John All of a sudden Cornelius Robinson still got nine points He took it right at Mustaf And thats Mustafs game as well Two guys of very very similar types of players Kelly feeds a cutting craft Great cut from Cam Craft and good eyes from Chaz Kelly And with that bucket thats Cam Crafts first basket of the game Hes got two points And I said it earlier they need a guy like Craft or Chad um Chatfield or Fleming to step up They need some bench Under eight minutes to play in a tie game Ray tough shot Kiraak rips away the rebound Ray missed short on that one He held up the fist to King Rice on the way by saying I need a break It looks like Chaz Kelly might have been calling for a sub too Well were going to get a timeout on the foul coming here against Jason Rivera Torres Certainly those four players need to be on the floor for their teams to have an advantage Uh you know I Ill still say this w this is going to come down to second chance points Uh who can take care of the backboard and then turnovers and the third in that would be right now free throws Craft will go to the line on the day Manus eight of 12 from the line Georgia Tech is now 14 of 18 from the line Um its a one one possession game You got to get every make every one count and craft hits them both That is one area Georgia Tech has been far better at today has been free throw shooting Shootings been good Georgia Tech 13 turnovers in the game Monmouth only three And thats why we see the discrepancy in field goal attempts Uh Montmouths only shooting 36 theyve taken 58 shots in the game Georgia Tech 44 but theyve only attempted 43 shots And it was kind of the opposite story on Wednesday when Georgia Tech took 16 more shots than Mississippi State And we are at the Institute of Georgia Tech so were just throwing numbers Throwing numbers around high frequency above the shoulders type stuff right laughter Sometimes you got a little steam off Hey man twopoint game Great game and both teams have really battled So foul coming here on Cornelius Robinson Georgia Tech is in the bonus Lamar Washington is perfect at the free throw line so far today Hes put together quite a stat line 16 points that matches a season high Hes got eight boards tied for the team lead Also leads the team with six assists and then two turnovers So hes got three to one ratio there Hes had a solid effort 27 minutes of player So he now leads Georgia Tech in points rebounds and assists today And for the first time since the 16minute and 47 second mark we have a multipossession game Its the largest the margin has been since Tech was up by four about 10 minutes ago of game play Jackets on a 60 run over the last minute 15 Andrew Ball a three Chowak tries to come down with it Collins wins it Martales goes up and he is fouled by Washington who grabbed him around the waist Thats a big play there from Spartales who was doing that Spartacus sign earlier Hes a freshman out of Greece Well you really only need a Greek god in the building Man was I wrong Its that green blazer you got on man You got the Greek colors Spartan Spartacus Were Were compensating John Look at him man Look at him It appears Mustaf is okay You saw him grabbing his ankle there Hes still in the game And Spartales completes the threepoint play Huge possession there Size though huh As a freshman I mean its just thick Doesnt look like your typical freshman 69 at 220 Craft 32 strong Collins source for the rebound Twoon one Ray a ball reverse lay Oh just a tad short Now the Yellow Jackets could get out and run Washington pressing pace all the way in Hes got 20 points and the lead to three and a home run a swing for Manmouth and a turnover And Coach Rice wants a timeout Yeah thats two possessions right there resulting in uh one turnover and one rush shot And this six minutes to play He may tracking a triple double Yeah first 20point game as a Yellow Jack It had a 40point game back in January against Washington State when he was playing for Pacific Hard to imagine Washington coming off the floor at this point the way hes played 4 seconds to shoot Hell cut it loose Race for the board and itll belong to Monmouth Last touch by Kai Fleming and for Georgia Tech Not having Bedongo not having Moila with foul trouble Hes got four fouls Dongo out with injury Kesi Reeves with four fouls on the bench All of a sudden youre asking guys who have not been in quote unquote closing time to play these critical minutes Carowax in there Its opportunity for growth Hes played more minutes than today than he has all season And what a big job protecting the rim cheering and applause Hes like I dont need to grow Im here Look at my size Boom Get it out And Fleming cant handle the pass Oh my Georgia Tech just shooting himself in the foot Quirak makes a great block shot Gain the possession and then throw it right back Look at the second effort He was a freshman He reclassified Took a prep year at OTE or I should say a postgrad year at OTE and then spent a year before that at a prep school up in New Hampshire So hes been a development project but the tools are tanalyzing Justin Ray gives it back up to Jack Collins the senior leader lets loose a three and ball with the offensive rebound Ray cutting in going up cant finish And theres Kiraak Couldnt ask for better shots from the Hawks right there if youre coach Rice Craft lines up a three off the mark He has not found that shot today quickly the other way and Manmouth a second home run swing Some sloppy turnovers for the Hawks They had turned it over just three times in the first three quarters of this game John Now theyve turned it over three more times Theyre just one of eight from the field in the last eight shot attempts Throw in the turnovers Georgia Tech has a one possession lead with the ball And coach King Rice is letting Justin Ray hear about it there as sophomore point guard Kiraak Washington with the runner He got it Nice finish Kurak did a nice job erasing the defender with a little side body hip check Largest lead Georgia Tech has had in the last 12 minutes Spartis backing up on Craft An O look feed Robinson saves it Its got to go up And a shot clock violation And that brings us to a timeout The Yellow Jackets Mamemoth has attempted 30 field goals in the second half and shooting just 36 But the odds are you want to get more shots at the basket Theyre doing that with offensive rebounds turnovers that uh theyre forcing on the other side of the ball And so Monmouth finding a way to hang in there even though theyre not shooting the ball well And Moila back onto the floor with four fouls You know John a Yellow Jacket fan might point out its hard to get those offensive rebounds if you make that shot Well youre right about that But Mamas got nine second chance points in the second half to Georgia Tech zero And you know theyre just thats how theyre hanging around But CILA trying to put him away Close the door big fella So the lead is up to seven thanks to this 6 run The fouls on Mustaf puts Collins at the line He left it short Collins hes from the shore born and raised man Manquan New Jersey or Manquan New Jersey be bigger pardon Fourth year at Monmouth trying to keep the Hawks in it He missed the front rim on the first one Knocks the second one down Hes played every minute of this game Has not been out Third nationally in minutes played So third in the conference sixth nationally Crab looking for Cila Robinson doing all he can to shut him down Crab puts it on the floor takes it to the hole and cashes in Its an aggressive take We said we need to get some scoring out of Craft in the second half Hes got six and that matches Georgia Techs largest lead of the game since it was 20 to 12 Spartalis they needed that too Its the first made basket for Manmouth in nearly four minutes And now a foul far away from the basket coming against Robinson Martales with that basket 14 points in this one Hes got four boards This is where its going to come down to free throw shooting Wy Georgia Tech with a two possession game Well Monmouth theyre shooting 74 as a team from the free throw line at his best in the Colonial Athletic Association and 11 team league Meanwhile Georgia Tech as we mentioned has struggled this year Mustaf hits the front end of a one and one And thats big because he was 60 free throw shooter coming into it 14 of 23 on the season And that was a big free throw Back to a threepossession game Got to give the Yellow Jackets a lot of credit after shooting 65 from the free throw line on Wednesday They are shooting 82 this afternoon and have missed just one of the 13 theyve taken in this second half Yeah Im sure just getting a little confidence that mental edge getting in the gym getting reps up Thats good to see some success from the hard work And what a play Kesi Reeves shutting down Rivera Torres who has had a tough night tonight Hes now four of 20 Hes coming off three straight 20point performances as Washington lobs it Cila cant finish The Hawks have got to go Raise the top threepoint shooter on the floor Heads inside now Robinson penetrates RIVERA TORRES HAS IT RIPPED AWAY by Reeves again Here comes Kawasi and he is fouled and gets continuation and one for Kesi Reeves applause whos got a chance for another 20point performance this afternoon Well get a look at what a play Spectacular Avoids the foul The continuation takes the contact and the bucket The gather Boom One hard dribble gather and Ray gets the foul and hes playing with four fouls King Rice saying thats continuation and ours wasnt He does have an argument there You saw the play about 7 minutes ago in front of King Rice on the bench Yep I I do feel like possibly an argument there that he would have and I think with the way that the NCAA has tried to get that called nowadays you would want continuation on both of those And Robinson lays it in Coach Rice calls timeout So a Lafayette Leopards who lost to Monmouth last week Monmouth played him on the road And then theyve got FloridaM Of course Marish is a team that could provide a challenge as well And a foul here Theres going to be on Jack Collins And that puts Lamar Washington back at the free throw line And you know John I think its a safe bet 10 days from now Lamar Washingtons going to be in that starting lineup Made his first start of the season today Hes got 22 points eight boards and six assists Not bad 23 points Nothing gets past you Keep stacking them laughter And his first miss at the free throw line of the day CEO with the offensive rebound And the largest lead of the day for Georgia Tech at a dozen Sila now with 13 points nine rebounds One rebound shy of a double double Bray clangs a three And Georgia Tech with possession and a four possession lead Looks like the Yellow Jackets thanks to a surge in the final six to seven minutes will snap this threegame losing streak One minute Lamar Washington player of the game Hell join us as soon as this one is over He did a lot of his damage down the stretch too He had 14 points in the second half And thats Reeves He now has 11 points in the second half and has matched his careerh high with another 23point performance Timeout called by King Rice and hell get some of the players on the end of his bench a chance to take the floor here at Mccameis Pavilion But the unselfish play the pass by Mustaf great spacing ball movement the good to great and Reeves knocks it down 23 points on this one Hes seven of 10 from the field That was his third triple with that make So Cory Miller Lucas Orchard Jack Ley Zubir Griffin and Quinn Peters get a chance to take the floor as Griffin cheering drains a three Its about a 2 and 12 second differential between game clock and shot clock Coach Rice instructing his players not to foul So the Yellow Jackets tied with Monmouth with seven and a half minutes left Close out the second half strong on their way to their sixth win of the season and they will snap the threegame losing streak Meanwhile Monmouth will fall to five and five And another chance to build some confidence for the Hawks here with this Georgia Tech team up until the final seven minutes But our final score Georgia Tech 79 Monmouth 67 Damon Statamire King Rice a couple of long friends Theyve known each other over 30 years
