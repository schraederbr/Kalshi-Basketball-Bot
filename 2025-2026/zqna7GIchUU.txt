continue He enters tonight leading the nation in scoring at 23 a game Officials tonight Eric Lewis Justin Porterfield and Jeff Pond Duke controls the opening tip Blue Devils 10 and0 Four wins on the season against ranked teams And thats Cam Boozer facilitating to Patrick Gumba They want to get Gumba more involved as Lipkcom goes on offense Their point guard makes it go Matteo Esmeraldo with the ball leading the AON in assists Theyve got some size down low as they turn it over Grant Aman is 611 Hes their leading scoreer Charlie Williams 610 Thats pretty good size for a mid major Well theyre starting man to man and they have the size to match up I dont know if they have the depth You see them come out the first possession try to go zone That didnt work here Now theyre going back to man And thats something we see a lot with Boozer He sees the matchup with the smaller Esmeraldo the instinct is go to the basket If youre putting an undersized defender on him he will punish you inside Hes not worried about impressing NBA scout showing you his range Hell hes developing that part of his game But with when you switch like that you dont know how to guard him You try zone he gets it in the middle makes the pass you switch it theres not not a guard in college basketball applause John Shy tonight seeking career win number 100 If he gets it he would be the fastest in ACC history to get to 100 wins Hes done an unbelievable job I mean I dont think he gets enough credit following the legend cheering as Moraldo got the step on Foster His pass knocked away by Foster Thats the length youre not going to see in the Atlantic Sun No I didnt used to see anything like that Speaking of length Duke just has size in all five positions That allows them to switch without really any penalty Boozer so good passing out of the double team Open three Isaiah Evans It started with the big guy Yeah its its you dont know how to defend him You dont want to switch And coach Carol told us he said Hey were going to just stick and do what we do And I dont know how well thats going to work but he shouldnt feel bad cuz nothing anyone else has tried has worked so far this season Charlie Williams backing down Gumba Now the freshman from Israel or Ashkenazi cheering Size advantage here for Williams Boozer came to help Another turnover forced by Duke I think one thing coach SH said he didnt want to see his guys be better at is transition offense and I think theyre running that time they ran the fast break but they didnt attack the basket to score thats going to be over the back on Gumba his first here again I mean coming off that pass to Boozer youre switching your guards you got to get low see Amina making the extra pass and you dont want to give that guy an open look last year he shot 41 from the height of three points Green line a little slower start to the season only 32 but dont want to give him looks like that and get him going Both of these teams have had more than a week since their last game Williams from the baseline not there Lipkcom still looking to get on the board Now Foster lines it up It rims out Ashkenazi flying for the rebound Jmeno went down and we get a whistle The foul on Lipkcom and Charlie Williams his first Kevin Carroll first season as Lipkcoms head coach He had been an assistant there under Lenny Auff Then spent the last couple of seasons at Division 2 Traca Nazarene a school which is also in Nashville like Lipkcom Evans with the stroke early a couple of threes for the former McDonalds AllAmerican And hes a guy We talked about the consistent second score for Duke Evans has the ability to be that guy Hes knocked down two quick three balls here Start this game And Randolph with Lipkcom struggling early A team that had won five in a row You get the sense there might be a little stage fright Well you got to you got to keep your calm here They get a steal This how he gets back in the game here Ashkenazi lays it in for two A young man whos 23 years old Hes a freshman He did three years of mandated government military service in Israel while playing pro ball in Israel Yeah Here And he gets the bison on board here by turning the defense into a little sloppy Yeah Thats what you want to do You got to struggling to get going here Turn defense into offense and be solid I think theyve trying to figure out a way to cheering pick guys up as hes saying Hey guys lets go You know that turns into a brand kid story one day I picked laughter Cameron Boozers pocket Took it the other way for an uncontested layup at Cameron Indoor Yeah you never show the score You just show that one play to validate your story You can see the nerves You can always tell when teams come in theyre going to have nerves with the with the pitchers and everything The excitement of being in this arena Ashkenazi wild shot Jamemenia cleans Took a shot to the head Evans already has knocked down a couple of threes through the contact Left it short Here comes Lipkcom They want to run as Moraldo It rims out and Jimemena battles for the rebound And we get a foul on Asmin who helps Evans back up to his feet Now one thing about Lipkcom their style of play off a rebound They want to get the ball across midcourt in 4 seconds They like to play fast not a lot of dribbles And Kevin Carroll told us theyre not going to change that because of the opponent And you respect that and understand that theyre just lining up today Theyre playing against a team where athletically that could be a concern but I credit that He doesnt want to slow the game down because as they play other opponents and when they get into conference play this is the pace they want to play at And you can see here again turning defense into potential offense Kennedy Apara his older brother Felix plays at Tennessee He had 17 last time out against AlabamaM Theyre going to do theyre going to switch their mantoman defense and have strong rotation to the basketball Akara picks up He knows defense as well too He He has the answers to the test Hes just trying to get his teammates up to speed to get these guys on the same you know page that he is on on the offensive and defensive end of the floor You see now theyre coming out theyre running a 131 here Hes going to try to mix up defenses Amena The corner three It doesnt go Rebound by Malik Brown And it goes to Lipkcom We saw a little stretch before the media timeout Lipkcoms tempo and speed almost catching Duke a little off guard I think that you see the turnovers a couple of careless turnovers here by Duke but also again theyve been off 10 days So they got to knock off some rush too We had finals and Asmin knocks down the three Hes having a breakout season He was about to follow Kevin Carroll to division 2 TCA Nazarene And then Carol was about to get the job at Lipkcom He said Hey hang on Before you do anything just wait a few days As Duke turns it over again Yeah And again you dont these big guys can stretch the floor Grant Azine again 41 from behind threepoint line Youve got to get out there and guard him in a pick and pop Theyre going to force Duke defense to switch a lot of those ball screens as Moraldo turns it over Amenia goes down remains down Spot up three is good And Lipkcom has tied the game at 10 Ross Candolino Its a 100 run by Lipkcom after Duke opened the game on a 100 run and the freshman Jimena remaining down near midcourt hit his face on the floor there when he fell the contact there He loses balance previous play is under review applause And here with the turnover just taking advantage of the numbers with the walkin three And if you hadnt seen this team play theyre going to live behind that threepoint line And 41 of their offense comes from behind that threepoint line And there not many teams in the country thats going to look for the amount of volume shots they shoot from behind that line There is Jimenia top 15 recruit Harren from Bellarus Nearly had a double double in the Michigan State win 10 points nine rebounds Last time out hit three triples in that game And hes another guy who when Duke switches and youll hear a lot about that this season you know how Duke switches on defense but he plays multiple positions and defensively Randolph that means he guards multiple positions He does And I think thats been the most impressive thing about this this Duke team This is the best defensive team in college basketball They do it differently than they did a year ago Theyre kind of like a bow constrictor Theyre not leading in steals Theyre not doing all those things But again theyre holding opponents to 34 from field goal from the field And thats thats just unheard of at this level in the quality of schedule that they play I was going to say that last part when you look at what theyve done top 10 offensive and defensive efficiency against one of the top heavyweight schedules thus far in the country And I think the scariest thing about it is again after view incidental contact Yeah thats no surprise It wasnt going to be a flagrant there Yeah you cant you cant hit the floor with a flagrant too So dueling 100 runs to begin the game First by Duke and then these upstart lips bisons Evans has hit a couple of threes already Gumba they want to get him more involved on offense Thats one way to do it Patrick Gumba there Get get it that low You turn and finish I thought Malik Brown early in the previous possessions had a point blank layup and kicked it out for a three I think they get inside at the rim They got to finish those as Moraldo the fade and the answer as Moraldo just showing you head smaller guards putting on a clinic youre getting there play off two feet pivot create space with the spin move heres Kaden Boozer too strong as secures the board cheering the twin brother of Cameron as Moraldo ran into Boozer now Candolino needs Asmin off the window and Lipkcom with its first lead of the game as Marado again taking on the switch feeding Malik Brown off the bounce and forcing rotation cheering Heres Saw skip pass Looked like it was tipped Evans looking for Brown Duke sloppy again as Moraldo the floor general Candolino lines it up Had a great look Thats Moraldos controlling the tempo and pace of this game Hes just making all the right decisions Lipkcom in the passing lane again That is eight turnovers already for Duke And we talked about the rust and what theyve done is theyve given this Lipkcom team a ton of confidence early with the sloppy play and the unforced turnovers Duke only averages 10 turnovers per game Oh par A nice move on the baseline against one of the best defenders in the country in Malik Brown It is And I thought he cheering let his length bother him if hes taking his time He had the rim He used the rim for protection and just rushed it And a foul called on Ethan Duncan the red shirt junior from Leach Texas Fifth team foul already on Lipkcom cheering If he had told coach Carl hed have a twopoint lead 8 minutes into this game I dont know if he would have believed that He might be saying wed stop the laughter game right here They give Lipskim a lot of credit You know they had a little early stage fright Fell behind 10 nothing Theyve had an answer Duke has that guy Nobody else does Cameron Boozer with four Sarunis and a foul called as Kellen Boland tried the two This has been the most impressive thing about Cam Boozers his ability to go inside Oh you cant front him He does a great job of wedging you up riding you up the lane and they just throw it over the top Just too easy Sarunis looks to be okay after taking a spill Highpoint transfer trips over the cameraman land And thats always a scary part And cheering theyre laying there doing their jobs and you trip over their feet And when youre falling backwards like that sometimes you fall on that camera equipment or you hit the chair and its pretty painful Dont forget following our game we send you to Chapel Hill Caleb Wilson in the 12th ranked Tarheelss taking on East Tennessee State at the Dean Dome Jay Alter Terrence Oglesby will have the call for that one Kellen Boland at the line Second season with Lipkcom after two years at Air Force cheering Got to love the way Lisk is playing Theyre coming out and theyre attacking Fullourt pressure here switching defenses They know theyre outgunned They are definitely giving this this Duke team a test here early now pressing out on the perimeter Boozer and the follow by Malik Brown He gets it that low Hes just a physical freshman and cheering try to get a body on Malik Brown too with his activity Charlie Williams and that is Boan going over Boozer Another turnover Nine for the Blue Devils cheering Libson giving Duke a lot of trouble Grabs their attention It gives them something because you knew it when they get to the next game if they can get past Texas Tech theyre going to start having all this crazy talk undefeated talk all these other things And you can never disrespect an opponent And you think about what Duke has come off of right Youve played three straight ranked teams You had Michigan State last time out Everybodys talking about the game Saturday at the Garden Texas Tech This is your proverbial draft game Yes Youve come in all three ranked opponents and youre undefeated Youre one of eight undefeated teams and Cam Boozer has had a horrific nine minutes here to start this game Sloppy turnovers there Thats a really bad foul Late shot clock and this is just a heady play Shot fake You jumps right into him Hand got caught in a cookie jar and its this is about as bad as youve seen him play all year long cheering We look ahead to our final womens music basketball double header of 2025 on ACC and Monday the 29th Anna Hidalgo in number 20 Notre Dame hosting Pit in Southbend at 6 Eastern and then its North Carolina and BC at conci form So three shot foul here for Esmeraldo His hand seems to be perfectly stitched to what this offense wants to be It is And you got a guy like that And I think we asked Coach Carl earlier hes like Hey Im looking for a guy a playmaker to end the games I think hes found one And he said today Hey a game like this will show you who that guy could be I think hes found his answer Karma misses the bunny Here comes Es Moraldo Hes the maestro Tries to split the double Able to recover Williams the corner three Got it And Lipkcom down 10 nothing to start the game Has opened up an eightpoint edge Anish Es Marado is controlling this game Hes getting wherever he wants off the dribble Its another sloppy turnover here by Cam Boozer There comes Esmeraldo ahead of Boozer Lipskum by 10 TIMEOUT JOHN SHIER WHAT IS happening at Cameron Indoor Someone forgot to tell Lipkins they werent supposed to show up but they didnt listen to anyone We got a game here in Durham music down Lipkcom after being down 10 nothing to start this game on a 266 run And Duke facing its largest deficit of the season which is wild considering this team has played Kansas and Arkansas and Florida and Michigan State One of the toughest schedules in the country They have Theyve played some really good teams And again cheering coming off finals and you dont come off ready you give a team life It does not matter who that is Nearly another turnover there This D team seems rattled Theres Boozer and he gets two back for the Blue Devils Hes got six cheering The first thing they got to do is rely on the defensive end of the floor And this is the key And controlling that guy is the key The block by Foster Duke wants to run How many has stepped out of bounds 11 turnovers for Duke already above their season average and were midway through this first half I think everyones surprised here You see the Cameron Crazy is looking like whats going on We dont recognize this group I dont think Coach SH does either cheering Lipskum came in on a fiveame win streak They havent played since last Sunday so theyve had a bit of a layoff as well Heres Boland in the paint Nowhere to go Able to get it back Shot clock winding down Five to shoot I think everyone at Duke bench is stunning right now But hey this is when you rely on your defense Thats whats got you to this point where youre the number three ranked team in the country the number one ranked defense in college basketball And I think you got to come out now and rely on that to claw yourself back in this game as Maldo beat the shot clock Couldnt find the bottom of the net Foster now aggressive Evans down low Boozer the flush One thing John Sh told us today wants to see Duke run more Sarunas turned away And they win against Florida They only had six transition points Only four in the win against Michigan State cheering Evans no good on the three Gumball A timeout by Kevin Carroll Duke starting to find its mojo cross Denise Shro Randolph Childris Duke told us they thought they could be better in transition Lipkcoms game is fast Its spacing the floor And so far the Bisons 112 edge in transition points Theyre doing a great job of getting out Theyre confident now And surprisingly Duke has struggled keeping the basketball in front Theyve been sloppy with turnovers here Credit Linsk coming out getting in the passing lanes just being overly aggressive rotating to the basketball And cheering theyve let Duke know theyre here to play And Randolph its easy to become a fan of number one in purple Matteo Esmeraldo whos got the ball You said it multiple times Hes controlled this game Boozer poked that one away from Williams as Moraldo nearly stole it back Evans puts it on the floor Hes done that more this year Another turnover by Duke Asmin ahead of the pack Lipskum continues to run I think some of Dukes problems are a little bit too much So their shots theyre turning shots down trying to get a better shot And sometimes I mean thats a great thing but so far here tonight its gotten them in trouble Theyre turning down good shots and theyre just throwing it away Evans in the paint gets tied up by Williams Thatll be his second Heres just another unforced turnover there Again no ones back He turnover is unexpected The floor balance is off When Isaiah Evans caught that basketball last position top of the key they were expecting him to take that shot He drives it in You got two guys in a corner Bigs are inside Theres the throw is off balance So when he turns it over theres no one back And theyve had four pick six turnovers that have led to easy eight points for Litk Very uncharacteristic of this Duke team which was number 10 nationally in offensive efficiency entering play And the most surprising part of all of this Randolph is Lipkcom is playing its brand of basketball Theyve changed nothing about who they are Sarunis with a chance at a threepoint play Theyre running their stuff Theyre not changing anything Theyre continuing to attack Theyre running their concepts Right now Duke isnt communicating Theyre just sluggish But credit list there Don May saw unable to get in front of the basketball there and contacts initiated and you got to be concerned right now if you go sh he I know he doesnt recognize this group of guys in the way theyre playing right now but I think its the turnovers its just so uncharacteristic and its how theyre turning the basketball over thats and Lipkcom as you said capitalizing off the turnovers 13 is the season high in turnovers for Duke And that is number 13 the Lipkcom Bisons This is more than a money game for the fellas from Nashville Theyve got a sevenpoint lead here at Cameron Indoor cutting hard Theyre attacking the rim Theyre putting Duke in rotation And they have to decide do they want to switch And with this lineup and expect a lot of switching Well thats the length of Duke Malik Brown got his hand on it Boozer doubled Hes dangerous but he turns it over 14 turnovers for Duke And Boozer responsible for four of them Theres Sarunes junior from Lithuania by way of high point A threepointer no good by Duncan Battle for the board and a foul against Lipkcom Its on the freshman Aurora his second What happens now when a team all you heard is how much how many threes they shoot defensively Theyre spread out Theyre not guarding the basketball And youve given this team a ton of confidence And now Boozer Cam Boozers been struggling And weve talked about this Were looking for the second consistent score for Duke to emerge Now youre down seven Your star is struggling We had concerns Foul trouble or just a bad game And hes having that right now so far this first half Who steps up for Duke And its a bit shocking given how Boozer had played of late Sar missing the front end of the one and one with Duke in the bonus But theres Brown Clean up aisle three cheering At one point Duke led 10 nothing It has been all lipkum since then and a foul as Sarunas tried to get it to a cutting as see what happens when you start switching everything Theyre so spread out Youve got to communicate You got to talk touch and take And you got to be able to touch If you dont theyll slip the screen like that And thats part of their offense cheering The last foul on Kaden Boozer cheering Here comes Or Ashkenazi Now Duncan over Kaden Boozer Yes We get a whistle Whats the call I think theyre telling the Libcom bench to have a seat Guys are standing up Theyre so into the game And again heres another play Thats really good defense Thats just better offense there by Duncan Hes getting to a spot and elevating shooting the midrange Sar hits the floor Theyll get a foul Its going to be on Sarunis Thats his first eight team foul on Libcom Four of those came before the under 16 timeout Theyre doing so many good things Theyre changing their defense whether its 131 Theyre trapping Theyre really rotating into the passing lanes Its giving Duke a lot of trouble here first half Dame Sar the freshman from Italy who was playing pro ball in Spain at the age of 16 at the free throw line and he gets the front end And Joe when you posed the question to John Sh who could emerge as that secondary option after Camboozer he said Sar is a guy that he felt was on the verge He did He thinks he has a chance to take that next step And I know hes disappointed in the first half but this is the perfect storm for someone like that like Dames Sar to step up and show hes stepping into that role Sar a projected lottery pick by most outlets Heres Esmeraldo Hes orchestrated this offense all night Now Duncan Shot clock down to five Duncan over Evans Locked Kaden Boozer leads THE CHARGE THE LOB TO SAR NO THE TIP in by Brown I think the guards of Duke got to attack the rim more in transition Boiling offline Here comes Sar Evans on the drive Lost it Gumbbo there to clean up yet again Hes got eight Theres no answer cheering on Look at this No one stopping the basketball as Moraldo able to draw the foul on Kaden Boozer And thats two on the freshman When they spread you out like this no one wants to guard the basketball as Duke They are fortunate enough to get the offensive tip in here Theyre getting to the rim Theres no shot blockers there consistently in the paint for Lipkcom And if you just rotating to the rim but this has been the issue in this end of the floor just not guarding the basketball cheering as Moraldo in his last four games 14 points almost nine assists Tonight eight points five assists two turnovers And youve said it a couple of times hes just been in control Hes been the best player on the floor And I know thats not a popular opinion but he has been so far in this first half Hes been the best player on the floor Hes controlled the tempo of this game And though they are man theyre outgunned They dont believe that And theyre playing like it And this is a kid who last year was playing for a division 2 school He theres toughness And again he has all the answers to the test Hes hes played everywhere Hes played in arenas like this Hes not bothered by it and Gumb throws it away Turnover number 15 by Duke Theyre averaging basically a turnover a minute Again the double team comes cheering Patrick GMA catching it way too low in the paint And I think they got to be a little bit more aggressive and turn and face against those double teams Patrick GMA can throw over the top but again theyre just a little off Five out motion is give forcing Duke to communicate Theyre picking their match up and Patrick Gump is going to have a hard time guarding Amenia picks up the foul trying to defend Asmin And that is the seventh team foul on Duke Yeah you dont want to leave as Patrick Gon as Moraldo too many times And Now Dukas with a small lineup now with Cam Boozer at the five coming back in the game Grant Amin a fifth year senior all five years with Lipkcom and prior to this season he had never even averaged five points per game Its been a breakout campaign Hes their leading scorer entering tonight Coach Carl said he thought he was really talented and he was going to follow him Yeah To the D2 range Yeah To Traca and he said Hey you know not so fast I asked him was like How soon did you know youre going to take this job to tell him to slow down Brown finishes down low Hes got eight Continue to get the ball inside and attack Theres no theres no answer for all your struggles Youre only four down here cheering Good ball movement Candelino not there Jimenia the board Boozers pass knocked away Turnover number 16 Lipskum nearly gave it back And were going to get a foul along the baseline and its going to be number two on Nicholas Amenia Anisha I had to rub my eyes to make sure like that Was that another turnover I just saw Theyre going to I mean this is unbelievable to have 16 in the first half That might have been a little bit of a cell job there by Esmeraldo Yeah again hes a veteran guy He forced the officials to blow a whistle Theyre owning the paint on this end of the floor I mean look at that 20 points off turnovers and and thats with four minutes to go in the first half This is unbelievable And its not that they they couldnt play well and and and have a lead Its just the way that theyre doing it Theyre not slowing it down junking up the game Theyre playing with pace Theyre getting in the passing lanes Theyre creating steals and turnovers Theyre doing to Duke what we thought Duke would do to them Look at them flying around cheering Big three and a needed one for Duke Thats Darren Harris Hes part of the returning player contingent for Duke Blue Devils one of three teams in the Power Conferences that did not lose a player to the transfer portal cheering 332 remain in the opening half Its been a stunner to this point over the first 17 minutes here in this first half is shocking Well I think everyone felt that way because again they were the number one defensive team in in the country holding opponents to 34 Theyre not doing that Theyre getting shredded here in the first half Theyre turning the basketball over And again Cam Boozers been dominant and weve been asking for whos the second guy going to be whos going to step up Hes not having a really good first half And were waiting on whos the second guy going to be This is a great test for a young Duke team List was doing a great job of changing defenses and they relied on their defense Their defense is further ahead than than they are in the offensive end of the floor Again risky passes that almost went out of bounds Heres Boozer in the paint using the angles like a Uklid of the basketball court Thats their answer when theyre struggling They got to go to him and hes not played a very strong half but has shown you hes willing to deliver when they need him Entry pass Asmin got behind Boozer Great job lifting everyone up on the weak side Boozer thought he had help and he did not Rebound by Asmin The 42 points by Lipkcom matches the most points Duke has given up in any half this season Florida also at 42 and a half as Moraldo cant follow his miss Heres Foster Great ball movement Harris with his second three Harris has done a great job in limited minutes so far in this first cheering half Hes come in and knocked down two threes Asmin One more Sarunis hits at the other end Tennis Sarunas the junior who transferred in from high point Again it started with the inability to guard the basketball Theyre beating him off the dribble and their spacing is incredible Harris no good Rebound Esmeraldo absorbs a shot from Foster 12 points five assists for Esmeraldo Sarunas Esmeraldo The back door cut Not there Less than 90 seconds to go Fastpaced first half Duke plagued by 16 turnovers Malik Brown off the nice dish from Caleb Foster I think Caleb Fost can do more of that I think he hes been really solid for this group Hes been more than that Hes been really good actually And I think here this team is struggling He has the most experience getting in the paint at his size and skill set cheering 384s teammates like that Theres Moraldo now picked up by Boozer on the switch Candelino with five with three Fades Rebound Boozer Really good defense there I think hell drive it No one stopped the ball Foster a blocking foul called on Asmin and that is his second I think he can do that at will and should do that more in transition Foster coming at you with a head of steam here Youre on your heels backpedaling there You dont initiate the defense until the ACC line You drive and put pressure on the rim draw the foul Rotation and help comes You kick it out to your threepoint shooters We talked about whos the second guy Whos the next guy going to step up and keep going to talk about Caleb Foster He stepped up in big games this year Weve questioned point guard play He stepped up and answered that bell And with his level of experience and amount of starts that he has he capable of being that guy His first two points of the night He was a young man who had a pretty big role as a freshman Took a step back last year lost his starting job cheering Its a great story for him coming back too as well I think its just a major story but so far the story is Lipkcom No good Sonis batted back and Libcom cheering with the rebound About a 6second differential between the clocks cheering Esmeraldo step back No Duke can take the lead Harris accelerates Fouled And if thats Asmin its his third talked about Duke struggling in transition offense I think the last three possessions have been awesome to see if youre a Duke fan Thats three now on Libskums leading scoreer Grant Asmond And he had just picked up his second foul Was that a spot where maybe you get him to the bench this late in the half Well you you thought you were going to have him for the offensive end of the floor and late shot clock You didnt anticipate an early shot Duke takes the lead for the first time since it was 1210 It had been Lipkcom for most of this first half SH is upset Hes like Why are you icing my shooter I finally get a lead and youre icing my shooter One out of two for Harris Gun ball blocked from BEHIND and that will count A dozen for Camp Boozer still fighting here Looking to see if that tip goes in I think its good Charlie Williams may have tipped it in Boozer gets credit but this score has to be a surprise Duke only leading by three and Lipkcom led for most of the first half Taylor Duke its you cant blame it all on your defense when you have that many turnovers You put your defense in behind the eightball Youve given up so many pick six turnovers and now youve got to settle down and come out and guard Charlie Williams ran into Jmenia and they say Jmenia stepped out of bounds You see that action there Anish That that action has given so many problems because as Duke tries to switch theyre slipping that switch and when the ball is in the middle of the floor on the noggin Well interesting from a lineup standpoint and not surprising Lipskum comes out with Grant Asmin in there He picked up three fouls in the first half cheering Hes their leading scoreer and yeah to have any chance in this game you almost have to to ride it out with Asmin Yeah put your chips on the table No reason to save him or leave him in your pocket Youre not going to win this game with him being on the bench You want him to stay aggressive Hes got to go here Shot clock winding down Front rim Offensive rebound Ashkenazi Sarunis Air ball on the three Saved by Ashkanazi cheering Cam Boozer retrieves Here comes Foster down the lane The kick out to Boozer tried to go right at Asmin with the three fouls and turns it over Dare I say Liv is a more physical team in this game I think thats the surprising Moraldo with a show and tell Hes got 14 to lead all scorers Hes been the best player in this game Hes just controlled the tempo Only only reason why listens in this game They cant guard him in penetration Hes gotten wherever he wanted on the dribble and now when it when he runs a ball screen hes just identifying who he wants to attack and hes attacking their frontline guys Here he has Cam Dezi gets the angle and he cuts him off Use the rim for protection so his shot cant get blocked and hes an experienced point guard Hes battle tested He has the D2 toughness with him Played in arenas like this And Ashkenazi picked up his first foul Gunga missed Knocked out of bounds by Duke Asmin meanwhile comes to the bench So they bring in Kennedy Akara He didnt play a whole lot in the first half He picked up two fouls He did And theyre playing without money right now Theres no reason to be upset Theyve weathered the storm Theyre confident now And again another switch with the big as Moraldo needing help Now Charlie Williams Good defense by Jimeia applause and cheering Skip pass to Evans Puts it on the floor and he stepped out of bounds 18 turnovers for the Blue Devils Its like everybodys trying to do something with the basketball I think Evans there just let it go Catch it and shoot it Dont overthink this Were learning a lot about this this new young team Nobody picks up Sarunas Matador defense and Lipkcom takes the lead 4948 And John Sh not happy wants a timeout I get it The students arent out here in full force Maybe not as loud as it normally is but the Lipkcom Bisons came in with upset dancing in their heads got to guard this team from the threepoint line and theyre hugging their men Theyre not helping each other Theyre not scrambling around the defensive end of the floor This is not the team that weve seen all year long and its a its a wakeup call for these young men Foster on the drive Hes finding success taking the ball to the basket Thats a veteran guy and I think part of his maturation as a point guard is knowing when to put his foot on the gas And I think this is a game like this Hes had big moments against some of the big teams I think the point guard concern has been answered but here in a game like this is this may not be Michigan State This may not be Arkansas This may not be Florida but youre in a dog fight And he needs to step up and continue to make plays Ashkenazi driving on Evans Out of control Threepointer by Es Moraldo No loser claims Here comes Harris Back out to Boozer Too strong Foster active hands Boozer down the lane Went right at Ashkanazi Weve talked about that He senses the smaller guy He attacks the smaller guy They should But here it starts with Foster here We talked about that point guard play pushing a button here You dont expect point guards to go to the offensive glass but he is starting to put his imprint on this game And he finds Boozer And again it doesnt matter who you are at that point He gets it 8 ft from the rim You cant do anything but foul Boozer has not had his best game And yet still you look at the numbers 13 points eight rebounds Hes probably going to end up with another double double Cameron came in leading the nation in scoring the ACC preseason player of the year 29 against Florida 35 against Arkansas 1815 and five in the win against Michigan State cheering Charlie Williams over Gumbbo Good defense there by the Duke big man I thought Charlie Williams had the fake dribble handoff Had he attacked the rim I thought he had a chance to layup Foster against Sarunas Catch and release out there for Harris Boozer the put back Missed it Theyre engaging the ball in the defensive end of the floor so flat I mean theyre almost inside the threepoint line As Baraldo cant tie it up Knocked out of bounds cheering by Ashkenazi I think at the point of attack Duke has to engage the ball early You got a live ball coming at you and your heels are inside the threepoint line cheering With a team that spreads you out like this youre just giving them confidence in the in the in the the alleys to drive it to the rim And Shro Randolph Childris Duke opened this game on a 100 run and then Lipkcom countered with a 100 run of its own The Bisons led for most of the first half as Boozer puts that one through And now the steal by Evans Thunder cheering Thatll awaken the sleeper cheering Williams doubled Almost tied up cheering Almost walked May have walked and scored Williams is the all preseason all sun team I mean we talked about Asmin and and how much of a leap hes taken this season but make no mistake Charlie Williams is the guy that is expected to take a a step also Active hands by Ashkenazi We step aside This is the Duke team that we thought because of the option he has And when they look when theyre looking for a bass they can get in trouble They put him in a ball screen in the middle of the floor and its really difficult for you to defend Nothing you can do I dont think you can because you cant switch it If you dont help the guards going to turn the corner And these are talented guards So you got to help And when you do he just throws it up Camboozie gets it at 15 ft from the basket Wheres the help coming from If you help up from the big he throws the lob at the weak side guy here As he sees here the same thing this time with his brother And here comes Boozer Picked up his dribble Kaden Boozer gets the friendly roll Duke with a sevenpoint lead They led 10 nothing at one point That was their largest lead So they came right out that second half right back to that play because it it was just a read for Camboozer at that point Sarunas off Ballads draws the foul on Harris First foul on Harris So has been good Hes had moments here heres ability to concerned about him stretching the floor but hes also put it on the deck What do you do Got the rim draw contact Draws another foul here Tennis Sarunis hails from Konis Lithuania which has been an international hotbed of talent Surus Marcelonus was one of the first international players to really carve out a role in the NBA You saw Sadruna Silgowskis first round pick of the Cavaliers You played with the Hall of Famer the great Arvida Sabonis I did We were in the same I was the same draft class His rookie year was my rookie year in the NBA And this was after two Achilles tears and he was unbelievable player Harris no good Offensive rebound Brown not there applause And its funny because Sabonis the book on him was had the NBA only seen him four or five years earlier He entered the NBA when he was already in his 30s and had a number of injuries I dont think people understand how great of a talent he was Um I think hes one of the reasons why the US had to send our NBA players over the Olympics getting past a guy like that and how dominant he was against our NBA allstars Well you saw Yasakus remember him in the 2000 Olympics He went bananas against Team USA at that 27point game in the semifinal loss And then Dennis Clea who was a first round pick in 05 Denadis Monteunas first round pick in 2011 And now you look at college basketball and there is a burgeoning trend of international import certainly in the ACC making an impact It is And one of you wants them because they come in so young and theyre ready to play right away Asmin back into the game The leading scoreer for Lipkcom hits the three Hes got 14 near his season average Brother to brother Cameron Decaden as Moraldo with the feisty hands Boozer The tip by Brown Harris saves it in the corner New 20 knocked out of bounds Duke ball applause there You saw another middle ball screen trying to get Camboozle the basketball on that short roll And I know coming into the night we were talking about whos the next guy whos going to step up and its been everybody in flashes but I dont know if weve gotten that answer yet Too easy for Cameron Boozer When you got that guy we may never know the answer Hes just that good And theyve beaten four ranked teams without really establishing a robin When teams spread you out like this they put so much pressure on you having to guard the ball Youre accustomed to having help But when they werent so much weak side action and they force you to guard and hug your man on the weak side What Kaden Boozer did you alluded to it earlier Duke in their transition offense early in the game Too much ball movement on the perimeter Now taking it to the painted area Too much east and west passes Getting off the dribble Get to the rim Force pressure If no one stops you just go to the rim like that This is what transition offense should look like No one stopped the basketball Wide pass Get to the rim at that speed as a guard and his size and physicality You wont get a better shot in any offensive possession than that And the awareness to know Im going to Grant Amin whos got three fouls and doesnt want to come out of the game He has to get out of the way Youre trying to draw that four foul on him You kind of get a sense were at a tipping point here for Lipkcom Theyve been hanging around hanging around but now Duke starting to pull away Lipkcom has won five in a row Duke the third ranked team in the country They have won 10 in a row to begin the season Its their best start to a season since the 2017 2018 campaign when Duke began 110 And its not just the win streak its who theyve beaten Theyve beaten Kansas Theyve come off three games against Arkansas Florida Michigan State all ranked at the time of the game Theyve played one of the toughest schedules Boozer has played his best ball against some of those heavyweights He hasnt Thats why I think hes a third of the way in the season Hes the player of the year But I think the concern you for Duke is if youre the rest of the country is this team is nowhere near its ceiling on the offensive end of the floor Theyre still scary It is absolutely scary Theyre looking for that identity on the offensive end of the floor Theyre waiting for guys to step up and theyre winning despite not knowing where the next guy the second leading scoreer the third leading scoreer where theyre going to get their touches from And right now they theyve been tested here Wild shot by Asmin and we get a foul Dumba cant believe it Been really aggressive defensively there trying to overplay that pitch post pass and they get D Sar and hes another one Hes another guy that John Sh feel feels theres more there offensively He felt the same about Jamena They want to get Gumbbo the ball more when hes on offense Saw with those long hands gets the steal and thats over and back Picked up his dribble while straddling the line And you can tell theyre trying to advance the basketball up the floor and I think just be patient and keep your dribble If its not there just play 19 turnovers for Duke six more than their previous season high Asmin doing work down low hes got 16 If youre Kevin Carroll whatever the outcome of this game ends up being you can use this to motivate your team against anybody from here on out You can and you want to save this energy and this tape for your team when youre in March getting ready for conference tournament Ill tell you what if Lipkcom wins the AON again gets back to the NCAA tournament Youre one of the heavy hitters you dont want to play these guys in round one laughter No I mean look at this 20 turnovers here tonight Wow And its been surprising because its sloppy play Some of these turnovers were not forced This isnt a pressing team Its just again perfect storm for Duke Its a little bit of were Duke were number three weve been off for 10 days cheering heavy favorites to win this game Hasb been blocked by Gunbar There comes Harris Duke attacks the paint in transition and the help coming from Boiling but a foul You want to solve your transition offensive problems You do that Put your head down attack the rim force the ref to blow contact This is a great block Patrick Gumbas beat there and theres recovery And Harris gets downhill takes the contact there and goes to the line for two Two high school teammates and PVI in Northern Virginia teaming up here in in Durham That was a loaded high school team at St Paul Yeah it was loaded with multiple division one prospects ACC PM Monday through Thursday from 600 to 7 Eastern And Friday is a special 2hour football focused edition from 5 to 7 hosted by Kelsey Riggs Cuff right here on ACCN and the ESPN app College football playoffs starting this weekend Sarunas by the way just picked up his third foul Nine points for Harris who you know one of those returning players for Duke And in this day and age it used to be cheering how many seniors do you have coming back laughter How many returning starters Now its just how many returning guys period Forget about classification Yeah And I think thats the strength of this Duke team as well having five guys that played last year They dont need transfer guys when you have five rotational guys returning Bigger roles for guys like Foster and Evans I think theyre still trying to figure out their roles as well Boozer the drive and kick Now Kaden Boozer attacks the baseline Evans rims out Offensive rebound Cameron Boozer shuffled his feet Hes turned it over six times tonight Thats the one turnover you dont mind him having but its still one too many This games over with laughter Youre supposed to be my security Hey you got a lot of em enemies in laughter this building too Thats true What was your record against Duke in your career I dont remember Yeah you dont remember I dont remember You were reminded laughter everybody at shoot around Thats only the two coaches Duncan the wild runner Rebound by Pat Gumbo cheering Thats free pass Boozer Hes got 20 Already has 12 rebounds Sixth 20point game of the season Six cheering double doubles on the season Gunga scared off Boil cheering Now Duke starting a play like the team weve seen most of the season Theres no double team coming there And Boozer identified the quick spin baseline there I think somebody blew an assignment I dont think you No one in the country guards a oneonone Hes not used to it No not at all Williams no good Thats what the coaches said They knew Cameron Boozer came in with the accolades His dad Carlos national champion longtime NBA player allar They knew they had a great player coming in Theyve been surprised by how good hes been and they said its been the defense Its been the decision making A lot of what you pointed out tonight passing out of double teams floor awareness spacing you know things that you dont often see from a freshman and you dont often see from a freshman when four of your first top four of your first 10 games are against top 25 teams Credit that guy we just showed on TV Boost credit is that hes seen it all Hes been around it and its sped up his mental preparation for the game I mean he hes hes seen it all and cheering where everyone else is learning these things at the college level He got a crash course at home in high school Into the driveway Foster is fouled Is that going to be three shots Its on Charlie Williams And thats going to be four cheering The foul away from the ball A basket here And Duke would take its largest lead of the game They led 10 nothing And then Lipkcom countered with a big run to take the lead They led for most of the first half Duke closed the first half on a 70 run What weve seen the last few possessions by Duke is what weve seen on film and throughout the year Its just plays like that that are not plays that show up in the staff sheet He catch a hand in the cookie draw just goes up draws the foul Hes just wise beyond his years and hes playing this game like a junior or senior And one of the things John Shy mentioned was how hes been able to hold up against teams like Michigan State Florida teams that are regarded as two of the more physical teams in the country He has and he plays with that level of physicality himself Again this has not been his best game and I I I I wont dare say what his numbers will look like at the end of the night And and were going to consider this his worst game Are you kidding me He said 22 and 12 on an off night Yeah not many people can say that Ill tell you that Largest lead of the evening for Duke But theyre starting to pick it up defensively Theyre starting to guard the basketball Theyre starting to fly around The biggest thing they got to do is contain the dribble talk touch and take on these switches and guard the basketball And they fake ran out of his shoes couldnt finish Kaden Boozer the other way in transition Duke is now controlling the tempo Theyre playing fast and Lipkcom is not in its tempo Sarunas thats off the foot Kick ball Itll stay with Lipsum Boozer again with another another outlet here and and just pushes tempo You dont engage the basketball this far with his size 65 point guard and his physicality Again hes going to get to the rim Sarunas the corner three splashes home Hes got a dozen Saras has been hes just made plays had got a lot of attempts but hes done a little bit of everything Evans catch and release his third triple Hes got 13 Thats pretty He keeps it high Gets it off quick Hes one of those guys you cant help off much You got to stay home on him and force someone else from the perimeter to make shots Hes not shooting it great but he can Nice feed by Es Maldo Thats going to be a goalend Eight assists now for Matteo Esmeraldo here Again not many point guards can do that A lefty pass on a dime Comes off with the left hand Whips it to the corner pocket Evans rewards him with the three ball Evans again Got it 16 for Isaiah Evans I mean sometimes you may want another guy to be the consistent guy in a sense of scoring I I think it just may be Dukes formula Its just a different guy depending on how youre playing us Too much from Boozer Snapped by Asmin If youve got enough guys who could be that guy in a given night that works out Sarunas slips in Boozer and a timeout by Kevin Carroll You talk about Evans age of the hard reset for a lot of teams across college basketball Yes Dukes got new players and they brought in another talented freshman class but its also who theyre bringing back and the volume of quality players they brought back Yeah if Duke is going to win another national championship these five guys are going to be a big part of that And and again you dont need to bring in transfers when you got returning guys is music actually an advantage with the level of experience that these guys have coming back And this is still a relatively young team outside of Caleb Foster whos a junior This is a young group It has a ton of versatility as a starting point guard Foster moves off the ball And I think its a matter of which one of these guys starts to get assertive and aggressive You know we talk about Evans here We hope hes okay steps on someones foot draws the foul And having struggled with the three ball not tonight Knock down four Malik Browns not known as as a scorer but hes in double figures as well He has 11 I mean its been a different guy I think Fosterss had moments where hes been really aggressive and has shown you some things So Asmin just picked up his fourth 16 points for Isaiah Evans sophomore from Fateville North Carolina That one rims out Now one of the things hes done more and weve seen it tonight hes taken the ball to the basket more Last year 81 of his shots were threes This year that number down to 70 Ara missed the bunny and then gets whistled for his fourth foul Duke gets away with one here I think what you saw on this possession is indicative of what happened earlier in tonights game Theres no communication on that back screen and Malik Browns looking at the ball He doesnt see the screen and Kaden Boozer is like Hey man we got what are we doing here Are we switching Well you got to help me One or the other So Charlie Williams Asmin and now Aara all have four fouls Those are now the primary bigs for Kevin Carroll ACC PM Monday through Thursday from 600 music to 700 Eastern And Friday a special 2hour football focused edition from 5 to 7 It is all right here on ACCN We get a foul on his third Mini has not been involved here tonight on the offensive end of the floor Played a pretty good game against Michigan State 10 points nine rebounds He started three in a row now Did sprain that ankle against Florida but again played against Michigan State and hes had 10 days to recover Williams wants it posting up the smaller Foster Brown battling for the board Nearly had it knocked away Here comes Foster Weaves inside Try to bayonet through the defense Follows his shot and its a 17point lead for Duke Eight points for the junior Caleb Foster Anish I think he can do that whenever he wants He gets ahead of steam and you dont engage the ball early you just get in the paint and get to the rim stolen away by Harris applause Id like to see Malik Brown try to finish that a lot I mean I know its unselfish play but hes turning down point blank layups Kaden Boozer no good on the three Plays that that can help your offense Youre talking about a group thats struggling to reach their potential and and take another step on the offensive end of the floor We were hoping to see that tonight We have not yet seen it But some of that is that theyre theyre too unselfish at times Foul on the floor We say that theyre on theyre on the verge of scoring probably 100 points on pace right now So its just scary about how talented this group is right now in a game where theyve had 20 plus turnovers Yes And credit to Lipston This is a difficult team to guard Five out See now theyre forcing Caleb Foster to defend the center on switches because of the fear of their ability to shoot the three Away from the ball Thats Gumba called for the foul Its his second Here comes Duke Harris off the feed from Kaden Boozer Now you look at the score if youre just tuning in It doesnt really tell the story of how close this game was for about a half and 10 minutes Yeah theyre taking quicker shots now Those are not good shots And again not getting back on defense when you take shots like that And its allowing Duke to kind of just pull away with this one 24 for Cameron Boozer The assist from his brother They got a lineup out there now Theyre going to switch five Should be able to guard all their actions They got size on the perimeter that allow their guards to defend the bigs The lifts them inside We saw that early with Caleb Foster cheering They just got to continue to guard the basketball Thats what Dame Sar does so well Pokes it away And thats a shot clock violation cheering Heres the lob Too much Little extra helium Turnover number 22 by Duke Its another unforced turnover there Its a lot easier now when youre up 21 than it was in the first half Yeah Duke began this game on a 100 run and then Lipkcom which looked like it had some early stage fright settled in led for most of the first half and then things slipped away in the final couple of minutes Duke used his 70 run to close the half Duke led at the half Its Lipkcom still battled you know the first seven eight minutes of the second half before Dukes talent just too much and the size Yeah this kids been good as one He was the best player on the floor for quite a bit of time tonight until Cam Boozer put his cape on For a kid who began his career as a walkon at Longwood and then played at Division 2 Traca Nazarene 148 at Cameron Indoor that turns into a fish story for the children one day You know that announcer the great Randolph Childris he said I was the best player on the floor laughter 345 to go in regulation Duke on its way to 11 and0 Should be a fun matchup cheering Has been defended by Sar cheering How do you see the matchup on paper Duke and Texas Tech The one concern you got to have for your Texas Tech right now the last time we saw them they are not completely healthy They only played six players Yeah thats going to be a tough matchup playing this Duke team with six players Kayen Boozer the three You know for Texas Tech too theyre looking for you Talk about the other guys for Duke Theyre looking for their third score leading scorer Theyve kind of been a twoman team right now Lets see if they can figure out some other things but they got to get healthy Theyre just not a complete healthy team right now And thats just theyre not thatll be a tough ass of them Sar no good Duke in the midst of a 130 run Weve watched a good amount of the ACC in person and a lot of preseason hype around NC State They had a tough loss over the weekend Louisville with its threepoint shooting prowess Virginias now in the top 25 and guys like Grunlow Der have injected new life into that program along with Ryan ODM their head coach How do you kind of see the top of the ACC Obviously Duke leads that conversation I think the top of the ACC is is strongest any conference if not the strongest of their top four teams I think Virginia is better than probably the fourth ranked team Duke and Louisville as good as anyone in college basketball When you add Carolina I think that four is as strong as they need to top I think the next five through 10 or 11 is what separate this conference from the years past And I think who whats the next two to three teams get to the tournament They get a foul on Patrick Gungba who elbowed Charlie Williams But on that prior play Gumba with the two points after the block records his first career double double 10 points 10 rebounds tonight Great to see a big man get rewarded there You block the shots He smiles at the bench 11 rebounds And I know mom and dad are watching Theyre proud applause Both former players at GW and George Washington in the city of Washington DC And Im going to give a defensive bit of the floor to his dad and the offense to mom Moms the heck of a player All time leap score there And the previous play is under review for a potential flagger foul All right So theyll take an extra close look at this as mom graduated as you said Gubs alltime leading scorer Spent some time in the WNBA as well And he has the ability to take a step on the offensive end of the floor Its again its just you know you play this game these guys are playing theyre so unselfish They know who the guy is and then theyre trying to so give those guys credit Some nights its going to be Patrick Gump Some nights its going to be Caleb Foster Its going to be Isaiah Evans I think maybe sometimes we say that and and I you like to see some consistency of it I think you you know as a defender sometimes youre taught to initiate the contact to slow the guy down and keep him in front of you So youre trying to put your body into him Does that warrant a flagrant I think it only does if he hits him in the face He catches you in the chest Thats one thing I think GMA may have because of his height You know hes I just dont think Williams was expecting the contact I think he catches him off guard I maybe felt it was a little late in the game for a welcome to Durham Uh I think you Shs leaving guys in the game for a reason You started out playing the game after view the call on the floor stands Common foul Thats the right call I think Williams just was didnt expect it Charlie Williams at the free throw line the lone returning starter from last years Lipkcom team that won the A Sun and made the NCAA tournament for just the second time in school history cheering Meanwhile John Shier 2 minutes and 15 seconds away from becoming the fastest coach to 100 wins in ACC history Thats not bad is it Its not bad at all He still has about 1470 to catch coach Sashevski but fastest to 100 Hes on his way Hes on his way If he can just coach for another 50 years he may have a shot Dame Sar lets it loose Mique Brown pokes it away from Asminia Ethan Duncan 140 left This was a 4845 Duke lead at halftime Sar Silky Duke has more than doubled up Lipkcom since halftime How about the bigs has been to Williams at 611 to 610 Yeah this game is giving coach I think enough ammunition to get the attention of his group here Theyre going to having that stretch Dominar for three Hes got six talking about Duke Blue Devil team having 10 days off with finals and everything and then theyre going to go home for Christmas break I think this gives coach SH enough ammunition to say Hey when you go back from break when you come back be ready to work So even though this ends up as maybe a 30point win John Sh treats this as a loss of practice Absolutely Yes I think theres so much to teach this young group about because the distractions are going to be there Again the list of undefeated teams is starting to dwindle Y and it was what eight coming into tonight and by the time we get through the week you know that number you know what what will that number be When you look at the top teams you look at Arizona you look at Michigan theyre just like Duke in terms of some of the other teams that theyve knocked off ranked teams Arizona now has five ranked wins Yeah Duke has a chance to join them But if they play this way against Texas Tech to start theyll be behind the eightball Yeah the first half Duke plagued by turnovers Much cleaner in the second half And as a result theyve outscored Lipkcom 4925 since halftime Make it 4928 Candelino knocks down a three cheering Tail of two halves Give Lipkcom credit Lipkcom battled but Duke still prevails with a comfortable margin The Blue Devils 11 and 0 They matched their best start since 2017 2018 and John
