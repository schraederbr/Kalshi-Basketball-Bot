And if you go back to a year ago theyve won seven straight ACC home games Carter Welling Vin Allen Luben get us started Darion Williams runs it down Wolfpack starts first And quickly on the attack comes Will Wades team Trey Hollowman draws the start here tonight Three ball from the right is good Darion Williams off and running with his 36th three of the year One thing I love about Copeland already he likes to get downhill and hes already spraying out for a three This is the 11th time Wades gone with this lineup Theyre six and four And theres a three by Justin Porter Well Justin got right back at you Wes And I think both teams understand if they can get to the paint and spray out for wide open threes you have to take them cheering Copeland front court against Jake Wallen the junior transfer from Provo Utah who played for the youths a season ago in the Big 12 Copeland on the drive Got the rim off the glass Thats going to be a tough matchup all afternoon Wes cuz one thing about Copeland he wants to get to that paint Yeah he and Hollowman and Williams try to share the basketball as much as possible Will Wade says we are better when we share the ball Porter another three Oh my Same spot same result Share the ball Miscommunication with NC States half court defense that time And Clemson has fired in two threes They only average eight a ball game Luben Heres Hollowan The Michigan State transfer Williams against RJ Godfrey Baseline too strong Wallen runs down the rebound applause Welling for Porter Now Godfrey who leads them in scoring at 12 a game Hunter trying to reentry to RJ Godfrey Back for Porter fakes the three Step in two Two strong Godfrey the tap follow Thats one thing theyre going to do all day long as crash that board and Gford with the left hand tip in Early threepoint lead for Brad Brownells team Heres Kadier Copelan Started at Syracuse went to McNe State now in Raleigh Williams a kick out three front rim miss Porter runs down the rebound applause I think NC States trying to gear up Clemson a little bit here 3D Well theyre trying to get them to buy into their style of play cuz you know NC State takes a lot of threes And we get a foul Thats McNeel against Carter Welling off the ball Paul McNeels first First on the pack And there is 43yearold Nashville native Will Wade who was a Clemson graduate student manager and then he was a GA here for Oliver Pernell Got his coaching career going and of course now in his 12th season as a head coach with 258 career wins Hunter working against Williams Heres Copeland against Godford RJ lost it on the dribble Porter scoops it up on the drive all the way to the bucket fell off the rim underneath Williams away with it cheering Heres a kick out McNeel shoots and hits Catch and shoot And now weve got Roger with a little uh stoppage of play with Kadir Copelan I think thats a little bit more of an officiating discretion more than anything else Love love great officiating that time A little squirmish going on with the coaching staff It looked like theyre just trying to calm everything down Yep And Roger S wants to pour water on it before the fire starts Exactly So the bucket from McNeel draws us even at eight all Dylan Hunter Heres Wallen A three 18th of the year for Jake Wallen So what did coach Brad talk about earlier That we do it by committing Its not one guy scoring all the points finding the right hand great ball movement wide open shot Copeland will be fouled on the play Free throws coming for the Wolfpack And the foul is going to be on Wallin or Godfrey RJ Godfrey ticketed And of course the Tigers winning as coach is the Evansville native Brad Brownell The dean of the ACC now at 16 seasons Wow Yep Head of the class Copeland free throw is good Kadier is 74 on the year NC State the fifth best free throw shooting team in the ACC at 75 Slightly better than that in conf or slightly less than that I should say in conference play cheering at 725 and Copeland got them both Now remember this morning we watched NC State This is more of a fullcourt slowdown trap Theyre not looking for steals so to speak More so taking Clemson out of their half court offense Tried to lob the ball to Welling that got knocked away Copeland 17 to shoot for the Tigers Yeah great activity by Copeland Early on It just feels like States trying to speed up Clemson offensively especially No question about it And thats what coach Weey talked about When they make shots early thats when their defense is better Wallen to put it in play and going to cash out for Wall or Welling Carter Welling a hard drive and score First bucket for the 611 junior transfer from Utah Valley Yeah strong right hand drive Saw that alleyway went straight to the roof cheering and screaming Williams Heres Hollowman cheering back for Darion Williams to tie And the rebound for Porter applause Abel has come into the ball game during the break a moment ago to spell McNeel Heres a quick look inside

whistle Stuck with it and finished the play Tigers are six of their first eight from the floor and have built a fivepoint lead early Matt Ael the freshman from Baltimore wears three for the Wolfpack And this is Luben with five to shoot Still well out against Carter Welling Shot clock at one Three ball Back rim miss Ael the long rebound Stick back Good Yeah good extra effort by Ael applause Rookies averaging nine in conference play Five minutes gone in this first half Porter another one Spins off Williams a rebound Hack can tie with a three here Next dead ball is going to get these teams

Wolfpack director of ops in 06 and 07 and uh theyre back here for a bit of a homecoming game There was a upgrade of the Hollowman foul as we went to the timeout is upgraded to a flagrant one So Carter Welling is going to get a free throw here Another look at this 3D and Wes I understand Hollerman know you want to hold your ground but for all you young guards out here thats where keeping it real goes wrong You dont need to push the extra elbow Just hold your ground Yep Second one bounces away for Welling And Tigers are going to get the basketball here And with that Nick Davidson whos come off the bench the last now eight ball games but hes had three double figure efforts in the previous seven into the lineup And so is 3D Butter Johnson Butter Johnson my guy Yep Huntsville Alabama can shoot it Same thing with with Davidson Yep And what makes Clemson so good cuz the bigs are so versatile and Ace Buckner number 21 The ACC legacy son of Greg Buckner also on the floor for the first time Five to shoot for Ace 6 minutes in Buckner stepped back at the top off the rim Davidson the rebound and the soft put back for Nick Davidson We talk about pain points Second effort applause So the Tigers got three of a possible four off the flagrant one against Hollowman Here cheering is Copelan Right side for Williams Kick out for Hollowman against Buckner Hollerman a rerackck off the luben screen and an air ball and out of bounds It will belong to the Tigers I thought you closed that door on the way in Let a little air in that door and you close the door Come on Wes Let that air in like that I know shooters dont shoot bricks right No No we dont do that Little backcourt pressure offered here by the Wolfpack too Remember its to slow Clemson down and not let them get into their offense easily Brad Brownell crossed away watching Ace Buckner run the offense Heres Porter against Ael trying to turn the corner and thats going to be on Matt Ael Third on the pack first on the Baltimore freshman There was so much momentum about Will Wade and his arrival in Raleigh They go to Maui Its a fight for three games out there They come back They almost get Kansas and Raleigh in early December And then theyve been you know they were electric against Florida State midweek last week in Tallahassee and then frustratingly lost on Saturday to Georgia Tech and Raleigh Theres Dylan Hunter out of the corner Thatll bounce away and a foul will be ticketed I think on Nick Davidson by Tony Chiaza and thatll be the second on the Tigers Well partner we talked about this morning The biggest thing I appreciated with Wade this morning was his transparency We are who we are Were a jump shooting team If we can make shots early we play better defense If we dont make shots were not a good defensive team Im like a breath of fresh air A coach is playing to his town not trying to force him to play a certain style McNeel back on the floor as Copeland handles it And on the baseline this is Sier And the kick out for McNeel No good Followed up by Luben inside Then on Lubens first basket Yeah great job creating space Easy put back NC State pulls to within two Hunter into traffic Godfrey had it knocked away and Musa the freshman from the Gambia draws his first It is the fourth on NC State in this opening half And Wolfpack will get Terrence Arsenal the Houston transfer into the lineup Hell replace Ven Luben And thats the thing that catches your eye about Wades roster Hes able to kind of dig in nine deep here comfortably Chase Thompson makes his first appearance for Clemson to spell RJ Godford Thompson goodlooking freshman 68 230 lbs from Glennwood Minnesota And Dylan Hunter to set the offense for the Tigers Ace Buckner standing three Bounds away for Copeland and the Wolfpack Eight minutes gone first half Copelan shoots for the lead and has it Kadir Copelan knocks down his second field goal Hes got seven in the first half And the Wolfpack has the lead at 1918 Yeah I love his early focus Wes Hes spraying out for his shooters attacking the paint and knocking down wide open shots and defensively being a presence Buckner on the drive pushed it up with a right hand and in Ace Buckner averaging almost five against the conference on the board Yeah tough The first two shots were tough shooting threes You just come in the ball game Third shot get to the paint knock down the floor Johnson trying to stay in front of Copeland and they throw it away to Ael So timeout on the floor Clemson by one shooting team We make jump shots early Were in ball games And Im not sure you want to get in a sword fight with them in terms of shooting here No No What Im impressed is that how they break down the defense to create those alleyways so guys get uncontested shots Im with you on that Tigers the ball Onepoint lead after the Buckner jumper And heres Davidson at the post out of a double team Got to work around Tried to skip it across and turned over to Abel And then oh my goodness Dylan Hunter took it back And now the Wolfpack gets it That was Sier that came up with it They had three scrums that produced two turnovers one for each school screaming And on the scoop and score that is Matt Able That was nice with the left hand soft off the glass Yep So NC State back in front at 2120 Heres Buckner Sier defending Arsenal holding on for dear life with Davidson inside And there goes Dylan Hunter to the basket He got hammered and fouled applause Thatll get Hunter a couple of free throws but lets go back to the uh change of possessions here a moment ago Yeah good scrap for the

largest lead Wolfpack by five Dylan Hunter with RJ Godfrey Justin Porter Jake Wall Carter Welling on the catch Double team there quickly Skip it for Wall Three ball too strong Welling had the rebound

put it in play Hes got Buckner Chase Hunter or Dylan Hunter I knew I was going to do that before Justin Porter RJ Godfrey on the floor here for the final 75 seconds Oh LOOK AT WELLING DOWN THE LANE Went for the hammer Well you said something what needs to happen Well that needs to happen I dont know I dont know why 62 Trey Hollowman thought it was a good idea to go big game hunting with Carter Welling but Well that was going to be the other way around That was going to be little game hunting Hollerman jumping at that He did stop the dunk Welling will get a couple of free throws and the first one rattles out Hes had five double figure games in his last eight He is number six in the ACC in defensive rebounds per game in conference Play at almost six The work Thats called the work right there He played 100 a year ago He played at Utah Valley and averaged 13 points and six rebounds Shot 48 from the floor but he was the wack defensive player of the year I can see why The couple games Ive had so far I can see why Yeah he makes his presence felt in the paint Four of six at the line Welling Tigers trail eight now with 70 seconds to go lead for Luben and hell challenge and score Eight for Vin Allen Luben in this first frame ahead Wallen trying to get to the basket They skip it for Welling CARTER W WOW WELLING What was said through that last timeout Because the last two

switched one through five in the first half And theres another turnover to start the second half on Clemson And then a foul ensued with Carter Welling Well to your part point partner I was a little nervous about that because NC State doesnt have a lot of size but theyre playing with the right physicality right now thats actually working Yeah And to the point even though theyre outrebounded by five they were plus four in the turnover margin Sometimes those two categories work themselves back together Heres Hollowan attacking Williams we told you a moment ago not been scared to shoot Godfrey raked it out of there Tony Chiaza is going to call a foul on RJ Godfrey Not sure Brad Brownells a fan but its the second on Godfrey First or second of the half on Clemson Get a better angle from the baseline Oh it looked pretty clean That looked pretty clean Lets maybe maybe Brad want to save it for later in the game Yeah thats right Right But it has a feeling it could be like that down the stretch Williams a 78 free throw shooter NC State just two of three in the first half and that one good Those three free throws by the way belong to Copeland Nine for Williams now Transfer from Texas Tech start his career at Nevada And the second one cleanly through averaged 15 points shot 45 from the floor 42 from three for the Red Raiders Hunter takes Williams into traffic Dylan got trapped

This crowds ready to get going again like he did the last three minutes of the half Yeah Cut it to four 4238 Copeland the scoop Wall takes it off the glass Heres Hunter Thought about it And almost two minutes into the second half Clemson gears down a little bit Hunter away for Welling Copeland defending Quick pass Godfrey the catch and dunk Third field goal for RJ Godfrey Yeah that was a grown man dunk He took the opponent up in the rim with him He qualifies as a grown man Yes he does Tigers to within two Luben with a right hand Got the roll Come on Luben I know its a jump shooting team but sometimes you got to feed the big fell away Hes playing down low Yep Heres the lead for Hunt or Porter rather And now Welling This game is four points and feels like its one with 90 seconds left Luben is a perfect six of six on the floor 3D man hes bowling Heres Porter with 10 to shoot Kick for Hunter Three now The Wolfpack with Claudier Copelan Quick entry pass Heres Luben going for seven for seven Nope Left it on the rim Still like the move though Let the big fella touch Let him eat a little bit rebound and playing good interior defense Yeah got a little offensive incentive tonight Does

years at Syracuse and then one year at McNe State and the Cowboys went to the NCAA tournament and eliminated Clemson obviously in the first round a season ago So he is ACCC legend Cuadier Copelan Yes he and Vin Vin Allen Luben this is in the new world This is his third ACC school and he took a sbatical to Vanderbilt two years ago before reemerging at Carolina and now finishing his college eligibility at uh at NC State Back to a sixpoint Wolfpack lead Buckner reentry for Godfrey quickly Porter a three Got it 3D It comes out of his hand Nice Nice and clean But what I like about Goffrey being patient waiting to see what the defense is going to do Swing swing knock it down Threepoint game again after Porters third triple of the night And a long three to answer No good Luben the rebound against Godfrey Forced it back up They cash out inside And last touch by the Wolfpack says Tommy Morrison Time out 1545 to go Justin Porter to work and they are 0 for one behind the threepoint line Two for six total Clemson has two of their four field goals or threes here in the second half One for Porter one for Hunter and Buckner whos got Johnson And that ball got deflected away And here is Copeland in transition Got lubing the ball and he left it short on the foul against the UAB transfer Butter Johnson Well for all you young big men at home Luben did an excellent job with the switch but high hands active hands You get the deflection Another turnover for Clemson Yep Tigers have been forced into giveaways NC State has carried their offensive incentive to a defensive aggression that has worked here tonight And thats the whole point about look the high hands deflection You get out and run get to the free throw line And we say it again jump shooting team They make shots for sharing the ball Lubens been effective in the paint 13 points for Vin Allen Make it 14 And he pushes it now to a fivepoint advantage again where it was at the break NC State comes in Theyre two and0 on the road in the ACC after a miserable existence a season ago where they did not win an ACC road game lost all 10 of them when the league was playing 20 conference games here tonight trying to add a third

24 NBA drafts and ultimately withdrew his name Wow and he is technically a freshman playing basketball here at the collegiate level in the United States And now Roger is talking to Will Wade about something And I think were going to find out Clock malfunction A little clock issue perhaps at the table The previous play is being appealed by NC State Oh the last foul saying Sier went straight up Okay so appeal by NC Its actually a challenge by NC State I guess we will uh go to break music Fivepoint lead for Will White after review The appeal by NC State is unsuccessful They will be charged a 30cond timeout cheering All right So Tommy Marcy coming over here to tell us original was on three red right Hes just trying to get him off a basketball play If anything you could have called a double foul Got it So they were appealing the foul or challenging the foul Buckners going to get the and one Ace Buckner now three of three at the free throw line Three and a half 10 in the game Third double figure in his last nine And were down to a fourpoint game Were halfway through the second half and now a foul is RJ Godfrey I think his third So look at this one more time and the foul This is the challenge is on Matt Ael and Carter Welling It has nothing to do with the Buckner foul that was called on Son Great cleanup by the referee Yeah Matt Able Carter Welling off the ball We were we were going to break thinking it was on the play with the ball It was not He was on a foul in the middle between Welling and Able Got to be careful when you say that laughter cuz some may say Willing and Able No Welling and Able Hollow with the shot clock winding down missing the three And Godfrey to run out and RJ with Hollowan to beat lays it up and draws the foul So free throws coming for RJ Godfrey on Trey Hollowmans third Third against the Wolfpack here in the second half So we were looking at the wrong thing Six fouls on Clemson three on NC State here in this second half Godfrey at the line First of the two is no good Dont forget coming up next well send you to Winston Salem Joel Coliseum for more ACC basketball presented by T Rose Price SMU 135 Wake Forest 11 and seven Both are two and three in the league Big for a lot of reasons with Anise Shro and Terence Oglesby tonight in Winston Second one is good for Godfrey Hes got seven What a fascinating game this has turned into Which team now can execute down the stretch down the half court offense Yep Able at the top Drive hard to the basket and lost it over the inline out of bounds Rookie just turned it over trying to create an edge Six turnovers for the Wolf Pop Well I like the fact that Abel was trying to be aggressive that time The physicality knocked him off his base Thats why the ball went out of bounds So an NC States going to go to a 221 here it looks like at least show one and then fall off Yep Little match up Manto man full court Yep Hunter with Godfrey Here is Porter whos been really good Back door cut for Godfrey Wasnt ready Finally got it Poked away by Williams Good hand And here comes Cuadier Copeland into the ball game for NC State and hes going to replace the rookie Matt Ael 9002 to go Inbound for Godfrey Buckner for Welling Double team there and a foul And its on Guadier Copel his third four on Will Wades Wolfpack Well I think someone on that coaching staff for Clemson said Can we get Welling going He was the one that got the momentum going there at the end of the first half Lets get him going back to the basket maybe Welling And now Hunter Skip for Godfrey against McNeel Rolls to the basket and scores Nine for RJ God You have to punish NC State if they continue to switch the way they switching That time he had McNeil on and took his time finish the play Copeland Clemson to within one and Copeland trying to take the incentive Heres McNeel in the corner Darren Williams baseline layup Good Excellent half court offense Didnt force anything There was a switch Copen thought about

Buckner lost it Another turnover on the Tigers Heres Hollowman with Hunter And its blocked And a foul is called And I believe this is Dylan Hunter Well see what Tommy Moresy sorts out Its on Ace Buckner If we show that last defense possession again for NC State Luben once again Im not crazy about switching all the time but most times with Luben switching Look at this switch West moves his feet McNeel sticks his hand in there All night long theyve been switching with a purpose Heres Hollivan Hes 83 at the line First trip tonight 33 of 40 Heres the Michigan State transfer this year at

Now lets see if Brad Brown now Dylan Hunter Fourth on Dylan Hunter Its the eighth on Clemson Its the come down If we show a different angle the original wall up West if you look closely I thought he

State is living at the line now 10 of 11 in the second half And thats impressive known to a jump shooting team Theyre still attacking cheering the paint attacking the rim Copeland got them both All
