Thats something coach Bronnell wants to see continue Yeah the Clemson defense has been outstanding but their ball care has been even better Only nine turnovers through the first two games Off we go as possession in favor of the Tigers wearing their beautiful classic white unis Love those Yeah really nice job there on that tip by Morehead State planning that Clemson would win it They ran a guy long unable to get it though Porter misses the first attempt Offensive rebound pulled down Hunter moves it Davidsons first touch on the block Sees two kicks it Three on the way Indeed Wallen drills the first three of the night One of the best things that Nick Davidson does when he catches the ball in the post He always takes his time Hes got his eyes up sees that defender rotate down able to hit Jake Wallen for the early three Starting five for the Eagles Three and were going to talk a lot about him as he penetrates to the hole Theres Marshall His first three off the mark and a rebound pulled down by Cunningham Its going to be important for the Eagles to rebound well here Yeah it really will Clemson is much bigger than Morehead State And during this threegame road stretch the Eagles have struggled on the glass Cunningham drills the nail jumper in the first two of the game for the Eagles Heres the start of five for Clemson We saw Davidson inside We spotlighted him off the top and Hunter such an important piece to this Clemson offense What he brings to the table is controlling the basketball but theyre going to look for a little bit more scoring out of him this year Yeah and Dylan Hunter off to a little bit of a slow start so far this season but does so many different things cheering uh some intangibles that help the Tigers be successful Want it on the block Its Hunter at the nail Wallen for three from the corner Rattles it home applause And already two offensive rebounds for the Clemson Tigers late leading to two Jake Wallen threes Great start for Clemson early on Threepoint shooting going to be such a weapon for this Tiger offense this season Foul away from the basketball and its going to be on Porter The first T foul of the game Heres coach Jonathan Maddox His second season here for Morehead State Formerly an assistant with Murray State We talked to him before the game team Hes pretty optimistic about what his team has to offer this season Yeah Jonathan Maddox has done a great job He was an assistant at Morehead State for nine years left for two headed over to Murray State and then came back home to lead the Eagles applause and cheering Coach Maddox will do a really nice job up in Morehead Kentucky applause I had a chance to go watch Morehead State practice yesterday They played at the University of Georgia on Sunday Uh watched his team practice in Athens Georgia yesterday really impressed with just his staff and the way that they ran practice the way that they executed things They did a really nice job Coach Maddox emphasizing that he wants to be able to close the first half strong here against Clemson They werent able to do that against Georgia in their loss on Sunday night Wallen off the mark An offensive rebound by Davidson WALLEN WILL TRY AGAIN And another offensive rebound inside that time Godfrey cheering bucket in the foul Send to the line for one more Already four offensive rebounds for the Clemson Tigers RJ Godfrey active on the glass able to pull down that offensive rebound Godfrey does a really nice job Hes developed as more of a scorer as his career has gone along Hes always been a really good athlete Able to get to his left shoulder right there and score it with that jump hook Hell head to the free throw line One of the things about Godfrey that television doesnt do justice is just how big he is Listed at 67 but he looks like hes 69 out there with his size Comes from a really athletic family His dad Randall was a longtime NFL player with the Dallas Cowboys Brother plays Kentucky at football Uh sister is a high level track athlete in Georgia So a really athletic family applause Arey TR on the free throw Clemson a sevenpoint lead And this is something that youll see music from Clemson all night Theyre going to pick up 94 ft Brad Renell Theyll keep rotating those guards through Keep that pressure on Josiah Lree and the Morehead State offense Cunningham Good step back Had Davidson off balance and he drills it DaVon Cunningham is a transfer from USC Aken scored five points on Sunday against the Georgia Bulldogs Really dynamic score Twoman game Hunter Davidson has a little on him but cant feed it to him Its Godfrey kicks out Hunter for three off the mark and Cunningham comes away with it and then couldnt stick the fork in the dribble Gave it away and the foul is going to be called on Cunningham So heres the winningest coach in Clemson history Brad Bronnell One win away from 295 Most in program history As you see there hes able to get his team to the tournament Wants to do that again this year The longest tenure coach in the ACC with a brand new contract that could keep him here till 2031 Yeah Brad Brownell the owner of 10 Clemson alltime records looking to get to the NCAA tournament for a third straight year this year Godfrey top of the key Hunter the ball fake now drives Kicks Wallen turned down the three that time Porter inside Good move to the basket that time by Porter applause So youre seeing the Clemson offense trying to be a little more patient these last two possessions Theyve already taken six threes Morehead State has struggled to guard in the paint Clemson able to attack the ball attack the rim on the dribble right there So RJ Godfrey has been imposing his will to start this one The senior from Swany Georgia music RJ Godfrey one of the best in the ACC on the glass cleans up right here as well Jay Lucas and Miami Well talk more about that at the half right now 11 to five your score Lets see what the Eagles are able to run out of the break Brie had to toss it up with the shot clock expiring and rebound plucked out of the sky that time by Jake Wall who was knocked down two triples Porter joins the three party Yeah thats really important for Clemson this year Justine Porter made uh 84 threes last year at Middle Tennessee State They need him to shoot the ball well this season Three threes in the game so far for the Clemson Tigers Eight in their win against Gardenner Webb on Friday Lree tried to respond Another rebound for WallE Wallen Heres Porter on the 45 Godfrey was calling for it Wallen rejects the screen attacking the rim Tough finish Thats a great ball screen refusal right there by Jake Wallen I think one of the things hes done well early in this season is hes shown hes not just a catch and shoot guy Really nice job right there getting in that side ball screen refusing it to his left Jake Wallen refusing it to his left Were talking about Josiah Lere right there on the baseline Coach Maddox and the staff want him to see that drive coming and be ready to rotate over They wanted to force Jake Wallen into that ball screen uh allowed him to refuse it to his left and then didnt have a baseline rotation turned into a layup Points in the paint have been really important to Morhead State Theyve got to do a better job guarding down low Agree right now on the bench getting a talking to from coach Maddox probably discussing just that Skyhook attempt not good and a foul is going to be called on Rifford and thats his first He was in foul trouble against Wake Played very limitedly in just eight minutes of play on uh in Sundays game against Georgia Yeah Tamari Weller is such an important piece for Morehead State because hes really their only true strong low post player He got into foul trouble as you mentioned on Sunday Really made it hard defensively for the Eagles Davidson slips inside Rejection inside there by Rford who stepped up nicely Veterans interior defense that time for the Eagles Well the Eagles have traveled a lot here to start the season Sunday Theyll finish the road trip tonight and then theyll head back home tomorrow before they get ready for Kentucky Christian at home next week Road trips are always a good way to bond as a team early in the season especially when you have so many new faces Maloos shot not there Rebound pulled down by Johnson Foster top the key wide open underneath is Thompson who hammers it home Yeah thats a really tough transition possession for Morehead State They were trying to get back into the zone Unable to get matched up and Chase Thompson gets the dunk at the rim Cunningham looking to turn the corner Picked up his dribble in a dead area Maluke back to the basket Cook again that time way short cheering Ace Buckner dribbles back the other way Wellen Buckner moves it Three on the way Foster cant hit Cuttingham skying for that rebound You see Clemson get out in transition on the missed shot right there Uh really good ball movement just unable to knock it down from three You do it We talked about Clemson in transition able to get out and run Ball gets reversed Great pass by the sensational freshman Zack Foster to Chase Thompson at the rim Zack Foster the highest rated recruit at Clemson since PJ Hall Really great pass right there Hes gotten off to a slow start shooting the basketball from three this year but his ability to play in transition is really important this year Yeah he was 0 for five on Friday against Gardenner Webb but its early in the season Theyre expecting that shot to fall for him He moves really well for his size Yeah hes smooth He doesnt run He glides down the floor Really talented freshman And hes joined on the floor now by Ace Buckner the red shirt freshman from Clemson Leading scorer right now after uh two games is off to a great start as well Buckner number 21 and one Thompson kissing it off the window applause Thats an outstanding basketball play by the freshman out of Minnesota Caught the basketball kept it high able to get to his left shoulder showed that nice touch off the glass Thats an outstanding move at the rim Led Alexander Area High School to their first state title and average almost 20 points per game as a high schooler That shot way off the mark Foster couldnt corral Stay here 20 seconds to shoot for the Eagles So Morehead State has hit a little bit of a drought You know they made those first two field goals early on One of the things that Jonathan Maddox talked about hed like to see more assists more ball movement Morehead State has now missed their last six field goals in a row Havent scored in nearly 5 minutes Its an 110 run for the Tigers Cunningham trying to put an end to it Foul line jump shot Cant get it to go Hell try again And a foul is called underneath Well Clemson right now with a big lead 15point advantage offensively They want to see Heres a picture of that Jamie Yes So Clemson music coming off of 25 assists just the other night already with five Morehead State is in a zone here Zack Fosters going to get this wing catch and immediately on that redirect pass We call that a hockey assist in basketball Just able to catch it Already saw that Chase Thompson was going to be open immediately directing it Super talented freshman Not just a really good scoreer but an outstanding passer as well Foster going to be a big part of this Clemson team as they expect to go about 10 deep 11 deep at times throughout the entire season Often times coaches start off the year like that But coach Bronnell wants that to be the case come March and hope that they have a little bit more gas in the tank than they did a season ago Yeah And I think so much of it these guards are able to pressure the basketball So he wants to continue to roll them through there uh continue to maintain music that ball pressure Uh being able to play different guys is a big part of that Johnson on the float in and out and then touch it last will go the other way All right for the Eagles right now they havent been able to find really anything offensively Theyre on the wrong end of an 110 run and their starting point guard Mia Lgree on the bench right now Wheres the offense come from Coach Maddox Yeah So it starts with the guy with the ball right now Craig Dawson the sophomore transfer from Mount Olive one of the leading scorers in all of Division 2 basketball cheering Outstanding Yeah Got a great pass just unable to finish Well came up with a rejection and then he picked up the offensive foul on the other end So Carter Welling last year was the defensive player of the year in the WAC Conference You see why right here 57 blocks last season at Utah Valley State Able to use his length with the rejection at the rim Great job rotating over That type of block will have the Eagles thinking twice about going up weak in the paint Number 22 is around And thats one of the best offensive possessions Morehead State had in a while They had really good ball movement able to get the ball inside just unable to finish Clayton Parker that time going glass a 10 in the loss against Georgia on Sunday and finally breaking the ice on that side of the net Johnson from the 45 for three Big shot there by Budda Johnson Another one of those transfers for Brad Brownell Shot the ball really well 49 made threes last year at UAB They want to try to continue to help him find a rhythm this season cheering Dawson watched by Buckner Buckner has had good couple of possessions defensively strong in terms of containing Dawson on the bounce That time forced him into tough shot One and done for the Eagles Heres Buckner on the offensive end Off the mark on the three Carol grabs the board past the halfway point of this first half cheering The hockey line change going to come Clemsons way as five new players will check into the game the next whistle So the Morehead State offense theyre going to run a lot of set plays just like right there They came out of an ivor Iverson screen action just unable to get a lot of ball movement A lot of side to side right now Clemsons length is really bothering them Bner counted in the foul applause Ace Buckner has had tremendous starts this season Hes going to look to continue it at the line with one more free throw Yeah the red shirt freshman has done a great job in transition particularly off of a missed shot Head coach Brad Brenell was telling us even before the game that was probably the thing he was most pleased with from this past uh Friday night against Gardenner Webb was their ability to execute in transition after a miss You saw it right there Had 11 points in the win on Friday against Gardenner Webb Played in just 60 minutes Efficient as coach Bronnell looks to go deep into his bench Buckner will get the hand after completing the oldfashioned threepoint play And this is exactly what you just talked about Five new players coming in for Clemson Josiah Lere back in for Morehead State Clemson stays with that fullcourt mantoman pressure agree on the handoff Cuttingham looking to turn the quarter Thats Lri on the 45 10 to shoot Draws two Skip pass Parker for three Way off Good rebound inside Relford Kamar Rifer really gives Morehead State an element down low to be able to offensive rebound to finish Great job on that uh offensive rebound and finishing it at the rim RJ Godfrey back into the game as is Hunter So Morehead State spent a lot of time on this zone defense yesterday in practice Theyre going to pack this in try to get out the shooters just like they did right there in contest but they want to keep Clemson out of the paint Count that one as a victory for the Eagles deep See if they can turn it into points Agree standing on the load Gets a set called out from his head coach Maddox Twoman game Lgree and Rifford Cunningham with five to shoot Cuttingham step back Tough shot Cant get it to drop And Davidson sticks a fork in it Yeah and thats another one of those shots Thats an unassisted field goal Those are the hard ones that Clemsons forcing Morehead State into right now Foul away from the basketball and looks like its on Mcgre It is So heres some good offense for the Eagles Yeah it started with Josiah Thats a great baseline skip pass right there over to Clayton Parker the freshman as you said 10 points against Georgia on Sunday Really talented young player from Missouri Porters three off the mark and Reford starting to impose his presence inside Picking up some rebounds here Got the switch Rifford down low Davidson defending and Relford couldnt get it to drop cheering Tigers looking to run here Wallen Porter trail three for Davidson Cant get that to drop And Parker with a strong block out 269 your score here in the first half with 731 remaining Tigers are built Um you know you just you see guys smiling enjoying themselves happy to play college basketball And the other part of it when you talk to NBA scouts cheering is whenever players come out of Clemson they know that theyve been coached One of the things that stood out to me last year watching PJ Hall two years ago Chase Hunter last year those guys wanted to be coached in practice Uh Brad Reynold does that but at the end of the day they know that he cares about cheering them and uh helps get the best out of them time family environment You could feel that the minute you walk into this gym and see the players interact with the staff George Marshall able to knock down those two free throws Maybe that gets him going He had he was 0 for four from the floor beforehand You saw in the graphic there 26 big points against Wake Force He can fill it up Sometimes the score just needs to see it go through the hoop No youre right And the other part about it too it allowed Morehead to get into that threearter court 221 Theyre not necessarily trying to steal the basketball Theyre just trying to slow Clemson down a little bit and then get into their zone I got off the turnovers Thomas walked under three to play here in this first half Coach Maddox emphasizing closing the half strong He has an opportunity to do that here Try and close the gap and give his team a chance Its all hes hoping for in that second half Yeah it was something that he did not feel like they did well on Sunday at Georgia made a big emphasis of it this week of just trying to finish well take care of the basketball have productive possessions able to do that just before with those two free throws Got a defensive stop but then that foul right there led to the charge Had that high post elbow entry slid over to the illegal screen right there by Anoir Mullock Hell hit the bench as Parker replaces him Thompson banging down low Left it short Godfrey had a hand on it but couldnt corral and Carol vacuumed it in Davidson using the Carol screen Cunningham use it quickly Marshall in and out Balls going to stay here as Foster lost it Well coming up at the halftime break Carlin J here Thats us Well look around the ACC and well have our first half recap complete with some stats and of course plenty of highlights Thats coming up on the halftime report here on the ACC Network Really important possession for both teams right here Both Morehead State and Clemson are in the bonus Its a tough play without fouling but able to get to the rim right there and score the basketball And Carol able to sweep through the lane and his first two of the night Triple knockdown that time by Thomas His first three The red shirt freshman Dallas Thomas really really talented young player Made his first three of the season this past Friday night against Gardenner Web Able to knock down that three Ball went inside in the zone Able to kick it back out and he knocked it down Davidson draws Davidson Heres Marshall Five to shoot cheering Marshall spinning in the lane Got it off to Davidson for three and he knocks it down That shot was able to be created off that dribble penetration Nick Davidson had switched on to the guard Unable to keep him in front drove the basketball forced the help kicked it out for the open three Thats a thats a really good possession for Morhead State Theyve had a couple of really nice ones coming out of that last media timeout Buckner was hacked to a little line for two So RJ Godfrey caught it in the high post against the zone Able to kick it out to Dallas Thomas on the other side and knocked down the three But then on the other head from other end from Morehead State George Marshall really nice job Drove the basketball down inside Kicked it out for three Morehead State has started to find a little bit of a rhythm offensively now They spoke now up to five points make it six as hes able to get it to Georgia Tech at taking on BC And of course well end the day with Virginia Tech taking on Florida State at 730 Eastern All three games available on the allnew ESPN app RJ Godfrey now up to eight rebounds in the first half tonight Got inside right there on that missed free throw And again we talked about it Morehead State already in the bonus Its going to allow Clemson to get back to the free throw line applause Reenters the game here for the last 68 seconds And with Godfrey and Davidson in the game Clemson does something that not many college teams do anymore and thats play two bigs Yeah the high low part of the offense has been a huge piece for Clemson over the last couple of years The thing that they do really well is their postto post passing You havent seen as much of it so far tonight because of the zone from Morehead State but their bigs do an outstanding job passing the ball post to post Its good defense that time by Davidson sticking with the smaller guard and Dawson cheering Cunningham down low Parker takes his time Had it poked Dawson as a shot clock expires Cant get it to drop Parker fighting for the rebound inside and he gets cheering hit and hell go to the line Clayton Parker has worked hard for Morehead State down low Yeah Clayton Parker now with five rebounds in the first half We talked about it earlier the freshman from Missouri coming off of his first double digit scoring outing Sunday against Georgia Really aggressive plays hard down low cheering Its given Jonathan Maddox some good minutes Sure has 10 points eight rebounds in 24 minutes against Georgia on Sunday Career scoring leader for McGomery County High School in Montgomery City Missouri cheering cheering Cant get that one to fall Clemson could hold for the final look here in the first half as Foster crosses the timeline Once again Clemson staring at that zone defense Davidson steps out Theres the high low Godfrey underneath Good up fake Unable to finish the first time Tried to second Cant get it to drop And with 6 seconds to play its Marshall cheering in the front court Marshall ripped by Godfrey and Buckner did not get it off in time to get it to drop A 19point advantage for Clemson Yeah the Clemson Tigers eight assists already so far in this half All well in that first half Lob averages says start to see the ball fall through the hoop a little bit more going forward Cunningham with the steal Good hesitation dribble as he got to the rack So Clemson immediately tried to get to a high low action Uh ball turned over Nick Davidson on an Aaron pass Credit Devon Cunningham Got out in transition able to finish at the rim Great start to the second half for Morehead State First player in double figures for the Eagles Now has 10 Godfrey down low chiseling his way to the basket RJ Godfrey able to continue to get to that left shoulder Hes really effective when he can use his athleticism get up elevate above the rim and score with his right hand jumper Marshall has been quiet So has Lere See if the Eagles can get them going here in the second half Lgree on the handoff 10 to shoot as Davidson on it Grieve got Davidson in the air Nice move Floats it home And Morehead State has really found a a rhythm offensively The last eight minutes of the first half these first couple of possessions so far in the second half Head coach Brad Brunell wants to see the Tigers be able to get some stops on the defensive end Feels like theyre settling into this basketball game Corner three from Porter Not there And Cunningham with the flat footed rebound Lree cheering touches the paint Kicks it back out Cunningham top of the key Lost control of the rock Got it back Good back door cut by Marshall whos fouled And hell go to the line And Godfrey almost picking up a technical foul after pounding the ball on the floor Well defense has turned into offense for the Eagles here to start the half Yeah great job in the post right there by uh George Marshall Just had his hands up able to get a deflection at least the transition Really good job to start the second half by Morehead STATE RIGHT HERE Finding a little bit of a rhythm on both ends of the floor George Marshall had 26 against Wake on Friday 17 on Sunday Thats just his third point of the night All of them coming at the free throw line Well heres next Sunday afternoons ACC womens basketball double header at three Georgia Tech hosts Jacksonville and then Florida State will host Indiana in Tallahassee Both games available on the allnew ESPN app Morehead State on a 62 run to open the second half Theyve been manto man as well Yeah had been zone primarily in the first half Have gone man to start the second half Davidson chiseling his way inside Cant get it to drop Falls his own and he got hit that time by Carol Davidson will earn a trip to the line Carlin we talked about points in the paint at halftime Clemson with only 1252 this past Friday night against Gardenner Web So youve seen the emphasis as theyve started the second half trying to get the ball down low to Nick Davidson RJ Godfrey and scored at the rim Davidson Davidson averaged just under 16 points per game and six and a half boards at Nevada last season And hes a guy that is really trouble for opposing teams as he can get the ball inside and also stretch the floor with the shooting ability Yeah Nick Davidson really dynamic transfer from Nevada Can score the basketball down low but also an outstanding shooter from three The other thing that he does really well is his ability to pass Thats something that the Clemson staff really emphasizes when theyre evaluating players whether it be out of high school whether it be a transfer They want those bigs that can play at the top of the key and pass the basketball Average just under three assists last season with the best picked the basketball up in a dangerous area and then gave it away Heres Hunter attacking Rejected Ball up for grabs And good hustle there by the Eagles Theyre playing with a little bit more pep here to start the half cheering McCree has the mismatch on Davidson You mentioned Davidson could guard on the perimeter Thats why the coaching staff likes him Relford inside and one Really nice job there by Morehead State They wanted to look in early offense Could they have an opportunity to go score but didnt have anything able to pull it out But right here this was a point of emphasis yesterday in Morehead States practice They spent 10 minutes working on walling up in the lane and not fouling But really good job there by Tamari Rford coming off of that cross screen action catching music it down low and drawing that foul on RJ Gothy Relford had just six points and four boards in eight minutes in the loss against Georgia He only played those eight minutes cuz he was in foul trouble Has played a lot more here tonight 19 minutes on the floor excuse me 9 minutes on the floor but hasnt been able to really impact the game It be good to see him go some touches inside if youre the Eagles A foul called Its on the floor Itll be Tiger basketball on the baseline But theres such a difference from Morehead State particularly offensively when Tamari Refords on the floor because hes able to go post up right there use his body use his positioning hasnt scored it maybe quite as much as coach Maddox would like but has drawn some fouls in the post as well Tyion Frell unavailable in this one as he is dealing with a toe injury Wall sticks a three He started the game with two triples Thats his third I would expect Clemson to try to extend this pressure a little bit now Get up pressure the basketball try to get Morehead State out of the rhythm that theyre in offensively Theyre pretty comfortable on the offensive end cheering Parker looking for Rifford Cunningham step back Thought he got hit No whistle ball up for grabs and last touch by the Eagles Diving that time You see just the intensity ratchet up a little bit for the Eagles here to start this half and thats not a good sign right now for the Tigers as Buckner laid out grabbing at his lower body Yeah Ace Buckner coming up injured at the end of that play grabbing at his calf heads to the bench and freshman Zack Foster will check in for him Just a cramp as hes over there on the bench being attended to Foster Hunter Welling top of the key Good show and go by Welling and he got fouled Hell earn a trip to the line applause Carter Willing has probably been the most surprised uh transfer so far for uh for the Tigers Great job right there faking that hand off able to get downhill to the rim and draw that foul But a really nice job in that fake handoff action So Welling had 14 points in the win against Gardenner Webb on Friday 11 boards in just 15 minutes of play Heres applause a look at Buckner Yeah you see him on the ball guarding guarding right here moving his feet able to get a deflection as he went into that pullup just when he planted that foot just uh right leg locked up Mhm You hope that thats just a cramp applause Theres a the gun being worked on right there And youre right Tigers hoping that that is just a cramp cheering His team up 20 right now Parker want to go inside again to Relford He gets a touch So clear the side for him Relford was hit Its on the floor and Welling picks up the foul A 20point advantage here as Morehead State showing some signs of life on the ACC network with the Morehead State Eagles Most wins over the last five years in the state of Kentucky and in the Ohio Valley Conference Its been a great run for the Eagles Eagles only returning two players George Marshall and Anoir Maluke from a season ago where they finished 15 and 17 Went 10 and 10 in OVC play Ohio Valley Conference Prior to that four consecutive 20 win campaigns under Preston Bradley And now its up to cheering coach Maddox to try and continue that success Hes not afraid to go out there and take on some big dogs Doing it here on a Tuesday here in Clemson as that sharp miss there by Clinton Parker And back the other way is Foster You can see Zack Foster trying to push the basketball off of the miss Get Clemson out into transition Morehead State is three of five now from the field in the second half So theyve had have had success offensively Davidsons three not there Cunningham has been the spark plug so far offensively for the Eagles Now up to 10 points in counting Mcgri has been quiet as has Marshall their leading scoreer Marshall back to the basket Had it pulled Lands in the hands of Cunningham He darts in the lane and cant get it to drop Bellifer got hit by his own teammate but its going to be Davidson who picks up a foul Buckner continuing to work out looks to be a cramp He was on the bike before now off of it back with the the gun and just consuming fluids Yeah the red shirt freshman leading Clemson in scoring so far this season Its been an important piece so far for Brad Rennell But again the Morehead State Eagles Im going to go back to Tamari Reford for just a second Has now drawn four fouls uh defensively by the Clemson Tigers Creates another possession Morehead State knocks down the three on that underneath out of bounds play That was Cunninghams 13th point of the night The response that time by Foster Its a great sign for Bradell to see Zack Foster knock down his second three of the game continuing to find a flow and confidence offensively On the logo uses a Riferford screen Parker from the corner for three Cant get it to drop What a rebound Lree He cant get it to fall And Rerford again Josiah Lgree is doing an outstanding job in the ball screen right now Hes coming off of it getting downhill spraying the ball out They didnt knock down the three but it created the offensive rebound opportunity that time getting his hands in the cookie jar to cause the turnover And look at the ability here off the inbound pass Cunningham dropping the three The response by Foster on the other end And after failing to see some threepoint shots dropped in the first half cheering starting to see the rim expand a little bit here in the second as rejects the screen that time draws two Thats a wild pass that Cunningham could not keep in bounds Yeah Morehead States in a really good rhythm offensively right now Josiah got downhill to his left hand Just an errant pass Threw that with one hand with his left hand Threw it out of bounds Hes got to do a better job right there Were expecting to see a lot more ball screens for Lurie Were starting to see that now Theyre mounting up Its almost like every time down the court hes getting a ball screen to work with Yeah hes doing a really good job of forcing Clemson to communicate Theyre not doing a good job of forcing him into the screen Allowed him to refuse that last one get downhill and create a shot for a teammate Its Marshall Wellifer with a bone crunching screen Freeze Marshall for his first field goal of the evening And Marshall now up to six And the Eagles have momentum here from Brad Bronnell Lets see how the Tigers respond coming out of that timeout Buckner back on the floor after leaving the game with that right leg injury and that will help Wow thats really impressive The red shirt freshman checks right back into the game Gets downhill to a righthanded floater Able to knock it down Had to leave the game with an apparent cramp This is where Clemsons got to settle in Morehead State is running set play after set play Uh really getting whatever they want on the offensive end right now in the second half Cunningham again on the float Theres 15 in counting right now for the Eagles Defending well that time on the wing Blocking fouls going to be called on Reford Tried to flop there applause We talked about the pick and roll with Morehead State just a second ago Out of the timeout Ace Buckner checking back into the game right to a high screen and roll able to get to his right hand downhill with a floater Thats really impressive by the young red shirt freshman Davidson good up fake Rejected by Maluke Ball kept by Godfrey Its Buckner for three Hes off and Rifford vacuums it in hands it to the hot hand in Cunningham Now slowing things cheering down 12 minutes to play here in this one Gree stopping on a dime cheering and almost gave it away Relford diving on the floor Finally cheering Buckner put a fork in it and Marshall picks up the foul applause Well the action heating up here is music music Jake Wall doing it for the Clemson Tigers Jake Wallain already with three made threes music so far tonight but hes also shown that he can drive the basketball Did a really good job there getting to his left hand able to play downhill The transfer from Utah this past year Had a careerhigh of 16 points coming into the season already with 11 tonight Three of five from threepoint range Started the game off with two big threes and that sort of opened up the offense for the Tigers Thats looks a little bit stagnant here in the second half Gotrey calling for it Gets it They clear the side for him Heres Wallen on the up fake back inside Godfrey with five to shoot Good cut there by Gut by Buckner Its a great cut by Ace Buckner Also a terrific pass by RJ Godfrey Hes shown his ability to pass the basketball so far this season Really good job late in the shot clock Boston back on the floor for the Eagles Number 10

talked so much about Clemsons ability to move the basketball This is a great late shot clock cut Balls going to go into the post to RJ Godfrey and immediately Ace Buckner soon as he sees that defender turn his head sprints to the rim Great job there in the late shot clock just continuing to move RJ Godfrey eyes up creates the layup at the rim Cunningham takes the three does not make it Maluke with the offensive rebound Dawson 10 to shoot for Cunningham The defense that time by Foster Tough shot Dawson cant get it to go And a good block out there by Davidson Its Tiger basketball once again The other part right now is is Morehead State on the offensive glass They now have seven second half offensive rebounds Theyve done a great job just keeping the basketball alive Its led to second chance opportunities really sparked their offense in the second half 16 overall Theyre rebounding above their weight class here in this one as Godfrey rolls splits the defense and finishes above the rim applause Its a great pass right there by Ace Buckner in that ball screen roll took the ball off of the screen able to make this pocket pass right here by to RJ Godfrey And then credit Godfrey to play with his eyes up Morehead State rotated over ready to take a charge but hes able to finish it at the rim and hell head to the free throw line Goffrey now with his third career double double here 11

get another opportunity kicks it out Wide open Buckner for three In and out Hunter again He missed it Cunningham finally corrals the rebound Cunningham on the push cheering Theres Marshall Hunter doing a good job of moving his feet that time Dawson on the pullup Tough look Craig Dawson the lefthanded transfer from Mount Olive one of the best scorers in all of Division 2 basketball this past year able to get to his spot and knock down that pull up Morehead States offense in the second half has been really efficient Foul away from the basketball Dawson was trying to find some space Heres a Dawson pull Morehead States guards ability to really create off the dribble has given Clemson problems particularly in the second half Just inability to move their feet stay in front of the basketball
