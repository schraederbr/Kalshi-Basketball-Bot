Harelson the 67 freshman now as Chris said running the show Number 10 in white And we are underway Carson Tout the grad transfer from Northern Arizona wins the tap And the Irish have the basketball first And interesting that Joshua Hughes a 610 junior number 11 in purple is the defensive player who matches up against Harelson and matches against every other teams best player Thats Garrett Sundra for three And heres a look at the Purple Aces starting five Leif Mohler the starting point guard at 67 Hes a young man from Germany And ACC basketball fans recognize Alex Hemway who spent five years at Clemson last year at Vanderbilt Didnt play because of an injury but he is a weapon for Evansville Harelson in tout a twoman game They give him some room to shoot Thats the one area of his game Chris that still has room for improvement on a pick and pop Hughes miss fires Long rebound comes to Notre Dame And here comes Harrelson Cole Sera has been on fire for Notre Dame So do you call it bully ball Do you call it booty ball What do you call it as t goes to work in the post The way Notre Dame is now doing it with things running through Harelson whether its down low or outside I mean I dont have a name for it per se uh but its been wildly effective you know something that Michael Shrewsbury did with Jaylen Picket in his time at Penn State You know theres a pro vibe to it Thats Connor Turnbull the senior averaging 14 per game missing on his first shot attempt cheering Doubt gives it back Shrewberry off the bounce knocks it down And the Fighting Irish off to an eight nothing start And when theyre not in that back down game Notre Dame is incredibly unselfish And Braden Shrewsbury 45 from threes Hes one of the best shooters in the ACC off of those dribble handoffs You have got to be alert and you have got to try to fight over the top of those On the takeaway Serta into the front court As a team Notre Dame third in the ACC in threepoint shooting led by Shrewsbury But as a team theyre 38 Tough pass over the head of Shrewsbury into the back court Its a turnover back to Evansville And theres the thirdyear head coach former Division 3 basketball player at Hannover College here in Indiana 49 years old Indianapolis native and continues to mold this roster in his image He is a guy who has deep roots here in the Midwest And if you look at the roster you can see lots of folks from Indiana in this part of the country Keshan Porter Mohler He picks up where he left off in Saturdays loss at Western Kentucky Mohler had five made threes against the Hill Toppers in the second half Hes one for one so far this afternoon Serta blocked First rejection of the day for Connor Turnbull who had nine last Saturday against Western Kentucky Harrelson No Strong rebound by Hughes Turn has his first two The 610 senior from St Paul Missouri Harelson No nice job defensively by Joshua Hughes Mohler left it short that time Serta down with a rebound Irish up eight to five Just over four minutes gone here at Purcell Pavilion Harrelson spins again trying to go up and over the 6 10 inch defender unable to finish He catch and shoot Nothing but net That is what he does And its eight unanswered points for the Purple Aces Harelson And that is block shot number two by Connor Turnbull The Irish hit three music of their first four Theyve missed their last four from the floor music like you said from that area and you know I think he feels for the first time he feels really good about this roster you know kind of how its been constructed put together some of the transfers they got Braden Shrewbury with the step through puts Notre Dame back on top Muhammad has checked into the game for the Fighting Irish as has Logan IMS Kaia Barage with a basketball number nine for Evansville off the bench as is Bryce Quinnette Terrific ball movement to find AJ Casey for the dunk on the feed from Turnbull Brady Kaylor has also come in for Notre Dame And this is an intriguing matchup were going to watch today Chris Carson Tout against the excellent shot blocker and Connor Turnbull Yeah both those guys you know kind of good at what they do Tout outstanding on the glass transfer from Northern Arizona And then Connor Turble weve already called his name twice on two block shots So those two guys really good at at what they do And Turnville has picked up his first foul Takes a seat James Dyson Murva a 611 freshman from Sydney Australia into the game Tout unable to pull it in And it looks like the Purple Aces were on the sideline out of bounds Quinnette but he was pushed out A foul against Notre Dame Kebai has also come into the game The foul is on Sir Muhammad music And I found it interesting in talking to coach Shrewsbury this morning He said that the way music they play that bully ball style now when Harelson is out of the game who has missed his five shots from the floor so far Sir Mohamad can play that same style of well they just put 11 seconds back on as the clock kept running inadvertently So back to 1425 as the purple aces bring it up Bryce Quinnette the freshman from Scottsdale Arizona with the basketball being guarded by Logan I Heway feeds the post to Dyson MVA Barage inside on a nice cut and the layup by Dyson MVA First lead of the afternoon for the Purple Aces Jai on the rescreen frees up Strusberry and Braden Shrewsbury now with eight early points He puts Notre Dame back in front cheering AJ Casey the former Miami Hurricane into the lane over the left shoulder Doesnt get the roll Grabbed by John Shrewberg left alone Boy hell make you pay if you give him any space As Chris said second in the ACC coming in at 46 so far this season Mohamd into the paint Kaylor No AJ Casey pulls the rebound This is the final nonconference game of the regular season for the Purple Aces They will begin conference play in the Valley against Belmont on Tuesday Hines turns the corner kicks to the corner Theres some of the versatility shooting the basketball for Notre Dame Sir Muhammad just his fourth made three of the season Now nine unanswered points for Notre Dame Thats an illegal screen going to go against Kev Jai Off to a hot start here And you know some defensive mistakes from Evansville early in this game You cannot go under anything where Braden Shrewsbury is involved And then Evansville has done a nice job When you play Notre Dame they play a packline Heres that Shrewsbury three again When you play Notre Dame they play a packline defense which means two things Theyre going to double the post which they have stopped doing cuz Evansvilles done a nice job playing out of it And theyre going to hard hedge And so a lot of these threes if you move the ball out of that high ball screen you should get an open look Foul on the ball Itll go against Brady Kaylor the 610 freshman from Fisers Indiana His first Shrewsbury takes a seat You see how well he has shot this year most especially in Notre Dame victories The Irish are eight and three looking for their fourth win in a row They scored the first eight points of this ball game answered by the Purple Aces who scored the next eight but then Notre Dame has used a nine nothing run to retake the lead and they enjoy a sevenpoint lead over an Evansville team that comes in with a 46 record and lost last Saturday at Western Kentucky They have shown some fight under the direction of David Raglin one of the teams in the Missouri Valley Conference hoping to challenge Belmont and Northern Iowa and Illinois State for an opportunity to potentially play in the NCA tournament this year Connor Turnbull number 22 in purple draws the second defender and throws it away Good close out on Cole Serta who has been redhot shooting the basketball for Notre Dame Mohamed attacks gets the roll and one And thats the tough part about playing Notre Dame defensively They are putting at least two 40 threepoint shooters out on the floor at all times They can space you And so those closeouts if you drive those closeouts cheering and get downhill with Sir Mohamed does a nice job there youre going to have a nice little lane angle to the basket and a good finish through that contact And remember Mohhamd was a top 100 recruit out of Myers Park High School in Charlotte last year but his freshman year was hindered by a knee injury At 66 215 hes very versatile and brings a new element to this roster this year Hes got five points off the bench The Irish by nine cheering Leif Mohler the freshman point guard from Germany Swing it around to Keshan Porter Trent Hudley pulls and the rebound grabbed by Kev Jai Notre Dame with the basketball on an 11 nothing run over the last three minutes Notre Dame again playing without Marcus Burton their allconerence point guard who underwent ankle surgery on Wednesday He is at the game on the bench No timetable for his return And so Jaylen Harelson the terrific freshman continues to run the show but hes on the bench currently Turn for three And thats the versatility Only his fourth of the year four of 12 but he had two of those threes on the year and their last last game against Western Kentucky You know if you give him that space he will shoot that And at this end hes very good at blocking shots So give Sir Mohamd credit for beating him that time Seven points for the sophomore from Charlotte Second defender comes immediately Passed by Turnville knocked out of bounds Logan I the last to touch Duke and Carolina highlight Tuesday nights ACC Network mens basketball double header Cameron Boozer leads the number three Blue Devils against Lipkcom at 6 Eastern at Cameron Indoor Stadium And then Caleb Wilson and the 14th ranked Tarheelss host East Tennessee State in the Dean Dome Both are also available on the ESPN app How about the freshman class around the ACC this year Chris Led by those two guys Mohler misfires Mohamd on the reverse a little too strong That was Harelson and a guy whos been very efficient finishing around the basket Its been a a tough day so far for him And speaking of Harelson and that freshman class Boozer well see on Tuesday Wilson we will see on Tuesday So Harelson remains scoreless here this afternoon just over the midpoint of the first half Turn immediately again gets double team dribbles out of it this time Finds the open man in the corner Hundley fight for the rebound Turn on the floor with tout and itll stay at this end Thats the shot youre going to get though Opposite opposite corner opposite wing especially out of those double teams Again Notre Dame is playing a packline Theyre going to double the post Theyre going to hard hedge ball screens in the middle third And they are trying to keep the ball out of the paint on penetration Theyre going to gap up forcing that kick out And on those double teams that look opposite is there You just got to knock that down AJ Casey backing down Tout turnaround of the baseline is good Former Miami Hurricane who spent last year at St Louis has four points off the bench here this afternoon for Evansville Tal against drop coverage He goes to that push shot It was very effective in the win over Idaho on Wednesday missing his first here today Harelson pulls up from the foul line cheering and the reachin foul will send Garrett Sundra to the line first foul on AJ Casey And so Sundra the 611 sophomore from Ashurn Virginia at the line out of Paul the 6th high school one of the national powerhouses high school teammate and classmate of uh Duke sophomores Patrick Gunga and Darren Harris at PBI One out of two for Sundra Ammon way to the corner Porters more of a slasher Got into the lane but then shuffled his feet Fifth turnover committed by the Purple Aces Harelson picks up his dribble flying under control off of two feet Tout now gives it back to Serta You think twice when you drive down the lane against Evansville and their terrific shot blocker Connor Turnville Theres the first two points of the day for Jaylen Harelson Casey spins and hes fouled and well shoot free throws when we come back ACC mens basketball music is presented by Food Lion official grosser of the ACC with Chris Pollola Im Doug Sherman here at Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center in snowy Southbend Indiana last nonconference game of the season at least in the regular season for the Evansville Purple Aces out of the Missouri Valley Conference who used a 122 run early to take a brief twopoint lead But David Raglins club has been up against it as Notre Dame has shot the basketball extremely well this afternoon cheering AJ Casey after the made free throw replaced by Joshua Hughes who always draws the toughest player offensively on the other side So hes 610 611 Chris and yet he will pick up one through five Yeah but in the case of Harelson hes not really picking them up Theyre playing Harrelson like a big Harrelson has not made a three all year Hes not a good perimeter shooter So you can afford I mean look how far off Hughes is playing him And then as Harelson takes up that space now youve got size are in the paint and around the basket when Harelson drives Heres Sir Mohamd and a foul off the ball Looks like its going to be an illegal screen against Carson Tout clear you know clearly Evansville music as most teams are going to be you know youre worried about that post up game of Harelson and then his ability to finish So you put size on him 611 you know takes away that passing window Harelsons ability to see over the defense to find those passing angles and then it makes it harder to finish Now Harelson offensively is a weapon as he buries the three He got off to a great start scoring the basketball of the year but he has put more of his energy the last three weeks into playing defense for this team First three points for the junior from Brisbane Australia Makes it 2621 Mohamd working on Heinway He goes down Mohamd missed the shot Jai had it for a moment but here comes Keshan Porter and he will dunk on anybody Miss the shot and the Irish does well to get back defensively Turnull takes it away Whistle before the Muller three What a womens basketball matchup we have for you tomorrow music afternoon right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Number 12 North Carolina will take on number 22 Louisville 4 Eastern at Carmichael Arena That foul by the way was on Sir Mohamd for Notre Dame his second Under six minutes to go in the half Turn a little strong Here comes Notre Dame Jaylen Harlson the freshman from Anderson Indiana First recruited by Micah Shrewsbury when he was the head coach at Penn State And he has gotten his college career off to a marvelous start A top 20 recruit nationally Paul Biancardi our terrific recruiting analyst says his versatility is his calling card And we have seen that this season for Micah Shrewsbury Again trying to attack Alex Hemway is Mohamad And Heway is going to be called for the foul There are a lot of pro elements to the way Notre Dame plays offense right Chris Yeah A yeah a lot of pro elements Of course Michael Shrewsbury spent time in with the Boston Celtics under Brad Stevens He remains close with the Celtics A couple of years ago he was with the on the Notre Dame team playing for Micah The second foul on Evansvilles point guard Le Mohler Heres Braden Shrewsbury leads all scorers so far today Give him 14 Has he touched the rim yet today man He is five of six from the floor including four of five from distance cheering Turn gives it back to Quinnette Porter nice in Wild shot pulled away by Kevin Jai Mohamd around and out Rebound grabbed by Turnbo Bullet pass inside taken away by the Fighting Irish and Brady Kaylor from the foul line Truth No Jai got tied up with Turnville on the rebound The basketball with this Notre Dame team You know they had 27 assists in that game against TCU I dont think they had 27 assists total in a month of ACC play last year So theres been a lot more life to the basketball Its it has moved from a pair of hands to a pair of hands When you have shooting like they do I I think thats been what the you know the most difficult part about playing them You know again theyre putting 40 threepoint shooters out there spacing the floor and then youve got Harelsons ability to get downhill Its just been a nice recipe over the last handful of games here Rebounding foul Taylor and Casey battle So after Connor Turnull picked up his second foul and we made the point I mean Ray Shrewberry has you know been on fire Hes hes really had a nice first half shooting the basketball Couple defensive mistakes and then you get a guy going and youve got to be up at the level Well if youre that big you cannot be back Especially if that guards unable to get over the top You cannot Youve got to be up at the levels that you can get at least a stick hand in the face of Shrewsbury cuz he is coming off of that high screen to shoot it In his three years here playing for his dad Chris how has his game changed and gotten better I think hes older I mean hes changed his body You know hes put on about 15 pounds And so you know thats the first thing Hes putting it on the floor I think he and Cole Serta have have you know taken on the challenge knowing teams are going to run them off the line Theyve taken on the challenge Theyve tried to put the ball on the floor a little bit more He was third in the league last year in both threepointers made per game and threepoint percentage shooting it better this year as a junior He has it poked away by Shrewsbury Shot clock down to two Gwynette puts it up Another defensive rebound for Keagai Sir Mohamd has it poked out of bounds And Evansville will have the basketball when we come back The Fighting Irish Its Chris Pollola Im Doug Sherman here in South Bend 320 to go in the first half Notre Dame with its largest lead of the afternoon Whistle underneath as AJ Casey went to the floor Kevin Jai who at 610 255 is a big presence inside Apparently a very big presence I mean its like he ran Casey ran into a brick wall And for his trouble Kevin picks up his second personal foul Nice cut Terrific feed as well from Hughes to Casey Notre Dames kind of gone in and out of their double teams on that post And if youre not going to double that cannot happen I mean just a cut right behind Jai Good pass and a nice cut by by AJ Casey And Evansville is trying to stay close with its best player on both ends of the floor Connor Turnville on the bench with two personal fouls Braden Shrewsbury he is feeling it here this afternoon Give him 17 points Your work on Shrewsbury has to start early It has to start defensively before he catches it cuz once he does it is too late Well he has gone for 25 points in a game a couple of times in his Notre Dame career That is very much on the horizon here today Casey misfires Logan Ims going to play more minutes with the injury to Marcus Burton who had successful ankle surgery on Wednesday in the building on the Notre Dame bench rooting on his teammates today How about Braden Shrewsbury so far today smoking hot and its been a lot of these dribble handoffs and you know youre too late if youre Ka Barage You have got to be music attached to Shrewsbury throughout the possession and we have seen Shrewsbury come off and music its a lot of that coming from that right wing to the top where he could turn into that shot Weve seen him music do it off of the catch and we have seen seen him do it off of the dribble in this first half Foul number two on Alex Hemmonway sends Brady Kaylor to the line He had a marvelous game against Idaho on Wednesday Four block shots Hes 610 205 with a 7ft wingspan and really has a wonderful upside Well I I know that Jaylen Harlson is the regarded freshman coming in Brady Kaylor when its all said and done may end up being their best NBA prospect for reasons that you just articulated I mean 610 can stretch it Hes got be a pretty cerebral game to him and he blocked four shots the other night Then that stoppage was to correct a scoring error Its 3723 Just about 2 minutes to go in the half and this is the second year in a row to follow up on what you were saying Chris that the ACCs team with the most returning points percentagewise is Notre Dame So they have a lot of youth but they still have been able to retain a lot of that talent Hughes connects for the second time today from that left corner Hes got six points Back to an 11point ball game Cole Serta looking for a foul as hes beingounded by Trent Hundley Heres Kaylor trying to impose his will Goes to the left hand Casey clears the rebound Mohler is fouled Final score postgame show Theyll have a complete breakdown and reactions from coaches and players Front end of the one and one missed by Mohler Notre Dame with the basketball Sundra Serta Mohamads and Shrewbury So four reserves out there now Muhammad has been productive here today give him nine points And you know his careerhigh is very much on the horizon He scored 11 at Cameron Indoor against Duke last year Hes got nine in counting today Now hes got the basketball And theres 11 using the screen to perfection Its really his freshman year You know injuries last year I think derailed his development a little bit You know he was hurt all summer going into his freshman year then he was hurt during the year So this is kind of his freshman year and youre starting to see him get more comfortable cheering with each game 6 seconds 5 seconds Clean look from the corner Hughes is now three for three from that very spot The heave before the buzzer is a little bit short And we will head to break 412 threepoint line better You know Shrewsbury obviously but these other guys can get it going Notre Dames been a very good second half team And then you got to figure out how to get Mohler and and Turnbull more consistent offensively Well if that was Turnbull as he comes away holding his his back or his side after what I believe is his third block shot of the day And now yes he is bent over holding kind of is that his lat muscle Yeah he may have you know reaching to block that shot May have just kind of yanked at it He is so good at that and and a lot of it timing Hes certainly 610 but hes also got really long arms Well in talking to him after practice last night he said that shot blocking is the only part of basketball that has always come naturally to him and he says he works at it does a lot of study understands what opponents tendencies are Here he is on the closeout on Haroldson But youre right he is one of the better shot blockers in the country averaging nearly three per game coming off a program record nine block shots last Saturday in the loss at Western Kentucky Now he shapes up on the block being defended by Carson Tout Now this time from the wing Joshua Hughes unable to make the threepoint try Fight for the loose ball It comes to tout last years national rebounding king during his final year at Northern Arizona Shrewsbury picks up in the second half right where he left off Hes got 20 points on the day And thats the ability of Harelson to find no shooters You know in that back down game Shrewberry carves out a little window for Harelson This is Notre Dames offense Even on the break Harelson will settle and then Shrewberry finds space and weve got the bigger hues on him And look if theres not a sense of urgency to find Braden Shrewsbury its going to be a hard time Youre going to have a hard time beating Notre Dame There you see second halves different story as a team for Notre Dame The person who personifies that the most is Cole Serta who has been much more of a second half threat Heres Shrewsbury off the handoff A rare miss for number 11 in white It goes out of bounds Back to Evansville And youre lucky that he misses that with the way he shot it And again on those dribble handoffs I think that big whos guarding the the the screener has got to be at the level of the ball You have got to be up higher to be able to contest that shot Keshan Porter had a scoreless first half Hes bottled up by Mohhamd Hughes puts it on the deck Tries to find space and with two on the shot clock able to put it in Thats a team high 11 points for the junior from Brisbane Australia All the way All the way All the way Mohamd into the lane Block shot number four by Turnville Gets on the floor and is tied up The possession arrow goes the other way Purple aces basketball Well Turnbull told me when I asked him Whos the best player you have blocked a shot of He thought about it He said First of all I want to say all shot blockers get dunked on and everybody gets music me But he did say a Dembona Philadelphia 76ers center former UCLA Bruin is on his list Hughes is feeling it today 14 points He really is Only shot 24 from three last year A much improved shooter and gives you that face up big that mismatch Well he was averaging 137 through the first six games of the season for Evansville including at number one Purdue He had a double double 15 points 11 rebounds Cole Serta has his first two points today Late Mohler Porter finds himself open and buries the three young man who received division one football recruiting offers UNC Charlotte among those who wanted Porter to play for them but he wanted to play hoops Played a couple of years at Radford last couple of years at North Carolina Central now at Evansville for his final year of eligibility Mohamd thats a new careerhigh for the sophomore 13 points off the bench for Notre Dame Mohler to Turnville off the window for two Its still a twoman game You know I I think if youre Evansville youre going to see a lot of that this year The freshman Mohler 22 years old European player out of Germany And then Turbo with that nice little push shot Weve got a foul off the ball thatll take us to break basket all season So you get into ACC play youre going to have longer athletes who are you know running key Shrewsbury off of that line Those guys are going to have to be diligent about making reads to finish at the rim Well Micah Shrewsbury says of Cole Serta hes the most confident guy weve got Made his first career start last time out against Idaho been quiet so far here this afternoon but as weve shown you he has had some big second halves Jaylen Harelson with just his second bucket of the day Makes it once again an 11point ball game Nearly 5 minutes into the second half Well coach Shrewsbury Chris has said in the past that in the first half the ball moves In the second half hes looking to attack individual matchups How does that apply from game to Wednesday which was successful rejoining the team today wont be available to play for an undetermined amount laughter of time maybe by seasons end but it just depends on how his rehabilitation goes but he came out of the surgery very very well his replacement at the point for Notre Dame Jaylen Harelson now with six points to make it a 12point game thats the difference too between Harold Harlson and Jaylen Picket who weve talked about a lot at Penn State is Harelsons about 4 in taller than Jaylen Picket And so the ability to see over the top passing angles but then like that finish he just had the ability to finish over the defense in the paint You know Evansville started this game putting the 611 Qs on him But if hes got a smaller defender like he does here in Hemingway look at this Just right up over the top Little fade away a little touch a game thats wise beyond his ears Well he was Notre Dames highest rated recruit of the modern era Played his last couple of years of high school ball at La Mer and as we talked about earlier a McDonalds allAmerican Well his usage is already in the top 30 nationally Hes got the ball in his hands a ton and its putting a lot on on the shoulders of a freshman but so far he has been up to the challenge 67 freshman from Fisers High School before La Mer averaging about 14 and a half points per game Taylor miss fires out of bounds as two Irish rebounders went after it Tout and Harelson So itll be Evansville basketball and its hard you know when Harelson does get it on that post up like he just had on Hemingway because youve got shooting around him You know TCU in that game you know they ran doubles at Harelson the entire time and he was spraying it out and finding Serta and Shrewberry opposite Thats the difficulty with this Notre Dame lineup A poor pass by Mohler Evansville fortunate to keep possession on the sideline and out of bounds was Joshua Hughes So they turn it over nonetheless Ninth turnover by the Purple Aces playing their final nonconference game of the season They are from the Missouri Valley Conference Purple Aces 4 and six on the year Harelson looking to heat up Well short Its not a not a good shot And Michael Shrewberry going to take him out of the game here that that that was a force and you know young guy you hit a basket you start to feel yourself days been a struggle overall Connor Turnbull the former Butler Bulldog with two more and you know what Evansville just hanging around down by eight could have cut it to five instead the long rebound grabbed by Hughes trying to find Turnull on the post Instead it comes around to Porter who spins into the lane Up and over the help defender Turn up and in And a chance for three Turn has scored the last nine points for a purple Aces team thats right back in this ball game Well and and really Jaylen Harrelson has put them in this spot You had a bad shot and then on the last exchange he just threw it from three quarter court and hit Carson Tout in the back of the head Bad shot leads to a run out basket for Evansville and then a turnover to follow that up and hes going to sit on the bench as a result Connor Turnbull completes the threepoint play and hell take a break playing with three fouls as a number of players on both sides are So hell sit about a minute until the next media timeout James Dyson Murva the 611 freshman back into the game defending the post against Carson Tout Here is Touted off Shrewbury He trying to stay with Mohamd goes down The shot by Sundra is off the mark Down five Evansville Evansville with the basketball Porter works his way into the lane Up and over Shrewbury who is called for the foul Well Porter can be a handful A fifthear player from Pinetops North Carolina at 65 in tall he is easily the most athletically gifted player on this roster You know the bench music can be the best motivator at times And with Sir Mohamd playing the way that he is you see Jaylen Harelson Michael Shrewsbury using that bench Once again its a young Notre Dame team and you feel like youve got this game sort of in the pocket and then an older Evansville group You kind of give them a little bit of an opening and they have jumped right into it Nine unanswered Evansville points to make it a onepossession game 1215 to go Casey defensively here Shrewsbury What an action What an action Again playing out of that post and then just a nice little pin a screen for Shrewsbury to come off And he is so good at that Two shy of his careerhigh now with 23 Heaven No cheering Been a heck of a day for Braden Shrewsbury They needed an answer from the flail lion Braden Shrewsbury music two points off a careerhigh right from the start today Chris he has been on fire He really has for a team that you know he and Sir Muhammad outside of those two guys you know nobody else has really had a pulse Hes come up big Mohamds already got his careerhigh with his 13 points off the bench Shrewsbury with that season high 23 Draw a lot of attention from Keshan Porter for good reason Logan I into the lane Mohamd the extra pass to Sundra beautiful offensive basketball and thats how the ball has moved really all year Its an unselfish team They got a lot of perimeter shooters Once they get you into rotation theyve done a nice job finding that open shooter Sundra 35 threepoint shooter And Chris that is the 10th made three for Notre Dame Fifth time this year Theyve reached double figures and not surprisingly theyve won each of the first four games when theyve gone for 10 or more But it starts with a paint touch So Logan Ims getting into the paint breaks down the defense Now youre in rotation Theres that hockey assist I doesnt get the assist Theres one more pass And thats who Notre Dame has got to be especially with Harelson off the floor with Marcus Burton now out of the lineup Its got to be a sum of the parts ball movement kind of a team A lot of life to that ball Well Notre Dame had seen its 15point lead cut to three just over a minute ago but the Irish have answered Mohamd working on Casey ready to shoot Cole Serta everything but the finish Now Casey gets downhill lost it out of bounds and he was the last to touch She immediately turns to his head coach David Raglin who said We should review that Well I It looked to music me like it went off of him so I wouldnt challenge this but it also looked like he got fouled Well theres that Its close Close But no challenge that time from the Purple Aces bench Mohamd Hes just got a big size and strength advantage against Alex Heinway and has been attacking it all afternoon 66 215 and feeling it I mean this is by far his best game so far cheering And in that back down game you know if youre not going to double hes got the match up Hes going right to work So Chris heres the foul situation Four for Tout three for Kaylor for Notre Dame And on the other side the Purple Aces have a number of guys in some foul difficulty Three a piece for Hemingway now Porter Turn and Mohler Nine nothing Notre Dame run after they saw it lead cut to three Ka Barage into the game finds Turnable short Notre Dame looking to extend its run Nice job by Notre Dame defensively recovering out of the double on the post Nice job closing out Mohamed through the contact doesnt get the caller with a bucket but hes able to get his hands on the rebound despite being on his knees on the tie up Itll go the other way Trying to go over the 611 Hughes Jai keeps it alive and from his knees Good Shai clears the miss from Barage Serta blocked Beautifully done by Trent Hunley looking to score at the other end The senior from Mount Orb Ohio with a big play Mohamd doesnt look to shoot Now into the lane pulls up off the back iron Back to him Shai winds up on the floor I undeterred connects from deep First three points for the junior from Zansville Indiana Turnable Rebound John The son of Nazi Muhammad is having himself an afternoon for Notre Dame 19 points for the sophomore from Charlotte His previous careerhigh was 11 What a day Yes sir Mohamd What a response by Notre Dame when this game got to three music Then Sir Mohamd has capped it What a day Its a 152 run now since the Purple Aces cut it to three and they remain cold at this end Notre Dame on a 60 run looking to build on that Sir Mohamd down the lane and he will shoot two And that wont be a block shot for Turnville but Im impressed again that hes looking to block every single shot that goes up even after a foul Watch the helpside defender come over and make sure theres not a chance for a threepoint play right there cheering and applause So its two free throws for Mohamd Makes the first Shrewsbury comes back Well Duke and Carolina highlight Tuesday nights ACC Network mens basketball double header Bamboozer and the third ranked Blue Devils music take on Lipkcom at 6 Eastern And then Caleb Wilson and the 14th ranked Tarheelss will host East Tennessee State Both also available on the ESPN app Turnball kind of a reverse dunk I like it 17 points now for the 610 senior out of Fort Zumalt North High School 12 of those have come in the second half for the Evansville Star and hes going to pick up what I believe is his fourth foul music Well Connor Turnbull was originally committed at Butler to Laval Jordan who was then fired replaced by Thad Mada And a few weeks after that after David Raglin who was an assistant on that staff at Butler had reinforced to Turnbull and his family that hey we want you here new coaching staff but we want you to be a Butler Bulldog About a month later he was then hired away by Evansville for his first head coaching job And apparently Connors mom Leanne was not very happy at that point And so when Connor went back into the transfer portal and David Raglin now the head coach at Evansville said Id like for you to come and be a Purple Ace had to get the approval of Mama And Leanne said Yes just as long as youre going to be there more than a few weeks Head coach and player were joking about that after practice here in Southbend yesterday Kebai with another rebound Mohamd dribbles up for Notre Dame cheering Hines off the back iron Jai knocked it out of bounds Back to Evansville Now Chris I know its only the middle of December and theres a lot of question about Marcus Burton being out but what do you see of this Notre Dame team at this point of the season And how do you think as we get closer to conference play they will stack up Yeah I I think the ball is moving better Now thats not to say that you know theyre better without Marcus Burton Thats not what Im saying They are different I think the ball is moving better And for a team that is going to rely a lot on their ability to shoot the basketball I I think thats a good thing I think the back down offense you know that that theyre putting Harelson and Sir Mohammed in you dont see it a lot I mean its one of the reasons it was so successful at music Penn State is you just dont see it a lot This offense that Michael Shrewsbury has them running The the question for me with Notre Dame because we saw it a little bit in the players era can they compete physically and athletically Can they compete on the glass And can their their offense function and can they create open shots against more athletic and more physical teams Out in Vegas they lost to Kansas and Houston 7161 and 6656 to both Got a win out there against Ruters by five But youre right thats a potential issue going forward You know Michael Shrewsbury calls them his defensive bookends Transition defense so how youre starting the defensive possession and then defensive rebound the ability to finish the possession with a board Those defensive bookends got exposed a little bit in Vegas And then the other thing is you know we talked about you know they had 27 assists against TCU ball moving better They played the second half of that game without Marcus Burton They only had six assists in that game against Kansas So again the ball would kind of stake and stall So how they reinvent themselves around Harelson around Mohamd Weve seen Braden Shrewsbury today take up the challenge Hes been so good today Cole Sertas got to continue to asserta himself Oh I see what you did there You see this even in a 20point game man High high level stuff And again Notre Dame would be better with Marcus Burton Preseason first team all conference Hes had a marvelous two plus years in a fighting Irish uniform Local player out indefinitely after the ankle surgery And Notre Dames going to have to figure it out and they are doing that on the fly And unlike last year when he went down for an extended period with an injury seems like this team in this roster is better equipped to be able to adjust You know its one of the things and look year one Michael Shrewsbury this program struggled but they were playing a lot of freshman Those freshman two years ago are now juniors Braden Shrewberry Logan I last year Cole Sera you know sophomore now hes playing Jaylen Harelson now a freshman Braden Kaylor So theyre you know they theyre young but theyve grown these guys and these guys have played a lot in their time here And here is one of them Braden Shrewsbury 23 points to lead all scorers Looking for a new careerhigh And hes got it 26 points for the junior from Granger Indiana cheering And youre right Chris When Evansville about 8 minutes ago cut it to a threepoint game it was Shrewsbury who calmly knocked down yet another three to get Notre Dame back on the right track You know I dont know if theres necessarily what you would call an emotional vocal leader of this group but I think Braden Shrewsbury particularly with Burton out of the lineup I think Shrewsbury is that guy I mean first of all an extension of the head coach cheering but he has shown that today with his example I mean the way that he came out in the first half they needed that jolt And when they needed it in this second half when Evansville closed in Shrewsbury was the guy with the answer And since he made that three it has been a 234 Notre Dame run An illegal screen against the Fighting Irish gives it back to Evansville music And that is the fifth foul Apparently not the fifth foul on Brady Kaylor as he stays out and plays for Notre Dame 418 remaining in regulation Porter wraparound pass to Casey Missed the layup Certified from distance I see Dunn a game cheering and you cannot help off of him You cant even stunt off of him which is what Evansville was trying to do there quarter back into the game Jaylen Harelson the freshman point guard for the basketball after putting up 20 last time out in the win over Idaho Its been a quieter game for him Miscommunication on that pass from Quinnette out of bounds But the story has been Braden Shrewsbury and his careerhigh 26 points to lead the way for the Fighting Irish looking for their fourth consecutive win ACC mens basketball presented by Food Lion official grosser of the ACC game You see AJ Casey trying to stunt on the post up You cannot leave Colerta He is automatic And music thats how good Harelson always got his eyes up for those open shooters Theres the 264 run after Evansville had cut it to a threepoint ball game What a response for this Notre Dame team And as we said Certa has been a part of it Only one of three from distance today But if you count his last three games he is now 14 for his last 26 from beyond the arc Here is Serta Tried to bounce it back to Harelson Taken away Casey draws a second defender Heres Porter from out in front Quinnette throws it up and Keshan Porter throws it down And Chris I want to give a mention to Kebai who has done a nice job inside for Notre Dame Only three points but 10 rebounds and providing a lot of size and strength Heres Harelson being fouled by Casey on the shot What a womens basketball matchup we have for you tomorrow afternoon here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app 12th ranked music North Carolina and 22nd ranked Louisville 4 Eastern at Carmichael Arena They had a wild game last year in Louisville where Carolina came back to win from 13 down Should be fun tomorrow here on ACCN First look at Ryder Frost another one of their highly touted freshman Hes from Beverly Mass had a DNP the last time out against Idaho And Shrewsbury among those who goes to the bench with his careerhigh 26 points And by the way Chris his eight made threes the most for an Irish player since 2018 when Matt Frell dropped eight on Boston College The school record is 10 And that record will hold for another day Porter lays it in Ryder Frost by the way the grandson of the great Tom Brennan former Vermont legend current Vermont legend he would tell you He is my boy My boy TB Also into the game Brady Stevens sophomore from Boston the son of Brad Stevens longtime friend and colleague of Micah Shrewsbury Now really the only other question one of the big stories in the last couple of days here in Southbend will Mark Zachary the quarterback on the football team just added to the roster yesterday one day of practice Will Zachary get into this basketball game There he is wearing number 24 just like he does on the grid iron next door AJ Casey No And a foul on the rebound It was interesting talking to Michael Shrewsbury about the process of getting Zachary into a basketball uniform at this point Of course the football team their season ending and it was interesting Well I asked uh Mark before the ball game about his anticipation of potentially playing today Said he hasnt played basketball since an AllStar game in June He missed his senior year of high school last year because of a broken cheering thumb Said he touched a basketball a little bit in August Messed around but until yesterday had not touched a basketball and whats that September October November December Got to use my fingers Its been 4 months since he even touched a basketball until yesterday Micah said he he made a call over to Marcus Freeman Made sure that was okay and then he called Zacharys parents to make sure it was good with them It was and they can use them More of a prototype point guard Harrison puts it up and in He was fouled Yeah its really neat how its come together Notre Dame fans obviously not happy as weve got uh tempers flaring Matthew Mlelen number 34 in white in the middle of it for Notre Dame Sure was 2001 Yeah something like that Yes sir Thank you Doug Oh come on Its only 24 years ago Shot clock off in what has been an impressive run to close out the victory for Notre Dame Again a game Evansville squad down by 15 in the first half Cut it to three with about 12 minutes to go in regulation And from that point forward it was all Fighting Irish New careerh highs for Braden Shrewsbury with 26 and Sir Muhammad with 19 Thats the fourth win in a row for Notre Dame Now undefeated 70 in home games That escalated quickly
