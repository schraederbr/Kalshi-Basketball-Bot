Reeds and picked up some new additions in recruiting and in the portal as well Something to keep an eye on tonight jumping center and its actually the Lions winning the opening tip Were underway here from Mckameish Pavilion on a cold Monday night Lions in green the Yellow Jackets in white Southeast Louisiana comes in 0 and2 Georgia Tech looking to make it 30 on the season The Lions out of the Southland Conference Late clock on the opening possession and a nice move but it spins out of there and the rebound finally scooped up by the Yellow Jackets Its Cila Two double doubles in the first two games for Cila the talented freshman Heres Dongo his front court mate Too strong on the hook shot and a rebound coraled by the Lions on the attack Full throttle and erased coming out of nowhere There is Cila already Luke he looks like hes going to be a great shot blocker The long arms of the law coming across there The timing is incredible by that young man Obviously hes got the physical tools but that was special on the fast break there Kind of a sloppy start for both these teams still waiting for the first bucket As you see the starting five for the Lions Really their all everything guy is number zero Elise Elise right now in the right corner at the top of your screen Another weight clock situation Another block for Georgia Tech That time its Dongo getting out of the act These guys taking turns We just talked about this front court duo Less than two minutes into the game and already two blocks for Georgia Tech Thongo backing in playing a little bully ball jump hook shot a brick and a rebound for the Lions So a rough start to this game Georgia Tech from the field 0 for three Both sides just starting a little cold Bs gotten two great looks on the other side Jeremy Elise gets right to the rim and misses a bunny as well Its a cold night like you said It might take him a second Yes Luckily were wearing coats to keep us warm as that ones deflected out of bounds And we welcome everybody who just tuned in to watch the Miami Hurricanes pick up a convincing victory alongside Luke Hancock I am Mike Morgan here at McCamish Pavilion on the campus of Georgia Tech The Yellow Jackets trying to make it three and 0 on the young season and Damon Starttomire in year number three and he believes hes got his best team thus far including a couple of really talented big men as you see the foul on the threepoint shot So that going to be three free throws and that is Jaden Lawrence a 64 junior out of Bowling Green Kentucky We all have idols in our life This young man picked a good one His favorite player growing up was the man sitting to my right Luke Hancock They uh they raised that young man right I guess down there in Bowling Green without question I I think the followup question would have been and whos your favorite playbyplay guy I was waiting to hear Mike Morgan That question never came Some shoddy reporting obviously but look at that shot Theres Luke Hancock and there is your biggest fan Jaden Lawrence Yeah I walked into practice and he was very excited to say hello The only thing makes you feel really old when a guy whos playing college basketball says Yeah I was 11 when you got after it back in the day That hurts We like making you blush in the opening segment of the broadcast Well see how many other Luke Hancock fans are in the building tonight Georgia Tech fans would like to see the Yellow Jackets get a bucket Theyd be a fan of some offense here Inside now to the free throw line and into the right corner to Reeves and a whistle He stepped out of bounds Now Kesi Reeves the senior the leader on this team and they need him We talked about the prowess of the front court He needs to be a guy that is a bucket getter from the back court He does a little bit of everything for this team but youre right he has to be a guy whos a consistent bucket When we talked about what Damon Style is looking for especially from this guard group consistency He wants them to bring the same type of intensity and production every single night Georgia Tech in the past few years has shown flashes of being really really strong but that consistency has been their Achilles heel at times Swarming defense by Georgia Tech Another late clock for the Lions Going to have to throw it up there but he traveled first An extra pivot cheering foot for Elise Theres the head coach for SLU That is David Keeper And thats another guy that has a connection to one Luke Hancock Absolutely Uh Coach Lieberman was an assistant coach my red shirt year He left with Richard Batino to go to FIU so they didnt hang around and win a championship with us laughter but have stayed really close with Mark Lieberman And uh he got me connected So I know an incredible amount about South Eastern Six degrees of Luke Hancock Turn over shot up and cheering in The hoop and the harm for Elise in Southeastern Louisiana has a chance to go up 6 nothing here in the opening stanza Kefir told me Jeremy has to be their guy He has to step up music and play well in this game Hasnt really turned it on just yet this season but certainly will be the goto guy for South Eastern in this game Elise the freshman of the year in the Southland Conference last year His parents from Haiti He went to Pemrook Pines High School down in Hyia Florida applause So now a six nothing lead How about a little fullcourt pressure put on by the Lions Watching their walk through I think theyre going to see this pressure the entire game They want to try and get back and set their defense but that pressure is not going away Yellow Jackets 0 for two from the field as we look at Chaz Kelly into the game Down low it comes Eight on the shot clock Little bully ball inside and then Dongo cant hold on and turns it over Now Georgia Tech could not have gotten off to a shoddier start here in the first four minutes of this game Now 0 for two with four turnovers As you look at Damon Starttomire great conversation with coach Damon Starttomire You want to talk about feeling old I mean I remember watching him play at Arizona and Ill never forget when Isaiah Thomas took him in the lottery for Toronto He says Isaiah and he still have a great relationship talk on a regular basis Said when he was being recruited being looked at by the NBA teams he said it felt different when Isaiah Thomas was watching it and really doing his evaluations Yeah If youre an undersized guard and Isaiah Thomas wants to see your play thats motivation enough Yellow Jackets going to the zone See it The Lions can find a crease with three to shoot Lot of dribbling Might have gotten away with a walk but the up and under falls short anyway And the rebound off to Georgia Tech Another board for Sila the talented freshman The highest recruited center in college basketball And theres the first bucket for Georgia Tech A much needed one and a pretty looking drive that time by Washington And they have high hopes for Lamar Washington His first bucket of the season and I think he is very much needed to bolster this back court I know you lost Nate George 11th in the country in assist but you bring in a guy who was top 25 in both assists and assists per game Thats not a bad replacement there Turnover breakaway and a twohand flush by another freshman Akai Fleming Mike that is what Kefir talked about nonstop about this game They cannot have the live ball turnovers going against Georgia Techs pressure with those athletes that lead to the runouts and those highlight reel dunks The offense for Georgia Tech has woken up Twopoint game 5 minutes into the action Lining up a three Popping out that time Cant drop for Isaiah Gains Georgia Tech quickly into front court trying to find a good look Dump it down low and a foul from behind And the push foul by Isaiah Gaines And thatll bring us to our first media timeout Lions leading the Yellow Jackets Six to four here from Atlanta Washington is certainly a guy to look for tonight Certainly a guy to look for Just steady out there 58 assists a game last year at Pacific Started his career at Texas Tech He is going to be very much relied upon But also a guy like Chaz Kelly III Played three years in this conference for Earl Grant at Boston College He is going to be another one thats relied upon to be steady and consistent for this Georgia Tech back court You see the top ball handlers Washington Kelly Mustaf those are going to have to be the guys that pick up the load because they lost a really good one in Nathan George such as the climate today in college basketball Anybody can go in that portal and change your roster in a hurry Twopoint game nearly 6 minutes into the action Strong take and an aggressive one at that by Kesi Ree Go back to our conversation with Damon Stomire talking about the fact they dont want him to just be a perimeter guy Hes athletic enough where he can make plays like that attacking inside And you mentioned kind of when he started his career it was get to the corner be that floor spacer but hes improved every year His athleticism continues to thrive and he can do so much on the court Hes got to be a stat sheet sufferer that does a lot of different things for Georgia Tech No doubt now in his senior year they go from senior to freshman of Akai Fleming draws the foul as you see Reeves on the bucket there Pretty strong move by number 14 in white Former Florida Gator and then drawing the foul on the other end is the freshman from Marietta Akai Fleming is another guy they have high hopes for And Aai Fleming missed 10 games last year that required surgery So technically just a freshman this year His father TA Plenn played for the US Virgin Islands national team and his grandfather actually works at Georgia Tech in an administrative role So hes got some strong ties to the school and to the game of basketball Kind of gives me some Kuwaiti Reeves vibes I know hes a young man but you dont get to the number 13 class in the country without having some other pieces than just Moira Hes one of them thats going to be a really really strong player for Damon Stomire Yeah Backto back top 20 recruiting classes for Coach Stomire Three ball snaps an 80 run lining up a left wing three is Seth Jones Hes another guy that played at Pacific He actually played with Lamar Washington And the fullcourt pressure causes the turnover And thats something that Damon Starttomire is not going to be happy about applause The former point guard knows a thing or two about breaking fullcourt pressure Got to stay composed right That pressure will not go away And theyre going to attack the freshman Theyre going to attack the guys that they feel like maybe arent those solid ball handlers You know obviously Georgia Tech wants the ball in Lamar Washingtons hands in that situation Certainly a learning moment for a Kai Fleming Thats a half a dozen turnovers already You saw the graphic 26 turnovers in the first two games They are still trying to find a flow and rhythm on offense That could have been another foul on another threepoint shooter Scramble Reeds hits the deck and a timeout called for They do not give it to him Instead its going to be a jump ball Its going to be a jump ball And youve got a lion down on the floor in pain I believe thats Seth Jones Yeah he was the one that hit the deck trying to get the loose ball and call the timeout He did look like he was yelling for it I I got to think the injury You see the shoulder wrapped as a guy whos got scars all over both of my shoulders Im a little surprised I didnt get him a timeout before I Mustaf got his hand on the ball Now the arrow will give Georgia Tech with the basketball Tech was on an 80 run before the three ball from the Lions So a onepoint game with 1312 to go These are the kind of games that you know they dont jump out on the schedule they hand out the beginning of the year But sometimes they can make or break you if youre a bubble team These games against the Mid Majors Luke youve got to be careful Strong take to the rim and a beautiful attack and the bucket plus the foul The hoop and the harm for the talented freshman Moila How good was that Just the space he covered once he picked the ball up The length and athleticism put that out with the left hand Im telling you Mike that that young man is different He he got there with one dribble He basically went 18 ft on the perimeter straight to the rack on one dribble All kinds of talent for that young man Youre going to hear his name a lot this year in the ACC Georgia Tech back on top coming up on the 12 and a half minute mark of the first half And thats a turnover on the Lions So stifling defense from Georgia Tech to try to match the intensity provided by SLU Already 10 turnovers November basketball Luke sometimes it could be a little bit rough It takes me a while to get going too Like I said its cold You know this is some of the toughest things up Yeah youre Monday night Its 900 A cold night in Atlanta you have to bring your own energy if youre Georgia Tech I Ill tell you what if youre a small major mid major team and you come into an environment like this these guys are going to be fired up Theyre going to play this game like it is a huge opportunity Yeah This is their final four Yeah Coming up on a break zone Onepoint game from Atlanta The windchill is about 24 degrees outside tonight Coldest day weve had here in the ATL The foul on the floor Thats going to go against the Lions trying to carve out space against the 610 Sila 1151 to that is a little more cohesive Seven early turnovers for this squad Still trying to find its way That ball left well short out of the left hand of Lamar Washington Strong take drive and kick sets up a wide open three Nothing but the bottom of the net for Jaylen Forest We just talked about his old man Thats Jaylen Forest the son of the former Georgia Tech star Started his career Presbyterian last year Leading scorer at Chicago State Coach tells me he can really score the basketball at all levels can get to the rim Obviously can shoot the basketball Said hes kind of like me Defense kind of optional Theres a few of those guys out there This is how South Eastern wants to play They want to get out in transition Priority taking care of the basketball You take bad shots that leads to those runouts You turn the ball over that leads to those runouts Shot selection and you cant turn it over That was the message from coach Kefir Its kind of interesting Its its the mid major team thats playing a lot of press and run and shoot You see the forest connection Jaylen and father James Thats got to be a weird feeling right Your your dad is on the bench coaching against you When youre a basketball legend I would think at this point it might be somewhat normal but uh pretty pretty cool experience for those two No doubt Coming up on the 11 minute mark Craft in the game for Georgia Tech Cam Craft the transfer from Miami of Ohio Georgia Tech has yet to hit a three and hes the best candidate If they can find him in space here Georgia Tech will have it with eight on the shot clock I think its going to be almost impossible for Georgia Tech to throw that ball over top like that I know it looks like Moila has great position but theyre an undersized team that knows thats what Georgia Tech wants to do They seem to be in position every time to go for that steal Dongo Dongo might have dragged a pivot foot They dont call it Craft spots up a three Just told you he was the top threepoint shooter Just missed the mark And then a foul going for the rebound on the Lions Thats five fouls on SLU Its a good kick out like you said by Dongo Almost got called for a travel right there And those are the ones that usually go in when they kind of miss one OH MY GOODNESS ROCKING THE RIM TO Sila and then he gave an extra little pull up on it and that might draw a technical foul Hell learn quickly A young freshman thats something you just dont need to do Damon Stylemires face says it all Yeah it does Thats the look of seven turnovers rough shooting and an unnecessary technical here cheering One thing we were told about Mo Cila whos actually a 21yearold freshman not your typical freshman out of the Sagal hes got a lot of flavor Hes got a lot of jazz in his personality and in his game Maybe a little too much so after the dunk They said hes pretty quiet off the court not so much on the court Those type of plays are how you get on Sports Center You just got to leave that rim alone just a little bit You had that problem right at Louisville right Constantly ri they had to check the screws when I finished on dunks like that all the time Bring out the crew lower the basket all that good stuff They were always always had an extra backboard on deck in case you shattered one Just in case Thats right Onepoint lead now for SLU 1042 to go This is not the start that Georgia Tech had envisioned Yellow Jackets trying to get off to a 3 and 0 start SLU will take their time set up an open three Great action along the baseline Sets up the open tray off the mark from Ethan Picket Think of that of Pensacola Florida Now Georgia Tech trying to get something going but nothing there Theyll peel back Set up the offense in the half court Craft up top probes the right side throws it up there rims out rebound fought for and coralled by the Lions Ethan Picket got his hands on it You can see Southeastern on the defensive end Strategy is going under Obviously youre going to watch Cam Craft but on almost all these other guards theyre going to go under try and pack it in They realize this front court tandem can do damage That is the priority Thats the focus Pump fake and a bump foul Cracked went for the pump fake and then bumped into the shooter Thats the second foul on Craft Thats team foul number four on Georgia Tech Not on the shot on the floor theyll call it Thats two late four closeouts by Craft He fouled the threepoint shooter the first time on that one there Youre not going to like the film watching that one tomorrow Theyll take a seat back on the bench with those two fouls inside Rejected but a foul A foul called and they will give it to Dongo Watch how high Mo gets on this block So Dango gets him down low Thats the foul But Sila who just jumped off his pogo stick at 61 was way up on the rejection A trampoline right there Yes Free throw is up and in As we remind you ACC Network Friday Night Mens basketball A double header Itll be Cameron Boozer music and fourth ranked Duke taking on Indiana State at seven Then Caleb Wilson and number 18 North Carolina hosting NC Central You and I are going to get into the hierarchy of the ACC later on I want to know what you think of the Tarheels so far I I said it about two weeks ago that people were sleeping on this Carolina team Now I will say Seth Trimble with an injury to his forearm broke a bone on Sunday Thats big time detrimental But once you start lining up the pieces for that team the athleticism and oh by the way Caleb Wilsons going to be a top five pick UNCC is going to be right there competing for the top of the ACC Well Seth Jones just sank a three the largest lead right now for the Lions And a timeout called by Damon Styleer and the Yellow Jackets music Stop Stop Back with you here in Atlanta Mccameish Pavilion Mike Morgan Luke Hancock Its a 1712 lead right now for SLU out of the Southland Conference Former Pacific Tigers teammates We talked about Lamar Washington how important hell be this season for Georgia Tech and hes going up against his old teammate Seth Jones who now stars for the Lions A lot of interesting connections here and a lot of turnovers for Georgia Tech My goodness thats eight already Bump that number up one Eight turnovers on Georgia Tech with 918 to go in the first half Southeasterns pressure is relentless I told you that right from the beginning Theyve kept Georgia Tech on their heels really their opportunities are coming when South Eastern takes a bad shot or gets a turnover and it creates a transition opportunity but if they keep them in the half court the press can do two things Yes it can speed you up and create turnovers but it can also dictate the pace of the game Theyre trying to keep these guys in front make them play in the half court Yellow Jacket zoning up How do you attack it Well theres one way Jeremy Jeremy Elise says I got a way to attack it If youre Kazi Reeds you got too many tools to let somebody give you a little shake couple dribbles and just pull up like that I know Jeremys a great player like we said player of the year in the conference last year Excuse me freshman of the year in the conference last year But Reeves you got to be an alpha here especially on the defensive end That is another turnover this time Must stop Nine turnovers already tonight We Weve yet to play 12 minutes And you see its been an issue so far this year you really start to realize how much they miss Nathan George so far Just the calming presence out there in that back court You want somebody as a point guard when when things are going like this and the pressures on you need somebody to catch the ball and kind of calm everybody down Thatll be the job of Washington here They also bring in Chatfield Eric Chatfield a 511 freshman guard number two in white who they feel like is going to be a really good player here Hes a hometown product Pace Academy in Atlanta threetime Georgia all state team member Hes want to be one of those guys they call upon as a freshman to be a quality ball handler and he just picked up a dime on an alley to Sila You dont even really have to know where he is If hes around the basket somewhere you just throw it up to big mouth right Ill tell you what three freshman out there for Georgia Tech I would be putting the ball in Lamar Washington hands as much as possible if I was Georgia Tech On the other side theyre going to do everything they can to keep it out of his hands and make somebody else facilitate this offense The alleyoop snaps a 70 run for the Lions Theyre still up five with under eight and a half to play Inside pump fake Big to big down low and the finish cheering Man oh man They are just carving up Georgia Tech Thats Isaiah Gains on the bucket Really good seal right there Jeremy with a great assist to kind of get him a wide open one His guys are flying by Crosscourt pass by the freshman Sets up a three Got it cheering CJ Booker books a triple and the LEAD IS 10 screaming Lamar Washington pushing off right there Thats a fresh the least bit batty 11 turnovers eight points off the turnovers for SLU And at times Georgia Tech just looks completely befuddled by the fullcourt pressure provided by SLU You know theyre going small ball here right They dont have the dynamic duo in there in the front court So trying to have a few more ball handlers but that timeout right there should have been nothing but diagramming how to break this press They got to pick up the pressure make Southeastern a little more uncomfortable Hopefully they can create some of those turnovers but right now you just got to change the momentum and hope these guys stop hitting all these shots screaming Shot clock at one for Booker No missed it And thatll be a shot clock violation Ball did not hit the rim just the backboard And how lucky is Georgia Tech right there If you give up an offensive rebound after you finally get a stop right that is a back breaker Lets see what they dialed up from Damon Starttomire out of that timeout to break this pressure The only bucket Georgia Tech has gotten in the last few minutes was that alleyoop and again having trouble this time getting it across the timeline They get it inside and theres an alley And once you break the pressure and it looks easy as Reeds drops the dime to Silas going to be a lot of fun to watch this year in the Atlantic Coast Conference Just throw it up somewhere near the rim Yeah every coach will tell you when youre getting pressure you have to attack that pressure and then make the right decision Georgia Tech hasnt been able to string that together They get past one guy and then they either give it away make a bad decision take a bad shot They got to settle down once they break that initial pressure Again late clock 3 seconds 2 seconds inside against the shot blocker An and one An and one for Jeremy Elise the sophomore and the reigning freshman of the year out of the Southland Conference This doesnt seem like a whole lot but kind of gets off his feet a little bit Thats the thing You can be straight up but youre moving towards him with that first jump And thats what you got to do to a shot blocker Get him off his feet And when youve got the length of sea like you dont need him to encroach right Just go just wall up You have to make him shoot over you I know Jeremys a good player Hes 67 Theyre expecting big things from him this year but big Mo Cely you just got to sit down and make him score over top of you And breaking this pressure Id have Mo right under the basket and telling all of these guys throw it to the big fella as much as you can Sila has been the only consistent source of offense Hes got eight points Gets the ball down on the baseline Skip pass over to the left wing up top now into the hands of Washington Heres Chatfield The freshman inside Washington and hell go to the line for a pair Lamar Washington Hes out of Portland Oregon He was Mr basketball in the state of Oregon If that sounds familiar that is exactly the path of one Damon Starttomire When he played his high school basketball he was the player of the year out of Portland Oregon All West Coast Conference selection last year Averaged nearly six assists a game top 25 in all of the country in college basketball The lefty jumper just always looks better but obvious he cant go both ways right Got to the right hand there Mhm If thats a lefty though he makes that one Thats one Chris Mullen on line screaming two Washington splits the freebies and Georgia Tech closes back to within 10 Now its Georgia Tech causing fullcourt pressure And a t turnover now on the Lions as Georgia Tech will get an extra possession Thats exactly what I would be doing if I was Damon Start You got to find a way to energize your crew Games just kind of losing his balance Almost falling out of bounds there Thats really good pressure by Georgia Tech See if the Yellow Jackets can turn the defense into offense here inside a post and thats going to be a hold right there in the middle of the paint Its Isaiah Gains getting a little handsy 17 fouls on SLU So a one and one upcoming for Georgia Tech Big Moes got four fouls drawn against the Lions Thats one where you kind of grab him around the waist You hope the ref doesnt see Glory Eaton steps in to relieve Gaines after the foul trouble there Sila too strong on the free throw and a nice box out there by Mai Miles the 67 sophomore Yellow Jackets cant cash in under six and a half to go first half Its a first half thats been dominated by the Lions out of the Southland Conference who came in 0 and2 Theyve been playing a bunch of high major programs trying to make financial ends meet Shot clock again under five Shake and bake The drive the pull up Shot up Too strong And flying in for the rebound is Washington Here come the Yellow Jackets the other way Washington dribbles it off his foot and then regains the handle Georgia Tech has yet to hit a three ball in this first half That was almost a turnover as the pass hit the rim And there to pick up the loose change is the freshman Aai Fleming A lot to like with the Kai Fleming And theres the Georgia Tech pressure again I think that is a great strategy by Damon Startmire Youve been kind of on your heels in this game Find a way to get yourselves going getting in the press I mean right place right time right Right there Thats just thats first class service when it just falls right in your hands right there in the middle of the paint But athletic Really like the freshmans aggressiveness Damon Stodder says hes going to be a really good player for them Theres an old axiom in basketball Press the team that presses right Thats exactly what Georgia Tech started doing here late in the first half Chance to cut into that lead here as Washington goes up top to Reeds Reeds the bank is open on a Monday night in Atlanta Oh the reaction from David Kefir the head coach of the Lions was priceless He just waves his hand and said Come on Obviously right online but that might have been 5 ft deep Yeah cheering Coming up on the fiveminute mark and its a fivepoint game cheering Shot clock again at five The three off the mark and the rebound gobbled up by Cila whos started his Georgia Tech career with backtoback double doubles Washington probing firing left it short Lions can run here Numbers fouron two and a foul drawing on Reeves Great job by SLU to realize they had numbers the other way and got aggressive One of those where coach keepers telling them to slow down and they did not Thats one that just works out Really crafty play by Forest right there getting in transition This was my move back in the day Get him in the air I watched a lot of hoops Kobe Beam Brian taught me that one Try to use that as much as possible cheering We now have three Georgia Tech players with two fouls Craft Dongo and Reeves cheering As the free throw spins in Sunday afternoon ACC Networks womens basketball double header as number three Georgia Tech plays host to Jacksonville Its Florida State hosting Indiana and Tallahassee Both games also available on the allnew ESPN app Hes Luke Hancock most outstanding player 2013 in this very city of Atlanta with the Louisville Cardinals Im Mike Morgan Entertaining first half so far Thats going to be a 10sec violation applause Luke I I mean Im almost speechless here as the turnovers continue to mount at a dozen early on for Georgia Tech This is just unexpected with Lamar Washington in that back court You would think hed be able to settle things down for these guys Again commend Georgia Tech for picking up the pressure and getting themselves going a little bit but now youre going to have a battle on your hands cuz these guys are playing with confidence from South Eastern Lions methodical in the half court and a turnover on the Lions Georgia Tech off and running Reeves spinning throwing it up there Desperation shot just to avoid the turnover Cant believe he even got that on the rim Baseline drive Not a chance Not in Not in that wilderness CEO was on the hunt for yet another block That is a tough place to be oneonone at the rim with Big Mo Fleming jab step crossover step back three Got it Finally Georgia Tech delivers on a triple How smooth was that It looked like Steph Jones was just kind of waiting for you We got a blowout We got a lost shoe Seth Jones spent a lot of time on the floor in this first half Flat tire for Jones Timeout on the floor Action heating up Fourpoint lead for the visiting Lions 2925 here from the Camish Pavilion music Can this front court kind of coexist together Can can Dongo be as effective as hes been and still have Moila be a guy thats going after double doubles the way we expect him to cheering So far thats obviously not been the case Having to play small ball in order to handle all the pressure from Southeastern really changed this dynamic Ill tell you one thing to keep an eye on Mo has played every second of this first half I know hes a freshman Hes got the young legs but well see if he can kind of keep that up Three ball left short and there for the board Crashing is Fleming Two athletic freshman going for that rebound All of a sudden the Lions have gone a little chilly from the perimeter Georgia Tech now can cut the lead to within two or maybe even one with a three ball And thats what this is A three from Georgia Tech off the mark from Chatfield cheering A rare quick shot and a rare offensive rebound and thats going to be a jump ball Possession error in the favor of the Lions That was a little bit out of character Basically the Lions have been bleeding the shot clock on almost every possession They want to make Georgia Tech work on every possession Defend multiple actions Trade the good shots for the great shots Under three minutes to go here in the first half Just the second meeting all time between these two schools Entry pass just a little bit wide to handle Thats Abasi Eim and Abasi Eum could not corral it 69 center out of Richmond California 10 turnovers now on the Lions in a turnover fest here in the first half 22 turnovers in half number one Inside and out of bounds to Georgia Tech with 17 on the timer Obviously a priority for coach Kever You know his influence the Andy Kennedys the Huggins the Frank Martins you know his teams going to come out and play tough when those are your guys Yeah No lack of intensity from those three coaches Ive covered them all And thats uh some high octane provided by those guys They got a start really from Frank Martin working the video back in the day in Columbia South Carolina Got to have Frank Martin as a USA coach with the World University Games Uh wasnt quite as intense as he is with his college teams We were trying to get him to get mad at us a couple times He wouldnt quite wouldnt quite lose it on us Hes too much fun One of my favorites when he was in the SEC one of the if you took a poll on whod be the one coach youd want to have a beer with the most I think Frank Martin would have won that contest hands down Another turnover and the Lions give it right back I think that was three turnovers in six seconds of play I Yes This has not exactly been a Rembrandt here in the first half but I will say this more competitive than perhaps anybody thought a twopoint game You got to think Southeasterns pressure has given them confidence You know theyre happy to be in this position even if they have slowed down a little bit here A foul on the Lions Thats Edison And thatll send Georgia Tech to the free throw line A one and one upcoming for the Yellow Jackets Georgia Techs only been to the free throw line five times in this game You think about the size advantage they have I You have to wonder if coach starter at the half is going to say Look weve got to use our bigs here We should be living in the paint and living at the free throw line Well Ill tell you this Southeastern knows that as well right So theyre going to pack it in Ill tell you a guy who needs to be impactful in this second half Kim Craft with those two really tough closeouts They got him his two fouls who played a couple minutes and has been an absolute nonfactor They need him to come out here and knock down some shots to space some things out Yeah hasnt been back on the floor since those early fouls Only played five minutes in the first half and theyre hoping he will give them a spark offensively on the perimeter Where would this Georgia Tech team be without the freshman Yeah they have dominated the action thus far And one And that time one of those freshman just picked up a key foul and again went for the pump fake Thats Mo Cila picking up the foul Thats his second You think he checks out now A minute and 34 left in this half I have to think he would I would think so I mean I wouldnt want to gamble I know Dongo hasnt played great but you switch him out and let him play the five here potentially for this last minute and 34 Taylor probably say a couple things they leave him in Maybe not a lot of confidence in in Dongo right now and uh a lot of confidence in the freshman Well I was going to say itll be a test of will and discipline cheering if youre Sea to not pick up a third foul here in the final minute 22 cheering Again late clock under five Pump fake in the trees Kickout pass Open three too strong and a nice weak side rebound coraled by Mustaf whos also been quiet in this game You said it earlier working most of these shot clocks down right to the end You drive you pivot you take care of the basketball you kick out and get a great look right there Reeves kicks off Tap attempted by CEO but cant get it to drop Under a minute to play in the opening half A 3129 lead for the visiting Lions of Southeastern Louisiana Inside seven on the shot clock and another turnover This time on the Lions as the flurry of turnovers continues Thats now 13 on SLU So each team with a bakers dozen turnovers in this first half More fullcourt pressure on display for the Lions Thats how you break it Alioop Oh and a block out of nowhere What a block by Mai Miles Are you kidding I did not have that on the bingo card You said it Thats exactly how you break that pressure Get the ball down the floor Theyre kind of messing around too much in the back court That was an unbelievable block That might be a Sports Center top 10 nominee Final 5 seconds 2 seconds one A desperation needed And that is how the half will come to a close But what a half it was for the visiting Lions of SLU They for this first four minutes incredibly important for Georgia Tech No doubt about it Of course you saw that stat line on Bango going to need him to come alive in the second half Jaden Mustaf coming alive would not be a bad idea either He had a rather quiet first half He ties it up at 31 here What about Georgia Tech defensively Any differences you want to see there I liked what they did towards the end of that first half You just want to be a little bit more solid I thought they fouled too many jump shooters There was at least three in that first half Got to stay away from some of these fouls That advantage has been to Southeastern Brilliant up andunder move there by Isaiah Games He was on the Final Four team for FAU and Dusty May a few years ago part of the Ratford squad last year Thats the most impactful 30 seconds for Dongo that weve seen Kind of breaks the pressure gets a good look offensive rebound and a great pass And youll wake up here in the second half Mike back to a tie ball game 33 all Patience exhibited on offense by the Lions throughout this entire game Pass into the corner with three to shoot and a foul Oh goodness Thats a bailout by Jaden Mustaf with under three remaining on the shot clock Again getting out in transition is only going to help Georgia Tech Thats the big to connection we were expecting from this Georgia Tech front court I mean this guy is pretty easy to pass to this freshman here Kind of throw it up there anywhere around the rim use those angles like they just did and and Mo is going to know what to do with it Cila came over a year ago from the Sagal as the three is lined up and knocked down Knocked down by Jaden Lawrence a sharp shooter from Bowling Green Kentucky gives the Lions a threepoint lead Mustaf up top Now theyre trying to get this guy going This is Craft on a leaner Too strong A quiet night for Cam Craft The transfer from Miami of Ohio Drive kick wide open three Rims out top floor for the rebound is Dongo That would have been huge for Southeast Mustaf his feet didnt know where he was going with it and almost another turnover I tell you regardless of what happens in this game Damon Styleers staff going to have a lot of film to break down and a lot of teaching moments wouldnt you say Without a doubt And they are testing his patience on every level tonight Its just been a slog an upward slog that Georgia Tech is trying to knife through A timeout on the floor with 1753 to go music 3633 The Lions trying to pull off an upset Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Thank you Jump on it So while we were away they were looking It was actually a challenge initiated by coach David Kefir of SLU And after review this is actually going to belong to the Lions as theyll say it was last touched by Cila And looks to me like a good call there Thats great camera work And that ones pretty obvious there Good challenge Obviously hes going to keep that be able to use it later if he needs I think the most important part of those challenges coaches got to hang on to a timeout Cant challenge anything without that timeout You like the way theyve set that up the challenge system My favorite part is that they have a limit in how many they can do so we dont sit here and do challenges all night 30 seconds on the shot clock They retain their 30 second timeout and have one additional challenge for the remainder of the game Great explanation by Roger Weve got Roger Brian Okonnell and Claire Aubrey our officiating crew tonight So the Lions wind up getting an extra possession after the review Lot of action screens cutting now The ball going inside for a rare time Shot clock down to eight Little turnaround hook Shot bounces around and in for Isaiah Gains How about the front court for Southeastern How many guys from this level are going to say you know what were going to take it right to the chest of buy and mo and challenge them inside the way these two have Reeves cant find the bucket but then on the follow a second opportunity and its CLA CEO now 14 points five rebounds to lead the way for Georgia Tech Shot clock under 10 Evans on a fadeaway Got it around and down Its going to be a long two but the lead is five now for the Lions And then almost a turnover on Tech They go ISO Oh Reeves misses the bunny Jeremy goes ISO the first time on by ISO the second time on Mo Really impressed with the sophomore Shot clock again under 10 Wholesale subs about to come in for the Lions as four go to the scorers table 4 seconds 3 seconds up top A long range three Brick City and a shot clock violation will bring us to immediate timeout 1556 to go Its SLU on top 40 to35 That pressure starting to wear Southeastern down Well see how the depth music plays out here Like you said wholesale changes coming Georgia Tech trying to take back some momentum music tonight for the Yellow Jackets Theyve been trailing for most of this ball game Theyve been styied by this fullcourt pressure from the Lions They break it here and a stop and pop and a nice looking attack there for the freshman Eric Chatfield Great poise by the freshman right there Everybody wants to throw the lob make the highlight reel play just stays in control That little pullup jumper Thats exactly what Georgia Tech needs to handle this pressure And a rare quick shot by the Lions That was only 9 seconds into the possession And theyve been bleeding clock almost all night long Dongo big to big and off the shoulder that time of Cila I dont know whose frustration is worse right now Dongo or Damon Stamine Yeah I mean the fact that we are this deep into the action and Dongo has zero points on 0 for two from the field Youre talking about a guy who was 13 all ACC a year ago I certainly did not have the front court for Southeastern outplaying Georgia Tech Right Game of catch on the perimeter with five to shoot Jones little shake and bake Fade and fire Its nothing Thatll be another shot clock violation A little bit of a desperation heave from Seth Jones Youre probably going to get a few of those cuz Southeastern is doing a good job of kind of dwindling down that shot clock making Georgia Tech work Lets see here when they can set their pressure if Georgia Tech can really attack this First thing you have to do is get the ball in bounds Theyve already had one 5second violation tonight And a 10second violation Thats right Yeah Five out of 10 Foul call and a block foul is putting it into high gear That time was by Dongo decided okay Im going to take matters over myself Time to get in the scoring column Too many four men are going to be able to attack the pressure quite like that Paid the price though That ones going to hurt tomorrow Free throw discrepancy I dont know if you had that either I mean no definitely didnt have that Felt like Georgia Tech was going to be able to pound the paint That would be a huge advantage Theyd be picking up fouls left and right But again the front court for Southeastern has been extremely impressive We havent had a chance to talk about just how great this young man was a year ago Hes the leading returning scorer and rebounder on the Georgia Tech team He also led the Yellow Jackets last year in blocks and in steals and ACC play That was after putting on about 25 pounds since his freshman year He grew up in a soccer family in Sagal Older sister persuaded him to play basketball at age 14 Id say that was a good call Thats a smart sister Id be listening to her on all things My favorite number on Dongo too as a true freshman started all 34 games last year for Georgia Tech His length athleticism is different And again its about can he and Mo coexist in this front court Obviously they take up a lot of space but Southeastern playing a little small ball has done a really good job of attacking these two Trying to dissect the zone here A three Knocked down Jaylen Forest with his old man looking on as an assistant for Georgia Tech Jaylen almost another turnover inside and a block foul called on the Lions Thatll be against Cheney This right here the guy is a scorer at every level You cannot let him get the ball Late shot clock up like that You know hes got basically no options Youre more athletic too So if he puts on the deck you can recover there Just cant let him get that shot up Hes going to do that all night Theres Pops looking on He doesnt look too happy No I dont think anybody right now on the Georgia Tech bench looks very happy but still a ton of time left with 14 minutes on the clock You got to be kind of conflicted Your sons hitting shots but your team is uh is struggling out there Free throws buried by Fleming Oh back to a twopoint game Georgia Tech has to continue to attack the pressure and take care of the basketball Those are the two most important things in this game Attack the pressure take care of the basketball And then also on the defensive end you got to start to inflict your will here and get your own pressure going Cila boards the miss for Georgia Tech Great ball movement Sets up the three No Offensive rebound Yes the follow by Cila I beg your pardon by Dongo Now Dongo starting to get a little more active Hes got four points now to go along with four rebounds A blow by pass inside though Too low Turnover on the Lions Heres Washington on the attack and Washington gets it to go THATS the first Georgia Tech lead since 109 with 1255 remaining in the first half Just like we talked about Georgia Tech has to attack the pressure They start to got to start to impose their will on this South Eastern team Might be getting the ball to Dongo and Big Moila I know this 1309 to go Georgia Tech on top of Southeast Louisiana 4543 Mike Morgan Luke Hancock with you here on a cold night in Atlanta And it was a chilly start for Georgia Tech Turnovers bad shooting just completely discombobulated And that man their all ACC performer in the face of the franchise put up a goose egg in the first half But Georgia Tech seems like theyre figuring some things out here Theyre starting to wake up a little bit You can tell by conditioning wise not where hes been in past years I know hes missed a couple games or missed a game this year but the pressure having to extend this pressure as Georgia Tech works their way back into this game It has really taken a toll on Dongo Hes laboring a bit And you got to look at the other side with with Mo Sila and say Man this guy has played every minute of this game and still certainly holding his own in the paint Offensive rebound in the trees No another offensive rebound and that one rims out How about a third try No Scrum Loose ball Frenetic pace here down in the bait and its going to belong to the Lions A foul call Who they get on the foul If its a foul I thought Reeves had the ball under that pile See if we can get an explanation on that Either way its Lions basketball Twopoint game Inside cheering No Here come the Yellow Jackets in transition and a foul called Great job on the attack One of the rare times Georgia Tech had numbers quickly in the front court and a trip to the free throw line where theyve only been there nine of 11 on the line so far tonight for Georgia Tech Tough shots block shots Thats what leads to the runouts right there I mean it is tough to go after Mo I know he kind of comes down a little bit there but thats what Georgia Tech has to do They got to be able to get stops and then get out in transition Goes Reeves out of Mon Georgia First couple of years with the Florida Gator last year had the foot injury missed the final 28 games so he got a medical red shirt Were finally at the point now where guys can stop playing like nine years with CO We actually go back to the clock that were used to Kind of thought I might get an extra couple years You You just missed your window if you played at the wrong time That aint that the truth Not just a couple extra years but the NIL on that Something tells me you would have gotten a nice paycheck Turnover there Eric Favors of course went on to have a tremendous career here in Atlanta And I tell you what Luke Hancock if I would certainly put my money that that young man Moil is going to have a terrific career in Atlanta as well There is absolutely no doubt about that I played against Derek Favors his shot blocking his presence down there in the paint Im really happy I dont have have to play against Moila Yeah but you are spot on The the things that this guy has the tools this freshman is an unbelievable natural talent Hes got some stuff to him Some trash talk out there on the court Some toughness Some stuff that you just cant teach Cant teach And hes really been the guy that has sparked Georgia Tech in this comeback Again if youre just joining us its been the Lions out of the Southland Conference who have led most of the way We have another shoe popping off Another flat tire This time its Ethan Picket who loses the right shoe Did you have that happen with all your explosiveness Uh no I didnt never have any shoe blowouts They were always perfectly fine intact I didnt have any Zion situations Zion situations No wardrobe malfunctions of any kind Not quite like that Not cuz I was going fast Ill tell you that We did do some research You did not play in this building but you did play Georgia Tech in Puerto Rico Your fourth ever game You darn near put up a triple double Eight points nine rebounds seven assists for Luke Hancock Ill take that Did you know that huh Gonnie Lwal Derek Favors Iman Shumper We played against a a really strong Georgia Tech team A lot of fun I remember those days like they were yesterday even though it was 100 years ago You had 28 minutes for you off the bench Dongo now with six points on two of four shooting from the field Georgia Tech is in the midst of a n run Weve been waiting to see when Georgia Tech would impose its will physically on the Lions and right now might be the answer Hopefully a couple of these offensive rebounds get Dongo going He just doesnt seem to be quite at the same level weve seen him the last couple years Conditioning looks to be a part of that Again you got Moila playing every second of this game Jump ball and the arrow to Georgia Tech Georgia Techs defense has gone up a couple of notches in this second half The live ball turnovers are what really kill you but they the turnovers in general really starting to creep up for Southeastern and the points off turnovers Thats the difference in the game They both have turned the ball over a dramatic amount but SLU 10 points off turnovers Georgia Tech 21 Kesi Reeves forcing that turnover the basketball player and author whos published two books already I didnt do enough in college I didnt laughter get enough done Its never too late Youve got a page turner in you I can feel it Luke Hancock you might have to take some notes out of his book Crosscourt pass ball movement and a turnover trying to thread the needle inside Georgia Tech coughs it up The Lions of SLU will not go away Forest full jumper rims off Looks like a quick jumper right there from Forest Done a good job Weve talked about it all night of kind of making Georgia Tech work Guard multiple actions Chatfield wheels and deals everything but the basket on a pretty move Thats a great move You get a paint touch to get right where you want Three ball from Jones Set Jones buries the triple His first game this season Coach told me this guy could be an X factor for us Again attack the pressure Be strong Make a good play And a man one for Cila You get Ca the ball down low Thats taking candy from a baby right there Number six in white A force near the paint And a new career high for CIA 16 points the most in his young threegame career Better off just letting him go when he gets it that low right I think so You know the guy is so athletic Hes so long Youre undized And Southeastern needs gains in this in this game He cant pick up any more fouls And and thats what a front court does to you Its not just the rebounds and the points the screaming and crying fouls drawn and wearing guys down over the course of the game That is part of what Dongo and Moila are doing Cila is one rebound shy of yet another double double So he could start his career off with three consecutive double doubles We were asking some of the Georgia Tech folks the last time that happened cheering Nobody really knows You got to look back probably a long ways away Air ball fired up by the Lions Double double watch is going to be a very common theme for that young man Oh yeah I can guarantee you that Stat stuffing machine cheering NUMBERS SWAM NO HE MISSED IT He got cute on a 360 attempt and missed it If Damon starter if his blood pressure wasnt high enough as it is hes got to be saying What are we doing You could read the lips there I cant repeat it The sequence of events that we just saw they should have turned it over Then Mustaf just comes flying out of there and the 610 all everything freshman cant finish the 360 And that right there that look Mike Yeah I give that look to my toddlers Uhhuh All the time What are we doing My wife gives me that look on a regular basis Yeah thats thats just I mean he is still just Come on man We had a Sports Center top 10 nominee Thats a Sports Center not 10 nominee right there Dont want to be on the not top 10 We do I You know hes got to be getting tired though I will I will continue to to say playing every minute of this game Payton Marshall is a usual fiveman sub for them that is out with some lower back spasms today So Mo didnt get a break it looks like 15footer from the elbow Not a bad shot but not a conversion And the Yellow Jackets will set something up here in the half court The Lions have now missed nine of their last 10 attempts Yellow Jack Wow that three hit the side of the backboard from Mustaf cheering Thats not easy to do A timeout on the floor One of the more bizarre Have to review the challenge by Georgia Tech is successful Itll be Georgia Techs ball on the baseline 20 on the shot clock Each team has one final challenge left the remainder of the game Yeah I can I can mention them So what happens when your uber athletic allAmerican recruit 610 music misses a wideopen 360 slam You get a lot of reactions like this music You get reactions from Jaden Mustaf saying Come on man You get reactions from Bango going What are you doing man And if youre the head coach and Damon Starttomire music youre saying Come on what are you doing A common reaction Those were just three reactions We probably could have shown a couple hundred more from the fans in the building tonight By the way while we were away Georgia Tech challenged the call on the floor They won So each team has won their challenge So thats how Georgia Tech got the basketball out of the timeout and proceed to give it directly to Southeastern I mean this game I know its early in the season but this is not a polished performance from either of these teams No And Sila just picked up his third foul makes it out of a desperate shot Coach keeper saying Why are you shooting a fade away Hes been upset with a couple of the shots taken from Jaylen Forest Got to live with some of that cuz he is a great scorer but theyve done a really good job when theyve made Georgia Tech really work Guard all multiple actions Washington on an offbalance runner the other way Rejected Oh you could see that coming Dongo was on the hunt SWATS IT AWAY I COULD SEE IT COMING You could see it coming I would have my radar up anywhere Dongo is Anywhere Anywhere Mo is Im paying attention to those guys in transition Dongo and Mo The SWAT team Washington tried to force it And there to clean up the loose change is Dongo Dongo just right place right time on a few of these plays Just has good touch in the paint cheering Maybe not the lift I mean you can see him being worn down late in this game The condition hes going to get there I would assume just weve seen him for two years Absolutely dominate but its surprising how hes kind of worn down through this game Shot clock at five Two And a rebound of Mustafa Young man has some confidence doesnt he Yeah he does See if they try to find Dongo again Hes got eight points all in the second half Hes on the perimeter though And the perimeter is where the shot will come from Nice box out there Great box out by Elise If you watch what Georgia Techs doing on that trying to set that high screen with Mo keeping Dongo in the corner so that they open up the paint so that the rolls there so that the defense has to shift and guard that roll Stepped on the baseline Elise lost his bearings and turns it over to Georgia Tech Couple of substitutions including Kawasi Reeves coming in and down on the floor for everybody holding their breath here That is Moila Have to take another look see what exactly happened there I dont know if you want that A player stretching Looks like a cramp All of a sudden weve got uh Bango doing double duty as a trainer here Hes about to hit 35 minutes in this game Weve talked about not having Payton Marshall as his backup Ive mentioned several times Dongo looks like hes getting a little tired but Moila it looks like hes trying to work out a cramp here It looked like he stepped funny on a play and was was kind of walking a little gingerly Im actually happy to hear its just a cramp Yeah you can see just just starts on him and then he hits the ground Well you mentioned the name Pton Marshall Peyton Marshall is their 7 foot backup center from Missouri that has lost some weight Coach Damon Starttomire says he reminds them of Oliver Miller He he would be playing some valuable minutes in a game like this one but hes got a lower back injury Theyre not going to have his services So more minutes for the Big Two including the talented freshman Mo Cila kind of thought we might see Carowak just a little bit but like we mentioned Mos going to have to play a ton of minutes Ill tell you what when you watch Pton Marshall in Georgia Tech first two games the outlet passes really impressive kickstarting fast breaks like Kevin Love Yeah And obviously 300 lb Its great that he lost some weight but that is a massive human being Yeah And thats where the Oliver Miller comp comes in Oliver always had kind of a heavy frame going back to his days at Arkansas and a long career in the NBA And this is a this is scary on two fronts I mean assuming its just a cramp then you would think that its not going to be overly bad news for Moila but applause you have to wonder is he going to be able to come back into this game And if hes not thats one more feather in the cap of the Lions trying to pull off this upset with 548 to play How huge would that be And weve talked about when theyve gone small ball its still Mo in the middle Dongo just doesnt look like cardiowise hes in great shape applause but just like hes done the last couple years hes going to hold it down at the five spot Looks like Kesi Ree will play the four I agree with you Thats not good for Georgia Tech Mustaf attacks the rim missed it tapped around Tech got it back and a foul on the Lions as Mustaf was not going to be denied Gets the ball back and draws the foul You know Mustaf doesnt have like this super polished game but this guy is all go Damon Stomire says he is uber competitive Hes a great voice for this team Theres a lot on that young mans shoulders He is a serious athlete Georgia Tech will have the benefit of the bonus for the final 538 Mustaf whose father Jared played four years in the NBA for the Knicks and the Phoenix Suns And dont forget coming up later on Saturday from 10 to noon its ACC Huddle The Huddle Crew will be at the University of Pittsburgh to get you ready for another full day of football Theyll have game previews and expert analysis right here on ACC Network in the allnew ESPN app 5 and 12 minutes to play Georgia Tech up by eight Rise and fire Back iron Unkind that time for Seth Jones Tech looking to put the lead in the double digits Strong take and another foul draw This is kind of what we thought wed see more of Tech being more aggressive attacking the rim and getting to the free throw line more Would not have thought that Southeasterns pressure was going to dictate so much of how this game has gone But just like that play right there Southeasterns going to try and deny passes are going to make everything tough And when you catch the ball you rip you drive like that you got to be ready for the contact and you got to go up strong Such a great athlete kind of squeezing his way in there You got to make free throws Mustaf missed the the one in one on the uh on the front end on that last possession These are the kind of games that youre glad to have cheering a senior veteran like Reeves on the floor Great hustle there by Mustaf Hes one of their most energetic and competitive players They talk about Mustafa saying hes competitive at everything he does in practice off the court on the court You know who doesnt look tired Jaden Moose Yeah I was going to say neither is that guy Dongo saving his best for the second half and almost an and one for number 10 in green Jaden Lawrence Right place right time Almost gets that teardrop floater to work out What a block These guys have such great timing such good range But Southeastern gets the credit there They are relentless attacking the boards We said this over and over again The front courts been great These guards get in there and mixing it up really impressed with the toughness You look at the bench for Georgia Tech Sila you have to think hes not going to get back out there in this game The way he walked off the floor needing all that help There are two people helping the big man off the floor I would bet against him coming back in this game Get them all the electrolytes you want but its going to take a while to work that out and he would finish one rebound shy of a third consecutive double double to start his Georgia Tech career I say we just give it to him Yeah lets go back check the tape Im sure you could find one somewhere What an impact on this game 35 straight minutes or so Yeah 16 points nine rebounds two more blocks He is something special One of the highest rated recruits for Georgia Tech in quite some time Washington spotting fire and rattles home the three Lamar Washington we talked about the importance of that young man from the guard position with what they lost in Nathan George Huge shot Thats going to count Thats going to be a goalend foul Just a silly play that time by Dongo So now you give just a a gift to the Lions of two points and yeah Damon Starters fuse continues to get lit I never had to worry about leaving those alone Wasnt up that high but that is just a mental mistake right there Theres been a lot of those tonight Dongos got to be the man down the stretch right here They they got this lead but I guarantee you one thing South Eastern is not going away Theyre going to ramp this pressure up They can hit a few shots here and make this game much tighter This play is being reviewed So Georgia Tech with its second music coachs challenge will have the verdict on the other side music I love it thus far and then thatll be finished off by Virginia Tech taking on the Seminals at 730 Our story tonight Georgia Tech got itself in a heck of a hole The Lions of Southeastern Louisiana implemented the fullcourt press forced a lot of turnovers Each team has 20 turnovers in this game I cant remember the last time Ive seen that The star freshman for Georgia Tech really was a guy leading the way 16 points nine rebounds but he is out of the game with cramps right now Georgia Tech will be without the services of Moila Four and change to go Its a ninepoint game and a foul called and thatll send Georgia Tech back to the free throw line Yes they go to the free throw line Not how you want to handle the pressure What didnt you like there Well you you throw up the Hail Mary pass that Dongo has to go get You if youre Reeves you almost travel over there in the corner and then they bobble passes between Jaden Mustaf But I Ill tell you what one thing I am very shocked about Moila checks back into the game Yeah I was just saying Mo Sila is back and maybe he wants that extra rebound for another double double But coming off that bad cramp give the young man credit Hes obviously decided to talk the coaching staff into getting him back in the game So Cila something we did not necessarily expect back in the game after it looked like he was in bad shape Especially to see him just sitting over there you know not really working through it He just kind of sat down for a little bit says I feel all right and going to get back to it Oh to be 21 again cheering Hoop and the harm Isaiah Gains absorbs the contact as the ball crawls over the front rim You got to give the credit right here to Seth Jones sees the the big on him the drop off pass He took it right at the shot blocker in SEA My mind is blown like I I knew these guys were going to be tough from South Eastern but the way the front court has held up against these two absolute studs for Georgia Tech Its its been amazing Gains Elise they have been they have been all that in this game Ive been really impressed No doubt about it Threepoint play is completed and perfect timing for the Lions This one was starting to get a little bit out of hand as the lead was in the double digits but now back to eight This 221 press right here for South Eastern has done a really good job Obviously if youre Georgia Tech you get it to the middle and then you can run but theyre just rotating really well making them uncomfortable with every pass Attack the pressure Great Kick to Washington Yes Great ball movement and the finish by the transfer Lamar Washington Hes got 11 now and the lead is 11 He said two huge threes down the stretch playing off of others and Mustaf right there paint touch find the open teammate that was textbook attacking that pressure Yellow Jackets leading at 6453 and trying to improve to 3 and 0 on the young season Little pressure between the old Pacific teammates there Got to go He goes up top Another three This time its Jaden Mustaf with the triple and the largest lead for Georgia Tech on the night Couple of huge plays right there attacks the pressure finds the open teammate and then steps up and knocks down the three Not a prolific threepoint shooter but Ill tell you what guy is a gamer Stepping up when they need him most Wheeling dealing and a nice bucket cheering for Ethan Picket No fear from Southeastern driving in there against the Georgia Tech Bigs Yeah they have not settled for threes or perimeter shots They have decided to make sure that Georgia Tech does not own that paint cheering Only time I would have had any level of confidence is when Moila is needing to be helped off the floor It hasnt really mattered Theyve have attacked both of those bigs relentlessly And Cila just got blocked for the second time tonight And he went down hard And now you have to wonder I mean how much longer can Sila go Hes already cramped up Had to leave earlier He just reagravated it looked like on that play It looks like hes going to try another minute and 47 seconds This guy wanted to play legitimately the entire game especially now that you have at least a somewhat comfortable lead You think hed be sitting down But also on the other side a guy whos been relentless with the pressure a big shot maker Seth Jones I dont know It looks like a cramp as well Hes getting stretched out over there next to the bench Thats a big loss especially when you need some big time shot making here in very short order if youre Southeastern Straightaway three off the right iron and a rebound Sila And that is the third double double Three games three double double Three double doubles in Mo Silas young career You think he checks out now I think now he can check out T Georgia Tech wants to handle this last bit of pressure take care of the basketball Time is on the side of the Yellow Jackets Lions need points and they need them fast Lawrence rise and fire Yes a triple for Lawrence and a timeout called by the Lions that keeps them in it a 9point game with 55 seconds on the clock I think if weve seen music anything its that South Eastern is not going to give up in this game Theyre going to keep attacking keep using that pressure Theyll be pressing trapping trying to create more of these turnovers I know weve seen a lot Mike but theyre going to need a few more here And again Seth Jones been an X factor for them knocking down shots and creating that pressure Well see if he checks back in and survives like Moila does These three games for Georgia Tech have been a little bit of an appetizer Theyve got a big one coming up against instate rival Georgia Clean oldfashioned hate for the 201st time Theyve split the last four meetings Georgias got quite a bit of turnover from last years roster including Jeremiah Wilkinson Familiar with the ACC there Cal transfer That should say Wilkins Excuse the uh Im sorry thats Jeremiah Wilkinson Yeah Jeremiah Wilkinson with 163 points per game leading the squad They also have Dominiques son whos put together some incredible dunks so far this season in Athens Jake is the son Jake Wilkins So you got Wilkins and William Sun but Georgia I I want to talk about Georgia Tech though overall You and I havent had a chance to really size up the ACC a whole lot We know who the favorites are right We know that everybodys going to be focused on the same teams throughout much of this November December period I think North Carolina is starting to gain a lot of traction right So heres your tears Duke and Louisville Tarheels looking awfully good Virginia NC State and then I think everybodys curious that that glut of sleeper teams who do you like out of that group Well you like everybody thats listed but Virginia Tech is a team Ive been talking about for a few weeks now Neo Avdales if youve not seen this young man play absolutely went off against Providence I dont say these kind of comparisons often The guy looks like a young Luca Donovich out there He has so much poise to his game Hes a great shot maker a great passer You know Mike Youngs teams theyve had a bunch of small guards over the last few years Not anymore 69 certainly looks like a next level player Should be a fun year in the Atlantic Coast Conference Four teams in the Big Dance last year Clemson Louisville Duke and North Carolina Of course it was this Georgia Tech program last year that made a lot of headlines when they had those backto back wins over Louisville and Clemson down the stretch And thats when a lot of people were buying stock on that mans program Damon Styletomire who he believes talking to him today at Shootaround this is his best squad When you add the recruiting class and the portal certainly theyre going to have to figure out who replaces Nathan George but its a team that he thinks has a chance to go further than the previous two and also his deepest team I mean weve weve played nine guys Georgia Tech has tonight Obviously Payton Marshall would would have been able to spell Mosila quite a bit tonight and keep him a little fresher but he hasnt had this level of depth to work with And we know the front court maybe not the greatest performance from Dongo certainly in that first half but these guys are special Theyre going to come along Its the back court that probably has the most question marks And I think adding the transfer portal pieces like Lamar Washington is going to make them get there They got to get better obviously but they have some great pieces to the puzzle That ball hit about six different players before finally the foul on Elise You know we talked about the ACC You mentioned the four bids I dont know if they get quite double that but just the the league as a whole is going to be so much stronger this year because of that We called them sleeper picks there But those middle teams there are so many teams in the ACC that could make the NCAA tournament Those top two tiers are the shoulds right But the SMUs the Miami the Clemsons there are a bunch of teams there in that mix that certainly have the talent to be able to get to the NCAA tournament I I think thats the thing too Luke is that you know the ACC just about every year puts a team in the final four Like we know how good the top normally is whether its Duke Carolina you had the great stories with NC State Miami but you hit on the key thing When is this league going to get back to the depth that it once enjoyed I think everybody is wondering when that light switch is turned on I think weve seen a little turn into this year I really do I I think the new coaches in the league they went into those programs knowing hey if youre not going to invest were going to get the same old same old Those coaches were given a lot of resources They brought in tremendous talent Youve got 24 of the top 100 freshman of the the ESPN top 100 and incredible transfers like Darion Williams preseason ACC player of the year that have come into this league It was a valiant effort from SLU They kept Georgia Tech put them back on their heels more than a few times tonight went for much of the game but in the end Georgia Tech just too much
