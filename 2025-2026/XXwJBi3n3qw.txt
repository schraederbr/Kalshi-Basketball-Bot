meeting between these two teams a series that goes back to 1913 So plenty of throwback eras amongst the Orange and the Panthers And its Pit with the basketball to start things out in their white uniforms and the blue trim coming off a loss against Clemson where Clemson shot 53 in that game Pit is 0 and2 to start conference play but they get the interior in the freshman and Roman Caleeppa from Brisbane Australia Hes terrific against Syracuse has a guy named William Kyle Pitts going to do their best to pull him away from the rim leading the ACC in blocks per game at over three A big time defensive presence Here is Kyle looking for a kick out The defense kind of evaporated around him and he ended up getting an ISO but missed the turnaround You saw the starting lineup for Syracuse Ken Anthony Carmelos son comes off the bench as the sixth man for Red Audrey Miner missing the threepointer Keep an eye too on Barry Dunning Jr a multitime transfer has found a home at Pit a big time scoreer Nice aggressive drive by Nate George whose numbers arent quite what they were last year at Georgia Tech but theyre not off by much This is a guy whos been really playing kind of finding his rhythm with this Syracuse Orange team Im a big fan of his his game A terrific passer for Red Audrey You speak about Georgia Tech Syracuse coming off a 10point win against Georgia Tech where Nathan George against this former team had 17 points and five assists A perfect 10 of 10 from the free throw line in that win Sometimes when you coach a pure point guard theyre looking to get everybody else involved first and they forget about their own offense His game has opened up because hes been more assertive personally looking for his own looks You see it in the free throw attempts Now you have to knock him down But this is a really talented player with guys around him that can score Hes the key Hes the engine that makes everything work Terrence we expect a physical game These are two teams two coaches that really hang their hat on the defensive side of things Absolutely And for Syracuse its been a little bit of a struggle offensively this year Getting Donnie Freeman back in the mix averaging a lot more points with him in the lineup Uh defensively still really good You see how much they pressure the ball out towards half court Theres a team that really gets after it Exhibit A And the big man its William Kyle going up top for the steel Syracuse top 20 in the nation scoring defense And it leads to a threepointer in the corner for JJ Stling Terrific transition offense by Cuse And thats where Nate George thrives Two steals in a row for William Kyle GOING TO TAKE IT HIMSELF THIS TIME THE poster by William Kyle I third The former high jumper jumps over the Pittsburgh defense My goodness Welcome to the game William Kyle Two quick steals two transition buckets and I believe his chin was at the rim And Syracuse making it really difficult to even inbound the ball or not inbound the ball but initiate their offense through the five Corin needs to do a better job of getting open at the top Pittsburgh searching for some kickout three opportunities Now its a drive by Corin disrupted by William Kyle Cuse offense getting out quickly in transition but they turn it over as the baseline pass goes out of bounds from Nate Kings Red Audrey in his third season and you know he has really talked about the athleticism of William Kyle an allworld high jumper as a teenager who converted his skills to basketball and you see both in exhibit on that play Applause Cia Lepa too strong on the three pit One of the things they do well on offense is shoot the threepointer 36 threepoint shooting team on the year A lot of injuries for this Pit team They essentially have a sevenman rotation right now due to those injuries William Kyle gets the feed Six quick points for William Kyle and its an eight nothing run for Syracuse And if youre pit and you get switched off and Barry Dunning Jr he can play some small ball forward but whenever you have a 610 Kyle there rooting out space the backside of the defense has to be a little bit better and more active See Aleppa little rainbow pit was looking for a goal Did not get a whistle Its out of bounds There is Red 13 third season excuse me with Syracuse and not only has been Syracuse coaching staff for a long time but a great player for coach Beahheim back in the day We were talking to Red before the game He said you know one of the best games of my career came here at Pit We looked it up February 5th 1994 the Civic Arena here at Pittsburgh 26 points nine rebounds six assists for Coach Red He was quick to talk about it too wasnt he Thats right He mentioned that and the game winner by Tyler Enis He was on the coaching staff runs deep for Red Autry and his passion for Syracuse That much is evident Hes got his guys really defending at a high level right now Big E and Nate George if he gets ahead of steam forget about it This Qs team is moving the basketball and it doesnt go in but theyre finding the exact shots that they want even in semibreak situations You look at their defensive statistics this year as Witherspoon fires a three and lips out Syracuse becomes a scoring defense and field goal percentage defense Theyre fighting with each other for the rebound that squirts out to William Kyle This is essentially the best Syracuse defense that theyve had since the 2017 2018 season He loves that spot And and this Hey it continues Syracuse playing quickly touching that ACC with the ball handler Thats when the Pit defense is converging and theyre finding good looks You got to be able to knock some of these shots down Donnie Freeman misses the three Cuse one of three to start the game from distance and a foul underneath William Kyle trying to get through the baseline screen but this Syracuse team playing well They all want boards Syracuse out on top playing hard We got a good one here in Pittsburgh to continue doing that but unfortunately hes got two fouls and now takes a seat on the bench Nice offensive set coming out of the timeout Roman Caleppa a little too physical on Donnie Freeman but you said it goes through Kyle It ironically enough youre absolutely right on the defensive end Kyles been the guy that initiates everything right So forcing turnovers and thats allowed this Syracuse team to get out and run And when they do that theyre dangerous cuz Nate George is a terrific passer JJ Starling one of the fastest guys in the country with the ball in his hands Uh this is a Syracuse team The faster they play the better off theyre going to be This is not something you see all that often A stagger set for your fourman Donnie Freeman this is the talented individual we were talking about Number one in Orange is different on the offensive end but so is Nate Kings Kings reigns in the three A transfer from Oregon State is averaging 10 points per game on the year Syracuse a 31 threepoint shooting team Not necessarily their strong suit but they are two for four from that distance here early Demarco Miner up top to Caleppa the straightaway three off the front of the iron and into the hands of Akir Suare who came in for William Kyle whos on the bench with those fouls JJ Starling to the rim Wow Syracuse just off to a terrific start and Eric they havent I think theyve run one play thats resulted in points Everything else has been quick and early in the clock Just been a terrific defensive showing but thats where Syracuse has thrived this year Theyve been aggressive out on the perimeter they communicate well theyre switchable Its been the offensive end where theyve struggled a little bit but if they get turnovers and they can play fast theyre deadly tough See Aleppo off the glass and in as now just two for their first 10 from the floor Im a big fan of Roman Creeppa the young player from Australia Hes a big time rugby player Strong as a bull Better guard Donnie Freeman though Donnie Freeman who scored 27 points a careerhigh in the win against Georgia Tech in his last game out and only his second game back from injury Hes a terrific player You see the length the athleticism really picking it up in the scoring column They left Corin alone up top That three lips out Pit has had some really good looks from deep Theyre just not dropping Eventually you got to make some shots Syracuse right now just moving the ball really well Theyre patient in their offense Pit 0 for six from three Two for a dollar Loose ball Offensive rebound Lobbed inside to Freeman and one Wow to say that Syracuse is Donnie Freeman Uh he gives you a goto guy when the game slows down And thats the biggest difference at least through these last few games with Donnie playing in this game Hes been terrific And when it slows down you can set up your offense He can act as the hub as the passer but it when hes able to step out and knock down shots and play physically Yeah I I mean its just its just a different approach to your entire offense really I mentioned the 27 points against Georgia Tech Also had nine rebounds in that game as well They can move him around the floor both on the offensive side and defensive side He takes a breather with five points excuse me six points and its a 194 lead for Syracuse 7 minutes into this ball game Theres Rothman and Terrence Oglesby here with you in Pittsburgh ACC Network action Saturday afternoon as a bump foul sends Brandon Cummings to the free throw line for the Panthers Foul on Kai and Anthony little bit out of position as the ball penetrates in If youre late on that closeout Cummings quick enough to get into the lane Guy and Anthony not on not on balance when trying to get back in position Anthony Tyler Betsy and Sadique White all checking into the game for Syracuse for the first time as Anthony the son of Carmelo who is in attendance here today picking up the foul Tonight at 9 Eastern after our mens basketball quadruple header right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming weeks Cummings a pair of free throws Three fouls on each team Syracuse offensively shooting lights out Seven of 11 from the floor Three of six from three Theyve made four of their last five Well see what the reserves off the bench can do to add to it for the Orange Get our first le look at Sadique White Thats a tough shot by JJ Stling former McDonalds AllAmerican Tough midrange jumper When people say midrange is dead depends on whos taking them Thats what I say Well Starling he can make it from anywhere Hes got seven points already in this game Three of three to start the game shooting for him Cummings Little floater in the lane for the sophomore Brandon Cummings Applause Four games this year with 17 or more points as Anthony drives and draws a foul Hes one of the best in the country at doing just that which is driving drawing contact and getting to the free throw line Thats absolutely right He understands I use my body to get downhill And Im not really sure what Roman CPA is supposed to do there but I will say uh Kayen Anthony when he checks in Eric hes not here to pass Like he knows why hes in a Syracuse jersey Its to get buckets He was a top 40 recruit in his class and I think there was some undue pressure thrust upon him being Carmelos kid of course Uh but this is a really talented young man who can score Its been a nice addition not only from a scoring standpoint but the fact that they bring him off the bench Absolutely And you got to have guys that can come in and change how a game is being played change the energy sometimes Now given tonight or today rather Syracuse off to a fantastic start because of their defense and Im going to be honest still make some freshman mistakes on that end of the floor but you know what hes going to come in and bring some scoring punch some aggressiveness and I enjoy having the guy like that coming off the bench and making his presence felt coming just trying to do it all himself Brandon Cummings The guard play for Pit this year from an offensive standpoint has been inconsistent One game one guy pops another game another guy pops Maybe today its Brandon Cummings turn for the Panthers Tyler Betsy pulls up for his first shot attempt of the game Its a missed threepointer Should be noted for Pit Caleppa is now on the bench because he picked up his second foul So be both Caleppa and William Kyle essentially the two best interior players on the floor for either team are on the bench with early foul trouble here with nine or excuse me with 1117 to go in the first half as Cummings will go to the free throw line Fouled about 15 ft away from the basket on the jump shot Carmelo is at darn near every Syracuse game to root on his son and to root on the Syracuse Orange as well Off to a good start A 2310 lead for the CE Eric Rothman Terrence Toglesby here with you A little side by side of the two shooting here Tio Hey very similar Elbow in balls placed high Cen has a little bit of a turn Hes right shoulder dominant a little bit but a lot of similarities And you can always see when a guys son somebody who played its strange strange to see like the little subtle differences in their game but every now and then something pops off the page Brandon Cummings has eight of the pit 12 points here early as they pull within 11 and a missed jump shot Panthers are out moving again Heres DeMarco Miner And I dont love that shot for Pit because Syracuse is better when this game is going up and down Its a team that struggles a little bit when the game slows down but if theyre playing fast and in rhythm Tyler Betsy can get loose Nice offense a sophomore from Windsor Connecticut who started his career as a freshman at the University of Cincinnati has found a home as a perimeter shooter here for Syracuse as the Orange has now made four of nine from three here in the opening 10 minutes Going a little bit of old school right here Some two3 zone and Sadique White comes over deflection Syracuse again off to the races Fourth turnover on Pit Heres George driving Got tripped up a little bit Awkward shot lips out Syracuse does have eight points off of pit turnovers so far as we hit the midway point of half number one Get our first look at Neyos initis a guy that build as a shooter coming out of Iowa State but didnt play all that much Hes really struggled from a scoring perspective They need him to knock down shots Corhand right in the middle of that zone That is how you attack it Speaking of knockdown shots I I feel like Cameron Coran thats where hes improved his game as much as anywhere else is his ability to stretch the floor a little bit You first saw him at Florida State He was an athlete Hes worked on his jump shot Nice pass to the middle get it to the ACC And if youre Suare you better close out to the shooter quick because that defense really spaced out And its amazing how the two3 zone has evolved since the early 2000s where it was packed in it was tight Now those wings a lot more spread out Try to check the threepoint line Yeah to a play like that where Suarez is laid on the closeout makes you wish you had William Kyle on the floor Instead hes on the bench with those two fouls as Cummings the runner Brandon Cummings 10 points here in the opening half And if youre red Audrey on that one you just live with it And you have to love it Cummings is a guy I thought he was going to break out be a breakout candidate this year He has some scoring pop to his game Some creativity Yeah thats a big time up and under and floater from the top of the key You dont see that all that often Step back for Ken Anthony with six on the shot clock Betsy going in there for the offensive rebound A tie up underneath and the possession arrow in favor of Syracuse You see Cummings he was getting busy on the perimeter A little between cross step back keeps may or may not have kept his pivot foot I dont know about that I dont know about that at all But Cummings he can score at 34 points in a loss against Hofra here at home few weeks ago as Pit has made four of their last five Its a twominute scoring drought for Syracuse Theyre still up by 10 However Betsy took a couple steps back to hit that three Thats what he does Theres not a ton to his game off the bounce Tyler Bets is looking for threepoint shots And whenever you stand 68 69 and you can see over the defense high release point Theres a reason he was twotime Gatorade player of the year in the state of Connecticut in high school I mean this guy is a terrific shooter top 100 recruit Answer on the other end Omari Witherspoon the freshman from Maryland went to St Johns College he hasnt been consistent but over all this season right at eight points a game You expect some of these freshman dips but the natural talent for Witherspoon certainly there Speaking of that Sajique White who has had minutes has really gone down over the past couple games and you know hes averaging essentially 22 minutes a game throughout the course of this whole season In the last two games just 9 minutes per game His productions gone way down but making a big impact here early with that turnaround jumper Well thats right But sometimes its not his fault Its just that Donnie Freeman was there And Situs has just not been able to find his rhythm over the last four or five games Witherspoon has a offensive rebound and backtoback triples for Omari Witherspoon But you talk about Sadique White number zero for Syracuse This is a guy from Myers Park High School southside of Charlotte Played for Scott Taylor friend of mine One of the best run and jump athletes in all of college basketball Still figuring out the skill part of his game Theres a lot of potential And he gets the assist right there to Tyler Betsy His third triple of the half as both of these teams going back and forth from long range and a loose ball out of bounds Itll stay with Pit after the timeout Syracuse knocking down shot Theyre well on their way They havent had a game this year where theyve made 10 or more threepointers They they could get that by you know early second half at this rate Well shot making is contagious So you step out you have a couple guys get some easy looks and Syracuse playing fast is a different team You cant turn the basketball over early against the Orange because thats confidence starts to go One guy hits one and everybody starts to feel good Donnie Freeman back out on the floor for the Orange William Kyle still on the bench with those two fouls So is Roman Caleeppa with two fouls of his own for Pit Pit on the other hand just two of 11 from deep I like it Sadique White turnaround midair Good finish Just a really good offensive set Stling coming off a Spanulus action Spinulis Want to throw that out there Legend Uh coming off get getting the hand off turning around setting a ball screen and JJ Starling just an older player understanding how to manipulate it Were going to be able to take another look at it right here Eric I thought this was just a really good job by JJ Starling understanding leverage I dont have the shot initially Sadique White turns the screen and you got to have somebody come over and chip Barry Dunning Jr not enough And when you have a small guard on the backside of Demarco Miner that might as well be no help side Pit scored the first bucket of the game They have not led since It has been all Syracuse A balanced scoring effort from the Orange so far with Tyler Betsy leading the way with three threepointers and nine points Brandon Cummings leading for Pit with 10 of his own Witherspoon throws it inside to Corin finishes with the left and a late whistle will send him to the free throw line Little bit of a miscommunication on a ball screen right here between Betsy and Freeman Uh Betsy felt like he could get over and you have two likesized guys They both retreat at the same time and Betsy just doing his best to recover Nice recognition by Witherspoon whos come out and played well Yep For Pit here early Six points for Witherspoon First personal on Betsy Ron Groover Sean Hull and Chase Shaw Your three referees here in this ACC battle Great crew Applause Cor five points after the free throw Donnie Freeman reigns in the triple I mean a pick and pop fourman who can step out You see the difference in the CU offense now that hes back in the fold And if youre Omari Witherspoon and you have JJ Stling over in the left corner just go ahead and come all the way over Yeah And try to contest that shot Make him swing that basketball cuz Donnie Freeman right now is acting different on offense Nine points three rebounds for Freeman Fade away for Witherspoon on the baseline Not there Freeman missed those nine games with an injury Its his third game back coming off a careerhigh 27 against Georgia Tech Last game out Go back inside Sadique White A little turnaround jumper over Miner Has been there quite a few times here early The mismatch down low A transition three from the hands of Brandon Cummings whos now got 13 points Hes been the Lone Ranger so far for Pit They need to keep continue finding him in the half court Four by four from the floor Hes done it off the catch Hes running the floor Got to keep looking for him JJ Stling He answers Its the eighth threepointer made for Syracuse in the half This Qs team doesnt shoot it I just read the stats you know I dont know Eight for 13 from three for Syracuse as Stling now leads the Orange with 10 points but not far behind Freeman and Betsy both with nine You know its interesting because when you break the roster down guy by guy you would think this team could shoot I mean Nate George capable JJ Stling capable Kings good threepoint shooter Absolutely And they just havent been able to get things going That was one on the shot clock as Barry Dunning Jr beats the zone Music First bucket of the game for Dunning the senior from Mobile Alabama But if youre going to give up a jump shot what kind of jump shot you want to give up Long twos right at the end of the shot clock Absolutely Pit has taken and made two of those but its kind of playing into CUs hands so far The lead is a dozen with seven on the shot clock and a whistle JJ Stling was trying to make his way inside Syracuse team functioning at a high high level on the offensive end of the floor That man right there JJ Star It really pulls out that extra big So him knocking down shots adds some fluidity to the Syracuse offense because now JJ Starling has a little bit more space to operate whenever he gets downhill Nate George same thing Nate Kings is able to get some of these swing swing passes to the corner to find some open looks Uh their offense is just completely different with Freeman on the floor and I think Sadique White will end up getting there He needs to continue working as far as his perimeter shot is concerned but I mean this is a different looking looking Syracuse team It also helps if William Kyle gets into foul trouble like he has early in this one He can sit on the bench and Freeman is out there and kind of take the load off of the interior offensive and defensive side of things for the Orange Speaking of the interior thats Corham missing the turnaround Guarded well underneath by Akir Suare Freeman left all alone in the low post Just running the floor rimto rim But it all stems from Syracuses defense That thats where theyve been good all season long And then you add this ancillary offensive piece just changes the trajectory of this team shooting 64 from the floor 61 from three in the opening half Witherspoon spinning baseline as he was fouled trying to go Witherspoons opened up this game I mean you can see the physical advantages that he has at the guard spot Continues to be aggressive Tio I know you wanted me to finish that North Carolina promo from earlier Freshman Phob Kale of Wilson and 17th ranked North Carolina host Wake Forest at the Dean Smith Center tonight at 6 Eastern And then immediately following that game well debut our documentary chronicling the 1993 National Championship winning North Carolina team led by Dean Smith Theyll get never before scene footage and interviews with players and coaches You can catch the game and the documentary right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Applause Just over two minutes to go here in half number one Syracuse has won four of their last five Pit still looking for their first ACC conference victory of the year year This is a broken play right here What how do you fix it if youre Syracuse Open up that side Its a little convoluted right now Not much spacing Get it to Freeman Let him figure it out Goes against the double team Ton of contact and no whistle Freeman not happy about it Jumping the passing lane Its Nathan George Hell take it himself Thats a killer You finally get a good stop If youre Pit youre staying in front Youre forcing a shot at the end of the clock then you turn it over trying to play too fast Just when Pits trying to sneak back in this ball game Fourth steal for Syracuse Theyve made eight of their last 10 from the floor as Caleppa back out there for Pit with those two fouls for the final minute and 15 seconds Coran harassed going into the lane Five to shoot now for Pit Selea on the far sideline Offensive rebound Pit Corhan puts it back up Hes short Loose ball on the floor Oh and a timeout taken by Syracuse Hey just when Syracuse knocks down shots his assist number is going to be out of this world Now keep an eye out here Pit showing a long 131 with Barry Dunning Jr at the top Just a terrific athlete You need to make quick decisions here or get a wide open three Its from Its from the lefty Nate Kings It nearly went in right Rattled out but an open look nonetheless Under a minute to go but I like the call coming out of a timeout Switch it up Dont allow for an atto And after timeout play Cummings has been aggressive Brandon Cummings one of the bright spots for Pit here in the opening half And and one hes got 15 points Brandon Cummings doesnt like misses Now five of five from the field Gets to his right hand Strong move Takes the hit high I dont know if that went off the glass or not Nice move Brandon Cummings obviously the younger brother of Nelly Cummings who played at Pit Prior Uh I thought coming into this season he was a guy who could break out because he has some shiftiness Theres Nelly Nelly Cummings there Uh Brandon has some shiftiness with the ball in his hands Can knock down shots Does a lot of positive things This one 131 zone Cummings has not missed a shot yet today 16 points on five of five shooting Its the most points Syracuse has scored in the first half all season long Can they add to it here in the final 15 seconds A lob inside off the mark intended for Suare and a nearly a turnover by Pit Final six seconds of the half and a baseline slam inside Barry Dunning Jr finishes Now the other way one to shoot George comes up short on the three But a stellar offensive first half for Syracuse Absolutely terrific moving the basketball And you see the threepoint shooting stats for Syracuse They were eight for 15 from threepoint range in the first half They have not had a game this year where theyve made 10 or more threes They are two away from that as we start the second half and Syracuse drops back into the zone Pit has the ball to start things off They go inside to Cor and a turnover Thats when you have to score and you cant wait for the defense to converge Youre going up against a two3 zone You have an isolation try to get to that hook shot quickly or else that second defender is going to be there in a hurry William Kyle back out on the floor to start the second half for Syracuse He played just four and a half minutes of the first half because he picked up two early fouls but boy he was a spark in the opening couple minutes with a couple monster dunks and turnovers as he goes up for the rebound there on the offensive glass and hes fouled underneath Syracuse really active on the defensive end Eric And in this two3 zone you move it around you get wide open you need to make a quick move Nice job Donnie Freeman initiating the contract uh contact on defense forcing the turnover but you have to make quick decisions against his own OH MY GOSH MY GOODNESS OH William Kyle III What Just show replays of that the rest of the game Two two of the best dunks youre going to see all year from William Kyle in just five minutes on the floor today Please stay out of foul trouble Holy smokes William Kyle picked up two early but the man lives above the rim And a turnover there Holy cow Thats one of the greatest tip follow dunks Ive ever seen Somebody foul somebody I got to see it again Freeman double team Kyle two hands this time and a timeout taken by Pit Holy smokes Serfficiencies about his game but what he does overwhelms all the rest of those parts Hes not a great free throw shooter Theres not a ton of perimeter game but the man is one of the best athletes on planet Earth At least this Big Rock I dont know about the rest of them but unbelievable Some pressure from Syracuse fullourt coming out of the timeout as Pit looks to regroup after the thunderous William Kyle dunk Cummings was the one who did it in the first half with 16 points and a foul up top with six on the shot clock You know talking about Kyles athleticism hes got the 44 in vertical a 73 wingspan There was a story written earlier this year from Syracusecom talking about how he was a high jumper as a young kid He went to a competition when I think he was about 10 11 years old performed really well And as they were leaving somebody went up to his dad another foul up top on Nate Kings and said Hey are you guys going to nationals next week in Texas and they were like I I dont know what youre talking about And hes like Your son is one of the best high jumpers in the country You should be going to nationals next week And theyre like Okay I guess were going to nationals next week to win some competitions but just a freak athlete And some guys just get it And look he was the Summit League defensive player of the year decides to take a stab at going to UCLA Didnt really fit what Mick Cronin likes to do out there in Westwood but hes a guy that in the right system can make a definite impact And at Syracuse its the right blend of guys Five on the shot clock for Pit Demarco Miner tough hits a three and a good contest It should be noted Tio that Nate Kings picked up two fouls Oh near sorry nearly another alleyoop going down to William Kyle and out of bounds off of pit That was a nearly another highlight reel dunk I was just going to mention Donnie Freeman whos been shooting the ball well gets a chance to find his rhythm early in the second half from the free throw line Thats never good And Pit you listen to coach Cable we talked to him earlier Its been a tough year for him Deshawn Jackson who transferred over from Iowa State not playing at all this year with an injury Theyve lost Papa Kee another interior player And he told us you know flat out listen I thought we were going to have a really interior frontloaded team coming into this year Now because of injuries were were forced to play with a short bench and a smaller lineup Yeah And they were forced to downshift Like Roman C Apa uh wasnt supposed to start his freshman season at Pit but with Deshawn Jackson out what ends up happening is youre having to downshift a little bit Yeah play Corin at the five where he would be more close comfortable at the four and its really been tough for Pit to kind of figure out rotations Theyre about seven deep and they had to pull a a red shirt off of Kieran Mullen whos not ready for big big action but theyre being forced to because theyre so short in the front court the DJ Jackson Deshawn Jackson that was a killer because it forced Pit to play completely different than how they planned on coming into the season Cummings scored for Pit and JJ Starling responded for the Orange Hes now got 14 points and a 5642 lead for Syracuse Witherspoon the left hand flips it up off the iron and into the arms of William Kyle III his third rebound of the game Freeman they drew the double team Extra pass in the corner And Starling Stein steps the defender and knocks down the triple Thats just really good ball movement and unselfish play by the Syracuse Orange Donnie Freeman sees the double team coming passes out to Nate George who makes the good better best pass to the corner Just really good offensive play by Red Autrys team Starlings made three threepoint attempts in three attempts excuse me for Syracuse 5942 Eric Rothman Terence Ogles be here with you at the Peterson Event Center Its been all Cuse since well Pit scored the opening basket of the game And since then Syracuse has led the entire way Cummings lost it off of his foot The whistle behind the play will be against Syracuse Its on JJ Starling his first And Syracuse playing with a lot of enthusiasm and confidence right now Yeah I I would argue try to take off the angle first Dont let the guy get middle and youre not putting yourself in position to get a foul call but show your hands Continue to play aggressive The activity level right now for the Orange has been awesome William Kyle almost blocked that See Aleppa got the offensive rebound though But yeah the the vertical leaping ability of William Kyle is on display nearly every play today that hes been out there Syracuse has really taken advantage of the opportunities theyve been given But Caleppa takes one himself this time Goes down hard as he was fouled from behind Applause as Nathan George I dont think the intention was to Well the intent was down Well the the intention was to get your moneys worth because Caleppa is going up for a foul and I I little bit surprised theyre not taking a look at this Fouled him pretty hard He did And I I think Nate George was going after the ball Sure But intent isnt necessarily the decision when it comes to flagrant foul Nice hustle getting back Theyre not going to look at it Caleb at the free throw line Fourth team foul on Syracuse I really like Roman Caleppa Hes going to be a good player for Pit and hes a guy played at the 19 World Cup for Australia in Switzerland and he was fantastic there But for Australia he was playing the three spot So because of some of these things weve talked about with Deshawn Jackson being gone hes having to shift down a position to the four And while hes had success not necessarily where hes most comfortable Former rugby player one of the best high school rugby players in Australia before transitioning primarily to basketball A foul Donnie Freeman was cutting across the lane See picks up the personal They were call it on the floor I think Freeman wanted two free throws But you know I I think the hard thing to gauge whenever youre a freshman and a young player when youre going up against a star like Donnie Freeman how much space do you give at about 15 ft right Caleppa is a physical guy Certainly a balancing act So comes Kyle again This time finishes with the finger roll and hell go to the free throw line and he wanted to pass the ball but William Kyle jumps high enough that he has ample time to make decisions while hes in the air Has a mismatch Demarco Miner a little bit of a gamble here Helpside coming over late He was going to pass it Easy finger roll I mean William Kyle everythings inside of 8 ft Sure but my goodness theres not many people on planet Earth that could do some of the things that he does Its eight feet around the basket and 18 feet above it It seems like youre throwing an alleyoop Just throw it to the moon and see what happens Bank it off the jumbotron Two3 zone for Syracuse once again Witherspoon turnover in going from man to zone zone to man Syracuse keeping Pit off balance right now Every time Pit starts to find a little bit of a rhythm Cuse just mixes it up Wow JJ Starling flies in and now nine turnovers on Pit have led to 18 points for Syracuse Eric I think a safe bet is to say that when Syracuse operates like this I dont know if they if theres anybody they cant compete with I I mean defensively theyve been on it Offensively theyre attacking the glass Theyre knocking down shots I mean Pit has just been blitzed today I was in Syracuse calling the Oranges win against Nor Eastern a couple weeks ago Donnie Freeman wasnt that wasnt in the game due to the injury I think there was like 55 fouls in that game This is a completely different offense with him on the floor You just see how much it opens up and he doesnt even have to be that active And yet it seems like its just getting guys like Starling guys like Kyle more opportunities to have ISO looks to do what they do best which is make athletic plays with the basketball Absolutely Just having him in the game as a threat to score I mean Corin always has to So theyre effectively Freeman just being on the floor Corin has to be away from it And youre able to open up just a little bit more the offense for these explosive guards See Aleppa out there with his three fouls Missing the corner three Oh no Loose ball turnover Now Cummings fires Offensive rebound See Aleppa Didnt even take a dribble Finishes off the glass and in And if Pences going to get back in this game thats how they have to do it Continue to attack the offensive glass Youre going to have to slow down tempo a little bit If youre the Panthers slow down tempo Turn it into a grind session because when the game slows down Pit can have success Were going to take another look at that previous play the uh this is a guy who plays with a certain tenacity and Australia used to get him to his right hand downhill and there was nobody who could say he would attack the basket like a rugby player would and because hes a little bit out of position its hard to put him in those spots to where he can do what hes most comfortable thats getting to his right hand Syracuse shooting it a Kings missing and a foul underneath theyre going to call Brandon Cummings for undercutting Akir Suare Fans want an over and back call Over the back call instead it goes against Pit Take a look at the left part of your screen Granted Cummings reaching around with his left hand is what the referee said Yeah Grabs a hold of his shorts Its not much but its enough for the foul call Third foul for Cummings So now Cummings and Caleeppo both with three fouls 12 and a half minutes to go here in regulations Kai and Anthony back out there for the Orange A quiet night for Anthony Afternoon I should say Just two points 0 for one shooting from the floor Two to shoot Someones got to let it go George is too long and a turnover on the orange Hey these are the stops that matter right Youre coming off an offensive possession for Pit where you end up with an offensive rebound and a put back you come down and play solid possession defensively Now if youre Pit you just have to stack possessions stack positive possessions But again Syracuse switching back to his own defense So now you have to redefine what youre trying to do on the offensive side of the floor if youre Jeff Cable Theyd love to get DeMarco Miner going Hes got just three points as he feeds Barry Dunning Jr A long offensive rebound to Cummings Back to Dunning inside Caleppa A whistle and one Just really good Panthers hoodie all decked out and ready to go for Pittsburgh Sports Eric Roth and Terence Ogles be here with you Its a 7 nothing run for Pit T And theyre just hanging around Thats right Theyre theyre just hanging around And thats what you want to do Youre at home Play long possessions on both sides of the floor If Im pit Im trying to slow down the tempo of this game No live ball turnovers and start stacking stops on this end of the floor Heads up Great defense Lob knocked away by DeMarco Miner Selea kicks it out Dunning for three and Sadique White was fighting for the rebound and he was fouled Its almost been a little bit of a role reversal in how these offenses are playing In the first half it was Syracuse playing freely and moving the basketball and not calling sets Uh in the second half Syracuse has been slowed down drastically Applause and as a result some of the shot quality has not been quite as high here in the second half So the foul was on Caleppa So thats his fourth Each team has six team fouls but that is a big deal as Pit has to put Roman Caleeppa on the bench And that is Akir Suare with the slam underneath was just sitting down there waiting for the pass to get to him Suare one of two Georgia Tech transfers on this Orange roster And Pit I understand wanting to press but really what youre doing is youre opening up the floor Brandon Cummings just feels like it Thats good Good recovery by Syracuse Back to a man Akir Suare communicating well Nice move Dunning Jr on the offensive glass Third chance for Cameron Corhead That all started with a Neoyasitis miss as Pit crashing the offensive glass and getting a bucket Just continue stacking good possessions Lead down to 11 Syracuse led by as many as 18 A lob inside Suarez swatted from behind Barry Dunning Jr called for the foul Barry Dunning Jrs too late coming over You have a ball screen going the wrong way The chip guy needs to meet the roller a little bit higher up Youre going to see the backside Barry Dunning worried about Kings the shooter on the back side You have to come over further if the lobs going to be there Syracuse at the free throw line Its been a much maligned free throw shooting team for much of this season for Syracuse Statistically one of the worst in the country at shooting free throws but they have really turned things around in that department They were 23 of 31 from the free throw line against Georgia Tech They are now 10 of 11 from the free throw line here tonight against Pit So backtoback games and it seems like you know maybe everything coming back to the mean for for Syracuse free throw shooting wise but they were real bad from the free throw line for the first 10 12 games of the year Applause Ball needs to move quickly Quick quick pass fake Get rid of it Excellent offense Knocked out of bounds Corin was going up with it Great touch passes by Pit to work it inside to Cam Corin I mean the worst thing you can do against a two3 zone for Syracuse is catch and hold Get rid of the basketball fake a pass make a pass and youre going to be able to find opportunities Cummings fading away Hes got 22 Tough chance Better shot Brandon Cummings been good today Eight of 10 from the floor 22 points No longer the the lone ranger Caleeppa came alive a little bit here in the second but going to need him to be extra assertive Caleppa on the bench with those four fouls now So maybe Cummings back to being the lone ranger Turnover Startling booted it out of bounds Hey stacking stops right Just continue doing that Now you wonder how long do you wait till you get Donnie Freeman and William Kyle And theres your answer right there Get your point guard back in Get some of these younger players out of the game And its not that they did anything wrong Its just youre bringing in some veteran pieces that understand time score and spacing on offense Now Syracuse back to a manto man Freeman William Kyle and Nathan George checking back in Syracuses activity on the ball has certainly changed here in the second half Theyre not picking up nearly as high in manto man communication while its still been decent Thats just a bad decision Injuritus get rid of the ball Just get rid of the ball Turn into a shooter Thats tough Hes really struggled And over the last three games he hasnt scored And hes gotten minutes And really hes still a freshman He played at Iowa State last year but he never really got any significant minutes Hes still learning who he is as a basketball player Takes a seat on the bench in favor of another freshman Amari Witherspoon Under nine minutes to go here in regulation Eric Rothman Terrence Oglesby ACC Network action on a Saturday afternoon as Donnie Freeman turns around in the post and finishes And when things get hard you need a guy that you can throw the ball to and rely on to get a bucket Thats what Donnie Freeman brings to this Syracuse team Marco Miner off the heel as Pit now four for 21 from three Syracuse turns it over Dunning into the lane and a slam Bulls pit within 11 Cant be careless with the basketball You have a team thats surging a little bit The crowds starting to get into it Eighth turnover on Syracuse leading to the bucket by Dunning And thats another one Miner got a piece of it It went off the hand of Nathan George and out of bounds Applause You see Donnie Freeman tries to get rid of it quickly Be assertive with the basketball Youre scoring in the half court and Barry Dunning flush two hands Easy work You got to take care of the basketball Thats been Syracuses theme over the last four or five possessions Dont give Pit extra opportunities to get back in this game And of course who else Its Brandon Cummings who trips that one in over the front iron and down to a singledigit lead And now the energys here You force turnovers you stack stops you get it within single digits Pit playing well Donnie Freeman foot on the line A long two The silencer from Donnie Freeman Greg Autrys glad hes back Boy is he him 17 points now for Freeman Applause Cummings weaving finds Dunning Jr steps inside the ark back to a 9point advantage Used to be 18 now its cut in half And Pits playing well on the offensive end of the floor now Things have turned And its amazing the energy in the building picks up when guys start making shots Defensive rebound there pitch shooting 48 from the floor in the second half Good decision by Brandon Cummings Now its Demarco Miner stops on a dime to Cummings for three He hits it Demarco Miner had what he thought was a mismatch drives commands multiple defenders and finds Brandon Cummings whos got 27 been on an absolute heater Orange go back to Freeman STRAIGHTAWAY THREE FOR DONNIE Freeman in response Speaking of Peter DONNIE FREEMANS A DUDE What a shot taking matters into his own hands 20 points for Freeman His third made three of the game I thought it was going up He wants it Cummings flips it Corin good move Good possession Brandon Cummings making all the right reads on offense Coming off ball screens finding rollers knocking down shots 27 points and three assists so far Right 45 Hell knock it through And then a ball And then Don Donnie Freeman on the other end Hes getting loose Taking the game over Its been mono Just really cerebral approach to half court offense Syracuse defense has gotten a little loose a little lax and allowing Pit to get back into this game Only down by seven now They havent been as aggressive on the ball in the first half Syracuses defense was up in your face right at half court That hasnt been the case since the break Nate Kings They found the threepoint shooter Barry Dunning Jr got in his way and Kings will go to the free throw line You know Barry Dunning Jr doesnt like that call but you got to let the guy land Nice move by Kings I mean youre not giving the official a choice but to call that foul And whenever youre trying to make a run back in this ball game now seven you can contest to try to block the shot fine But you need to go off to the side because now youre giving Nate Kings a good free throw shooter three easy ones And a reminder tonight freshman Phenom Caleb Wilson and 17th ranked North Carolina will host Wake Forest Thats at 6 Eastern And then be sure to check out the new documentary chronicling the 1993 national championship winning North Carolina team led by Dean Smith Youve got neverbeforeseen footage and interviews of players and coaches Catch the game and the documentary right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app And I said Nate Kings was a good free throw shooter last year He was a good free throw shooter shooting 55 from the the line this season but last year at Oregon State was up at 81 and change Not really sure what thats all about but its a guy who knows he can shoot it Cummings to the rim trickles off Im not That was awfully close to goending Excellent effort by Cuse Under five minutes to play in regulation The 129th meeting between these two schools Its a rivalry that dates back to 1913 Applause Five to shoot George a mile away from the basket lobs it inside to Kyle but just not a good pass Really good job Barry Dunning staying active Now Dunning on the other end bricks the three Loose ball on the floor and Kings comes out with it The foul on Pit And Im going to take another look at this shot a second ago I thought William Kyle came up the wrong side of the basket here going up for the rebound Is it still in the cylinder It was close So didnt touch it but at the same time Yeah But if you hit my eyes didnt deceive me It looked like he almost hit the rim right No I agree Kyle will take a seat on the bench Of course he lives on the rim So thats true Applause Syracuse 13 of 15 from the free throw line before that missed by Nate Kings Was the ninth team foul on pit So Syracuse will be in the double bonus the next whistle against the Panthers Music Liner lowers the shoulder goes up and hes rejected underneath by Aar Suare I thought JJ Stling he should have pushed the tempo Thats where you were scoring in the first half You dont necessarily have to go try to score but attack the paint get into that blue area Now you got oneonone with your best player though Its hard to argue thats a lot of contact Three guys converging on Freeman No whistle as he misses the pull up Now Witherspoon underneath the basket Chased by Freeman Caught in no mans land Need to get a ball screen Get a out in space See if you can find one if youre Brandon Cummings Bang Long two for Brandon Cummings Hes got 29 Applause Were down to seven Pitch just crawling back in this one And its been all Brandon Cummings 10 on the shot clock 3 minutes to play in regulation Starling drives Tried to finish with his right hand going left An awkward looking shot Applause Just set a ball screen and let my man go Thats where were at in this game Cummings slips Crossover for three hasnt missed many in this one but that was the worst by far as Cummings threepointer sails out of bounds A sevenpoint advantage for Syracuse in the final 245 here in Pit Introducing This games very much in reach if youre Pit Its been kind of strange though Eric We we were talking about it during the break like every time Pit kind of makes a run Syracuse finds a way just to silence it and and its just taken the air out of the gym time after time and a lot of times its because of Donnie Freeman How can you find a creative way to get him a look Nice job to Marco Miner 10 on the shot clock for JJ Stling Miner in Freemans face strips the ball out of bounds Itll stay with Cuse with 28 on the shot clock Ill say this Demarco Miners tough He doesnt back down from anybody Hes giving up about 9 in in height against Donnie Freeman and my man is in the mix So under 3 seconds to get a shot off here for Syracuse Freeman in the corner Rejected out of bounds by Caleppa Now Cuse has two timeouts This is a tough entry point Nice block Sele The athleticism of this young man just point8 on the shot clock here Tio Well thats what Im saying Is this a time where you throw or you call a timeout to try to set up a lob for William Kyle Sterling got to get rid of it Short on the three That would have been a killer Yeah Big possession right here Im not saying it all rides on this one but Cummings inside the free throw circle No Fighting for the rebound William Kyle brings it down Winning time Good decision Donnie Freeman This is why you go and get Nate George out of the portal You need a point guard to write your write your ship Get a solid offensive set Get an open look Applause Starling with five to shoot Excuse me Freeman fading away on the elbow and somehow it drops Thats just a big time move from a big time player My first time seeing Donnie Freeman in action in person since Peach Jam a few years ago Loose ball turnover on Pit at a crucial time with 112 to go And the other way Nate Kings the layin And thats a killer Youre making a run and a turnover where you cant set your defense All but over inside Caleppa Little turnaround short Got his own rebound Cummings for three They need it Loose ball tapped out into the hands of Nathan George and hell go to the free throw line Thats tough He had coming into the season versus the roster thats on the floor now for the Panthers I mean its a completely different look Hes a coach that loves to have big tough physical players When Deshawn Jackson wasnt going to play it really changed their lineup because you had to move Cam Cor into the to the five and they want to play with a certain type of pace They want to slow it down grind it out Its been a tough go at it first half of the season for Pit Applause Final 43 seconds Syracuse looking to improve to 11 and five on the year This would be five wins in their last six games if they are to hold on Miner has played valiantly on the defensive end but really struggled shooting one for seven in the game as throws that one off the foot of Donnie Freeman out of bounds 25 seconds to go Been a nice game Been a nice game for Brandon Cummings I mean 29 points Did all he could Syracuse just stacked just enough stops to put this one away after a first half where the Orange were out of this world good Yeah Shooting the basketball Well this is the part of this the schedule if youre looking at it for Syracuse the conference slate that they need to win some games You got Pit and youve got Florida State at BC You know thats those are some victories that Syracuse needs to have All three must wins If if youre wanting to be in the conversation for an NCAA tournament bid you have to win those three games Marco Miner good bucket for him He has worked hard from the start of the game till now the end Just hasnt had a lot of production offensively and itll be in a losing effort as Syracuse can dribble out the clock on an 8372 win here on the road at Pit The Orange fans who have traveled a ovation to this Q team that shot 55 from the floor and 10 of 22 from three Fantastic first half and just enough in the second to get it done This Syracuse team when they shoot the ball well
