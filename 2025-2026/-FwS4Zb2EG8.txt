name and Virginia Carson Ta Johan Grunllo get us started here at Purcell Pavilion and Sam Lewis will get it to Don Hall And here are the Cavaliers in the navy blue with the orange letters and numerals to work Malik Thomas whos been terrific as of late And this is Ditter against Tal Hard roll with a right hand and Carson Tal will pay for it with a first foul Testerer 16 points a game leads Virginia in scoring Wes on a balanced team that has really seven guys that are seven points to 16 points They share it They move it They play with great spacing and its not a surprise to see them take it right at Carson Tout to start the first possession Ditter 66 at the line coming off a 208 rebound game Saturday at home in the loss to North Carolina and he spots Virginia to an early lead This is one of those international players of influence not just in the ACC but in college basketball a decorated player from Antworp and at 69 238 the 23yearold freshmans got two free throws to get the Cavaliers start and the Notre Dame lineup of course without Keba Jai whos lost for the season and Marcus Burton who has been out of the lineup for better than a month now and Cole Serta Braden Shrewsbury Brady Kaylor with the freshman Harelson Shrewsbury and Carson Tout who we spoke of on the foul a moment ago Notre Dame head coach Michael Shrewsbury will tell you its a process and they are learning as they go When you lose your best player if anybody loses your best player youre going to have an adjustment period It doesnt matter what point in the season that happens Low the catch and score Nice pass from Der And that high low game is going to work because Notre Dame doesnt have the size at the front of the rim Theyre going to have to have better ball pressure on the top of the floor and not let that quick hitter in transition happen Harrelson will handle the ball a lot to get the offense going for Micah Rusberry Now of course in his third year here at Notre Dame Harelson with 10 to shoot off the tout screen When you have the shot blocking presence you can really push up defensively out front Serta moves to his right launches a three that rolls in Wow Backto back possessions where Virginias defense has taken Notre Dame deep into the shot clock Making a play 40th three of the year And theres an offensive foul on Malik Thomas Another look here at the ball movement that we talked about Notre Dames offensive execution Micah Shrewsbury 39 wins here in South Bend 76 as a head coach also at Penn State of course longtime assistant at Purdue worked for the Boston Celtics for years Got his coaching career going at NIA IU South Bend here in town I love shoot around today Starts with film then they go to the floor walk through close outs and rebounding Backto back threes Serta first and now Braden Shrewsbury the coachs son second best threepoint shooter in the ACC from behind the line Really good action for Shrewsberry off that pin down action to the top of the floor Left corner Heres Lewis answering Sam Lewiss 29th three Virginias first triple of the night Got to get it in bounds And there was Kaylor looking for help And a backcourt foul is called on Johan Grumlo His first second on Virginia and Ryan Odum in his first campaign on the grounds in Charlottesville I think we can call him an ACC legacy Cant we Sure can Rode his bike to the gym in Charlottesville when his dad was the coach Third grade to 10th grade Yeah hes a hes a legacy Absolutely Terrific to visit with him today Shrewsbury thought about the step back Hall did a nice job recovering Heres Serta on the drive against Thomas into traffic Tout wont shoot it from there Shrewsbury might back for Carson Tout Bounce pass inside and Harelson is fouled This is on Grunlow and thats his second So two on Johan Gruno three on Virginia and thats going to bring Oana Onenso into the game Thats an unfortunate one for Gruno because thats a trip and you got to call that foul Yep But on the other side today shoot around Michael Shrewsbury told us that his son or excuse me yeah Micah his son Braden came to us and said Hey I want to have more of an impact And thats part of the reason why theyre going to start running a few more things for him Hes been very aggressive early Harrelson left it on the far of the rim Hes only 61 at the line On Yenso to replace Grunlow in the Cavaliere lineup Notre Dame is 688 but Debbie they are 64 a half at the line in ACC play That is two from the bottom Well and Harelson missed them both And Michael Greenstein the umpire had a lane violation on Virginia So Harelson will get a chance to buy one of them When you have bad free throw shooting teams you got to be ready to rebound And thats why you have the lane violation because theyre trying to step in quickly Theres a cure for poor free throw shooting Wes Its called getting in the gym and shooting free throws Get a routine and a rhythm Well I kind of offered your services as a clinician today to laughter Notre Dame Yeah I noticed I noticed that in the case of Carson Tout if he goes to the line later we will be speaking of numbers you dont normally hear as a free throw shooter Ditter with the right hand left it short That was a nice play Kaylor defensively Tied at seven early here at Purcell Pavilion inside the Joyce Center tonight Heres Tout against Onenso Wheeling all the way around Carson Tout has a motor now and it never stops He is constantly looking to make a play to make it easier for his teammates Shrewberry with Ditter there launching and hitting Bren Shrewberry Hes got six and theyre both legit threes Confidence Its amazing for a shooter when you can get some confident Last couple of games he struggled a little bit outside the arc Looks good shooting it tonight 107 Notre Dame almost four minutes gone here Five out Look how they get come out of the dunker spot on Yenso Quick pass for Derritter Double team there They knocked it away Harelson gets the turnover Irish looking ahead Left corner Serta again Harelson kept it alive Heres Shrewsbury Thought about it Taylor will shoot and the three pounds away for Lewis Thought they got good looks Deon Lewis cant finish Tal scrapping with Onenso Will save it Virginia Yeah 107 Happy birthday with that Well Debbie like some other ACC programs here in the last five or so years theres been a change in leadership October a season music ago Tony Bennett announced his retirement And that left longtime aid Ron Sanchez to serve as Virginias interim head coach a season ago And after the Cavaliers were eliminated in the ACC tournament Carlo Williams began the search music for the next one Didnt take long About 10 days later Ryan ODM was announced as their head coach And through the first 19 games hard to argue he has done a terrific job since coming over from BCU And of course took VCU and Utah State and UNMBC to the NCAA tournament Really strong identity on the glass offensively fullcourt pressure win protection and sharing the basketball We get our first look at Chance Mallerie in the ball game here for Virginia Handling the ball Nice pass Whoa what a look that was And the bucket for Devin Tillis You manipulate the defense You move it till you get the naked side Twoman game And then you just drop the pocket pass down like Maui did Garrett Sundra Sir Muhammad have checked in along with Logan as well to join Taylor and also Shrewberry in the Irish five With five minutes gone heres Braden trying to find his shot here but Thomas putting his chest on the basketball Yeah Mohamed dumps it inside Kaylor the catch Foul on Mallerie before the shot One more look at Chance B You know were not talking enough about Mallalerie for sure as one of the most impactful freshman music in college basketball Mallerie and Harelson Look at this great drop down pass inside to Devin Tillis Its a great finish inside but its all the manipulation of the defense moving people from spot to spot getting them to change sides of the floor music Another foul this one on Jakari White I think before the balls ever inbounded Yep White picked up his first grad transfer from North Dakota State Five now on Virginia early in this game Out of the corner Shrewsbury and one And I think Jakari White just picked up a fly by foul What a great job of getting organized in the corner You know theres only 17 panels over there between the threepoint line to the sideline Theres not a lot of room You have to have excellent footwork which Braden Shrewberry has Thats a tremendous job right there Three triples already for Shrewsberry Braden had 21 in the loss at Cal 26 earlier against Evansville He had 22 against BC here on Saturday and hes got 10 and the ice hadnt melted in the drink yet Just saying Hadnt taken long for him to heat up Not going back for seconds yet right No Onenso out of a double team for Jakari White who plays with two Heres Lewis trying to answer on Yenso fights for the rebound and score I mean he just rises above the rim And Yenso so long and active and he rebounds out of his area Does a good job playing at distance too for a guy his size at 7 ft almost 250 Mohamd with Caleb trying to help him Sarah Mohamd right hand spin left it short Notre Dame by three Virginia on the attack with Mor Ball doesnt get stuck with Virginia does it No Yeah its its a really fun way to watch the game when you show it Throw it cheering away Tillis tried to go back up seam it looked like Heres Shrewsbury Little euro Put it up and in cheering Scarlet White didnt want to pick up another one Nope 1611 and Braden Shrewberry has got 12 of them Hes outscored Virginia in the first seven six and a half minutes Sure has Out front Thats a three ball Bounds away off the hand of Tillis And Logan I front court Nice pass inside layup Sundra Well weve seen two nice deliveries of the basketball to Bigs here Sometimes teams guard the action and not guard the ball You got to guard the basketball You got to keep it in front out of the paint cheering Lewis back from Mallers three and Taylor the rebound Irish by seven in Shrewsbury Little drag Get the switch Kaylor That is deep AND GOOD WHOA BRADY KAYLOR Ryan ODM needs a timeout Virginia now out of the timeout And Grunlo playing with the two fouls on the floor against Sundra And a foul on Garrett Sundra Youre starting to see that a little bit more or less as we look at the turnover numbers Virginia with three Notre Dame scored five points off those turnovers You know you can pound once as long as theres no dislocation But the second time uh a lot of times theyre putting a whistle on it and thats what happened on that one Three out of the corner off the mark for Thomas and last touched by Gallon Hall So it will belong to Notre Dame and Tillis is going to defend the inbounds pass of Ryder Frost whos checked in during the timeout Mike the Shberry is using his bigs like Sundra to come up and help relieve some of the ball pressure to get the ball in bounds Yep And heres Sir Mohamd handling the rock coming forward Sophomore from Charlotte Malik Thomas almost in a no catch for Shrewsbury right now Mohamd almost got the threepoint try Foul on Virginia So free throws coming for the sophomore from Charlotte Quick reminder to you Super Tuesday presented by Progressive Insurance continues tonight 900 Eastern over on ESPN from the Opera House of College Basketball off West End Avenue Kentucky and number 18 Vanderbilt Carl Rabbit Jimmy Dykes Alyssa Lang will be there for our coverage Always available on the ESPN app Theres a quick look How about Baky McMill at that Did a great job I mean its a fun style A lot of threes They move the ball They press They play up and down Yep Very similar to what Virginias doing here tonight Mohamd got the back end of the free throw Hes just a 52 free throw shooter And the good thing for Notre Dame early on is because theyve been able to spill it theyve been able to load up their defense in the quarter court really lock in They had a really good defensive scout today around Gerritter inside Grunlo the catch and the flush The freshman from Germanys got his second field goal Two adjustments down 10 off the last time out Face guarding Shrewberry and not letting him get a catch when hes on the floor and getting Grunlo back in the game Look at Sa take the Ritter downtown How about that And as soon as Micah Shrewsbury saw his son being faceguarded he took him out so that they could get better ball movement See if uh with a lead he can get him some minutes Delay a game is a the rule from Ron Groover who works tonight with Lee Cassell and Michael Greenstein Heres Hall running the Virginia offense with Mallerie Two really fine ball handlers for Ryan OD Bounce out front Thomas air ball to three cheering You know Wes when you play two point guards on the floor at the same time with Mallalerie and Hall usually you expect to get good spacing a lot of good ball movement and try to play through the post Here is Sundra bringing it front court against Grunwell Now Sir Mohamd against Hall Here comes Serta again And thats going to be a foul on Malik Thomas And Sertas hurt Hit his tailbone Malik Thomas now has two Theyre three Cavaliers Debbie with two Thomas the latest with 1048 to go See Thomas has got to beat him to the spot He He bullied him off the screen right in front of the official This is what you call bully off the screen right here Hes got to get over the top And actually when that screen is set that far out I know Certa is a shooter You might want to consider going under and shoot the gap on that Some might not want me to say this Number one free throw shooter in the ACC Now 51 of 53 on the year is the Illinois sophomore Cole Certa Remember how big the shots were he hit late last year 26 of his 28 field goals a year ago were behind the line Thats a textbook free throw Oh yes Yeah Hes hes fine You dont need He doesnt need a session No he doesnt need a session No youre good Yeah Hall Oh look at Ditter A three and were going to get a whistle on a Notre Dame foul underneath And keep in mind what a great offensive rebounding team this Virginia team is 42 of their misses They rebound 14 rebounds a game Its one of the best in the nation So Grumlo is out on back and here comes Sam Lewis the Toledo transfer and hes also going to check into the lineup to replace Mallerie So just the one guard now Don Paul on the floor for coach Odm Now this is a big lineup on the floor even with size on the perimeter Braden Shrewsbury music at 64 going to get Logan on spot ando against Brady Taylor Quick look in the corner inside They feed the Ritter and it rolls in Thats the Ritters first field goal Deb anytime you take the ball to the baseline you flatten out the top of the floor The shooters in the corner Thats some really nice work by Virginia Harelson back on the floor and he plays against Elijah Gertru red shirt sophomore from New Jersey into the Virginia order for the first time Heres Shrewberry Little runner with a right hand missed And halfway through the opening 20 minutes here in South Bend Notre Dame with a double figure lead on number 17 Virginia Gertrude on the drive Kick out Heres Paul with 10 to shoot Gertrude will fire back miss And look at Taylor go get cheering it You have a size advantage inside Im surprised theyre not throwing it on the block I think Gertrudes out there for defensive purposes more so than offense Taylor spot up jumper Good Boy a couple of buckets for Brady Kaylor with confidence Its a 610 freshman Yeah hes already put 15 lbs on that frame Hes going to continue to add muscle on left it short on a three By the way that was his 22nd triple of the year Okay so the last two shots for Virginia have not been good Okay they got to move the ball play through the post go back to their ball screen or get something off their defense like this right here D Ritter off the Swooberry turnover The Cavaliers cheering going to give it right back One turnover begins another one here but Brady Kaylor a couple of big field goals Harelson doing such a good job Screen rescreen and look at Kaylor fighting to get open using his leverage Thats where youre going to play the game low to high right there Wes If youre standing up the whole time hes going to knock you over That was just a tough play by Caleb Excuse me I mean thats the part about what Micah Shrewsberrys team is showing you here is a little bit of the fight he talked about today He was really proud of his guys in the second half against BC Yep And a nice carryover here for Tuesday night Serta off the back rim and ahead Gert Lewis thought about it in the corner Ditter will push it up and finally gathered by Sundra Shrewberry pull up three Whoa What is it you say Michael Shrewberry son cheering Braden shoot till your arm falls off Absolutely cheering My goodness 15 now in the first half Hes tied Virginia and almost turned over to Shrewberry cheering Come on Debbie Come on Braden Shrewsberry Second in the stay equal because right now Virginia has missed 11 shots and theyve offensive rebounded three That would be a low number for them I think their shot selection has been questionable Lets see if they pound it in the paint here On Yenso the catch Touts back on the floor by the way for the Irish And heres a three ball and knocked down by Lewis Great call by Ryan Odum Play through the post skip over the top Thats a great time to take a three 3118 the score Sundra on the floor with Tout Sas out there with Shrewberry and the freshman Harelson Heres Shrewsbury off the tout screen Harrelson hes probably got a little bit of a room and does Goes all the way to the basket First field goal for Jaylen Harelson at the other end Tillis cheering and theyre going to whistle a foul here I think on Sundra Thatll be his second Thatd be fourth on on the Irish Well look at this move right here by Harlson This is a fivestar freshman music Another freshman that doesnt get enough pub across the ACC headlines because theres so many great freshman in this league but he has gotten much more assertive with his back to the basket Even though he plays on the top of the floor a lot for Michael Shrewberry when he gets to the wing or to the baseline he is trying to get to the paint Free throw for Tillis is good Grad transfer from Los Angeles the former anteater That was a pretty quick advanced pass up the floor Uh Notre Dame wasnt ready for their transition defense Thats why Tillis is on the line And the second one good Four for Tillis Hes averaged seven in the last two for ODMs Cavaliers And Virginia continuing to offer some pressure in the back court And once you inbound it everybody clears out so they cant run and jump at you Sort of got caught Heres Sundrum Sort of from the logo Oh this is supposed to be the best threepoint p defensive team in the ACC Virginia thats a lot of threes in the first half for a team that only averages eight a game Mallerie on the drive threw it away in the corner trying to go to St Louis Notre Dame has hit three threes in this first half each deeper than the ones before I mean that literally is from the logo You cant even see him Hes out of the frame Wow You know it was a detailed shoot around It was an upbeat shootound It was a really good scout and prep by Coach Shberry I love the film part personally Yeah Want to thank Notre Dame for letting us sit in on the film A little old school for you I know you enjoy that Heres Certa foul And thats Carrera the freshman red shirt from the south of France his first Thats nine on Virginia with 609 to play And Cole Certa whos knocked down two threes Hes got 10 in this first half Well go to the line 10 for Serta 15 for Shrewsbury And he missed the front end and held ball going to go to Notre Dame Wasnt sure who he went out off of Certa to miss the free throw Thats news period Only his third miss of the year in 55 tries And Virginia wants to get Ditter back on the floor Theyre going to get a new 20 on the shot clock So Gruo out the Ritter in Carrer is in there to defend Theres S off a catch and shoot OUT OF THE CORNER for three How long do you think Virginia spent on that out of bounds play today at shooting Im going to say about 10 minutes Yep And you could see by the look on the staffs face like what are we supposed to do We told you they were going to run that Its hard for the bigs to chase up you know Little zone employed by the Irish Heres Ditter The catch and one Tess Ditter scores in traffic His second field goal Good ball movement across the top of the floor and then you get a step on the baseline Nice music job by Duter to get into vision on the penetration Foul was on Harelson his first Five on the Irish Derritter already two of two Make him three of three Hes got seven to lead Virginia And now Irish have got to get it in bounds And well step aside as well 543 to go first half Taylor week it was announced that Kevin Jai will miss the remainder of the season and youre talking about the two most experienced players they had returning to the lineup Well you lose your battery your point guard and your post player up the middle Yep It affects everything but its made Harelson a much better player Hes had to face up and handle on the top of the floor and make decisions and hes done a really good job Last two games zero turnovers for Harelson 12 to shoot Heres Kaylor trying to help him Now heres Shrewsbury Braden will go all the way through Skip it Harelson jump shooting And the rebound for Tison Virginia Cavaliers again will look ahead Mallerie Hall They skip it back here for Hall And now a dump down for Tillis against Shrewberry A little bully ball by Tillis and missed the layup cheering Rebound for Taylor Debon dunk it Dunk it Right laughter Dont Dont push it up there on the glass Oh you could use the glass too Four and a half to play Boy theyre picking up Serta now He will get no windows on the dribble against Hall Fall away Oh my goodness Cole Serta he and Shrewberry carrying the Irish up 18 now Derritter and one on the town foul Carson Ta picks up his second Sixth on Notre Dame Look at this right here Serva takes the bump off balance to Ritter to the line for Tester Ritter He is a much better player in person than what you see on TV Well this is the second time Ive had Virginia live and hes very athletic Yeah you can see why people were excited about him music He withdrew from the NBA draft a year ago in June He cheering was projected as a second round pick He played in uh Liga ACP a year ago Its at the highest level of European basketball Hes just got a lot of strength Hes got a lot of experience and some skill 15point lead after the threepoint trip for Virginia Notre Dame trying to get this thing to the half with the momentum theyve seemingly had from the start here tonight in South Bend Shrewberry ran into a nice screen by Sundra Heres Taylor working all the way through Foul line Rimmed out Mallerie the rebound Good D Active moving putting your chest on the ball in the corner Fall Oh nice job Shrewsbury there Tillis ran into Kaylin Mallerie with seven to shoot Trying to beat to the point will scoop and score Tough shot from Chance Malleries first bucket So quick Virginia has played a lot on the top of the floor instead of playing vertically through the paint or the middle third Tillis is shaking up Thats going to get us to a timeout So theyll first half against Carolina and the start of the second half I think if Virginia can get it to two possessions here at the break that would be um six points cut this thing in half a little bit and since the last time out theyve only taken one three and theyve played through the post Irish have gotten contributions from so many different guys Now Shrewsbury and Serta stand out from a scoring perspective but it feels like a lot of guys have had a hand in what theyve done here tonight in this first half Virginia has only trailed once this year at the half Shrewberry shot fake Ditter got him in the air Left it short Good D in that possession coming off the timeout Thomas in the corner attacking Mallerie gets into the paint and then a whistle and a foul called And quick reminder to you that Thursday night weve got an ESPN womens basketball double header Olivia Miles and TCU host Kansas First games at 600 Eastern And then Debbie and music Beth are going to be at the Maples Pavilion again Youre a few days away from California Residency Number seven Louisville and Stanford 800 Thursday Its all on ESPN and the ESPN app West Jeff Wallace team at Louisville cheering Theyve got eight players that can start Theyve got great balance They can play any tempo and that sophomore class behind Taj Roberts and Amari Barry So good Best team in the ACC right now Mallerie missed the front end of the one and one Stays a 13point game Look at Harelson just taking Mallerie to task and then threw it away trying to dial Ryder Frost Just the second Notre Dame turnover of this first half And just Harelsons first turnover really in the last three games So Micah Shrewsbury 49 years of age Indianapolis native third season here at Southbend I I think this balls going to der get in on post up right here Baseline Thomas Nice pass Derritter Tester Derritters been terrific Hes got a dozen in the first half to lead Virginia Theyve done a better job of contesting at a three and oh look at that except for Harelson sees a wide open lane Got to stop the ball Double spin dribble from Harelson Ditter cheering against Ims Thats a mismatch Powers in against Logan I couldnt finish it In those situations when youve got a small I dont understand why you counter Just go to your goto move over that left shoulder and just put it on the glass Clear out Frost thought about it And heres IMS with 10 to shoot 70 to play Logan IMS trying to work against Mallalerie Oh nice cut Frost fall away Oh that bounced out Somehow they got a great look Mallerie inside Derritter lost the handle on it Harrelson will pay for it His second foul Quick hitter up the floor in transition Naked side Little drag but really he ghosted through that Really good read by Mallerie Look how quickly Ditter moves He changes his body angle to catch the basketball I think he was passing Was he passing on that Might have been Still one and one I think he took one Right across the side of the noggin They going two shots here One and one One and one cheering Jers four for four now Has 13 points Debbie dont see too many guys with the one hand one arm release You got to have a routine at the free throw line and whatever it is you got to perfect it But how many guys do you see shoot it with the off hand off the ball cheering Not many It works Cant argue with the results People thought Sam Sneed didnt know what he was doing putting either Derritter scored their last 10 Its 11point game under a minute to go Mohamed front court against Malik Thomas Lost to Hannah Tried to keep it alive somehow or another Its in Kaylors hands And a Virginia foul Now Notre Dame a little fortunate here Debbie I thought that was chaotic music I didnt know if he traveled Double dribble We couldnt tell from our angle but the officials were hustling on the play Second on Mallerie 10 on the Cavaliers with 417 left music I think Ryan ODMs going to talk about defensive discipline about playing through the post and about continuing to move the ball You got to force Notre Dame to play against closeouts Youve got some athletic advantages on the floor that you have not exposed Taylors got six By the way the foul was marked for Ditter his first not the second on Malor Nonetheless it was the 10th on Virginia And Taylor got one of two which is right at his average 12point lead Mallerie a three You bet Chance Mallers 22nd three Hes got five in this first half Its a good job by Notre Dame to kill the clock right here so they get the last possession Inbounds Ruthberry They took about seven or eight seconds off killing it So they do hold the ball for the last possession Cavaliers going to go to the locker room trailing for just the second time this year at the break Taylor got caught in the air out of the corner That is a front rim miss for Sundra And thatll be halftime Notre Dame plays a terrific free throws Shrewberry it is of note went the last eight minutes of the first half without a point They had 15 quickly and then the Cavaliers started tightening the screws Heres Lewis on the drive Theres a rejection from Kaylor that starts the frame for Notre Dame 10 to shoot Ditter now tease a three up right wing and the young freshman Kaylor throws away the rebound Duter is a 40 threepoint shooter and he gets that wide open he should look to take it especially in the slot Out front Heres Tout He was limited with foul trouble in the first half Shrewberry the runner Tout the rebound Carson Tout bites back and cheering scores And the fan favorite of the Irish the transfer from Northern Arizona at 68 and 250s on the board his first shot Yeah had a little foul trouble in the first half Just a couple Heres Lewis on the drive Ditter the catch and score 16 now for Ditter Yep thats what they need to do right there Pound it inside with that long athletic front line How many times you think Tals brought it front court on the dribble in his career Not many Yeah what I was thinking No problem Shrewberry off the screen Kick out Always wants to get back to that right hand Sa follow again Back rim Thomas who was scoreless in the first half for Virginia He averages right at 18 or 176 in league play Move it for Lewis Good D by Notre Dame Thomas Hard drive to the basket Kaylor got a piece of it and then he battles Ditter till they cheering have a fall Itll go to Notre Dame I cannot wait to see Kaylor next year after a summer in the weight room Hes so skilled 610 He can shoot to three This is tough right here Thats backto back blocks and then hes just battling for the rebound And thats going to be a foul on Virginia There was a push against Harelson and it was Lewis Junior from Chicago transferred from Toledo to Charlottesville with the personal foul Heres Harelson fighting around all sorts of barriers to try and get the ball and it ends up in Tals hands working against Puno Carlson trying to find Serta Here he is Eight to shoot Taylor Kaylor baseline Thatll be a foul Ron Gerber on the whistle and it is on Ditter His second Debbie second on Virginia here in the second half Notre Dames patience is going to be tested here a little bit I think theyve been very patient early and town only played eight minutes in the first half so expect him to definitely have an impact here in the second Harlson Town has an incredible motor Hes a great screamer Hes constant motion Harelson to the basket in the dunk Seven now for the freshman Tow ghosted out of that screen and what a great straight line drive cheering Lewis a triple to answer Spins out Guilo the rebound and no on the stick back foul on Notre Dame I think Taylor watch out of it You got to guard the ball cheering And St Louis basically opens up his hips and Harrison drives right cheering down the line Fouls on Brady Caner by the way his first first on Notre Dame Thats why you ghost outed it Wes cheering because youre trying to confuse the defense Are they switching or not And especially right there on that part of the floor where youre already in scoring territory Johan Grunlow who is from the Kloppenberg province of Germany cheering The one thing Virginias defense has always done all season is push teams out in a way affect the quality of the catch and Notre Dame is catching the ball in scoring range and theyre able to run their stuff Tal starts the offense and heres Shrewsbury right back to Carson Tal feeds Harelson into traffic got to commit Heres Sa 10 to shoot on the drive and a foul cheering So a couple of free throws coming Dont forget weve got NBA on ESPN coming up music Wednesday night And of course your game one is the Lakers and Cavaliers with LeBron music returning to his hometown against Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs And then Spurs and Rockets at 930 NBA tip off with Ernie Shaq the Jet Charles at 600 Cant wait Those guys are so fun Yep The foul was on Thomas Its his third Virginias third Serta hit the first free throw Hes got 16 first points of the second half for Cole Serta He averaged 10 minutes a game and less than four points a year ago against the league 17 now for Certa Virginias brought ono back into the ball game to replace Grimlo or Grumlow rather Three and a half gone Heres Mallalerie on the floor for the first time in the half too Derritter on the drive and a bumping foul I think this is Tal and if so itll be his third Really nice shot fake 69 on the top of the floor Beautiful shot fake and the adjustment for Notre Dame And if you watch their body position on the wing they gave up the music baseline a lot in the first half and allowed Derritter to be available at the front of the rim Theyre not giving up the baseline here in the second half cheering Couple of free throws for Derritter Deb Ill roll this one by you I was thinking about this yesterday cheering Were going to be at the midway point of the ACC schedule this weekend Nine in nine to go for just about everybody in the league Youre thinking about first team all ACC How many do we get Five we get 10 We get five for first team Wilson and Boozer I think are locks at Duke and Carolina Then the question becomes how else does it start to sort itself out Ditter is going to get some heavy consideration He should If Virginia continues to have the kind of year theyre having that ball got dribbled away Shrewsbury will scoop it up And now trouble for Notre Dame Thatll be a turnover And to your point the talent is just much better Four teams in the tournament last year projected nine right now Correct When we come back in the snow today he said yes he did Oh yeah Paul to Virginia after the foul a moment ago trying to throw the skip but Harelson the steal Really nice job Really committed to trap with high hands and forcing turnover on the back side And Harelson you got to guard two You got to guard two over there And he does a good job 67 working on 510 Itll leave Sundra open Three Front rim Miss Caleb The run out rebound Serta tried to get the pocket pass deflected off the Cavaliers Itll stay with the Irish up 10 Here comes Jakari White who played briefly before two fouls saddled him back into the ball game Remember now this is just his second game back Remember injuries have music sidetracked him a little bit The wrist injury still plays with the brace on the left hand Well he broke his wrist in the Maryland game Yep music And its limited his time Hes just coming back He doesnt have any movement of that wrist So as a shooter thats a really tough position to be in Plus handling the ball Harelson strong with a right hand Couldnt score it Got the rebound though Thatll drive Ron Oden crazy at the Virginia bench Taylor taking Derritter and draws the foul Third on the freshman Derritter four on Virginia You look at that Notre Dame record and you go two and five in the league And if youve watched Micah Shrewsberrys teams youve seen how connected music they are how much their rhythm has improved and the the cadence in the quarter court offensively There were stretches in the BC game where they had a rhythm going on both sides of the floor And when you do that you know your teams in in a great flow and connected and doesnt matter who gets the shots you get the best shot Freshman from Fisers Indiana to the line and Kaylin knocks the free throw down ESPN top 100 player went to Micah Shrewberrys alma moater Cathedral in Indianapolis and he was teammates with Jaylen Harlson in the EBL circuit So little bit of chemistry already built in for these guys when they showed up on campus Got a nice stroke Eight for Caleb Theyve averaged just two and a half in the last two games Debbie 12point lead Looks good tonight Valerie for Lewis Quickly corner and White tried to get on the beam but the baseline couldnt cheering Tillis five to shoot Look at this Follow the way out of the corner Too strong on Yenso had a crack at it Last touch Cole Serta Boy that was 30 seconds of really good defense You got to finish it off I mean when you watch collectively how Notre Dame is moving Their rotations are good Theyre not behind the play Theyre there on the catch So Harelson out Sir Mohamd back in the ball game And into the back court will go Tillis to pick it up See thats why you cant give up baseline Wes Theres the three from Lewis Nine for Sam Lewis off all triples We didnt chart it but I bet if we did every time Virginia has gone baseline theyve been able to get a bucket Sunder coming front court against Onenso Now Serta will get a screen Look at this Three on the move Missed badly Now Tillison in Virginia six minutes into the second half trailing by nine Mallerie to cut it to six and does eight for Mallerie His second three of the night and a timeout taken by Micah Shrewberry Micah Shrewsberrys team now has to respond They played from in front Virginia trailed at the half for just the second time tonight this season You see Micah Shrewsberry is looking for a win as Notre Dames head guy against an AP ranked team here tonight for the first time Theres a Virginia foul Its on Jakari White The action that Micah Shrewsbury runs for Soda and for his son is so good because it gets them to their right hand and theyre so good at setting their feet getting their hips and their shoulders to the basket Sir Mohamd to put in play baseline Another screen from TA Heres S Mohammed on the drive down the lane Right Couldnt finish Taylor Five to shoot Heres Serba fall away in front of the bench What was going in the first half is missing in the second half And theres a bump and a foul on Kaylor on the drive by Mallerie Malleries about four rebounds a game And he immediately eyes to the rim and pushes He puts a lot of pressure on your transition defense when he gets on the glass Harelson Shrewbury back Sera out for Notre Dame Almost seven minutes into this second half Still a sixpoint game on Mallerie baseline against Tout scores They had a chance to trap I dont know why they didnt just trap him while they had him there Tout left the ball 10 for Mallerie Cant give up the baseline Man you kept talking Youve talked about it and each time Virginias done something productive from it Fourpoint game Clear out 80 run by the Cavaliers Tout the rebound and a foul which will be the sixth on Virginia and its against Mallalerie Heres the thing about Carson Town You can think youve got him boxed out You can check music and see if hes going to the glass but hes going Yeah And hes not giving up on the box out Hes going to keep working Hes one of the few guys I asked Micah Shrewsbury about it that can go underneath the basket and come back on the other side and stay in a play trying to get on the glass and hell take the inbounds pass Braden Shrewsbury at the top too strong and the rebound on Yenso So Virginia another crack to cut into the deficit just four points now White baseline bumping a foul Thatll be on Braden Shrewsbury his first four tonight in the second half on Notre Dame You get a sense that Virginias trying to speed up the game a little bit Like just trying to push right Yeah Like in the first half it felt like they were just pushing to advance the ball Now theyre doing it with a purpose to be aggressive as youve noted a couple different times to create some advantage at the baseline that operates and essentially opens up the other valves for them to score Right cheering Exactly Lewis Don Hall thought about it cheering Mallerie will gun again That spins out and Mohamd the rebound cheering Notre Dames been pretty good defensively there Debbie That is just six offensive rebounds Irish have missed their last seven Theyre just two of 11 from the floor Tal scores Really nice twoman game Two of the three Notre Dame field goals in the second half belong to Carson Tal Thats one of the actions that coach Rusberry told us that they like to go Shrewberry Braden and Carson Tout on the single side cheering Tillis double teamed Here goes Hall into traffic Tillis knocks down the three Boy Devin Tilliss second field goal of the night Hes got seven Well Notre Dame runs a lot of their stuff through the middle third of the floor Virginia runs a lot of the stuff on the baseline through the corners They cut hard out of the corners They exit cut to the corners Mohamd tried to lob it I think to tout It got deflected on Yenso And now all of a sudden Virginia can tie with a three The pocket pass on Yenso The catch and the score cheering Uhs second field goal of the ball game And its a onepoint game with 11 minutes to play Long gone is the ninepoint halftime lead and the double figure lead that Notre Dame had most of the first half Virginia has imposed their identity and they didnt do it in the first half They didnt get on the glass Theres an offensive foul screaming thats on tal Itll be his fourth Fifth against Virginia And here tonight they trailed 19 the first half cheering Here comes a double Ditter on the floor Thomas who is still scoreless by the way cheering Oh Ditter didnt walk Missed the layup Follow got knocked out of there Heres Thomas shooting for the lead and Kaylor had it inside Ditter recovers and Kaylor blocked it and then deflected to Shrewberry Irish turned away Virginia four times Sundra against Grunlow Here is Shrewsbury Foul on jumper on Hall is short Call got a piece of that Another try for the Cavaliers to take the lead Thomas and Derritter That will not count Touched it in the cylinder Basket interference All the big freshman Oh terrific camera work from our director Cory Huffman tonight Ball still on the rim Inbounds It comes to Harelson Notre Dame landed on threes in the first half Shrewberry jab step triple away Nope not in the second half Deio for five now Had a good look Knocked down eight in the first half cheering Did the Irish Cavaliers a fourth trip to take the lead cheering der at the post with Sundra backed him all the way down Garrett Sundre going to pay for it with his third foul So Virginias going to take the lead Itll be on two free throws from Tester Ritter with 9005 to go This is Virginia basketball right Guard the ball defensively get back in transition with great rim protection scoring in the paint You got to keep moving the defense music So here is Derritter at the line and he is eight for eight at the stripe in the ball game cheering Thats how Virginia has come back in this game Yep And were tied at 54 cheering Man Chance Mallerie has had a really good second half and hes back in the game here So Mallerie is in So is Tillis Thomas and Groom will sit down for Ryan ODM You know we talk about the the great freshman in the league You already mentioned Boozer and Will Caleb Wilson Yeah Right So when you put the graphic together we put Territter on it right We put Mel Brown on it Right Yeah No question Okay All right Youre youre already youre building Theres no room for the other guys If youre going to start making room for the other guys in this league like Harrison and Mallerie Yeah By the way Virginia leads for the first time since it was seven to six on the free throws by Ditter And now a foul I believe Lewis on a hold against Harelson off the ball Thatll be the second on Sam Lewis with 848 to play Couple of things in play tonight It feels like Virginias 3 one on the road in the ACC Theyve won five of six 11 of 13 Notre Dame had lost five straight to the win Saturday against Boston College They are 12 at home against the ACC Heres the one and one And it ratted out for Harelson But when you watch them and you look theyve had some bad breaks Theyve reconstructed minus Marcus Burton They and its tough when you lose your best player Yeah You lose Burton and now youve lost Kevin who was as serviceable and big as they had and was a guy who had experience in Shrewberry system all three years Tillis backs down scores with a right hand against Caleb Just a veteran move by Devin Tillis And see this Notre Dame defense is not up the line overplaying Its a defense that protects underneath so that allows them to get on the glass Its part of the reason why I think theyve done a really cheering good job limiting the offensive rebounds for Virginia to just nine But Virginia starting to come on here Irish have been outscored 22 10 here in the second half Shrewsbury has gone a long time without a point cheering roughly 20ome minutes of game time and the 72 run by Virginia will be continues to impress 23 and 12 points almost 10 rebounds a game and the front end of the one for Taylor is good and hes shooting 58 from the floor with defenses geared to try to limit his touches Thats how good he moves without the ball Yep Really impressive Second one from Kaylor cleanly through Another freshman to keep on your chart too Debbie Brady Kaylor averaging just a couple of points here in the last couple of ball games Hes played well tonight Virginias lead is one Another zone possession by Notre Dame Trying to change the rhythm of the game Seven and a half to play Baseline is Tillis Double team there with Sundra and Caleb Well you cant let them split Heres Mallalerie Six to shoot They get it back in the corner Hall first points of the night Don Hall A triple out of the corner His 19th of the year Thatll push it to back to a fourpoint lead for the Cavaliers Harelson Shrewsbury is much better getting to his right hand going right Sa cannot buy one here in the second half That hit the inline out of bounds cheering Notre Dame who was eight of 13 from three in the first half is now 0 for six here in the second half See if Notre Dame stays in that cheering zone Better go back to the man Lewis to the cutting Ditter in traffic Blocked by Sund cheering You got to go up and dunk that Shrewberry baseline Harelson all trying to help out Heres Jaylen Harrelson had it poked away Thats a foul on Tillis His second nine on the Cavaliers 101 I really I really like that emerging part of Harelsons game You know how good is he going to be when and if Marcus Burton is able to come back Oh yeah Itll definitely help those numbers when Burton comes back Harlsons going to be a more versatile player whos already a fivestar great player but there is an adjustment And when you get to play with a really great player like Marcus Burton he makes the game easier for his teammates He knows how what I call the three Ws West who to get the ball to when and where Harelson the highest rated modern player in Notre Dame basketball history Second one touched all the rim and dropped in Four cheering and a half nine in the game for Harrison who averages almost 15 against the league Twopoint lead for Virginia Lewis fighting for a spot Back to Hall who just scored a moment ago against Certa Foul line for Ditter cleanly through Ditter now with eight in the half 22 in the ball game on his sixth field goal Virginia back to a fourpoint lead Harrelson all the way through Lay up good He just rejects the screen and straight line drives it Cant help off the strong corner Theres a shooter over there Tillis in a twopoint game Mallerie again trying to get baseline Sundra commits his fourth Seven on Virginia with 538 to play Straight line drive Boom Reject music the screen Dont use it Drive it The value of Jaylen Harlson as a basketball player Debbie is expanding because of the Yes very difficult circumstances with the burn injury Im sure theres some possessions hes played on the top of the floor over the course of his career but really feeling like you have a major responsibility and there is a difference of playing on top of the floor versus playing on a single side and Im sure Burton has helped coach him up according to coach Hes used his voice a lot cheering over there on the bench to help his teammates and stay engaged Mallerie 18 of 21 at the free throw line against the league and hes missed a second free throw tonight He came in seventh best free throw shooter in the ACC tied for fourth in conference play and hes 0 for two Notre Dame a chance to tie her lead Tout to work Oh boy Reverse with a left hand and Onenso rejects it Oh boy I like the idea Carson But youre going big game hunting inside against Onenso And because onenso only has zero fouls he can be really aggressive at the front of the rim Look at this They snuck back door and Ts got six in the second half Crafty Debbie Carson Town is crafty cheering Hes relentless is what he is Hes going to play hard every possession Hes not taking one off Tied at 62 We got five minutes to play tonight Hall forced it up Rolls in Don Hall for five here Virginia keeps the press on cheering

all Don Halls got to be music aggressive and more assertive looking to score Deb they called a foul on Ditter Its his fourth with 416 to play Its got to be because he jumped on on the ground But thats

were tied again A dozen for Brady Kaylor Well Virginias not getting any transition Theyre not getting anything easy Theyre having to work for everything So you got to give Notre Dames defense a little credit for it Theyve been tough here in the second half 64 all ball got deflected then tapped away and turned over Sundra with it cheering Now youre in that winning time right here Wes where you cannot have game slippage You have to execute the details of your system on both ends Shrewberry has not scored since the 8minute mark of the FIRST HALF THAT BASELINE Kaylor hangs in the air Couldnt finish And Yenso so aggressive at the rim Yeah And as you said without a foul can afford to do so cheering Out of the corner Another three away Back miss under kept it alive And Shrewsbury for Serta Ditter and Mallerie are right back to the table And theres a handshake foul on Malik Thomas Thats going to get us to a timeout Its his fourth with 36 Disrupt and you know force you into late shot

look to do that And same with Notre Dame They both worked on it a lot in shoot sort of kind of wheeled that one in to give the Irish a twopoint edge 310 to go Ditter and heres Mallerie Paul takes off baseline Look at the ball movement Tillis and Lewis stepped out of bounds in front of the Cavalier bench cheering Another turnover for Virginia will get Tal back into the lineup to replace Sundra for the Irish The body language looks a little bit better for Virginia than it did going to the break Theyve got to play with great energy here and it has taken a lot of energy to overcome a 19point deficit Irish still playing without a three They have not had a three since the 606 mark of the first half They had eight of them in the first half none in the second half Serta by Hall on the drive Tried to feed T Ball got lost Sort of scooped up the deflection and scored cheering 21 for Cole Serta Back to a fourpoint lead with 225 to go and a Ryan ODM timeout cheering Micah Shrewsbury and the
