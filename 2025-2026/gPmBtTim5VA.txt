Little old gold versus new gold tonight And we get the party started in the Joel as the ball goes out of bounds Wake Force gets it right back Get all the energy that Raina builds you up for this first ever meeting and wake so much balance scoring Monday night Five in double figures two of those with 20 and some really ball pressure from Morehead States defense Youll see Morehead try to trap Theyre not a very big basketball team relatively speaking but theyre very quick very athletic long So theyre going to try to trap in the corner and run run and run Heres Trayvon Spiller late in the clock His first bucket is off and a scrum for the rebounds Works for the point guard champs George Marshall Jr one of two returning players for coach Maddox Marshall very good open floor player and this whole starting five Tamari Rifford excellent on Monday he had nine points no player with more than 15 though a lot of balance for the Eagles this goes inside to Rifford and hes fouled on the way up at Spillers first a veteran guy at 69 that could be an interesting matchup he versus Spillers got inside position that time played a couple years over at West Georgia and just kind of finds a way around the basket to score a really good rebound and thats an interesting match up and they go right inside to him immediately Yeah the undersized Morhead State team Early free throws here for Rford Struggled last year shooting the ball at the line 63 If youre Morehead State youve got to play a better defensive game and that means getting some easy baskets compared to what they did against Midway They found themselves down even as you know 11 points you know just at halftime and found a way to fight back but they cant get behind early against Wake Forest because Wake wants to push them up Well watch that was a track meet 8984 Morehead State pulls out a nondivision one win and heres Wake Forest Their offense was clicking 16 fast break points Monday night 221 after the made free throw by Morehead Heres the Wake starting five Mai Mason big impact addition out of Washington and Belaloos first shot is a bit off here Spillers fighting for the rebound and early on some pressure from Wake on the glass Omaha Beloos been working on that jump shot He played in and out of the season last year Had some injuries They really expect some good things out of lost a little weight Has taken that perimeter shot that time He didnt fall but the second chance opportunity gives Wake News new life with 20 seconds Harris works inside and a quick turnover How about the activity here Morehead State early Well youre going inside Its a little too easy but Drew Harris has got to be up strong with the ball and finish that play Oregon State 15 forced turnovers Monday night They struggled to stop people but you get turnovers that can help And now Josiah Indiana State transfer with the Rock Heres Marshall off a nice pick Clock inside of 10 Lets it fly Follow Josiah from the logo They like him They like him Theyve got so many new players Theyre kind of like Wake Forest in a lot of ways Trying to mix and match everything Knocked down 10 threes a season ago And he can be that spot shooter that can get on a run Good look for him Heres an open three Aloo 0 for two from deep Living with that shot Heres a loose ball and Harris puts one in The athleticism of Juke Harris One thing you cannot do if youre Wake Forest They did a little bit in the second half even though they scored 89 points was that they settled for jump shots They got excited knocking down threes dunks worked the basketball Theres some active defense Nice steal Mason pushes tempo Harris runs the rim Good transition play Nice pass and better finish Wake Forest lived on those American turnovers Monday night You talked to the coaching staff thats been an emphasis all year long is the the value of the basketball These kids really enjoy playing together and passing You saw that there Nice play Some of us would have taken that and tried to finish it ourselves An offensive screen here Legal Watch from the F Knocks it down Bam And then you got to get back and play some good defense And theyre getting on the floor Get out Pushing Watch this Take the middle of the floor Push ahead And then the strength of Drew Harris to go inside and get the basket Coach Forbes has to be pleased with the tempo here early Wake taking advantage of turnovers Good block inside Thats rejected by Relford And now transition play Marshall fakes the three Steps into another And an offensive board Relford back inside Great second chance Yeah we talked about it a moment ago Hes a very strong inside presence at 69 Two baskets early for Relford Mason dribbling into trouble Lree puts it ahead Heres a rim run No good but a tip in there and Lree taking advantage Nice job by Largree to follow up on the play Morehead State capitalizing on three early Wake Forest turnovers Theres Drew Harris He gets inside and draws the foul on Cunningham Evan one of the things that you have to be careful about if you wake for us is dont roll yourself into false and security You scored put a lot of points up You had a lot of exciting plays You got to be patient You got to be patient but you got to be fast If that makes me be quick but dont hurry Ive heard that before Yeah Well you got to be quick and be smart sometimes also And you know youre not going to knock them out Bam Bam Bam Take your time Run your offense Youll get shots Some early substitutes This is Chase Dawson the Durham native who played at Mount Olive just across the state coming in He can light it up Now can that translate from division two to division one or in this case power four basketball Thats yet to be seen And a big addition here Cooper Schwagger comes in the all Missouri Valley transfer His first minutes did not play Monday So Schwagger in there More size for Wake Harris misses the jumper Beloo on the boards hanging tough No good Nice defensive rebound Here comes Dawson the Durham native Throws one up Nice tip in Rifleford Heres Morhead State pushing tempo Another job Another great job of hustling getting back Theyre playing with some in motion C4 is not very happy with finishing players Good job there by Morehead State Well stay here during the timeout Thats six points off of turnovers for Morhead State And if youre coach Jonathan Maddox music he was under a staff that won two OBVC titles Theyre on now at JMU Preston Bradleys unit But give coach Maddox credit Winning record a year ago in his club Thats a tough game Youre losing to a nondivision one but finding a way to get the win All hes able to do here is get Morehead State off to a nice start 10 new pieces for the Eagles And you have to like the hustle and the effort here in the first five minutes It set up Morehead State with a sixpoint lead And for Steve Forbes his unit was moving the ball so well those 20 plus assists on Monday night He did know too many threepointers missing uncontested shots You want to see that improve Well and thats what theyre doing I mean you know 20 assists on 31 made field goals I think it was on Monday night and they were moving the ball and they were doing it quickly They were finishing those plays a few times So far theyve not finished them And and it gets you off sloppy And you can see the enthusiasm right there by this Morhead State team This is the type of team that they planned to be but didnt get off to that start against Midway Lree with the early foul on Miles Kovven Another chance for the Purdue product who struggled shooting the ball but he was explosive flying at the rim If if you have not seen Miles Kovven if you dont even remember him at Purdue he hes exciting Hes physical He can work his way inside as well as outside Hes got a really nice touch and I think hes going to be one of those excellent adding additions to this Wake Forest team Good defense on the baseline drive Clock in 10 and earning a foul that time So free throws here for Wake Thats George Marshall with the harm to number three Nice run a half set that time Just try to try to get something inside Get Mason involved last couple possessions Hasnt taken a shot Hasnt really looked for the ball Get inside Maybe let him post up Get excited See the ball go through the basket get rolling First free throws for the UDub transfer Slow start for Wake here early as Morehead State gets more bench action This is Clayton Parker a talented true freshman He was the Missouri Gatorade player of the year Explosive athlete at 68 Yeah And and he is going to be a guy I think if you talk to the Morehead State people hes going to really give them something as he just continues to evolve averaging almost 24 points if Im not mistaken in high school So he he can he can do some damage and just getting your taste Here you go And youre gonna have to play against bigs here To your point Jadis Jones of Lynenwood the lone returning all OBVC player He was the freshman of the year last year Bringing any talent back is so big at this mid major level Wake Forest little token pressure So Dawson returning to his home state operates the offense Morehead State an early lead here at the Joel Culvin picking up Dawson too Well see how that matchup goes Lree penetrates Nice finish Theyre a very good open floor team They want to play you know three or four out one in or even five out from sometimes as Mason fouled on the three Chance to add a treat from the line We got a timeout here in the Joel Threepoint party early and a fourpoint Morehead State lead on social media Instagram Thank you section 106 with the family who got their season up today Lets give a warm welcome to the family here Heat Heat screaming out Mike Forest trailing by four early here at home with the Joel and coming off a 21 win season double buy in the ACC tournament Some strong metrics but just short of the tournament You see the players that music Wake have had to replace in Salace and Hilddrth and Stan here in the last two minutes more effort more energy has gotten Wake back in this game It has to because you dont you dont want to get off to a poor start three of nine shooting to Wake Forest The thing that would concern me if Im coach Forbes and his staff eight paint points for this Morehead State team theyre about equal in size And also the fact that Wake Forest has got the two turnovers but theyre being outrebounded by Morehouse Well its early I know but six to three you just dont want those trends to continue Mai Mason finishes off the fourpoint play And you remember he goes to the free throw line and makes one sees one go in comes off the screen knocks down the three fourpoint play that gets him in some rhythm He gets excited now And now this highflying Morehead State offense goes back to work Heres Parker inside Intercepted Nice job there Swagger getting some important first minutes here for Wake setting a pick Calm short on the three and a foul on the rebound Six early fouls for the Eagles applause attacking the glass Part of the plan for Wake Forest this season Again you want to run you want to be defensive put pressure on you when you get a chance but make sure youre offensive and going to the going to the rack That was a nice defensive play that time by Swagger Had his hands up easily to intercept that pass and start that possession Next foul sets up the bonus and tossing the pick Hes got Eagles soaring fouronone Nice finish Well you talked about it a moment ago kid played over at Mount Olive in North Carolina and he can score the basketball 22 points a game he average 18 games where he had 20 and more cut a couple of big 30point ball games I know his two but scoring is scoring Its not just great pickles amount laughter They got great ballers too as that shot and another scrum for the boards All the aggressive scrappy plays going the Eagles way early Wakes getting one shot Nice job boxing out by Morehead State See a flurry of subset to check in for Wake Wilson misses the three and now Mai Mason off the double double in his debut Beautiful spin and earns a foul So Mason putting the ball in his own hands here lob Watch this steel Dawson knows exactly what to do with it Kid grew up in Durham Went to Mount Olive and then watch this in transition Look around See what you got makes a nice spin move Not really in contact there but misses But theres a foul on the play Continue to attack attack attack Thats it Wake up in the bonus for the next 14 minutes Well on uh by days run together Im thinking Monday Tuesday Monday night they have they made more free throws again than um than you saw out of their opponents American three plus three Last year they did that 18 times And that those all part of the the plan offensively for Wake Forest Score the free throw line be able to extend your defense And heres Mason continuing a great legacy of transfer Steve Forbes has brought in fresh off a allconerence season a year ago at Washington Marian has just checked in for the Demon Dickens Marcus Marian gets his first minutes in the post It slowed with an injury initially I think was going to start Whos got that spot right now But again theyre theyre getting a lot of people Theyre getting a lot of folks on the floor and thats what you got to like if you wait for using the depth Marshall nice drive but he misses the bunny Marrying an early rebound off the bench And now Nate Calmese the Washington State transfer pushing tempo Mason goes up top and all of a sudden eight fouls Its going to be a free throw game here the rest of the way for Wake What do you notice that they push the ball down the floor and then theyre in attack mode and and Morehead stays on their heels reach a couple of times trying to body them up and you like the fact that Wake Forest as we said earlier goes the free throw line Theyre attacking Sebastian right now Wake struggling with those free throws Just two of five Make it two of six but Kovven there to help out Coven a grown man in the paint Thats no good Nice tip drill to Trayvon Spillers who gets his bunny to drop There you go One of the most explosive players in the ACC Trayvon Spillers Nice use of the left hand Had a really good year last year after transferring in from App State He was a double double machine in the Sunb Belt He gets a rebound there for Wake Now John Carroll top scoreer Monday for Morehead State Look at this ball pressure on Dawson Clock down to six Thats a tough shot and it rolls out All of a sudden its Morehead State going one and done on offense Wake getting to the free throw line a ton these last four minutes Harris does it again No continuation on the Lee Castle call They got Marshall on a reach as he would blow by It is free throws regardless but its a one and one not a double Another guy that I think could have a really special season is Juke Harris got a little stronger Saw a quick move there And coach Forbes feels like he could be that twoway player Could be that three and D type guy for them Again watch the spacing here for Morehead Dawson flings it outside down to the freshman Nice look to Carol Patient block Harris gets a hand on it Active defense for Wake feeling this run Juke Harris takes advantage Two in D How about two and D for Juke Harris Got the block on one way in Runs the floor Gets the layup on the other Wakes activity changing this game Dawson now earns a touch foul Thats the second on the Demon Deakons Watch this Goes inside Got to power this up Weak side block And watch Harris just takes off down the floor Gets it to him early He can make a move Adjust Goes in Heres contact and scores Heres Sebastian Akens with the ball for Morehead State Back up point guard Thats a tough three and short Morehead State Four straight misses Spillers one v one Challenges the freshman Nice rebound on the back end for Carol Now Dawson as the tempo picks up eight minutes in Marshall great look Another block for Spillers cheering Only Morehead stayed off the board for three minutes So Akens gets inside misses the layup to try to run a little set right now Get Dawson involved in some high ball screen action Dawson goes away from the Thats a tough look And Dawson steps up Yeah Snaps a threeminute scoring drown Well my question about would he be able to convert Oh hold on Theres a foul Sending Kov to the line and well take the timeout Nearly a Sports Center top 10 dunk Instead some fun fodder on ACC Network Extra music in the US State an early threepoint lead back to Monday night That music bench scoring the highest ever in the Jonathan Maddox era 66 off the bench Its led to some lineup changes tonight Stan and the offense music impressive Really looking to find their rhythm out of this media timeout They they had to get some bench points because the starters at the time were were struggling shooting the basketball Had a hard time stopping midway and they exploded and made some big plays One thing you look at these stats doing a nice job on the glass on Morehead you know down only one on the rebound 12 of 111 Wake Forest leads that seven of 16 shooting for Morehead State Got to be happy with that with the fact that theyve scored 10 of the 16 points in the paint So if youre Morehead you kind of like a lot of things youre doing You got to tighten up the defense You got to stop fouling Yeah Already eight free throw attempts for Wake and theyll shoot the rest of the half And Wake Forest last year was sixth best in the conference at the free throw line you know shooting about 75 And so theyre going to get even more chances I think a lot of that was because of Salace and Hilddrth you know getting out their aggressive style I think Wakes going to go to the free throw line even more this year just because of the way theyre playing and other guys that are willing to take a hit Yeah last year was the Winter Eagles led the country 30 free throw attempts a game These Morehead State Eagles with a onepoint lead Heres a trap Got to get rid of the basketball Look for reversals Clock inside of 10 Fakes it Now he steps back for a three The teardrop is off Wake limiting Morehead State possessions Nice job of contesting by Atkins Drive Harris stripped Good hands and then a interesting pass that goes out of bounds Relford a little off target Well you know what It was a Youre right It was a good read It was great timing because you saw the defender leap in the air but he just put a little too much air under it you know But I that was a good decision I think Yeah Morett stayed early They were great in transition They had the second chances Its been harder to find offense It would have been then too had he just you know either kept the dribble or made just a little better pass in front Good pass to Harris He draws contact and its all way kind of this timeout Yeah Wake Forest really using their athleticism and their length and getting inside Not a lot you could do if youre Morhead State Goes inside against Lere Lgree is about six feet tall You know Juke goes about 66 67 on a good day and just goes inside and just does work Whats the coachs nightmare Five players with two fouls now for Morhead State Yeah You see how aggressive Wake is continuing to attack the basket Thats shifted this game in the last five minutes Well I would you know yes you want to knock down threes if you can but I want to try to get you in foul trouble I want to get the easiest basket Just continue to attack Moreheads not shown that Yeah that they can stop that Yeah Morehead States bench scored 66 Monday Tough news is if youre running out of players that Yeah complicates things laughter The good news bad news why are you on the bench Nearly halfway through this first half Lree with a beautiful dish Good shot fake Theres Cunningham Theres the USCA can transfer Wow Nice job But I was watching trying to see the baseline to the side if he stepped out of bounds on his catch Great balance Nice foot control is able to knock down that three First big bucket for Cunningham Hes coming off the bench tonight Needed basket too Akens wiggles Heres Marion He pops a three Thats his second triple Thats good to see Marcus Marian was set out all last year with an injury Limited minutes the other night And if he can be that extra that 34 guy 345 in some systems thats just another bonus for Wake Forest that versatility And heres backtoback turnovers for Morehead State Watch this Watch this Theres a kick the drive shooter ready Thats a nice jump shot for Marcus Marion And then again just keep moving the basketball The skip pass stayed in head and shoulder fake relocate and buries the three This is Cunninghams third stop in three years UNCC Asheville USC Hes circling the Carolinas now Hes in Morehead Kentucky Might be the top player for coach Maddox He said I love him off the bench His instant impact is so big Now Mason in attack mode He dishes Heres Cal Mazize off on the three and Parker lost it Theres a second chance bucket for Wake Look what I found keep the ball alive and Drew Harris did something that I really like to see He got low as the ball got low you know and just went down picked it up and then scored Didnt try to bat it try to shoot at it Perks of being a returner The whole crowd juke on that layup Just a nice play Parker a travel that time A freshman mistake cuz Morhead States offense a bit stagnant here the last five minutes Well whatever coach Forbes said at that most recent timeout it really stuck because theyve come out they really contested shots got their hands in passing lanes made everything offensively for Morhead State a little more difficult Schweger returns for Wake He had his first minutes earlier this half An uber talented prospect at a Valpo Now Harris gets inside Hes got a nice mismatch and taking advantage of that size Theyve had a lot of success in two basketball games of getting the ball in the middle and looking for the backside cutter And Juke Harris if he can get ahead of steam and get in the paint hes going to score get fouled and maybe even both Thats a nice execution by the Digs Coachs dream Six buckets nine assists a lot of balance and a bad pass Calme scoops it Hes in transition What a rejection Oo a late foul on the Great Thats his third I could see goending maybe but yeah the calls a foul on the drive Well Cal Me his role has changed a little bit so far where he was a scorer last year at Washington State averaged about 15 points a ball game and and a traveled player that is a veteran and now hes more of a facilitator and and you saw that there But when he had the opportunity to score I I I thought it might have been a good block Got him on the body going down But I love I love his aggression If you get him scoring along with these other guys on the perimeter man laughter Man what Mason and Spillers did Monday you compliment Calis to that he had a monster Exactly cheering T a little chippy Little talk little talking to just a bit If Im if Im Morehead State Ive got to find a way to settle in his final 824 just you know be smart get some shots Its an 11point swing in the last five minutes And Morehead State who lived in transition early Coach Maddoxs team its all gas no breaks Tough to find a buck in the half court here They were able to do that because their defense has stepped up They made Wake Forest take some shots maybe not so good And a couple of times they were contested See how far theyre pushing their offense away Bellford the handoff Ball movement to Maloo and Ward dribbles into trouble and a steal Not a handler from that far Mason lays off Beloo circles in a rare transition miss for the Deaks Can Cunningham counter tough pivot and another miss shot Thats four minutes without a bucket and a foul here leads to immediate timeout Wake Forest its largest lead of this first half We got more fighting night hoops after this music Since 2009 Wake Forest Athletics has teamed up with schools in Pres County to encourage reading among fourth grade students and of engaged readers in Winston Edward Huttle and Drew D Marantonia helping you out in the studio And theres Drew Harris carrying the load half of the wake scoring early I think hes got to improve and I think he will Hes a sophomore is bigger like we said stronger is that free throw position just a shade over 60 a season ago knocks down one of two now but as his game evolves getting those free points just make him a better player very important time if youre Morehead State right now find this game slipping away only one assist with eight turnovers earlier it was different different time good pass on the three thats three straight minutes without a bucket officials checking itll stay Its a 153 Wake run Warren State came out of the gates with transition buckets Second chance looks and now Rifford in the post Hes tripled Relford banging bodies Thats no good Tip out Active hands for Maluke Dawson Another miss And Juke Harris not just on the offensive end getting it done here Hes an impact piece as a returning starter and a deep three for Juke Little heat check but another foul So free throws coming up for Wake Cunningham So one at State two players with three fouls Three other players have multiple fouls Youve been in these moments as a coach How do you handle Ive been in these moments as a player watch watching teammates pick up I want to pick Im not going to foul like that But yeah you you just got to milk it And the problem is you knew the T was coming He knew the T was coming Coach Coach is a little upset about you know number of fouls Felt like his guys got fouled on the other end But the thing of it is is that you got to tell your guys guys I can argue that the subtle fouls but some of these are blatant you know pushing the block coming down Not a lot you can do about it And you know Wakes has got to take advantage of it But yeah its a terrible thing right now And theyre theyre down a couple of players You got any eligibility left You know if you and I could check in we might help out in the second half Foul trouble picks up cheering Jonathan Maddox has two returners Roster loaded with new transfers right now Foul trouble the big story Wake though has missed eight free throws So thats kept Morehead State in the game So Omaha Blue was fouled earlier He goes to the line A little fullourt pressure Token show it Make make here if youre more stiff Offense offensive integrity Move the ball inside out G cutter set a solid screen like the baseline Theres a shot coming Theres a deep three No movement that time and a rebound foul Theres some effort from Ellford down low That wasnt the one I was looking at I was watching Dawson come off the baseline screen And if you just been we talk about being patience just be patient Let that evolve you get a shot That ball movement was so crucial in the first 10 minutes of Morhead State up and down They had a eightpoint lead Wakes defense smothering sense Yeah but you got to you got to take smart shots I mean Wakes doing a nice job contesting putting pressure on you putting balls on you But see like he played out of a double team moved the basketball And Morhead State scored 89 points Monday There was no trouble putting the biscuit in the basket Yeah but they had they were behind They had to score I mean they they Heres Maluke First minutes Almost an over and back There was a tip Now inside Rford Hes doubled Good ball movement Heres a three and a tip out Nice second chance Thats where Morhead State was effective living on these second moments And theres Marshall Its a hard way to get a basket And weight comes right back at you And a reach in here on Dawson And so now Dawson has a foul Nine of the 10 guys have come in have committed the foul for Morhead State Chase Dawson first personal might be a war of attrition in the second half for Morhead State and if youre wait for you continue to be aggressive but thats can that thats you calling a foul fine but part of thats lazy defense you let the defender you get in defense stance and then you get out of your stance and you just decide to play Olay defense and reach and theyre going to have to call that foul especially if youre driving and driving aggressive like Juke has been doing the last few possessions So if youre mov you you got to play threes You got to move your feet That foul its not just bonus plus Its 15 fouls in the first down Lots of pluses And they got away with one just there on the box out cuz you saw Rford I did anyway Hooked him and yet foul trouble Just a ninepoint game thanks to Gree seven He was explosive in the first five minutes Comes out here Theres a double Dawson stripped and a foul Blue with the reach in Okay now both teams understand something how theyre calling it Theyre not going to let you take advantage of the basketball Okay So if you reach if you stick that hand in there if you trip somebody if you trip that Yeah I cant even get it out quick enough But that thats thats their officials going to call So now its up to you as a player to make the adjustment Okay You know theyre going to call it Do you bring that up at a timeout as a coach You you as a player I mean you got to know that I mean you you you hope you would but yes you got to tell him you got to tell the guy Hey guys heres Maloop going inside Creativity His shorts are sagging Hes still finding ways to score Nice Nice Jumped out of him at 13 against Midway the other night which was one of his highs careerwise Some nice take to the hole that time Marcus Marion returns for Wake Forest John if if Im Morehead State to further your point about what you talked to your kids try to find a way to milk this thing for 539 Get to halftime so we can reset First ever meeting Morehead State Wake Forest Zone right now Just a little free throw game here in this first half Else good movement out of the zone Kovvin drives and hes stripped Now Cunningham Marshall with numbers Marshall attacks Nice finish Hell get free throws Say that again What did you say Attacks Exactly Thought they thought they may have messed up the uh thing Watch this a moment ago Watch this Drives down Nice finish there Can I ask you Well I had finished telling you about that yet And then you finish out and your pants come out Now we talk about the fashion state Pants too big You know they wear belts in baseball They could wear them in basketball if you needed Okay there you go There you go There you go Whatever it takes No just get a pair of pants that are a little tight enough for you Or either how about use that string and tie it This aint that hard We make stuff more difficult in life than it really is It aint hard Its a fashion statement Yeah hell be on Broadway in No Fashions go out of style but needed backto back baskets for Muhead State So now you settle in play smart Team captain George Marshall Jr goes one and two You notice they went zone on that last possession but still tried to reach when the guy got by him Theres a little showing a little trap Be big be on the basketball and Wakes got to recognize that One of the first looks against zone this year for Steve Forbes club Its a deep three Thats off Kovvins tip Marion inside A lot of footsteps in the paint Thats a really active defensive possession Akens gets inside Spillers that time it rattles in Good ball movement Nice job defensively by Morehead State You know they dont want to foul Made Wake Forest work a little bit Wakes able to get inside once again and finish the play All five players touched the rock there for Wake on that possession Theres Jacob Wilson He played just four minutes Monday with all foul trouble The bench deep here for the Eagles Pressure on Carol Heaves a prayer Mary in the interception Great job by Mariam in the interception spot Steve Hors gave a little dap on the way down the floor That was a great job defensively Coach Jake Dicker loved that secondary play Heres the three and its in And then theres the payoff Trap the corner throw a crosscourt pass have a position player to intercept it run it down in transition and then get a basket And a timeout here for Morehead State Wake Forest coming to life with ball movement in the last four minutes Turnover leads to a three Demon Deakons up music 11 We have the rest of the first half after this Well see you Sunday November the 16th Secure your seats right now at fans Please welcome back to the floor your W presented by GoPro Put your hands together Hallelujah Turkey Heat Heat Closing minutes of music the first half Wake up 11 Juke Harris has taken over in this first half and Morehead State so aggressive in transition early but the turnovers have cost the Eagles here down the stretch Wake Forest has come out this this middle eight minutes Done a really nice job moving the basketball getting some easier shots and doing a great job on the glass Eight offensive rebounds for the Demon Deacons 15 rebounds total music for Morhead State Morhead State if Morhead State could keep Wake Forest off the free throw line this game would be even closer than it is Wake Forest at 11 of 20 from the line so far Got making free throws out you know as this game goes Remember Morehead State shot 68 as a team Monday Theyve been held in check in this first half Heres Jacob Wilson inside of 10 And a bad pass Loose Scrum Here comes Wake Akens on the move cheering Nearly our first dunk of the night Another unforced turner over a mistake by Morehead State Come off the double Just dont panic Take your time Picked up the dribble there Youre in trouble Not a ton of ball movement here for Morhead State Parker gets a catch and shoe That was tipped Coven pushing tempo Great hands Theres Marshall Marshall throws one up Hes fouled cheering Its a big time finish against Drew Harris You know what from this angle I dont know that he really d you know about Watch this up though This is just what Im talking about You picked up the dribble Theres no real pressure there Everybodys got their back to it and then away you go And just not quite enough lift right now Its okay But watch this Does he make contact Yeah I I guess he did I guess he does with the body low but youre very lucky Well for your bingo card at home thats 22 combined first half fouls A game of whistles Well thats one of those again you know I I I dont mind that Duke contest to dunk Thats a pride thing defending the basket Like I said I dont mind him contesting it but sometimes you got to understand your foul situation Nearly made it Relford tomorrow Reford comes back in 60 games of experience at West Georgia Now how do you manage this final three minutes if youre staying to extend some pressure a little 221 They drop back in the zone Zones been successful in slowing Wig down a little bit including Vince Dawson the third who gets his first minutes And he defends the roll to the basket very well And heres a foul on Dawson No its out of bounds Out of pardon me steps out of bounds Ive been fooled by whistles before Well yeah Thats why you know you got we got to wait We got to wait But yeah it was it was the a good defensive job of kind of boxing him out not letting him elevate on the weak side lob 15 team fouls for Morhead State in this first half Everyones checked in off the bench Spillers inside Look at Spillers drawing more contact on Rford Its his first Good thing was for Spoilers hes able to get a foul but getting the ball free throw line extended in the black right there the ACC logo youre not going to get many better shots But because hes 67 68 and he elevates so well he can put the ball on the floor one time Theres no shot blocker really in the game from where state and elevate In this case he gets the foul So it worked out really good for him but something in his bag of tricks as the game goes on maybe against bigger longer players as the season goes So Mai Mason returns in an ACC conference Five players on the Carl Malone watch list for best power forward in the country Weve seen Spillers athletic those 20 points Monday And Wake needs a player in the post they can lean on for points come conference play Well I dont know about if they got to be a pre post player because theyre going to play with three or four out and you keep the post open But what Im saying is that when he gets the ball in the paint like that hes got to be alert that sometimes youre not going to be able to just power and elevate and score against longer taller players Hes active here defensively in a reaching against Wake Thats on Akens State in the bonus Sebastian you know this is time We got 16 team fouls on Morhead S Is that the last count Yeah 16 And now eight You almost have to tell them to go back to elementary basketball You run up on the guy put both hands up and just get in a stance and stay there If he does that and seals that trap its not going to be a tripping You kind of go back You got to go backwards a little bit and turn down some of the aggression All right cheering for Jim So Dawson back to the line in his home state return Chase was a conference Carolina freshman of the year Mount Olive last year Great player Score He can he can score a lot of ways Nate you and I have done a ton of those Kataba games at D2 level You can get up and play at any level Heres a tip drill to Parker That goes loose Nice save from the freshman Great job there Now Dawson pushing tempo for Morehead State Now be patient Nice I like this Try to set something Dawson shows his ability to score off the bounce Bad turnover off his own foot and Dawson thought he hit Mason We know the milk in the clock Its no field goals in the last four minutes for Morehead State Well its its not so much milking as it is trying to slow your tempo and get a good shot as opposed to those you know and make Wake Forest defense work a little bit But you know cant turn it over Theres your trap Reverse it right there Good movement from Marion Short on the three though Wakes missed some open looks Aens a deep three that rattles out Another chance Heres Marians turn Everyone jacking up threes That one no good And a scrum on the rebound Little 4v4 Like overtime hockey Now in the paint Refruit Heres the freshman Cant step up from three Not the tempo you needed from Morehead State right now Wait for us Just continue to pound the glass second and third chances Nice lob inside Little tip drill Spillers and another scrum in the paint Possession there should should they continue like it is is going to go Morehead States way So this might be a chance to go two for one but get a good shot Dawson doubled and will stay here 12 on the clock Eagles so successful in those first 10 minutes Lebanon transition second chance buckets But you see the length not so much the size but the length Long arms of the Wake Forest players Look at Marion you know gets out there in the passing lane Calvin gets out there in the passing lane And so you know 67 becomes 69 610 with length You got to test your pass You got to shorten the distance and you got to come hard off cuts Dawson goes outside Oh side of the backboard Wakes defense stepping up to close out the half on this end Akins no look dying Marian blocked and a late foul sends free throws foul charge to number three The 17th team foul for Morhead State And his third So three players with three fouls You dont see many box scorers where Wake Forest is on pace for 25 first half free throws They have missed double digit shots now Wait can use I mean Morhead can almost use this entire clock So horn set try to run something high low if you can again reverse Theres releoot feeds Parker clock to six The freshman needs help Dawson drives Dawson in three and earns a foul Thats a nice job Thats a scores mentality Nice job of Dawson Turn the corner So he had the defender off balance and then goes into the defender So its either going to be blocked or youre going to get fouls A smart play by Dawson Chase Dawson who had a guest list of 20 plus coming over from Durham But check him out tonight Takes advantage Seven points now Team leading scorer So he makes his free throw Okay and and you dont allow Wake to score Psychologically youve got to say to yourself Hey weve overcome a whole bunch of fouls some missed free throws some exciting inside play by the other team and were still in this basketball game 221 will slow him down Wakes got to make a good decision Got time 20 seconds for Akens He heaves a three and its good What a way to end the first half from way downtown here in Winston Salem free throws attempted Jonathan Maddoxs team had played with pace and space Thats the emphasis for Morehead State They had it five minutes in but then Wakes defense I I you know Im sorry laughter Offensive foul on the pick I was about to say pace and space you know thats a nice idea but when youre down and youre turning the ball over like that you got to come up with other plans And when they were slow and very methodical for this game for today you have to you have to make adjustments like you know we were talking about starting line It dont matter You adjust with what you got See and they didnt do that You come out there very careless loose screen and its a turnover And and if Wake is efficient they take advantage of this with a basket Out of the break misses the three Good rebound Spillers Wakes now offensive rebounding all day Masons three Third time not the charm but maybe a fourth Wow And then a tip drill Agree playing with four fouls Great dish to Marshall Hello Nice job there pushing ahead and wait three four opportunities to score Couldnt do it And you hold on So you still get the basket back if youre morehead state And Mason gets an easy layup Too easy Wake pushing a little more of the gas pedal offensively Steve Forbes loved the ball movement Monday And heres a foul on Kiss Very subtle foul by Cal Me Just got him on the hip Okay here Watch this Watch this Push ahead That was after the long rebound and you finish Smart Didnt hang on the rim Then watch this drive inside again Wheres the defense The middles wide open Easy baskets And Lree with those four fouls Hes got to be smart Yeah Well you cant Yeah hes got to be smart And they cannot just go basket for basket right now Just just that pacing and spacing and stuff you know Okay Hey we did that Yeah but you gave him another basket on the other end Your daddy got some stops Baltimore native back to the line He goes two for two Hell be subbed out Smart call Chase Dawson comes in Dawson shined the Durham native in his quick minutes That whole Dawson family right behind the coaching staff And a bad pass goes out of bounds I mean again you got to lock in You got to lock in Thats just a mental mistake by Omaha Blue Pass was a little low but he caught it Catch it and face up Wait everybody to come Thats Thats just a mental mistake Spatial awareness Its a lost art sometimes where youre at on the floor No just lock it in I dont know about space I mean you know it just catch the basketball Smart Theres a good foul and a reach in First half had 27 combined fouls Heres our third of the second half You said something about coach Decker a few minutes ago Good luck to them tomorrow night as they travel up to Strawsville He would be very impressed with some of these takedowns in this game cuz Cal Mis has wrapped his arms right around That would have been a great tackle there on short yardage You know every program has walkon tryyouts typically Well he aint got time right now But theres a kick ball that stays alive but I mean thats just thats just again lock in Play smart Corner three Morehead State finding the rhythm Four threes You give them an opportunity they take advantage This is a team that can score the basketball Scored 60 in the second half Monday Were trailing an NIA program They shot the lights out against Midway Akens with a nice jumper His three before the half was huge And now we have a loose shoe Do you double knot this Do you just strap it on Theres no tying of the laces Lets just slide the slipper in Well if the slipper fits Cant believe he didnt tie his shoes Theres DaVon Cunningham USCA can transfer Word State trying to find better offense in the half court So Marshall tease up a three Miscommunication And I was trying to watch this to get a better look and you saw blue just kind of go after the double up Didnt need to double anybody They make the reversal get a score and then theres an an unnecessary foul 13 foul for Morehead State So Marshall has four Lree has four and theres still a lot of basketball to go Thatll force Vince Dawson the third to come in a Georgetown Kentucky native Grew up just within an hour here of Morhead State Difficult pass Three minutes into this second half Wake struggling with turnovers Theres another And now the Eagles in transition Cunningham Take advantage of it Hes smart Way off for three Maloo air ball SPILLERS RUNS THE LANE HELLO Great job in converting the weak shot Take it down the floor No one stops the ball Spillers makes you pay Thats a grown man dunk from Spillers Heres an open three Spillers big on the glass Hes fouled on the rebound Okay again its a air ball or short shot One dribble gets the hole and theres not anything you can do about it from a physical standpoint or even from a numbers standpoint because you got foul cover You cant contest it And thats a smart play taken strong to the basket by Spillers and finish it Explosive athleticism from App State transfer Trayvon Spillers And now Clayton Parker talented freshman comes back in for Morehead State in this zone defense Wake very effective moving the ball against the zone in the first half and Akens rejected by Rifford Okay man I I Im looking at some stuff Im just looking at some things I need I need to see everybody talking I want to see you take control Get this in Set a solid screen Plenty of time Okay All right So wheres the communication Lets just watch this Should I have big zone HC There you go Kicks it to Harris Ball that leads to a three Couldnt get it done QUICK ENOUGH YOU SEE IT The zone Great shot there Our camera crew stayed on that Kept the middle wide open Flash to the ACC logo Youre in the middle You can do a lot of things Reverse back to the weak side buries a three Those are the open threes that Wake was missing Monday Theyre finding more success in those uncontested looks Another possession inside of 10 for Morehead State Relford double Cunningham pops Thats a tough look Way short Thats their ball Akens pushing it Heres a lob Nice deflection Save to Sports Center dunk Parker fakes the three A lot of tempo to open this second half Shorting the triple Dawson Mason Spillers rewarded for running the lane We talk about being unselfish An excellent decision by Mason Got in rhythm Could have knocked down the jumper but a big guy runs the floor He rebounds on one end Reward him on the other with the finish Timeout Morehead State Wake Forest A little 70 run to open the second half Well be right back after this Heat Heat Give me the money Keep it up Happy birthday hallway Quick now 14 in the second half thanks to a nice 70 run music This is what it looks like when its right You force a shot You go in transition Spillers comes out to attack the middle of the gap Make the pass to the weak side Shooter ready to shoot Knock it down And then again just beat the defense down the floor Make the play Finish strong Thats what Wake Forest ideally would like to do all game long We know it cant happen all game long but when it does happen boy does it look nice Nice job by the Dicks Now can Morehead State respond That athleticism has led to five of the last six easy buckets for Steve Forbes unit and the ball movement stepping up here out of the halftime break Morehead State meanwhile the foul trouble starting that up now The Gree has four Marshall four and Cunningham three Top three scorers all battling foul wos to open the halfer as Cooper Schwer reenters for Wake even more size with a big match up with Michigan looming next week Dawson with a bad pass That Wake activity defensively shifted this game in the second half Theres Mai Mason He tried to slip one through and a Wake turnover And we have a quick timeout out of this break Well be right back with more basketball here in Winston Salem after this timeout music season on Saturday at 430 pm and well see you in the legacy Its time for trivia with Michael and its time for brought to you by Legacy Federal Credit Union Were going to throw a trivia question up on the board right next game against All right lets see what that question is All right I like to see in 1967 right here also in 1967 Wake Forest became Wake Forest University What was it called before that Ladies and gentlemen give it up one more time This is amazing Foul trouble music continues to be a story tonight for Morehead State You see Marshall and Mcgri have picked up early fouls their fourth And when youre playing with foul trouble St Youre kind of playing with fire with 15 music minutes to go It takes you out of a lot of things So but hey got to play through it Wake Forest is taking advantage of that A 70 run out of his last timeout break And you start music to tell the athleticism the defense the toughness of Wake making a difference in this second half for a Morehead State team Would love to copy the formula for Murray State 18 time OBC champs They had an upset win in the tournament back in 2021 Made the Sweet 16 And heres Morehead State coming out of the timeout Parker has it The true freshman Good back door look Excellent ball movement to Wilson Well thats how you draw it up but no good on the three Akens on this end He loses it going out of bounds Itll stay here His three felt like a tagger before 21 on the clock Just got to play through this now Everybody talking 21 on the clock Morehead State got away with one right there Three in double figures including Juke Harris whos taking over this game at moments Oh good look That is a strip Now numbers for Dawson He goes one v3 Cunningham swings it and a steal This is the man of the hour Juke Harris missing the dunk One of the few things hes missed tonight Simplicity and execution I understand I understand it But hey just finish the play And this is what kind of happened about this same point in the game last week uh you know against American where there were opportunities some dunks some threes that were there missed some plays and kind of got laxidasical So youre not faulting him for missing that play but you got to make those plays and continue the good the good mojo thats going on right now Pushed a big lead early in this first half Parker harassed at the threepoint line Reford underneath How did Wilson get that No good Aens has it 3v1 Harris puts that one down Took it up with two hands and attacked it that time Thats nice Much better job on finishing If youre Morehead State you had two good opportunities You got to be stronger with the basketball but a good job of going from conversion converting from defense to offense and getting a basket And a new career high for Harris in a Wake Forest Uni So Rifford banging bodies Hell test Schwiger down there and earn a foul in this half Both teams were well away from the bonus All right push it down Watch him go up strong off both feet with two hands Make darn sure that ones going to go in time this time Watching that boom boom boom He learned his lesson after that missed dunk Salsbury native Hes been explosive in these first two games You think of what Hunter Salis did last year as a all ACC caliber athlete Wake needs that superstar Kovvens played well Could Harris fill those shoes and be a big time scoreer at least through two games has been impressive And now Vince Dawson will sub in for another bit of foul trouble Wilson comes out with two The ulm transfer cheering And now one more John Carroll will check in He was a double double machine at the junior college level played D2 at Missoula College Stepped up out of the Tallahassee native 221 Here we go Take your time Move the ball Good pick and roll Coven swated away Good minutes from Carol Comes right in and gets a block Now Cunningham on this end He wants a foul and it goes out of bounds And that was well done on both sides Nice job of attacking the pressure Got the ball in the middle and get it inside Watch this Nice job Goes up strong Gets the block Meet me at the rim And then you come back down the other end Thats well done And needing to foul now Okay Take advantage of it Morehead day Cunningham back in the game Davon really difficult look And Drew Carris cleans it up One rebound from a double double cheering Nice ball movement Akens air ball Not the cleanest second half for either team offensively Parker will reset Carols got good position in the post Dawson the third off on the three and then Dawson gets it back Theres Carol with the layup Look what I found Last couple possessions you had to juke dunk But again two out of those three have been empty possessions for Wake Forest In some ways somehow more says capitalized Theres your trap Keep the ball moving Kovvens three Rattles out and a foul on the rebound here Wake will earn it So thats Vince Dawson the third with his first foul Now every player who subbed in for the Eagles has committed the harm tonight third is first Please win the contest for your team in his NCA debut and a debut for Jaylen Cross the Greensboro native cheering Met his family Monday night Greensboro folks and and just so excited proud of him what hes going to do Think hes going to have a nice career here Got to wait his time Good play Good dunk for Marian So with a newcomer in cross the Marian gets on the board as well And these are important early in the season Get your depth See who you have come conference play Weve seen Morehead State by necessity play Every player eligible on the roster including Parker the freshmans three is no good Look at Cunningham soaring for the rebound No Second chance a bit off Wakes these battles in the post here early Theres the freshman His debut three just offer the rebound in his first game for Wake Now its Harris Its been Harriss week here in Winston Nice Very nice job Find the open man on the reverse off to the rebound and Juke Harris is just so smooth today We talked about it earlier Possible three and D player Hes doing a nice job

Monday impressive nearly a double double and in todays stand even better here against Morhead State 23 points for Juke Hes had a huge second half and has helped fuel the pull away effort Morehead State continuing to ravage through some foul trouble Well the Gree comes back in with those four fouls Top point guard and George Marshall Jr gets big minutes Hes also playing with four So now hes got to be aggressive but be smart Omaha still hanging around Get a little run going Omaha Belaloo will set back in for Wake Heres some ball movement and Dawson the third short on the three Those quick jump shots those long jumpers Wakes been able to get all those rebounds and turned them into something positive Either transition break layups or running your half court offense and getting the score Theyll get something spoke too soon Carol forces a turnover Heres holds his pivot foot Oh and then he lost it Marshall a deep triple How about that range Nice Nice three I think LED kind of caught a little Charlie horse or something or whatever in his back Hes cramped up He How about Juke Harris 26 Of course Of course he has Unfortunately a little injury here for Morehead State as well Lgree he got bumped Hell sub out Yeah he was in a lot of pain that that entire sequence and then after he got rid of the pass went down and looked I think maybe a shot in the ribs or something But Juke Harris tying a careerhigh on threepoint baskets now his third But hes just been in a rhythm and hes and and right now for Juke the basket is huge and you can see it Hes playing with a lot of confidence Well Juke with these 26 points we think of the most improved player in the ACC Donald Harris from a year ago at Boston College He doubled his scoring from one year to the next That could be the jump in year two as Wake searching for that signature scorer on this end A missed triple for Morehead State And now Cross in his Wake debut is intercepted Good hands by Marshall Marshall wants it back Marshall he goes to the bucket There you go Good job in transition And this is what theyd like to have more state going up and down up and down up and down But you got to get some stops Very lucky there on the defensive play Those transition scrappy buckets have been huge for Wake Forest as now Isaac Carr checks in The Portland Oregon freshman hes got a ton of potential as well as Cross comes up short and Swaggers there to clean it up Nice follow basket by Swagger Again he can score the basketball Had an outstanding twoyear career at Valpo And again if you can give them some inside presence he will be valuable for this team Pressure on the ball Run your offensive set if youre Morehead Coach is telling move move move Nice minutes for Schwagger in his debut You see the depth of Wake Forest tonight Harris the star but complimentary pieces Well you got to get some people in today I mean you you have to kind of use that bench See what some guys can do under fire Marshall under fire The shot clock unloads Nice job again Marshall running your half court offense Steve Forb was a little disappointed that they didnt get the stop but a good big time shot by a big time player in Marshall Remember Marshall made just one field goal Monday He couldnt buy a bucket today Hes been draining these deep threes Carr with a no look Beloo missing the layup but a second chance Carr a lot of traffic and no whistles Theres the big forearm shiver of Vanoir Maluke out of the Netherlands You made a hard shot more difficult with that adjustment So and aint going to bail him out that time and take advantage of it from West You still got a lot to play for with 824 to go Just keep running your sets Dawson no look Heres a wideopen Maluke He goes in and is rejected What a swap by Kovvin Heat check time Coven the dishes and a steal Now Malook runs the break That time the dunk and a timeout Well take this 30 second timeout Wake Forest up 13 A lot of hoops to go here in Winston Salem All right fans Direct your attention to the video Its time for the Dominos Pizza it up now Lets go Congratulations If youre hungry I need you on your feet Thats it Across the state of Kentucky no ones done it better over the last 5 years than Morehead State Not just 110 wins but two trips to March Madness in that stretch And thats the challenge for Jonathan Maddoxs program Second year head coach Thats the legacy of Morhead State the last 5 years And tonight foul troubles been a big issue and not finding enough offense here against a scrappy Wake Forest team Too many turnovers some forced shots not getting back on defense but other than that and foul other than that pretty good And this is the team I think theyre preseason pick number five or six in the OVC and Ill see a couple of those other teams as this next couple weeks go there This is a good basketball team thats going to get better I mean you got to understand you know this early November obviously youve got a lot of new faces new players and a lot of guys that did different things They were big scorers one play So you were defensive specialist thats now asked to do something So it takes some time but but I like what I see minus the turnovers and I mean the fouls out of this uh Morhead State team A little two guard trap here How do you handle it Coven swings it Ill go the other way Nice duck Nice call And and youve got some younger players that need to gain some experience So you you put them under the fire I dont need you to fill up the box score I dont need you to do anything but but execute and run your set They didnt do it that time Difficult look that rolls out Offensive rebound Carol and hes stripped Cross run in the break Wake has lived in transition tonight Heres a no look to Cart Nice dish and Spillers gives it up Cunninghams been a oneman wrecking crew here for Morehead State And then Dawson steps out of bounds See those are thats court awareness Thats being in the moment And I know Spillers has been told a million times you know as a post guy dont put it on the floor like that His his dribble didnt take him any place And because of that he ended up getting stolen But fortunate another one of those unforced what weve seen weve seen a guy step out of bounds on one side We had a baseline step out of bounds Weve had a couple of missed dunks Both teams some first week and and nah that aint What are you nervous about I mean no no no no Absolutely not Just no nervous I nervous you know first game No backcourt violation No no no no Its its its staying in the moment playing the game not worrying about the crowd play Juke Harris continues to be a demon on this end 26 and counting So youre nice Youre trying to bail them out I aint nothing No no no no no no No You see that Look at the court Look at the Joel Colise Theyve done a great job the last couple years remodeling refurbish Look at that big black baseline banner that goes all the way on the side If youre on the side of the parket thats thats legal If youre in the black youre not Dont step in it That aint that difficult Nearly a steal laughter And then look at the effort out of bounds though from Josiah Lgree Hes been playing with four fouls the last five minutes I love it Lay out for the basketball He and Coven both competitors Lree is a freshman He was a backup point guard at Indiana State but wanted an opportunity Coach Maddox had a previous relationship from his OVC days Mary is back in the game Lets see how active hes going to be Juke is on the wing Spillers in the middle Theres Spillers Goes into Carol Thats 0 for8 start for Spillers A lot of easy looks too Turn catch and score Didnt need to put it on the floor there either Now Kovvens missed seven shots Spillers is four for nine Its been the Juke Harris show though in this second half for Wake Marshall gets in the lane and he just keeps going How about an M1 Wake Forest did a really nice job in the trap You had big trapping small but youre able to split the double team and then split it again right there Little continuation and the nice athleticism there and gets the finish play Again theyre doing some smart things versus a trap That time you split the double and then you attack the basket Its not hard Well heres a sneaky 70 run for Morehead State And thats why you dont get loose like I was talking about every possession Make it eight Yeah Back to a 10point game There you go And good job Morehead State Theyve done two things They play hard and smart and theyre not fouling as much Morehead State who lost by 50 to Louisville a year ago They played well here against an ACC foe Spillers kicks it Heres the three Wake cant buy a triple in this second half Right there Spillers spins Akens the deep three and a nice defensive board from Carol Shot selection has got to be smart Wasnt bad Its just got to be smart right now Use your clock Finish plays Man pressure Its a big possession for uh Morehead Marshall good pick and pop with Lere Carol drives Good hands Mary in the steel Hes got Spillers Spillers runs the floor Very good decision there You could have made the pass Could have been deflected Get it in rhythm Take it to the rack and finish Nice smart play When Wake Forest has gotten out in transition theyve been unstoppable tonight Well you also got to remember where theyre getting some of these transition plays A lot of this is above the free throw line extended or above the three circle So you get numbers You get a quick run Marshall kicks it Heres Dawson the third Off on the triple This games picked up some tempo here in the second half And a rejection underneath Spillers tips it Wow look at Marian saving it Bodies hitting the floor everywhere And great hands Carol with the block No foul And Steve Forbes is pissed Okay Its all right Hes furious Theyll review this Clean block laughter All right lets go inside the play right here Good defensive effort Deflection Swing it Goes inside and Juke initiates the contact He went straight up or as vertical as he could have been Ive seen fouls called on this Ive not seen foul calls on this Well see Remember call on the court is no foul ball out of bounds Officials reviewing the contact on the body going up in the air And were also being told theyre music evaluating whether the shot clock needs to be reset A lot for Lee Castles crew to figure out here Here we go 1918 You can see that at the bottom of the screen See you see Juke with that elbow right there a little bit as hes trying to clear space and get verticality I would just let this go as a shot I wouldnt call a foul or anything else You know based on that angle theres not seem to be a ball hitting the rim So the clock would not reset Yeah I I wasnt even thinking about Im thinking about the foul or possession Um but this is good This is good that coach Forbes is is disciplined because you got you got to finish games You got to finish You got to finish strong Go to stay at 15 Theyre going to move There we go And its going to be possession there going to go I mean possession is going to go to Wake Forest Thats great teaching tape if youre John Curl how to go up and not commit the foul Well thats what he did I mean that yeah he didnt do anything wrong if you know in theory ch is the one that in that case initiated the contact and now a technical foul on Steve Forbes Yeah Well coach Fords didnt see it like we saw it I understand that Well this could turn this game back to a 10point difference But now I hate to keep saying the same thing over and over again but Im going to Youve got to understand how this game is going to be called and theyre going to protect basketball But I really feel that time Juke initiated the contact and so a no call even though you wouldnt be popular it was probably the best you know it was the best play But I like it because coach Forbes has nailed demand and his team pick up their intensity with the little things Second and third chance opportunity gets a basket You dont finish inside Youre worrying about the highlight reel You know you got to find something and you got a big game You cant make those mistakes against Michigan You know whenever that game is Tuesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday all my days run Yeah My days run together But you just cant do that So the effort of a foul trouble Morehead State team theyre battling here with everybody in foul trouble Heres Harris going inside and the foul that time cheering Yeah you almost had the feeling You almost knew if you know basketball you had the feeling that that was going to be a call to goes the old golden block John Carroll with his fourth Three players with four now for Morehead State Now Ws got to get their free throws as well Theyve missed 10 from the charity strike tonight Now heres going to be interesting Let me see here 446 He makes his free throw Do they put some pressure on the basketball A little token on the inbounds The reason Im saying it do you want to try I I dont know that you really need to speed the tempo up What you need to do is value possessions Get free throws get baskets wind the clock down Silent mistake directing that traffic Hes been an anchor in this second half Nine points out of the break He wants 12 An air ball applause and cheering Its not the kind of look coach Jonathan Maddox wants late in the game And Marian throws it into the seats Its a bad turnover Well theres something to game pressure as well Playing in a tight game late seeing how teams respond Monday Wake had some breathing room in the 14 Youre making it youre youre youre making it youre making yourself have pressure unnecessarily because of what youre doing You know what Im saying So I counter that No they theyre not executing Yeah I didnt matter if youre up 40 or or or down 10 Do things the right way There you go Hand in the passing lane jumping the pass gets the deflection That defensive activity has really sparked Wake in the second half 15 on the clock now and where state where state has not done a good job of checking passes ball fakes shot fakes Wakes done a good job of getting in those passing lanes Here we go A lead as big as 18 Trim to 12 The Luke look at this Fight for the boards Marian comes out with it Nice strong rebound by Marian All right run some clock Mason He goes in Another missed layup for Wake Theyve had some chances on the doorstep And a nice board that almost turns it over Hold your breath An Eagles team has scored 89 on Monday Can they kickstart the offense here Well they aint scoring 89 today Cunningham and the same play as a juke play a moment ago Akens running the break Spillers is there Another transition done Risky Its nice scored But you dont see anybody on the weight coaching staff jumping up right now because you know its hey just lay it in Unselfish Im not trying to be that guy you got off my lawn But right now clock is your friend Nifty little layup Nice Thats Josiah Lgree playing with four fouls the whole second half Hes impressive Had the most assists in a season opener in four years on Monday Hes being a scorer tonight 230 Keep moving the basketball Get you a layup Make them foul you Harris gets fouled There you go On script and immediate timeout 12point game here late in the second half David Dickens on the verge of a two and0 start here at the Joel Attention please winners tonight 31 Congratul for a wonderful night for Drew Harris the 67 sophomore from Salsbury Scoring inside scoring outside driving in music the middle with the ease of a allAmerican right there Look at this Jump shots in the corner goes music inside So watch this Botto knows hes on the court inside the black like we talked about Boom Knocks in the three Smile Playing music good As you mentioned and other people have mentioned has the opportunity to be one of the better players comeback player improved player in the ACC On the verge of 30 points now for Juke Harris This free throw will put him there Balance too Good first half He was impressive in the second half but hell hold it 29 for the moment See that See just let it go You jinx Juke Hey its our job to cheer up Its your job to do it No let him play Let him play it Tell him after See the the the Jinx got you Hes the first one to get us this year The free throw jinx Well heres a chance for two more laughter Akens on the steel Hell take advantage in transition Everybody kind of hailed the breath Wasnt really sure about that Good contest We have seen activity from Wake defensive and thatll translate to any game if you can play this level of forcing turnovers Morehead States up for a tough test Georgia Tuesday Clemson next Thursday Maluke off on the three to follow that shot Bacons getting a little attack mode here late Hell get more free throws Its the 25th foul of the game for Morhead State Like that little hesitation that time by Akens Gets inside gives you a little hesy uses the left hand and thats the first player to foul out Carol has just committed his fifth To have all that foul trouble in the first half and only one player foul out Actually pretty impressive all things considered Thats kind of how it works out to be very honest with you You adjust officials adjust Three in double figures now for Wake A similar balance we saw Monday night 8000 minutes of transfer experience here for the Deakons and the Denver transfer Sebastian Akens putting up some good moments tonight Whats that 20 turnovers Officially 19 but I think a 20th might be coming at some point Thats the level that Wake has provided Almost a turnover there Okay Morehead States going to use a coachs challenge Morehead Okay Well well see how it works Got to have a timeout Make the challenge If its successful you get the timeout and you get another challenge If it doesnt you lose it So with what 114 to go second game of the season lets see how this process works for Morhead State for Wake and for all of us Well I love Jonathan Maddox trusting his players whos saying Get that hit off not my knee someone elses knee Lets see You heard me ask the officials before the ball game about you know when this happens because you know players never think they filed or anything and ask for a replay review and who are you listening to Lets see here Calling the quarters that did not touch Aikens on the way out All right Well I can wait call the four stands Okay Yeah Gold will use one of their 30 second timeouts So Morhead State will burn a timeout as well with that challenge Its cool Got to it quickly Want to see if it worked Hey get another possession Cut this lead Coaches track everything including their challenge success rate So 0 for one this year for Jonathan Maddox Everythings on a whiteboard Everythings trackable Good steal Little tip forward and Cunningham benefits with the layup Nice Never let the ball touch Keep it out Keep it out Keep it moving Little game of pinball Bing bing bing bing bing Keeping everybody involved Spillers to close out this final minute Hits the layup So hes got 16 Rebound away from a double double Hes going to be a terror if he gets that ball in the paint Ability to take the jumper Power dribble score Here we go Josiah off on the three Hes had a good night but not enough complimentary pieces here for Morhead State taking the 5 and 1 half hour trip Backtoback 80point games here for the Demon Deakons Good start offensively and theyre trying for more with nearly a steal but theyll stay with Morhead State Eagles will head down to Georgia tomorrow
