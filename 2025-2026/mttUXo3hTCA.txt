their third straight win of the season five and two overall Nor Eastern comes in three and three on the year Happy to have you with us here in Winston Salem The Deaks have it here to start things off And for Wake Forest can they continue that pace they had against Campbell the other day Perhaps one of their better 40 minutes played basketball this year They were very efficient on offense and very intense on defense Calmese drives in Hey mask or no mask hes still doing what he does Well look at the starting five for Nor Eastern Allery in double figures Mentioned Fritz as well The five learning to find themselves on the floor And if you can make threes like that by Miles Newton youre in good shape Newton knocked down his third three in season Hes a spot jump shooter Averages about four points a ball game at 63 If he can get off to a good start that definitely helps the Huskies Wake with the same five weve seen throughout the course of this season When you watch this Wake Forest team watch the spacing And thats Revon Spiller is going inside at 67 using that length as the Deaks go back up by one Has really been efficient Scott in the midrange When he gets the ball in the paint you can almost guarantee its going to be a basket either by him scoring or an assist Already doubled along the baseline Last touch by Wake Forest Mason got a hand on it So well stay here on this end What I liked about Wake Forest and their win over Campbell Tuesday night They were engaged defensively They took away shooters looks They took away their drives Everybody was active defensively Theyre kind of doing the same thing early in this ball game There we go A little too quick William Kery turns it over Theres that pressure by Wake Forest He just kind of stepped out hedged that screen area good triple hand off and you stepped out And a nice job that time by Spillers and caused a travel And what youre doing Scott what Wake is doing so well right now is theyre so efficient on the offensive set Everybodys getting a touch laughter Youre moving without the ball and you need to get a nice threepointer or a midrange jump shot Cal will drop it off inside Spillers Its oneonone on the baseline with Fritz Powers it up and in for another bucket and he came up and contested that shot Bumped him two times out of Fritz Did not bother Spillers a nice lefthander on the baseline Thats become one of his best shots Fritz will drive it in through contact and gets the roll Nice roll cheering and applause from the Netherlands I shorted him I said about 68 Actually he risked about 69 but can score the basketball And quick three along the side by Mai Mason as hes made his 17th triple of the year now Really playing good basketball Fritz shut off along the baseline Nowhere to go underneath Second turnover of the game by the Huskies And Wake will run and Mason gave it right back What do you think about pace of play in this one Stan What are we looking for If youre Northeastern you want to keep this game into the high 60s or 70s If youre Wake Forest you want to push the pace as much as you can It starts on the defensive end not allowing in good shots Now in all baskets they only give up about 71 points a ball game Offensively they feel like that they can score off the defense Ally picks up the steel to Newton Newton rises missed it bothered there underneath by Abu uh by Baloo I should say who came back quickly in transition but the three off the mark by Mason Nice job by Belu to not foul and contest a shot Missed opportunity off a turnover for Nor Eastern Theyve got to take advantage of those type of plays Wide open on the weak side is Newton and he buries it and Newton only a freshman but that the name Newton sounds familiar His dad Milton Newton played on those Kansas teams was a teammate of Danny Manning and won that national championship and uh so hes got some basketball in his bloodlines just along with Allerie too We all know in this area his dad Mark Allery and his sister Bell which was a star player at Princeton with a nice answer for Wake He has really over the last couple of ball games extended his length on shots and also been more aggressive on shots Average about 13 14 points a game last year at Washington State Hasnt really had to look to score a lot now Hes certainly doing that Kermoy will rifle it over to Allerie Drives in and strong finish by Allerie and a foul and a chance here in a threepoint play for Xander Allerie Good pace to this one early here in Winston Salem Wake Forest holding about it I mean 20 years and and you think about some of the coaches that have been in Nor Eastern The first name that comes to mind is is Jim Calhoun and all the success he had at Nor Eastern and then later on at Yukon in those national championships and then well Pat Scarys done a great job at Talson We see them from time to time Ronnie Everheart Frank Martin our good friend Frank Martin you know So theres a lot of great basketball history at Nor Eastern The leader of the pack would be Coach Cohen So off to a very solid start on the road on a Friday Mat day And speaking of wins congratulations to Coach Jebia womens basketball coach and Wake Forest won her 200th career game uh yesterday in overtime down in where they bam somewhere Puerto Rico There we go They werent in Winston Salem I knew that someplace warmer than we are Somewhere warmer than we were and somewhere I didnt get to see the game live but uh congratulations Megan for 200 wins and uh and an outstanding Deaks basketball star 8 and0 8 and0 got a game today against uh Illinois State So well keep pressure on them for the Collins Illinois State back in the day Thats all right though 300 wins 800 Theres a lot of basketball games Three A lot of games Deacons by three Just underway Newton knocks home three Again we talked about his bloodlines He comes off the screen and just ready to catch and shoot Hes an outstanding athlete and and hes only played like 100 minutes 20 so far Jump that up Jump this one up and stay after that Newton three Theyve made three threes already here in the first half They come in only averaging about five or so big threes a game right Yeah I mean they their most I think was against Harvard and they had nine that game Theyve never had over eight threes all season long but theyre getting some looks Theres a trap And so you got the wing shooter Knock it down Yeah Kick it inside then outside Kery couldnt knock it down So Wake with a chance to take the lead back as they come the other way Kery leads this team in threepoint baskets with nine That was a good look But again getting the ball in the paint using that left hand the elevation This has been so successful this year for Trvon Spillers Spillers has six here early Wake back up by two Drive along the baseline by Newert Missed it Tip foul is good by Allerie Just like his dad Mark back in the day at Duke Hes got those soft hands and always around the rim Can finish play Xander Allerie Harris goes baseline draws contact and that foul will go against Miles New Two free throws coming up Thats his first And if youre second team foul Nor Eastern youve got to be really excited about the way you guys have been able to bounce back to take a punch and then punch back and getting some really nice looks And so a 176 game in 1355 was much better than anything we saw on Tuesday night Steve Forbes in a six season here at Wake Forest coming off two straight seasons 21 or so wins in each and has his sight set on another big year here in Winston Salem and likes the group hes got here and molding them together to a five and two start They understand theyve got to build games build wins and it starts Its already started They were able to do in the Islands last week getting a quality win Had a big game on uh Tuesday against Oklahoma They go to West Virginia playing one of those games But uh you just keep winning keep stacking games and feel like youre doing enough and then get that bid that you so desperately want to have happen This one of the best teams in the country has not gone to the NCAA the last couple years Hosting new faces on the floor here on both sides Well set these lineups for you here in a sec Bastion Akens running the point Has the ball in his hands there Lost it and the turnover to the Huskies screaming And I Ill tell you this now so we dont have to talk about it anymore I Ive been to a couple of these Black Friday games at Wake Forest that didnt turn out really well Uh one against Houston Baptist now Houston Christian one against Dale State you know one against you know they lost in overtime And so a team like North Eastern thats going to get better and better I think preseason pick number seven in the CA But you cant let them hang around And this is an NCAA type environment that they get that matinea game on Thursday or Friday and youre excited to play Your mind might be someplace else your body in another place You got to lock in and get excited both with the team as well as the fans get get some enthusiasm going to this basketball game because the longer that Northeast was able to have success the better its going to be for them Yeah Feeling of a even a conference tournament game early That that new Yeah you got to treat your own enthusiasm Another turnover and stepping on the end line though The Huskies will give it right back Kind of seen this here in the last couple minutes with some of the subs coming in Well youre not expecting to maybe blow a team out already okay But you expect thats some better execution Thats another pass of just kind of a loose pass Allery got in the passing lane Not able to to retain it Then theyre going to check the clock from clock and possession Did the possession change or not Le says Lets reset the shot clock to 16 Yeah Feel like at least could have possession fully Heres Aikens with it Wake leading by two Shot clock under 10 on this trip Akins drives Nice feed inside but Marcus Marion who lays it over the front of the rim Continue to get better and better Set out last year Can be a a force inside 69 Nice little easy dunk there by Marriott In the corner He lost it Blakes got numbers Theyll kick it far side to the corner Akens nowhere to go and theyll back it out Cross in the ball game also for Wake Forest number 23 Coven drives missed it Rebound down to Zoic Transfer from West Virginia whos really been a spark for Nor Eastern of late We love the way the Huskies just move that basketball around the perimeter Kick it in kick it out Open three up top and it is good by Abru And Brew has cheering really stepped up the last couple of weeks of basketball Only a freshman was a CA player of the week last week Defend can knock down some shots Averaging 10 points a game off the bench Not afraid Made the big shot Youre exactly right Great ball movement And a pretty move there Driving in and a finish by Akens Nice job by Aens cheering cheering Allery rifles it over to Lochney Back out front to Allerie Recognizing clock Five to shoot for the Huskies Nowhere to go by Frankle as cheering hes doubled And then with four on the shot clockin foul against Wake Forest Jaylen Cross Wake Forest working the offense You drive in you flip it to your big man and just like that you got two season 20 points high percentage and rebounding My man Jer Salsbury finals telling thats only think about that Were were actually a month in the season practically and only five people already have been doing it You think some of those numbers are going to go down I think Juke numbers could level off there or even get better Thats all right contribute when you come on the floor Thats what he does in so many different ways Four points off from the free throw line here this afternoon And right on Q Miles Coven spots up for three out of the timeout after they get the stop Knocks him the three Im telling you Miles Kovven is just steps up Hes made the big plays Weve already seen the half court buzzer beater and then the late game winner and he just steps up and makes quality shots second best in three points on this Wake Forest basketball team Wake Forest shooting nine of 11 from the floor here in the first half screaming Good shots good pacing and good spacing Backing his way in Boy Ill tell you what Swagger when he gets that kind of position at 610 hes tough to beat was the Missouri Valley Rookie of the Year one season and made all second team last year and its 69 610 can put it on the floor can play the three can play the four thats a nice pat and move that little jump hook for him midway through the first half here leading by six turning up the defensive intensity Frank has got to make something happen here shot clock at three skip pass to the corner has to force one up and last touch by a husky underneath screaming Watch this Watch Swigger takes him down gets there gets positioned and then the elevation with the jump hook A lost star I love that shot Love to see big guys He had space to be able to turn those hips and just elevated 69 Youre not going to block that shot Swer again Here we go it out to cross Cross drive and kick and Marion couldnt handle it Come the Huskies the other way Not sure if hes intended for Akens or or not Marion cut three but didnt finish the play by catching screaming Frankle catch and shoot distance rebound underneath down to play by six Another one of those very good catch and shoot players for Nor Eastern had a good look there Coven turns and fires Didnt get the roll though Brew right in front of the weight bench applause and cheering Knocks home another three for the Huskies Remember the name Xavier Brew as youre watching basketball this year Its one of those phenomenal freshman averaged about 26 a game at Phillips Academy in high school and has just really come on the last couple of weeks as I mentioned cheering player of the week in CA Thats I loved it I love the diversity in this game Boy Swinger just shot right over the top of the defender there at 610 Another three This time its missed by Loch Nate Opportunity to expand this lead if you wait for it screaming Cross reverses cheering in Mr draws brings the crowd to their feet here inside the Joel Maybe thats one of those energy plays that can give Wake some momentum and a steal Aens careless pass results in the dunk and the crowd is excited The players are excited Wake Forest cheering Digs with their largest lead here at nine Steve Forbes wants another steel sorting his defense on cheering underneath and Zovich gets positioned and hell have a couple free throws coming up and maybe they got away with one too you know and this is a Wake Forest basketball team that I think can hurt you a lot of ways You know youre looking at what theyve done so far in this ball game 13 cheering of 16 from the field What is that 81 Theyve had four ball games already this year where theyve shot over 45 field goal and they value the basketball So when you do that and you play some containing defense good things can happen for you and you outrebound your opponents I I just like the makeup of this team and the energy of this basketball team You know Nor Easter was not playing basketball Scott hit nine out of 18 shooting six assists six turnovers and then find themselves kind of getting pushed around a little bit They were sped up that last sequence You got to slow your tempo down make some shots Both teams shoot the basketball well Nor Eastern at 50 weight at 81 here in the first half Shot clock becomes a factor on this trip though And Bill Cohen cheering gets the defensive stop he was looking for That was a big defensive stop for for Northeast from them They come back Like I said nine of 18 shooting Got to stay in this basketball game Freaks has been sort of quiet so far Alleries not really put up the big numbers Newtons had a good start in another basket Yeah just back in the game and Newton goes right to work Hes got 11 now to lead the way for the Huskies And the lead has been trimmed down to five Only a freshman this season high in career high Oh Spillers has been doing a little jump hook and a little baby left hand He said Let me show you what else is in my bag Sander Allery laughter Sander Allerie picks up the foul and Trarevon Spillers will head to the line Team foul number four and Spillers at 79 on the year This is the first back on the floor for Wake will be Juke Harris And hes got those two personal fouls as he sat out the long stretch of minutes here Although Wakes been able to build the lead without him See if he can play with those two fouls here 633 left to go Well we talked about the numbers a minute ago for Juke 55 from the field taking care of good shots 20point ball game But one thing that that doesnt show up in this box scores is the depth right near this Wake Forest team So you can maintain a lead with a guy like Harris on the bench Well William Kurboy a long two came out on him and he just drained it Down to four Yeah Kerboy the leading threepoint shooter for Nor Eastern NICE MOVE BY BLUE OH IT ROLLED IN Look like one of those pucks of yours hanging on the edge Hanging on you know depending on where I am they wont go in That one did Nice post up with the footwork had knocked out of his hands Watch this Blue puts it on the floor and then a nice holiday roll Boom Falls in I liked it It did look did look like but didnt come at the end and fall in Just enough spin on it Newton has not been bashful And thats why really stepped out and coach Forbes not happy Off the inbounds comes foul Newton Hey Miles Newton much like Winston Salem hes got 14 already here in the first half And we talked about it A thousand point high school scorer great bloodlines with his dad Milton Newton but hes living his own life right now making just had some great looks off screens Hes got space has been able to knock that down Season high careerhigh going in this afternoon was 11 points Only had made Look at that guy Two threepoint baskets made going into todays ball game Whats he now Four now Four five He was two of 11 coming in Of 11 I can do that math Forbes calls a timeout right away and says Hey lets keep an eye on this guy Right It wasnt like he wasnt on the scouting report They knew he could play Mason nearly fumbled it out of bounds And he did thought maybe a northeastern player may have touched it but boy you hate that if youre Steve Forbes you call a timeout and then you turn it over Nor Eastern again putting a body on a body Some confusion there Theres a pick and roll Sor Showler keeps it himself He did not get the roll Spillers cheering comes down with that rebound with two hands Wake will run Calis to the corner Harris three in and out Allerie had it Couple dicks around him Scrambling for it and last touched by a weight player Out of bounds and Nor Eastern will have it Notice the value of Cal Me immediately after getting that rebound Pushed the ball Got the ball in the middle of the floor He could go either way A jump stop and take the shot Finds Duke on the wing Juke shot doesnt fall They crash for the glass But again thats the tempo that you want to have on the defensive side if youre wait for it whistle off the ball and thatll go against Spillers Thats his second Thats his second foul number five With those two fouls going just talking about a bunch of stuff here But you said probably more important right now But I will tell you this with 450 to go The longer Nor Eastern stays in this game the more confidence they get Oh blocked underneath by Sahor Shaller who came in and ahead of the patch is Allerie who was slow to get down the floor after he felt like he got hit in the face on the other side He got hit and then planted on the other end and got a blocked shot there by Schroer Charlotte and it ends up getting another basket from Northeast So look what we got A onepoint game 420 getting ready to get the next TV timeout Quake led by as many as nine The lead is down to one Harris had his shot blocked and last touched by Northeastern Blake will have it here with 415 to go Nor Easterns doing a really good job of contesting shots especially drives playing without fouling in the paint Big rage pull up is pure Thats what he can do shows very early on Mai base the transfer from Washington cheering Brown getting a little handsy here now with four left to play in the first half Trying to trap the ball up top He got him reverse and rotate Theres Newton again The ball gets stopped You somebody from the weak sides got a cut and Newtons done a great job of that Got to find Harris in transition and Zuke Harris says okay if were going to get in the scoring run credit Cal Me again for a tempo push the ball down the floor real quick and you know is going to be on that wing ready to knock it down 331 to go here first half good one in Winston Salem Wake leading 4137 that last four minutes of the half for norththeast Eastern you got to continue to execute If youre Wake Forest this is that time to try to get that knockout Put them on the heels Try to extend this lead to 10 points or more Diving for that loose ball and picking it up as Akens off one of those plays Mason off the turnover drops it off and Harris couldnt convert Less Jones says thats cuz it was a foul on the outside and a couple free throws coming up And Les Jones is usually right when he makes a call So Im not going to bother with Less today But good nobody will tell him if hes wrong either Oh I dont mess with Less Hes a good guy Hes one of the best out here But you see the guy down on a loose ball you know and thats that explosion play that Hey everything youve been doing is nice but man were ready to move on before we get to halftime And you thought you had it on the explosion in the in you didnt make one point at it But man just turn up the defense if you wake Forest and value the basketball if youre cheering Northeast cuz youre going to come So Shaller kicks it out to Kery Under three left to go in the half Another driving kick to N Defenders around him Hell force that one up and score again We thought defensively hed come back and tried to help and Mason didnt recover He just kind of powered in So hes showing a lot of stuff in this ball game today and Miles N And has a steal Twoonone break here for the Huskies Newton drops it off Gets it back and well head to the line to shoot a couple Remember Miles Newton the freshman came in averaging just about three and a half points a game and hes at the line with a chance to go to 20 if he can knock two of them in Well the second game of the season against Kate he had 10 points Okay hes only averaging maybe about 15 minutes a ball game if that much and crying but hes broke the starting line screaming the last couple games and then hes been very aggressive cheering and you know what I like about him hes not forced any shots I mean all those shots have come within the offensive set hes moved out the basketballs played with a lot of enthusiasm goes one for two from the free throw line thats been a very good half for Newton and who knows what would happen if other guys were scoring the basketball a little bit for Northeastern fors got a play Harris off a screen squares and fires offensive rebound out Last touch by Nor Eastern Akens had it Tried to shuffle it to a teammate underneath Got to be deflected away And Wake will have it here with 18 on the clock Bringing a couple subs as Coven returns along with Marion screaming officials huddling up here Well make sure weve got everything straight with the clock and stay here at 211 and 20 on the shot clock Got a big lineup in we go over the top here The pants deflected out of bounds Yeah you got Swagger on the floor and Marian s a sholler did a nice job anticipating that pass Just got a hand and it deflected 10 on the shot clock for Wake Forest Hands it off to Aens Three to shoot Akens has to turn and force one up off the front iron Offensive rebound by Coven and hes fouled Steve Gords will love that effort on the offensive glass as Kovven will have two coming up Clock winding down Nice shot to get up there but just a great effort Youre exactly right by Coven to get a second chance opportunity Maybe go to the free throw line where hes shooting about 80 But again Miles Coven has just really stepped up and six double figure ball games and continues to just make plays very quietly very efficiently you know doesnt doesnt do a lot Just boom makes a play boom makes another play set the chance opportunity there gets you two points for momentum Scott this is a big possession I think for Nor Eastern Theres your double Really chasing him Nice feed underneath and theres Fritz with the reverse You see you know youre getting trapped on one side You got to cut it with one persons there Youve got to cut hard to the basket Good catch by Fritz off the ball Swagger spinning forces it up had it blocked Fritz didnt like the call but go ahead Im just saying why the double team played out of the double team And then you cut and actually nice job by sweeper being in the right position but just didnt know where the B ball was and had his back turned and then you got a problem ball in the air and finish it But that was a good defensive set to a player Kind of like a that defensive back when youre going back on a wide receiver You got to turn and find the ball right back shoulder fade sometime You see good look there by Sora Sler guy and two from the line 4542 weight cheering Crowd here in the Joel getting a little antsy for a stop Newton nearly lost it Gets it back Hey Swall Shallower with the wild shot high off the glass Harris down with the rebound Tried to play through the contact that time Too strong with the shot Scramble for it Swigger on the ground Bodies on the ground And finally here come the Huskies out of it Akens had a piece of it from Newton And finally we got a held ball here possession Love the hustle on both sides of the floor Possession arrow will be for Wake Forest That looked like some peoples houses yesterday trying to find that last piece of bread and turkey you know before the end of the day Everybodys scrambling trying to get that last bit of turkey laughter Whos going to GET THAT DRUMSTICK WHOS GOING TO GET THAT laughter Not Uncle Stan Thats No no no no no I already had Mike ready to go Heres Kovvin along the wing Powers his way in Bodying and bodying Turns and goes up and one too many shoulders there by Kovven as he gets whistled for the offensive foul First bump was good The first bump See there Watch this Now watch Turn squares and then kind of leads with the off arm Thats what they got him on The off arm not the bump I like the bumping I like the bumping inside just the pushing You cant deal with that off arm Got him An air void the mistake and a chance to maybe tie or beat down a basket or who knows a fourpoint play Take the lead Good way to finish for Nor Eastern Possession errors there also You go two for one Hold for the last shot here 10 left to go Fritz Oh thats a nice gut off the glass 4 seconds left Wake will push it the other way Akins Its good IF IT DROPS IN AND IT cheering does the first 10 is Miles Newton number 10 Okay The second 10 Wake Forest turnovers All right 10 turnovers off eight assists and 16 made field goals Tighten up your ball handling Keep playing good defense Theyre making shots People are going to make shots Cant make them have two Oh thats a nice back with a nice reverse Nor Eastern is out in front here Theyve had a lot of success spacing the floor and those back cuts Defenders have got to help on the weak side and then talk A tough basket but a good basket by Aller Tip follow No good again Spiller got it and muscles it in Grab it with two hands Finish with two hands Nice job there by Spillers not to give up on the play Forest only had three offensive rebounds in the first half So thats got to be a point of emphasis for coach Forbes And off the turnover here come the digs again Juke Harris down the left side and a little continuation to count the basket And thats part of that new adaptation of the rule now that let you get that step So that was continuation in his finest Not a good decision to make the crosscourt pass And then Wake goes into push it mode Juke gets contact says Im going to play through this and he does and has a chance for the threepoint play So after Nor Eastern took the lead Quick five points for the Deaks to go up by four here minute into the first half Sora Shallot keeps it himself Cant finish it And then a loose ball rebounding foul will go against Wake Forest Wake is doing such a nice job of putting pressure on the basketball and you get mesmerized sometime on the weak side and it should be helped side to two dribbles in the paint from that distance should not have happened to get that opportunity for an easy layup So again its just about moving your feet and communication who the basketball is Try to make them declare a side either their strong side or their weak side and then you screaming defend from that if youre a oneonone game Bel with just his first and Fritz misses them both Only a 53 free throw shooter Theres Cal Me Back to the hands of Harris going inside swinging along the baseline Case and Wake will back things out Shot clock under 10 Makes nowhere to go to Mason Hell launch a three High archer OH HE GOT THE ROLL Thats the second roll for Wake Forest He drops in Well executed at the clock A friendly roll and the kid ready to shoot the basketball screaming And a big basket there along the baseline by Allerie Sandra Allerie not really known as a big threepoint shooter but has scored some big basketball games already this year Just his second pay three of the season Stan came in one of eight from beyond the arc Yeah But a needed big basket for this Nor Eastern Virginia team averages about 10 points a ball game Team shooting the basketball well as you would Spoilers misses a cheap one there Nor Eastern seven of 10 from three They only make five on the season And shooting it well here but they turn it over And then Wake gives it right back Settle down Settle down Newtons first touch here in the second half Hes doubled Finds Fritz Had it swatted away by Spillers What elevation at time I think Kelmese was hit in the face again and hes adjusting the the nose guard Yeah his mask kind of got smacked there a little bit and the officials saw him block Did you see the block by Spillers Yeah of course you did You seen your saw Of course you did So theres Caliz remember his nose earlier in the season had surgery on Wednesday out here competing Theres the block Bound elevate He thought you had one had a basket there and Spillers had a different idea Hes just a little banged up too Stan Hell check out as a come in was really good in the first half Hes right in for two Well hes got a great first step doesnt he Gets to the basket Comes in with some great talked screaming about players that have got honors or whatnot was rookie of the year last year out of the University of Denver Hes got stairs down Harris and then knocks him to three Says he going to let me shoot it Okay Cuts it to three Permos got another good look to sit the leading threepoint shooter for this team And dribble by Spillers Seems like every time Wake has given him something theyve been able to have an answer or find a way to get off the run Basket by Ker Boy and a turnover there Notice theyre very patient right now Wakes not able to speed them up They can run their half court sets but do a nice job Space pass and cut to the shot His first look at it comes up short Spiller is going to keep it himself Lost it on the way up Gathers it back to the corner for the three This time Mason doesnt get the roll Look at Spillers hustling on the deck Saves a possession and Harris couldnt get it to drop in but is fouled and will have two free throws Yuri Fritz with the foul That started off a drive and the shots blocked and just keep going in there and watch it One one white jersey three or four red jerseys diving that loose ball makes a play Juke Harris didnt get the friendly roll that time Thats the type of hustle that you like to see out of your basketball team Days where you think okay theyre going to have an old Dick Stewart word lumpies Having a day lumpies you dont want to play you know you kind of just lump it around You dive after plays Thats the creative enthusiasm that you have to have Good hustle by Spillers results in the possibility of a basket for Harris Those plays like this as you well know win ball games for lead is at five for Wake Trouble with the dribble handoff there and fortunate as Nor Eastern not to turn it over Both teams trying to turn up a little bit on the defensive side and wake up by five Tom is Tom is Mark F doing something right Jones from over at Yale whos been there forever and continues to win the Ivy So Cos doing some good things Theyve got a solid program Had a lot of success Shot clock at five on this trip Inside and Allerie couldnt get it to drop in Lost touched by Wake Forest cheering Look at the field goals Did we have a close game Of course But the difference is where the free throw line Wake Forest 12 of 15 Nor Eastern four of seven And Nor Eastern being out rebounded by 10 So gets the stop and they add to this fivepoint lead Again led by as many as nine in the first half Onepoint game at the half If youre just joining us 5752 we stand Akens will kick it out Beloo from long distance has not been able to find the range on the wing today in blue Wide open in the corner a blue but couldnt get it to drop in Spillers eighth rebound of the night Aens off the high ball screen drives in kisses with the left hand again Great recognition good timing Had a little rough screen just fought the guy in there And Aikens a Summit League freshman of the year last year comes up big once again giving them good minutes with Nate Kamise A little shaken up Heres a steal by Mason Hell rise Oh gathers himself up Kind of got a flat tire there Good hustle by a Brew just to kind of get in the sideline But watch this Heres a defensive play You got this nice drive recognizing the easy basket Now watch the bad pass This is a lovely gag pass Great huff and then ah cant get my steps right Dont know if I want to lay it in or dunk it And ends up not doing either one I knew there were footsteps coming too Yeah just kind of lost his footing Skinn did it a little bit Huskys really having a hard time here the last couple of possessions getting into any kind of offensive Has done a great job Scott and as all the other Primitive guys anticipating getting in passing lanes And Nor Easterns been very careless with some of those wingtowing passes drops it off to Spillers gathers and finishes high above the rim And the lead is at nine now He can get the ball with both hands and just elevate The few are going to stop him And another turnover by Nor Eastern Heres Coven down the lane OH HES cheering FLUSHED IT HOME You already knew You already knew Miles intentionally on defense but it started with a steal and score How about this Go inside get the spills basket Watch Kovven Every ball game you can almost anticipate Miles Kovven flying through the air making a long range jump shot or something off the steel Takes it home Two hand flush Hang on the rim for a little bit to get the take but not on the rim and gave you the excitement the energy play that we were talking about Miles Coven Travon Spillers doing damage inside with great aggression gives Wake Forest the lead 80 run over the last two minutes or so by Wake Forest Its been fueled by their defense They forced five turnovers already here in the second half for Nor Eastern And the Huskies shooting just three of nine in the second half Also fifth game this season where Wake Forest has forced eight or more steals had 16 against American 14 against UMass Loyal Nine so far in this basketball game Great anticipation good hands playing solid defense See if Northeastern can get the ball into the hands of Newton Culvin did a nice job stepping through the skin that time Didnt get beat on the back cut Here is Newton Hell drive in and count the basket Some continuation there by Newton Just his second shot attempt here in the second half Watch this He gets the ball is in the gather position He takes the one step They give it to him I like this addition Count the basket What a game for Miles New Much needed move for Nor Eastern after that time out Hes gotten as many points in this game as he had in the other six laughter Got 22 now Remember Nor Eastern was playing without LA Pratt also senior guard who averaged was averaging 17 a game a preseason allconerence performer lost him earlier this season with with an injury but imagine if they had him out here with the way Newtons playing expected big things out of a game that a lot of people this year you may remember played at Elon Taylor for several years forunately broke his his foot November 11th but I dont think theyre expecting him to come back there I think hes going to maybe try to get another year Oh hard bounce pass there and Spillers there to clean it up Hakens watch the lob Force a turnover Hard pass to catch Good idea Just too close And if you make a mistake right now Wake Forest is there to jump on him defense to transition to buckets for Steve Forbess group Lead is at 10 And another turnover Heres Harris Kicks it to the corner They want three and theyve got three Converting from defense to offense or offense to D cheering This case defense You make the turnover You push it immediately Wing jumps going to be there Wait Yeah turning up the heat defensively Akins has 11 off the bench for Wake Forest The lead is 13 now And another steal cheering screaming Coven nearly lost it Hell ease things up Step back three Spins away Get another crack at it Spinners really calling for it down low Likes the match up hes got Goes to that left hand Gets the baby roll Well like I said if he can get two feet in the paint hes going to back it down The few are going to be able to stop him Hes elevation is really good and his tough soft touch People forget hes a left So he goes in there strong 670 Brad from Charleston Allerie for three and hes fouled from long distance by Beloo The Wake defense creating havoc creating opportunities Alley plus and its a 15point lead by Wake Forest Anticipating passing lanes getting there making plays and then finishing 34 points in the paint And yeah we know Spl is having a nice game but a lot of that been on transition off the steel and then later the score Now Wake with three players in double figures Spillers leading the way with 15 Harris has 13 Akens with 11 Allery will have another free throw again Fouled shooting screaming from beyond the arc Hes got 15 now Newton leading the way with 19 but he has been quiet here in the second half as Wake has really clamped down on him That big piece of chicken everybodys looking at it Black Friday you got to think about sales and food still Bears lost it on the way up Last touched by Nor Eastern I think Fritz got a piece of it there 11 on the clock Wake has done a really nice job this season in scoring and being in scoring position You know those baseline out of bounds those blob plays Five to shoot on the shot clock Harris will rise and fire from three Missed it Sweeping in on the offensive glass is Marion with another crack at it Harris one more time for three left this one short and finally the ball kicked out there to Newton Bodies everywhere here What a great effort by Marcus Marion first of all to get that rebound like you said skying out of there to get the ball and then only reversing the shot was short and its a loose ball and youre fighting for it Whos on the floor Marcus Mary nice job Set out last season got a little bigger got a little stronger you know better basketball IQ Was already good even more so now Look for good things out of him Very unselfish player Dont worry about scoring but making all the little plays You saw two of them Harris sweeps in another Northeastern turnover Remember how we talked about the help side defenders and communicating Hes read it perfectly And theres Marion going right to work on the other end Steals to buckets for Wake Forest That has been the recipe here in the second half And Wake does such a good job of that Going to force a turnover and then able to get something out of it Theres a hedge Another possession where the shot clock becoming a factor And another steal Kovvens got it Hell do it again but had it stripped away at the last minute cheering right now Nor Eastern just cant get a shot up Well theyre making poor ball decisions Theres a trap and the open player is the crosscourt pass but you cant make it because the defenders on help side Hes anticipating So I mean this is better than in practice sometimes just past the midway point here in the second half as Wake Forest pulling away from Northeast Follow on the weak side Wouldnt drop through Place is ready to explode and Baron and able to flush that Made the better play by just trying to take the little jumper cheering screaming Called a traveling violation Northeastern wanted a foul as you know Sora Scholler lost it there and see Bill Cohen saying what do I got to do here Well its amazing to watch players reaction sometime because co K coin just knew okay it got me from reaching and thats what got him off strut and I think he did file it but the officials didnt see that They saw all the residual effect and got the travel and so when they found out it wasnt a foul call oh he just took a deep breath Got to be stronger with the basketball dribble handoff Caliz back in the game Good to see him back on the floor Kovvin nowhere to go and lets cheering see and so the Northeastern bench really getting livid on the other end They thought it was the same play They wanted to travel Instead its going to be a foul Well I I heard the same thing that same post move from some Arkansas fans today about making plays in the post and your big guys and youre traveling and everything like that And Im not going to argue that it may not have been travel but also Im going to say its some good footwork You know a pivot a step you step through keep that pivot foot established opponent you know able to draw the contact It looked like a foul I had traveled but it wasnt But yeah I got some Arkansas fans that were on me about about the play about a post play post moves So itll be all right Itll be all right They didnt call it that time Maybe they will next time Nice move by Coleman Go to free throw line Gets one of two and Nor Eastern feeling like theyre really in need of a bucket here And they get it from the corner by Franklin We talked about Franklin with the critical release Came in having made seven threes Second best on the team That was a big basket for the Huskies Another foul against Nor Eastern They go to against JB Frankle See I think Coven Kovven must be living right because I think as the offensive play maybe he did get him I thought his foot kicked the ball The ball bounced off his toe You saw kind of smiled a little bit with him too Yeah but he did reach though Four team fouls against Nor Eastern Three have been whistled against Wake Forest Mason Holden drives and kicks counties and it packed away Xander Allerie who initially attended Miami red shirted and then found his way up to Boston and Nor Eastern And we mentioned you know we know his dad but his sister Bella was a threetime player of the year in the Ivy League You saw the athleticism there with that block shot Came in with 10 blocks on the year to lead the way Northeast gets a stop and they get a bucket here Still got a ball game Yeah and a drive in and theres the follow by Fritz Nice job of Fritz on the weak side Sor Ashola comes in there and throws it up there and says Okay Im going to throw it up there My guys can make the play I meant to mention this a possession or two behind him but Newton kind of pulled up lane and Im looking at him on the bench right now readjusting Im not sure if he rolled in the ankle or whatnot but uh maybe about three plays beforehand Eight minutes to go Lead now 10 And Kiss gets one to roll over the front of the rim with the mask on Thats a nice little soft touch Bend over the front of the rim and just let it fall in And the Northeastern bench gets up to clap that whistle 739 left Huskies down by 12 The basketball stand And thats the big thing too If they are steals if your turnovers result are steals it just means the other team is going in transition the other way And those those are easy baskets and it gets some momentum and you get some energy and it takes cheering a little pressure off your half court offense and it makes the other team very timid and very afraid to catch the basketball Remember we talked about it 14 steals already in the game Second highest this season for Wake Forest 16 against America in the first game this season Ball deflected deflected Spillers lost it on the way up gathers it back Still time on the shot clock Mason will drive in He lost and had it poked away Nice shot by Franco coming up on the weak side to get the steal Now can you make a score if youre Northeastern Id like to see the ball go in the paint a little bit if Im as opposed to perimeter passes Chance to cut the lead down to single digits Little floater in the paint by Frankle but it wouldnt drop in for him But it was in the paint though right Coven keeps it himself Gives it out to Marion Now to Calise Oh nice Pretty passing inside I told you very unselfish as Marcus Marion could have taken the little 10ft shot You would have but he p made the bounce pass to the finish Spillers flushes it home Hes got 17 now for the Deaks And youre in danger time if youre Northeastern Youre either turning the ball over or in a quick shot Well youre looking like a turnover And yes soul get it right back No reset Frankle ball fake three Shot it wide Great defensive possession for Wake Forest Almost had a turnover and forced a quick shot Calmese will kick it out Kovven rises fires wouldnt drop in And last touched I believe by Allerie there along the baseline Watch this High low Nice bounce pass I love the bounce pass Lo balls catchable Spillers in the same motion Caught and dunk Good minutes there by Marion as blue comes back in Harris and kept going into the body of Abu to draw the foul charge to number one Thats his first and the 15 foul But in the act of shooting Juke Harris will have two here You know 550 on the clock and on the other side for Nor Eastern stand Its been a long time without Miles Newton on the floor Yeah Leading scoreer averaging 22 excuse me scoring 22 here today Had that huge first half You know about 17 minutes ago s that misstep getting that ankle retaped or appeared in the ankle Lower body injury lets say So well see Five and a half to go Wide open from the side of Lane Cant get it to drop in and lost it out of bounds Loane had a really nice look off that down screen some of those shots that were going in in the first half He has struggled shooting the basketball Only one of 14 from the three line going into this afternoons ball game That was a really good look for him Calb looking to post up spillers Had it kicked away right there for weight Youve got enough points in theory to to kind of nurse this home You dont have to be in rush mode Take a quick shot Take your time Get a high percentage shot a layup a late second three Harris with the step back three No good Huskies will run Kick it to the corner Lochnne drives inside to Fritz Lays it in Nice job by Lochain to make that pass and Fritz to finish Prits in double figures with 10 and CM nowhere to go there A tough shot with the clock and then a rough shot We just finished saying chance to cut it down to single digits if youre Northeastern 430 left Allie underneath to Fritz He lucky enough to get it out to Lot screaming and the three and its good Well he took the time and moved the basketball the way hes played today He could have been fast approaching 30 points if Wake Forest didnt make some adjustments But 22 points in this ball game and the fact that he only had 22 going into the season you know as a freshman They can do it here on this stage too Something he can build on for sure Four minutes left as Harris behind the back goes in and just uses that length to shoot over the top of the defender pushes the lead out to 11 after that Wake Forest timeout and the elevation also offensive foul there playing into his wheelhouse making it physical for Coleman but you get back to youre talking about Juke Harris his elevation he gets really good looks at the shot because he gets up high and its really hard to contest or get a hand in his face and he loves that little running downhiller into the paint off that illegal screen by Allerie Wake Forest gets the ball back Akens had a notion and I think Belaloo thought he was going to actually shoot it Cut to the basket Steve Forbes say Hey say that Shoot the basketball Get in there and penetrate a little bit more Its funny too You watch him Kovven and we know his dad Roseville Kovven star defensive player with the Patriots and also an allAmerican at Purdue So they try to play physical Dont they understand thats in his wheelhouse He wants you to push you around and he played at Purdue for a couple seasons He loves the physicality to play laughter Mike thats crazy Know your personnel KNOW YOUR PERSONALE KNOW YOUR BLOOD LINES Know five to shoot on this trip Forced jump shot by Lock name is no good Good hustle by Allerie there And cheering didnt like the call but I think the ball hit out of bounds all hit out of bounds before Allerie got to it You know you ever heard that old saying about coaches if you coach you listen to the fans in the stands pretty soon youll be up there with them Well its the same thing with officials If you listen to the officials if you listen to them too long in the stands you might be up there too Theyre going to look at this Theres a challenge on this Were going to look at this play here Steve Forbes wants to challenge this Theres a shot tip there One hand Does he graze it And then Kovvin saves it But I think you can see the bottom of a hand there And I Im not 100 certain And well wait Taking a peek to see if the ball when it bounced hit that end line before it to hit the line before 309 left All huddled up Want to make sure we get this call correct Still enough basketball left to be played Youre just joining us Wake led by one at the half Pushed the lead out to 15 at one point and maintaining a kind of double digit lead for the majority of this second half Not so comfortable that they can relax if this you ever could Next up for Steve Forbess group as he waits this challenge Of course theyll have Oklahoma here in the building on December second and theyll go to West Virginia So two big nonconference games left on the schedule Games in Charleston Charleston The challenge is successful It is weight ball So successful challenge and Steve Steve Fors the high five there on the bench as he gets the challenge Remember what the rule is now I told you Yeah The rule is you have to have a timeout first of all and then if you get that you get another you get another challenge If not you lose obviously in the timeout See some pressure now by Nor Eastern and Newton back on the floor here with 253 left That game up in West Virginia I think next year theyll play the Mountaineers in Greensboro Kind of like what they did with Michigan this year Uh the neutral sight game went up to Detroit 245 left Shot clock at five Long three is good Force mouse score just stepped into that jumper Hes in double figures now with 11 Pushes the lead to 14 He just seems to have a knack of making the right play You know what Im saying You know getting in for a loose ball getting a second chance opportunity to rebound coming off a screen and being in a catch and shoot position the number two threepoint shooter on this basketball team A Bru shut off at the baseline Hell try it again over the top of Harris Does not get the roll Spillers rips home the rebound Now hes got a double double to Spillers with 17 and 10 and has been everywhere defensively Also its awake in no hurry now leading by 14 Another deflection this time by Fritz Spiller is a senior averaging 14 and six on the year but those numbers continue to rise with every game Hes so active Hes got good hands and and makes do good decisions when he gets the ball in the paint That ball was deflected and lost it to Newton Rifles it ahead to Brew who flushes it home Nice pass and a better cheering finish by Xavier Brew Had a huge game Hes led this team in scoring three times Thats why its so amazing what uh screaming Milton has been able to do Miles Newtons been able to do 140 left A lot of contact as Akens drives in and around and around and drops through That might be the one Not sure if youre going to have enough of possessions And theres Kovven running into Fritz and cheering hits the deck And thatll be an illegal screen on Fritz Fritz didnt listen to what I was telling you about Thats the screaming wrong player to hit Watch this Scramble Push ahead Ab brew with the finish that this team is scoring three times already this season Only a freshman Could be a very potent back court or perimeter game if Newton gets going and Brew continues to score But then you get the offensive foul there hitting hitting uh Miles Kovven He enjoyed it He enjoyed the physicality 120 left Foul savior up here I will I wrote it down so I didnt forget Congratulations to the womens basketball team Wake Forest Undefeated 90 5744 win over Illinois State I think I remember that right I know they won Thats all Thats all that matters They won 5744 Theyll play again on Wednesday 1130 youth day education day But congratulations to them having a nice already got enough wins they had last year Had nine last year Already got there Thats a good thing So you know you got a better season Good showing by them for sure Newton has it blocked away by Spillers Deakons have numbers if they want to push it screaming Be easy Be easy And Coven will back it out Forbes might have been in his ear there right by him And under a minute left Wake Forest looking like theyll get back in the win column here today as Aikens kicks it to Harris too strong on the three Who else but Hoben making a play but just cheering couldnt quite hold on to it Dean fans still up that up except it officiate Well they may have gotten away with a foul earlier on that rebound and grabbed it and missed breast Hey again thanks to every crew for a wonderful job
