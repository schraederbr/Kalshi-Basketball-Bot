been able to get to the paint get where he wants to go but he comes to almost a stop on the dribble here right Yes Well you give him credit You see Stevenson fighting over the screen He just slows down Weve seen a lot of guards do that Yeah So Panini to the line He is 80 Four points in this first half cheering By the way John Perry I thought was pretty candid with us today when he talked about getting the job And then Bonini was willing to pay back the academy and put his name in the portal And so John Perry not only got the job from former athletic director Cad Gladshot he then had to rerecruit arguably one of the most important pieces of his team because Austin Bonini was willing to go through that process of paying them back and thats what you have to do when you walk off on the agreement after the deadline the service deadline taxes which it had for him and he said look we needed him to be a part of this and then you These guys they make a commitment Now this thing on Thursday the service assignment that is a real part of that experience Thats what its all about Heres Benini again Layup the left hand too Maybe starting to find it here Trailing eight under five to

averaging just better than three a game ON THE DRIVE Skip it Kim to shoot Dixon doing a good job there defensively Theres Draper left hand scoop and Bessar could not save it 29 on the shot clock And this is Johns awesome John Perry might have been looking for a uh a potential reset Did the ball on Drapers shot hit the rim Jamal Spearman nice piece of officiating said no And so Ryan Cissano will award it to Banini to put in play here Lob for Bernett and he is fouled with 11 on the shot clock by Stevenson Second on Jiren Stevenson Thats nine on Carolina And Bernett one of three at the line will be able to strike for two here Well I look for Navy if they can knock down these free throws to be in another press matchup zone and kind of take Carolina out of their rhythm again Hows Carolina handle the zone behind At times pretty good at times but for the most part I got to give Navy credit Its kind of taking them out of the rhythm cheering applause If youre Hubert Davis how much are you studying lineup combinations at the half in terms of the sequencing of this game You know your starters are you know your starters are but to your great question Youre trying to figure out who who is my best team to finish out halves and thats key cuz you saw when they saw and Wilson went out things were very stagnant right So one of those guys has to be on the floor right now at all times All right So you got Dennis on the floor with Dixon Bogabots Stevenson and Vessa See heres that Yeah Wilsons going to the bench Every free throw Coach Perry going to a little match up Its kind of slow things down a little bit Then when Carolina gets to the front court they kind of slack off Exactly Busard at the foul line Kho defending Oh boy Rattles little jump hook 10point game And if Navy wants they can take the last shot Yes applause And they will ban off the screen Three ball Just money Just flat out money You go under the screen steps into the shot and shoots it with confidence time really works At least for John Perry For John Perry There you laughter go applause I think John Perry would like this thing in second or third gear Hubert Davis wants it And heres a turnover to start that And Draper with the and missed the layup And meanwhile Wilson going to see if he can get an advantage Look at this And off the iron but a foul called Caleb Wilson draws the foul down the floor against Mike Woods And two shots coming on the foul against Woods which is his second And John Perrys calling Its right here Oh its stuck Yeah it never never moved Still missed the layup still hasnt
