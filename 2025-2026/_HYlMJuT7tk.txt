have lost four straight So two teams trying to get reconnected with winning ways here in the Dean Dome Carson Town and Notre Dame win the tip Bert Smith Clarence Armstrong and Don Daly our first class officiating crew Jaylen Harlson and the Irish with the ball on this Wednesday night Theres Braden Shrewsbury for a Notre Dame team that gives Brady Kaylor his first career start Colerta his fourth Both teams with changes to their starting lineups well get to momentarily Notre Dame is deep in the shot clock here with Serta and the timer at two And that shot is denied decisively by a flying Seth Trimble with 610 of a second to shoot And a statement by Seth Trimble the leader of the Tar Hills the senior coming across blocking the shot throwing it out of bounds Only 6 remaining on the shot clock So nothing better for the Tar Hills on their first defensive possession Notre Dame trying to avoid a shot clock violation Gets it into Carson Tout He draws the iron and Harelson has the rebound And again that was what you dont want Carolina saw a lot of that against Cal the first few possessions of the game where Cal was able to get off to a 70 start against the Tarheel Harlson rims out a rebound to Jaden Young making his first start in Carolina Blue Tar Hills have three usual starters Wilson Henry Vinsar and Sam Trimble Derek Dixon makes his second start in a row the freshman point guard And the Virginia Tech transfer Young is in the game to start He sets up Trimble for three But thats really what Derek Dixon has provided Knocked down four threes in his first start against Cal last time out and now knocked down the first one on the offensive possession for the Tar Hills It is the freshman Derek Dixon out of Vienna Virginia Notre Dame starting five Harlson Shrewsbury in top The regulars Serta and Kaylor make this a new starting lineup for Micah Shrewsbury And Kaylors miss is grabbed by Wilson The first rebound of what will be many And Wilsons not going to get a chance of the rebound here as Trimble finishes through traffic Dixon and Trimble in the back court with the opening buckets for Carolina And the count is now one One thing well look at today how many times does Seth Tumble end up in the crowd It normally happens multiple times throughout the game Whats your over under this time Over four today All right Over under four Well see Harelson misses it Just one more thing for our statistician extraordininaire Freddy Ker to keep track of Bessard sets up Trimbo No good for three Wilson goes over the top and is called for the games first foul Caleb Wilson is tremendous at starting the action on offense Hes the best rebounder in the ACC but he has the ability to push the basketball well The advanced pass against Seth Trimble out in transition Trimble able to finish and ends up in the crowd for the first time of many here this evening Now if you end up in just the front row of the photographers does that count or does he have to actually contact a fan Well considering there are more people more than one person would be concerned crowd So therefore camera crew part of the crowd Okay knocked away from Taylor into the crowd with 11 to shoot Notre Dame pretty good threepoint shooting team and theyve struggled in this fourgame losing streak Very poor from the line and they really struggle with turnovers Michael Shrewsbury in his third year in South Beds looking for his first win at Notre Dame against a ranked team Heres Harelson Irish started 0 for five all from inside the arc Harelson in the paint bumps and scores it off the window into the body of the freshman Dixon Thats the advantage of having a 67 point guard Even though Derek Dixon has great positional size Harelson even taller and stronger in the paint Heres Henry Vessar down to Wilson Foul and a ferocious dunk try Yes Gary fall after that one But how often do you see the big big pick and roll action as Wilson is unable to hold on to the rim fortunately able to get his feet away from falling back behind him But I love the action from Hubert Davis going with the big big screener roll And normally you dont see the fiveman as the ball handler in the big big screen roll Hubert Davis in year five as the Carolina head coach will watch his freshman stand out Wilson 70 free throw shooter misses the first This is a weakness for Carolina They get to the line a lot But they are one of the poorest shooting free throw teams in the nation 67 is third worst in the ACC as Wilson goes 0 for two but the ball is tipped out to Dixon Li fourth in the ACC field goal shooting They get a quarter three up and good from the first time starter Jaden Young But when you put Jaden Young on the floor alongside Dixon that gives Seth Trimble a number of driving lanes Trimble even though stumbling still able to deliver the assist to the corner Young who started 10 at Virginia Tech a year ago Serta is bumped and Cole Serta will go to the line Eric Dixon picks up the foul Step wants to attack the basket When you have shooting on the perimeter it opens up driving lanes If you help it opens up opportunities for Jaden Young for Derek Dixon who have both knocked down threes in this game I asked Hubert Davis before the game about Jaden Young He said first of all hes from Goldsboro and Goldsboro kids are tough And then he said I didnt give him playing time He took it He was out of the rotation He missed a couple of games early this year just because of a coachs decision Young And at just 23 points per game he has wrestled away a starting spot for North Carolina Young has played well He was a guy that really was a silver lining in the two losses in California gave the Tar Hills good minutes and more importantly minutes at a a crucial time throughout the game U Davis was trusting him to end games Even though he may not have played much in the first half hes absolutely earned as you mentioned the right to be on the floor now in the starting lineup for the first time the season for Irish Spring 611 sophomore Garrett Sundra off the bench to replace Tal Theyre certainly undersized tonight and should be the rest of the year lost big man Kevaji to a knee injury for the season Theres a three for Wilson Its only his fifth of his freshman year and only thats his first in ACC action So was 0 for three coming into the game from beyond the arc But Caleb Wilson has that capability But look at what hes doing now defensively getting lower into his stance even though there was a miscommunication on his switch allowing Sera to knock down the three Notre Dames marksman at 39 from deep and Serta has been hot 117 the Tarheel lead Carolina four for five from the field as Wilson thinks about another three Dixon will take it Thats off the mark and rebounded by Sundra Irish have hit their last two Those two free throws off an 0 for five start Shrewsbury makes it three in a row the best threepoint percentage in the ACC Braden Shrewberry with a muchneeded early triple But I love that three by Braden Shrewsbury because he didnt rely on anyone else to create an opportunity for him Just took matters into his own hands off the bounce with an individual three He has been struggling big time in ACC play as Treble is fouled on the drive Good offensive action early Six straight points for the Irish Heels lead by one watching that game and of course Freddy was in the building for that one But I can remember all the hype and the hoopla desertedly so surrounding opening this building Jeff Lebo a McDonalds AllAmerican in his freshman year coming in and playing in the building Of course Huber Davis who averaged 21 points per game his senior year Carolina Its amazing to look at the rosters for that game Brad Dardy Kenny Smith Johnny Dawkins RJ Bis Tommy Amler for Duke go on and on and on with all names in the history of this great rivalry That was also the class that saved Coach K So again thats the class that played the first game in this building but it was the Tar Hills walking away with the win down the stretch Nice jumper by Tal offensive rebound And even though It was Garrett Ser with the offensive rebound Harson couldnt finish Notre Dame got some great looks The 60 Notre Dame run was snapped as Luca Bogats first shot of the game is buried from three But Caleb Wilson is getting a a master class of how to handle post traps Hes getting trapped pretty much every possession He catches the basketball on the block and knew exactly where to deliver the pass to pick up an assist Applause Irish with Tout Serta Sundra Harelson and Trusar Remember theyre without Marcus Burton their leading scorer Harlsons jumper ripped down by Henry Vasar back of the game for North Carolina the 7 foot star About as good a big to big combo as youll see in the game And theres one of them Wilson who rims out another try from three Shrewsberry son of Michael Shrewberry who said We might try to play Braden and Cole Cert a little more together Two great threepoint shooters Braden gets a clean look but misses there Wilson couldnt grab the low pass from Dixon out of bounds and a Carolina turnover Johnson playing against Aaliyah Chavez and Reagan Beers I had worked with those three young ladies at the Nike Academy this summer So I will definitely be tuned in checking that one out Of course you know big sis is coaching Taylor Give me your scouting report on the three you work with Well Aaliyah Chavez will shoot it from anywhere Tessa Johnson one of the best shooters in the game and Reagan gets the job done on the block Anytime she catches it shes absolutely correct 730 tomorrow South Carolina Oklahoma as Notre Dame turns it over Sir Muhammad on the floor along with Logan Ims for the first time 1510 the North Carolina lead and Jonathan Powell Jiren Stevenson and Ken Evans off the bench Vessar one starter on the floor finds an open Powell Vessar has got the rebound Boats no good from three Music And the Irish 0 for their last five with the ball Mohammed played very well the last two games started at Virginia Tech off the fence today His miss cleaned up by Tout Hiker Shrewsbury feels like Mohamd gives them a threat to attack the paint So thats one of the reasons why hes been in double figures in the last two games Great job defensively by Jiren Stevenson not only to block the shot but to keep it in bounds And it leads to an open three Evans buries it turnover Not a turnover but a block leading to an open triple And Evans is the fifth Tarheel with a made three tonight But thats one of those fivepoint swings that Huga Davis talked about were not going in their favor on the West Coast strip This this time at home theyre turning it into an advantations Applause leading active rebounder Not a huge score and ran into big trouble and a 5second violation which you basically never see Or did he get one shot from two and made it Notre Dame has taken 12 shots from two and made just one And youre considering a team that normally plays through their bigs as Garrett Sunders able to knock down the three on the exterior and hes a guy that Michael Shrewsbury and his staff wants to see be more aggressive on the offensive end Also defensively want to see him foul somebody Heres a twopoint try Jiren Stevenson missed it right at the rim Another nice pass Big to big action Mohhammed goes behind the back and off the window Off the Stevenson Rebound Heres Evans Moved to the bench for the last two games in favor of the freshman Dixon run the offense through Vesar and Vessar muscles out of the rim and gets fouled Arson top pleats his case to no on the interior and theyre used to getting fouled but they go to the free throw strike and take care of business normally at about a 70 to 75 clip Now youve got three straight misses from that front court Caleb Wilson missing two and Bessar missing his first of the year Tout is out of the game Matt Mlen graduate transfer from NIA Madonna is on the floor as Vesar hits the second Heels are just two for six today So Notre Dame already under man on the front line Theyre at 610 Senior Kev Jai done for the year with a knee injury He announced yesterday and Mlen had a lot of minutes at Virginia Tech and may have to again tonight start to pass up an opportunity He came off of the DHO clean but wasnt looking at the basket where hes been shooting lights out from three Logan IS gets an open foul line jumper Junior from Zansville who had started the previous five makes it 1915 But this is what Michael Shrewsbury wants to see He wants to see Logan picking up the basketball He feels like he can be a menace defensively and put more pressure on the ball handle Evans step back three off the side of the rim and tap to Serta Great threepoint shooter Runs a break for Notre Dame Halfway through the first half Notre Dame shooting just five for 18 So much better start for North Carolina after these four disastrous defensive games Mohamd for Ims That three is no good and grabbed by Vessar Evans Nobody guarded Powell He makes him pay And a great read by Evans But you got to give credit to Jiren Stevenson who running the floor occupies the defense and allows Evans to find Powell in the corner for the three Thats six made threes Six players with a triple for North Carolina Now Henry Vessar whos 24 for 49 from three isnt one of them Well they had a game earlier in the year where they had eight different players make a three So could be a possibility of seeing that here this evening as everyones getting involved But watch Jiren Stevenson occupy the defense You have to get over and tag And as you tag to make sure Stevenson doesnt get the layup and opens up Powell on the outside Ev is delivering a strike North Carolina had a game last week at Stanford They scored 90 even though they had a season low seven assists on 32 field goals And they wanted to see a little bit more ball movement even with a high scoring Tonight six assists on seven makes and only one turnover which probably even better for Hubert Tavis to see But if you think of the Carolina their three losses on the road in ACC action theyre averaging 92 points per game shooting 51 from the field and making nine threes a game in those three losses So those averages are above their season averages So it hasnt been the offense thats the problem Its been what theyve done defensively Heres a three for Vesar Left it short and Mlullen the rebound for Notre Dame What is Carolina doing better defensively than weve seen the last couple of weeks Well its this trying to keep the basketball out of the painted area but more importantly theyre putting up much more resistance They have been broken down at the point of attack offensively and guys have been able to get into the painted area Besar off THE SLIP CANT FINISH WILSON CAN and Micah Shrewsbury will take his second time out of thats when he normally finishes up but Caleb Wilson not assuming anything goes in and gets the put back slreame just five for 21 at the other end strong drive by Brady Kaylor he cant connect and Jiren Stevensons got the rebound for the Tarheelss Carolina six different players with a three Wilson leads the way with just five an incredible ly balanced start knocked away by Kaylor who dives to the floor and was out of bounds But that is the kind of effort and toughness Notre Dames getting from this 610 freshman Microsbury called Brady Kaylor skinny tough earlier today Young man who is not lacking confidence at all And I can truly appreciate that Kaylor coming off a careerhigh 17 points in their last game at Virginia Tech Hes got a little edge to his game Micah Shrewsbury thinks out of Cathedral High School which is Micahs alma mater Indiana kid and rewarded with his first career start Young end of the shot clock Stevenson ended up yanking Harelson to the ground there Stevenson is hit with a North Carolina foul his first Jiren Stevenson getting quality minutes right now I dont know if hes even been out of the game since he came in as a substitution for Vesar early but Huber Davis trusts Jiren Stevenson on the defensive end to guard perimeter players Also guarding big making him very valuable to the Tarhill line Shrewberry fakes a three against Wilson inside and that was scored against Stevenson A really strong cut by Harlson and the freshman just two for eight has his second bucket Jimblean Dixon along with Young the guards for Carolina Four starters and Stevenson in for Vesar as UNCC turns it over for only the second time Young stepping on the sideline trying to set up a screen and roll action that retreat step But as Hummer Davis doesnt ever want to see them turn the basketball over but if youre going to turn it over make sure its a dead ball turnover in comparison to the pick six which they gave up on the West Coast Applause Lot of switches here for Wilson Shrewsbury finds Kaylor who missed the dunk but got fouled Notre Dame just kept switching and switching on the perimeter and got a good look from Kaylor who will shoot two and no one there to truly pick up Kaylor attacking the basket Trimble gets over at the last minute but hes late And reading the pick and roll coverage thats one where if youre Seth Trimble you have to be early already and on the in pretty much the middle of the lane so that that pass isnt available Force him to skip it all the way to the outside Taylor continuing with the theme of the game misses a free throw Vesar replaces Stevenson We saw a lot of defensive breakdowns on the West Coast for North Carolina Where in their communication are you seeing these struggles for UNCC the last couple of weeks Well one we just saw earlier in the game a miscommunication on a switch where Cole was able to knock down a three to top the key But we asked Huber Davis if you run earlier today was there one particular thing He said the problem is its everything They have been lacking in every different area defensively Starting with guys being able to crack the paint at will not being able to keep guards out of the painted area Wilson gets his own miss Wilson back up short and theres a whistle in there A foul So Caleb Wilson will go to the line in a game that has been largely foulfree so far Just the fourth against Notre Dame It was writer cross 67 freshman Philip missed his first two free throws tonight Five points three rebounds one assist in the game and he gets the first to go Next Saturday an ACC Network mens basketball quadruple header Thats one week from this Saturday 10 days away North Carolina is a Georgia Tech following Pit and Clemson on the ACC Network and on the ESPN app Georgia Tech team that won last Saturday at NC State That NC State turned around and won yesterday at Clemson handing the Tigers their first league loss But a topy turby couple of days here in the ACC Applause Ninepoint lead for UNC which has not trailed Harelson weaving through draws the contact and the foul Theres another example of where North Carolina has struggled defensively Its simply just a oneonone matchup where Jaylen Harrisons able to beat Jaden Young off the bounce able to finish and theres no resistance there from either of the bigs because they have to respect the shooting on the interior forgive me on the exterior So therefore Harelsons able to get to the rim finish and an opportunity for a threepoint play Mah Shrewsbury mentioned he wants to have his son Braden Shrewsbury and Cole Certa in the game together the two shooters Is that the kind of possession that shows why that works Thats exactly why it works And thats the reason why he started Braden Shrewsbury and Cole Serta together in this game is to create those driving lanes So therefore you have to make a decision Are you going to help or are you going to allow Braden Shrewsbury and Cole Sera who both are shooting the basketball extremely well this season to have those wide open looks from three Harlson just picked up his first foul under six to play in this first half That ball slipped through Vesar tracks it down Sets up Bogavotss got a little cold from three here They havent hit from the field in about three minutes But thats often the problem when you start out making threes as FS is able to knock down another one for Notre Dame as they shot the basketball very well from beyond the arc to start this game Irish are four for seven from deep Bogots into contact It wouldnt go A hard earned trip to the line coming for the junior from Montenegro Applause Thats the second foul on Harelson who picked up a foul on each of the last two possessions Notre Dame the last two games or North Carolina the last two games Defensive struggles for sure Also theyve left a ton of points out there at the line Boats 75 shooter hits the first Applause Two for true trip for Luca Bogots Very young Notre Dame lineup here and foul away from the ball Theyre going to get Seth Trumble pushing pushing Braden Shrewsbury into the screen Two hands in the back Trumble second and that puts Notre Dame to the edge of the bonus 16 fouls against UNCC Shrewberry and Sert on the floor together again as Ims runs to the control slips it back to Kaylor off the fake Kaylor denied by a recovering Vesar Vesar into Wilson Quick double team come as Wilson works around it and gets fouled by Ryder Frost Underrated aspect of Bessars game his ability to block shots Not only can he get the job done on the offensive end but defensively as well Even though hes beat with his length able to recover and denied an opportunity Caleb Wilson actually orchestrated that last offensive possession ran the floor got post position but wasnt open to the original passer on the perimeter pointed to Vessar to make sure that his teammate knew to get the ball to his big man His big man would be able to deliver the basketball inside which results in a foul Special combination Wilson and Vessar averaging 37 points 20 rebounds collectively a game This got a lane violation against Shrewberry So Wilson will reshoot the second free throw Applause When you look at the numbers of this front court when you consider Caleb Wilson and Henry Bessar strong case you can make for this being the best front court in the country But its not just about the scoring and the rebounding where both guys are averaging over 17 and nine which would be the first duo in the history of this story program to be able to do that Another open three off a little pick and roll Kaylor misses it Rebound down to Dixon for North Carolina Vessar is calling for it in the paint Couldnt get the initial entry Now Wilson wants it from Trimble Pacing up the freshman Frost out of the double team Extra pass Dixon good for three All created by Caleb Wilson drawing the double team and making the right pass out which leads to the hockey assist Second three for Dixon Hes the first Carolina player of the six with a made three to hit a second three Shrewberry finds a cutter Its a driving serta for a rare two and trouble with two fouls Couldnt do much about that Was able to show much resistance Wilson no resistance to him when the double team was there He just went the opposite direction He had no interest Spun around Kaylor Wilson into double figures with 11 He scored 11 or more in every game of his college career Applause Serta the hand off for Shrewsbury Bogots behind him Shrewsbury Kaylor passes up a corner three Dribbles into traffic and then gets fouled Luka Bogavots with his Cayla Wilson Hes one of one Hes the first that weve seen There are a number of guys that we can talk about he has traits similar to but Im going to go with Mike Im going to stick to my guns Im not going to compare them to anybody Ill wait till we get to the combine in May and we can talk about those comps then I cant believe thats stunning cowardice or stunning bravery from you to say you know what I reject the comparison game Well or youre just afraid to throw out a really good name and Im Caleb Wilson It is I dont know Lets put the pine down the middle It is because Sean Farnum Seth Greenberg Kevin Connor and I heard of him Yeah right We have this thing where and I will say this Farnum does a great job with his comps Okay I had to make rules for Seth The top hundred again you know of course the NBA 75 theyre off limits Off limits And what the guys that Caleb Wilson reminds me of hes in that NBA 75 which means hes off limits Im not going to put a comp out there for him I would like people to give comps to like really good ninth men in the NBA but thats you know thats what most guys are going to do Yeah And so so I agree with what youre saying If youre going to do a comp you cant be disrespectful and compare someone to some of the greatest players have ever played the game I think we should just comp NBA 75 guys throughout the rest of this Thats thats Greenberg style Ryder Frost looking like a young George Gervin with the three The second three for Ryder Frost And now North Carolina starting to you know give up those opportunities that hurt them so much on their West Coast trip Theres Bessar in from Wilson Wilson is unbelievable at handling the pressure And again hes getting trapped pretty much every time he catches the basketball on the block Hubert Davis knows that Thats why they play through him to open up opportunities for his teammates on the perimeter But no one guy is going to be able to guard Caleb manto man down there Wilson late to get that three right across missed it You say Caleb Wilson has really the passing ability of a young Caleb Wilson Heres Shberry open three Shberry missed it Wilsons there to high point the rebound Hes got 124 and two assists Bessar runs the floor and couldnt finish it right at the rim These are shots that Bessar normally takes advantage of We talked about shooting close to 65 from the field And this is a young man who has made 24 threes on the season coming in So not everything is around the rim Theres another three That ones good from Garrett Sundrew And the open threes are starting to pile up here for Notre Dame Thats how Notre Dame staying in it Now theyre shooting 50 from beyond the arc which has been the benchmark for Carolina opponents over the last four games Vessar goes into Sunder who just scored back for Bogots Miscommunication there Vesar was able to handle it Closing in on five to shoot Dixon off balance somehow got the bounce to go Soft touch by Dixon Just getting it on the rim allowing the basketball to do the rest Three points for the freshman on a season high 14 last game I too easy into the paint Rebound deflected to Wilson Full steam ahead Caleb Wilson takes on the Irish all five of them and scores it But thats what makes him so dangerous We know hes an elite rebounder has a chance to be the best freshman rebounder in North Carolina history but the ability to take it 94 feet and make a play for himself or his teammate makes him elite Shrewsbury in the dying moments of the half Mohamd try to drive on Wilson Top two is good for Sir Mohamd Last shot of the half for North Carolina if they can get it Powell three No And that heave wont count by Notre Dame good from three but shut down from two And the Tar Hills lead by now a better defensive first Defensive breakdown Are you certain that there was not supposed to be a switch or the switch was called I said he was involved You didnt say Derek Dixon Well we were doing Caleb Wilson highlights Had we done Derek Dixon highlight score Dixon was involved in the miscommunication He was involved too Eden Besar is involved in this basket and UNCC leads by 11 In all sincerity Carolina defense in the first half What do you make of the first 20 minutes Honestly I think it was pretty much the same defense that they saw in the West Coast The difference is theyre at home and because theyve been great Theyre fourth in the country in in twopoint field goal percentage defense So theyve been great guarding the paint The problem has been they havent guarded threepoint line well Notre Dame 50 from beyond the arc in the first half And more importantly as we talked about off air those threes are wide open Those are defensive breakdowns that Im that Huber Davis Im sure hopes they clean up here in the second half And you mentioned Dixon Dixon and Wilson Two freshman have been involved in a lot of the action for Notre Dame led by Jaylen Harlson with seven Garrett Sundra right had six And Harlson full Mark Sanchez just ran under the back of his own teammate Carson Tout Just the second turnover of the game for Notre Dame or only four combined in the first half but thats another product of North Carolinas defense not really being that aggressive in this game Notre Dame comes into this game averaging 16 turnovers a game in ACC action Only one in the first half Theres the first three for Vetsar who had just three points in the first half and has the first two buckets here in the second Hes the seventh Tarheel with a made three And Bessar letting out a screen after knocking down that three was one of six versus Cal in their last time out So and he got it shooting 49 from three Still sa no good on a tough contested three rebound to Brady Kaylor who didnt score in that first half and tout got undercut by Young Thats the third foul on Jaden Young Ves steps in knocks down the three ball and then look at the exclamation after Excited to see the three ball go down after he struggled to shoot the basketball the last time out versus Cap Double figures in every game this year Hes got eight tonight and guard the inbounder Harelson Thats a tough pass Tal will get to it Carolinas front court as folks might have imagined dominating the game And Bessar continues it Blocked the shot and then flipped it right off of Harelson Its North Carolina ball and Bessar fired up again Smart play by Bessar unable to save the basketball after the block but recognizes that Harelson is out of bounds And I what I really appreciate about that he didnt fire at Harelson because he knew it was going to be a turnover anyway He didnt have to throw it extremely hard All he had to do was touch the body Just a soft little plop like he was playing Now he sets up a three for Dixon the freshman with his third Timeout Notre Dame US Arizona transfer red shirt junior from Talon Estonia who has had a amazing first year in Chapel Hill 179 on a block per game shooting 64 from the field for pretty much everybody else in the ACC Hed be the best big man on the team for here Hes part of maybe the best one two front court combo of the country with Caleb Wilson as Young just picked up his fourth foul against Shrewberry So an early second half exit coming for Jamesar is a kid who only scored two and a half points per game as a freshman at Arizona Dislocated his elbow in a golf cart incident missed his second year Last year nine and a half points five rebounds off the game And he was the kind of big North Carolina was really lacking last year to pair him with Caleb Wilson has been enormous for UB It really has has taken a lot of the pressure off of Caleb Wilson even though hes getting double team every time he touches the basketball on the block Having Bessar at the top of the key especially with his shooting ability changes things and Besar has done a great job of diving in that short roll catching passing out to his teammates as well So those two guys have really opened up a lot of opportunities for their teammates But for North Carolina to be successful moving forward theyre going to have to get more production from their guards Trimble one of those guards picked up his third So Young out of the game with four Replaced him Trimble stays in with three Tout over Vessar And Henry grabs his ninth rebound Applause Dixon Wilson Oh too hot to handle the first Vesar grabbed it spun and scored And after a threepoint first half hes a rebound away from a double double in almost 2 minutes and 40 seconds Music He has scored or assisted on all 10 points in this second half as Carolina gets hit with another foul Well Caleb Wilson once he catches the basketball isnt certain as to whether or not Vesar is going to stay on the perimeter Hes throwing the pass for the threepoint shot Vessar is diving However great hands by Vessar as hes able to corral it spin and then get the layup off the glass Applause Tough inbound here Tout out muscles Dixon I know we think of Caleb Wilson we in the larger basketball world you too as a likely top five pick in the NBA Henry Vesar where is he as a pro Mid first round I do believe hes I the decision for him to come to North Carolina has really changed his draft status His ability to shoot the basketball as Tal is able to come up with the second chance points But Besars ability to shoot the basketball from three has really opened the eyes of many at the NBA level as he looks to knock one out but he doesnt let that one go Now the way hes been playing in the second half he cant pass up those opportunities Well hes going to get two free throws either way Vessar continues to imprint every aspect of the game as Shrewsbury fouled him as first And Mike Shrewsberrys team has looked overmatched in the second half after trailing by nine at halftime Applause Well if you consider the wideopen looks that Notre Dame was able to get from three in the first half where they went six of 12 North Carolina has really cleaned that up in the first three and a half minutes of action here in the second half which has allowed them to really stretch this lead out to 17 Henry Vesars ability defensively has really helped as well as much as what hes done on the offensive end Sundra and I replace Serta and Tout Vesar two for four at the line will take a seat for Stevenson HDR turns to a heros welcome Coach Davis going with the full tie suit everything today Often times well see him wear the sports coat some slacks and maybe a buttonup shirt but going with the tie for the 40th anniversary I love it Sensationally dressed Davis Theres great respect for the 40 years history in this building Wilson cleaned it up Harlson second chance opportunity And that is Notre Dames the second second chance bucket of the game into Wilson Too late So the the problem is when the pass comes from the top of the key you cant double Its normally when the pass is coming from the wing it gives you an opportunity to get there with the double But the pass being that easy no pressure on the basketball allows Caleb Wilson to go to work as soon as he gets the ball in his hands Harson message from Notre Dames coaching staff was we versus the ball Defend the paint as a unit Powell misses a three Theyre holding up pretty well in the paint for Wild UNCC was good from three Theyve started to dominate the paint as the games gone on This may end up in the paint A little too long for Wilson who was out of bounds Caleb now taking the Seth Trumble roll going into the camera crew I think hes now surpassed Trimble Crew last years number one pick The flag will be in that Lakers maps game One of these five Cory Alexander be the number one pick this year What do you think Well I dont agree with this order However I do believe that this could very well be the five guys drafted with those first five picks I think there are other guys that may jump into the mix as well Whos your number one on that one Uh Im going with AJ Devons at one Uh its a tossup right now between Caleb Wilson and Cameron Bruce at two I think that AJ and Caleb have all the tools necessary to become superstars at the NBA level I think Boozer will be a 15year pro or probably 15 time allstar I think he has the highest floor but I believe the ceiling for AJ Caleb Stevenson just got fouled right across with his third But the name who was the number one coming into the season there is Derek Peterson of Kansas Now hes dealt with all kinds of injuries lower body leg issues Peterson he is back Hes had trouble finishing games for Kansas but starting to see what he and Kansas can do They knocked off Iowa State last week and the JayHawks are one of the hotter teams in the country And I think Darren similar to Booer I think hell be a great pro I think hell be a perennial allstar I just think that with Caleb and with AJ you have the chance to have a franchise changing possibly generational talent and a lot of it starts with their athleticism but you consider that Peterson as well as Boozer are somewhat finished products I think the ability for AJ and Caleb to get better and increase their talent level is going to even skyrocket once they get to the NBA level And youre talking about two elite talents right now in college Logan eyes with a bucket for Notre Dame Caleb Wilson on the bench right now as Tar Hills lead by 18 Stevenson Evans got it They need some shooting from Ken Evans Hes obliged tonight after going three for 15 in his last four Hes two for three Three I believe Evans has taken a little bit of the pressure off of himself No longer in the starting lineup I think hes a little more relaxed once he gets on the floor and is able to knock down shots Really which is his calling card coming to UNCC Mohamd scores over him Sir Mohamd on his second bucket The sophomore from little ways down the road in Charlotte Sir Mohamd with the positional size able to take advantage of smaller guards as Stevenson is able to knock down the three And this is what Jiren Stevenson did in high school Of course reclashed up to go to Alabama He was a scorer more of a shooter at the prep ranks has been much more of a defender in his college time but this is something he can add as a dimension to the offensive end North Carolina has just tied the UNCC record eight players with a made three in the game which they did against East Carolina earlier this year Stevenson with the Heels 113 today But theres part of it has to do with the fact that Notre Dame is so concerned about the size of North Carolina What Bessar has done with Caleb Wilson has done in the painted area in this game just giving away opportunities for everyone on the perimeter That time Stevenson able to take advantage of it Great throws for Cole Cerna who is fouled by Evans Now in that game against East Carolina one of the players that did hit a three was Elijah Davis And so theres a chance that we will get some guys in the game that have not played minutes yet Now with Carolina leading by 20 where they could possibly break that school record with someone else knocking down a three Well two players who have fell to Florida have been hit three so far Zayen High hes only hit one And then Seth Trimble 30 threepoint shooter Well Seth Trumble also didnt hit one in that game I dont think he attempted that game He wasnt fractured left game Hes been back for the last eight games now Melon with a foul for Notre Dame Heels by 20 with 13 to go Nice drive by Carol Well the West Virginia transfer with a tough finish And Pal does the majority of his damage from beyond the arc with showing off his ability to attack the rim as well 63 of his 79 attempts from three into the game Stir up wouldnt go Rebound Bogots Bogots Evans got another The reality behind it is if North Carolina shoots the basketball this way theres nothing you can do because you know youre going to get the production on the interior with Vesar and Wilson So if you allow them to get clean looks from three and theyre making them to this level theyve become unguarded Off the miss by Todd Here they go again Bogavas with acres of space Put back Vessar and a foul ITS LIKE THEYRE PLAYING EIGHT ON FIVE Teammates thats made a play You ever see U Mission Impossible fall out the six Mission Impossible Im sure I did They all start to run together at this point But yes Im sure I saw Theres a moment where there the bathroom fight Henry Caval kind of the arms as hes going to punch somebody That looked like Caleb Wilson like he was loading up the flex there Oh okay All right Caleb Wilson going full Henry Caval It took a long way to get to that story my friend But anytime I can reference Mission Impossible Fallout one of the great action movies ever Im going to take that opportunity And lets all forget about Mission Impossible The Final Reckoning from last year Its about two hours too long 70 to 45 Bogavots again open again misses Oh they are getting one clean look after another Harlson trying to bully his way in the paint Gets fouled by Power One and one coming up the Tarheel season Speaking of down under we had a conversation with Ruba Davis earlier today whose daughter is studying abroad down under Yes And she was he was telling us how she has now turned him on to house music Doesnt really know what it is but he likes it So therefore he uses it during his walk which is part of his pregame routine walking around the Smith Center prior to their shootound He told us that his playlist can include as TA by the way was fouled by Vessel and Ta who likes to use the glass gets his own miss and Harelson gets his miss and well if at first you dont succeed try try again four shots whether the line or the field finally a bucket he said its RB hiphop country classical and house music and now house is new to the to the Trimble got dispossessed Heres Harlson on the run in the corner Serta great shooter And thats tipped out to Trimble Powell Trimble And Trimble finishes and nearly ends up in the crowd Hes only been there once Great twoon one The ball does not touch the floor As soon as Powell catches it he drops it right back to Trimble Hes able to finish in stride Applause Serta Thats all entangled with Tout and the fouls going to go against Carson Touts his third for Notre Dame Trimble grimacing a little bit after the bucket and Yuber Davis checking to make sure his senior is okay Look at the beautiful fast break Trimbles able to go with the reverse layup Hes fine Hes missed too much time this year I dont think he would be taken by the game if he tried Fractured left forearm in a team workout November Wilson Besar how did that work It goes off the glass first Besar tries to still dunk it through but even the failed attempt becomes a made field goal Caleb Wilson gets an assist off the back Uhoh Uhoh He strips Here comes the Thunder And then Caleb ends it up in the crowd Yeah he didnt skip the inbound pass away Caleb Wilson tossing it up to Bessar but it hits the backboard first Still able to go and then Wilson out on the break with the nice finish but unable to stick the landing And now he has taken the lead over Seth Trimble in landing in the cameras in this game 21 I think it is two partial count in in Calebs favor He leads the team in every other stat it seems to be So may as well take that one over as well Points rebounds steals blocks minutes starts free throw attempts and leaves the country in dunks 59 of them now Kick three from Tout Harlson way too long Offensive rebound Kaylor Shot clock never reset I knows it I misses it Tip to Tout Notre Dames just missing shots grabbing the ball missing shots grabbing the ball Almost like Carolinas not there except theyre leading by 29 Hubert Davis look at the stat sheet and see his team is holding the Irish to 32 from the field and maybe even better 32 from three Notre Dame is 0 for seven from three in the second half Now Freddy Ker over with us on this side oftentimes is over right by Hubert Davis during games The next game where Im here and Freddys on that side Im going to need a stat of how many times Hubert takes his glasses off and on during the game is constant And when he gets upset he takes them off He doesnt slam them down but he places them firmly on the table Got to be careful You dont want to slam down your glasses Rip off the sou Thats one Very true Besar three Applause And thats last touch by Kaylor to argue it was touched by Wilson It wasnt that close I mean you got to give it a chance Yeah why not They have to lose He didnt look over to his bench and call for a challenge so he knew he was just playing games Glass is firmly affixed to Hubert Davis This is a the type of win Carolina desperately needed Tough times for the Heels Two and three in the lead You calling it with 815 remaining I feel pretty confident Okay Its a lot of time left in this game Look if not Notre Dame can make the highlight reel and they can lead the highlight reel with that Nobody believed in us That all except by fate Trimble misses Irish trying to get should they say the Tar Hills trying to get back to 500 in the league And again they are 110 at home this year Every home game except for Wake Forest a week ago They won by three Theyve won by 12 or more Tout with the bucket for the Irish Looking for win number 501 at the Dean Smith Center Three days past the 40th anniversary of this buildings first game Knocked away from Vesar Heres Kaylor off the steel Fast and loose hoops right now IMS misses a three Knocked to Wilson Wilson spinning and winning against T Caleb Wilson has a 20point game his 13th of the year But the one thing about Caleb Wilson his ability to rebound gives him so many opportunities to initiate in transition Thats why I think he has a chance to be a superstar at the next level His playmaking ability is understated because his scoring and his rebounding normally takes over Ives took it away from Trimble Mohamd Ims driving Everybody in the floor is just gassed right now We havent reached the 8minute timeout yet Yeah I believe it was two to three North Carolina players never even made it back across half court after the turnover Hubert Davis going to call the turnover to get some subs to get to call the timeout to get some subs this year You think itll be another Yannik Center Carlos Alcarez final Nobodys won a major other than those two the last two years in mens tennis Sure With all the basketball I watched Im not sure that Ive had opportunity to keep up with finish So yes whatever you said If if its s Alcarez again you got to tune in Roland Garos last year one of the great tennis finals ever You said I didnt know this during you were a huge Arthur Ash fan from Richmond Virginia Yeah Arthur Ash from Richmond Virginia Mike Camp started at the Arthur Ash Center and a man who meant so much to so many different people So hes my number one tennis player of all time One of the great players of his generation one of the great humanitarians Obviously you hear about Arthur Ash courage award at the SBS every year Logan IMS with a miss Its all Carolina here 7853 Tar Hills have never trailed 25 off their largest lead Missed three by Evans and a foul will keep it right here Whats impressed you most about North Carolinas game tonight the fact that Notre Dame who was six of 12 in the first half from three are now six of 20 from three They have not made a threepoint field goal in the second half Huber Daviss message to the Tar Hills at halftime was received and executed and thats the important part especially when youre dealing with the this is still a young team when you consider the fact that you know Derek Dixon Caleb Wilson are freshman Henry Bessar is a junior but he didnt play a lot last year Jiren Stevenson got minutes at Alabama but hes really in a different role this year than hes been in his entire career So this isnt a a very experienced team but the way that theyre putting their execution into play here in the second half shows that theyre learning How gorgeous is that from Wilson who looks over here and laughs making it look easy Hes eight for 10 But when youre that good often times and Ive been told I dont know this personally but but Ive been often times you really have to smile and think about the things that you just did on the floor Like I cant believe I just did that 22 for Wilson Theres a three for Notre Dame The first three of the second half Sir Mohamd It comes after 15 minutes and change Wilson again bounces it for Bogavots Wilson will pick up his fifth assist Luga Bogavots with seven off the bench But Wilson with only six rebounds and I say only for a man that averages over 10 rebounds a game Now picks up his seventh Needs to get on the ball Im sure Hubert Davis isnt going to leave him in here much longer on a tie up there as Kavirus went in Possession arrow to Notre Dame Wilson once again catching the basketball on the block but showing off his passing ability dropping it off for Bogabots who goes to the reverse for two 227 and five with a block and a steal Now you had the game against Florida State where he led UNCC outright in points rebounds assists and blocks He was the third Tarheel ever to do that in a single game first since Jerry Stackhouse in 1995 against Murray State Yeah NCAA tournament game where Stack did that And when you start putting yourself in the category that Caleb Wilson has I mean he has a chance as he is able not able to knock down the three ball Phil Ford is Mr Freshman in the ACC Okay But when this all said and done Caleb Wilson has a chance to have better numbers than any freshman in the history of the ACC He is knocking on the door of not only breaking Tyler Hanssboros freshman scoring record but also Antoine Jamesons freshman rebound record Those guys went on to play four three years respectively Of course Bill Ford played four Unfortunately I believe were only going to see Caleb for one Music There you have it Most rebounds by a Carolina freshman Some of the great Tarheelss ever on that list Young misses a three Now that thatll be the only comparison point we have Youre right Caleb Wilson will be a very high pick in the NBA but a lot of work left to do at Chapel Hill Once again this game has just run ragged and Mlen puts it in Once again we are blowing past a media timeout with some free flowing and occasionally wild basketball Havent been a stoppage in several minutes Bogots off his miss Theres the stoppage at 234 Thatll be the last we see of Caleb Wilson tonight Carol Applause Williams who in the middle of this ongoing debate whether or not to relocate the home of North Carolina basketball We just got the announcement today Um Lee Roberts here at North Carolina Chancellor University told the board of trustees that the leadership here is moving forward with plans to develop the Carolina North Campus which would expand the universitys footprint across Chapel Hill They want to break ground on this expansion next year Its the site of the former Horus Williams airport as Satan High is there to follow this from Isaiah Dennis University thinks that land can add some housing to match the stage court population a future engineering school and possibly the future home of the basketball program which as we mentioned is celebrating its 40th anniversary here in the dean dome Sir Muhammad with a bucket for Notre Dame Roy Williams a couple of days ago posted online a video this building keeping Carolina here He said that hes given his opinion very strongly Hes very much in favor of staying here Coach Smith wanted this place on campus That was his wish There was no question So be a fascinating year here as folks whether or weigh whether or not to renovate this building which some university officials say could be 80 to 100 million just for what they call essentially a basic facelift or maybe to move the future home of the basketball program I know I get zero vote in this but Im with you You renovate this place And I can tell you Im not sure if youve ever been to the Hall of Fame attached to this building but it is unbelievable when you get an opportunity to see all of the history not just with this building but with this great program but I can understand the need for the renovation and I can understand the desire to relocate and build a brand new shiny building Theres a need for of course skyboxes in this building Theres a you know and a renovation would also force you to play elsewhere for an extended period of time at least for one season But I would love to see the Dean Dome remain right here on campus I think its one of the things that makes this such a special place Heres a three for High No good He was attempting to become the ninth Carolina player with a three which would have been a program record So in whats going to be win number 501 here at the Dean Dome Carolina has hit 13 threes Ryder Frost with a put back for Notre Dame as both teams have gone deep into the bench for the walk out You just saw the miss from Brady Stevens son of Brad freshman off the bench for Notre Dame Brad in the building today twofold to make sure that he comes to check in on his former assistant coach Michael Shberry and his son also to lay eyes on Caleb Wilson Henry Vessar Two guys who in my opinion will be in the league next year as Frost does not allow the fans here at Chapel Hill to have crumble cookies Ill say this though if Brad Stevens is seriously scouting Caleb Wilson that means Brad is getting a new job somewhere Oh no I dont think this sound like somebody in the Caleb Wilson ever believe that when you talk about all the trades and everything thats happening and were not even a trade deadline yet You never know Never too early to scout Its never too early to scout Smith on the follow for North Carolina There is Brad Stevens The Celtics have played pretty well without Jason Tatum this year Applause Right Music Applause Music Applause Ryder Frost basket Music Applause Final score tonight 69 Applause
