on tonight Its the most important game in Louisville history Tells you the passion and commitment cheering that this guy coaches with and youre watching it right here right now on ACC Network Mel Brown Jr has the tip off the win from Sandanda Froom And here come the Louisville Cardinals They all they do is take threes Theres a good example of it Ryan Conwell starts the night Great execution of the fade screen Do a lot of that here in the Louisville offense And theyre just a difficult team to prepare for because Pat Kelsey scripts so many things He changes He comes out with so many first plays and every out of bounds side out of bounds puts so much pressure on your team defensively And when theyre knocking down threes theyre as good as anyone because they have elite shooting David Golden leading scoreer out to Ari Fulton And JIT takes a ton of threes themselves at three and four after a loss on Monday night in Cincinnati Balden the freshman 13 points a game top 10 scorer in America East Jeremy Clayville is a bigtime threepoint scorer They figure if theyre going to hang around tonight theyre going to make a lot of them against Mike Brown and Ryan Conwell one of the best back courts if not the best in the country Isaac McNeely up to Sand And that is Louisville basketball to a te Thats what they want Threes and layups They start out the game with a fade screen corner three Great back screen there and a lob by the freshman to Sernando Fu Wont find an easier basket than that tonight German big man didnt play a lot Took the hard fall on Monday So Ali Khalifa the backup big came in Had a big night Clayville inside Tough catch Thats a full block He ate up Malachi Arrington Isaac McNeely career 40 plus percent threepoint shooter Same for Ryan Conwell The transfer deep one Fruit in there He is the tallest man of the world tonight but he threw it away off of Ron Groover Courtney Green and Jeff Pond The other two officials in this one See the back screen here by McNeel as a guard you dont want to help because you know hes an elite shooter but when youre that size you just cant get up and elevate and do anything with the lob anyway So its a difficult ask of this back court for the Highlanders Miss from Ari Fulton came right to him but his backside was on the end line Fulton is NJITs at least on paper best player high major offers Injury kind of curtailed his recruitment but hes been big time for them He has physically his body translates as well and he can compete athletically at this level and theyre going to lean on him heavily tonight Kind of settled this group down This is a really young group Freshman and sophomores stopped only by the front of the rim Jordan Rogers Hes played the five at points for a pretty small NJIT team as Conwell knocked it away Active hands for Louisville defense F looked like me trying to dump that laughter to start the game I would say its the sprite conversion I think that is when he hits the dunk Yeah No hes uh you like to see that effort out of him though I mean he he is really good in the ball screens Theyre kind of different with him and Khalifa Fu attacks the paint puts pressure on you at the rim Khalifa plays more on the perimeter with the dribble handoffs Boulder went inside Theres Sander Fu Its kind of night with his size and his strength of the German basketball Bundesliga You feel like he could have a big night Well he has to be physical It doesnt matter who hes playing against tonight Just play your role Be a star in your role is what Pat Kelsey demands How about inside Skip it out McNeely Thats what he does McNeely knocking down three The slump is over Five threes against Eastern Michigan Knocks down his first three here tonight But no fruit just he and we talked about the passing of Khalifa Hes showing you that and hes a really good passer as well and thats a difficult thing to guard when a big man passes the basketball with this type of weaponry around him Clayville as a guy cant give an inch Shot 38 at St Francis an NCAA tournament team last year first year at NJIT Jump it down through two around him Couldnt hit Good defense by Malachi Orington their tallest player at 611 He had to deal with Mustafa Cham on Monday night NGITs loss to Cincinnati Louisville fans know all about Cham in the 72 as Fulton misses badly Wont deter NGIT from taking threes And heres Mel Brown Jr who threw it to nobody Javon Hadley wasnt expecting it to be him No he was you saw McNeely out of his corner in his eye throw Thats where the ball was going And hes a point guard You hate those turnovers throwing it right towards you and you think its someone else and and for Mike Brown who is struggling with his assist to turnover ratio thats not a bad idea for his Ari Fulton announcement had 10 points on Monday went for 22 and 14 in the game earlier this year now its Woolly kick it out Conwell feet set thats what happens and that play started with the crosscourt offense he talked with us about advancing the basketball putting so much pressure on you before you can set your defense Ball gets in the paint You dont rotate back to the shooters Ryan Conwell who leads all ACC shooters in threepoint takes and makes and he just forced the turnover As we highlighted in the open you have got coming out defending really well What is so dangerous about that pass You saw the passion he talked about when we dug Carolina Roy Williams and coach Smith used to do a great job of that Carolina Carolina break It just most teams are so afraid of that You dont get a chance to set your defense You got to sprint back and they put so much pressure on you that skip across pass and then they throw it up for threes is a big part of that And they looking to get double digit points out of that every game and got a three ball out of it here already Roco Awanad off the bench freshman good shooter for NJIT Theyve started one for seven from the field But they got 5 seconds to get one up Find Ari Fton Find the corner Awad Nowhere to go 1 second Get it up and got it to go Its a great shot there Woo I thought made a mistake and put his hands down and needed to keep his hands up Even there You said your FIRST WORD MCNEELY back the other way You said your first word Theyre theyre in the front court Theyre there You have to And theyre prepared Its set up so that even if you press them they already have a a press release and they can advance the basketball Youve got to get back and set your defense against Louisville and theyre coming at you fast Jordan Rogers All right Fton offensive rebound and Kobe Rogers has already got a buck and took it away Backup point guard to Ali Khalifa who had a massive night the other night and called an offball foul Rogers tried to back door cut there and didnt need to push off but he did The official saw it called it Got to guard that Now the difference is Fern Fernando Frus in the game Hes more about lobs and everything else And you can see here he pulls his shoulder and back door cuts Great job officiating there calling that Quinton Duncan missed Louisville on the run Cany Roots first touch of the night Hell take a three hit one the other night Rogers stripped it away The incessant Kobe Rogers to Isaac McNeely Sure That was right in front of us It looked good from the second and left hand And again the passing ability of their bigs put so much pressure on you and another assist here by their front line guys McNeely hit five threes the other night on Monday in this building Hes already hit three And theres Kobe Rogers off the interception Woolly in the corner Tap dancing Skip it out Khalifa behind the back McNeely Fake it Right back to Khalifa And they drag him for a foul Yeah theyre playing with pace But thats one of the guards As a guard you got to slow down and allow the big a chance to set his feet I know you dont like the call Kelsey doesnt like it laughter Are you kidding me I thought he went got away with one earlier doing the same thing Got to be got to be set foul against a Louisville press You see Kobe Rogers in that huddle saying All right relax relax Thats his role on this team but its Pat Kelseys role to be mad Well have to because your coach has that much passion you want to play hard but Kobe Rogers has been in the system Hes a veteran with him coming over from college at Charleston and hes like Hey guys just settle down and do the things that we drill and we do every day Let coach do all the passion and everything else We just play hard and settle down and once they do again a lot of these guys these transfers this is new to them Malachi Arrington 197 Louisville start in the opening seven plus minutes Back door again Woo with the finish from Khalifa Thats a timeout from Grant Bill Meyer How many timeouts do you think Ali Khalifa is over from Virginia And this is one of the early signes to Pat Kelsey and he fits this system beautifully We came on the air promising intensity and fury Louisville comes out of the press in a press up 14 and NGIT broke it very nicely Sebastian Robinson the veteran guard makes it 219 Great job breaking the press and thats what you want to do You break the press you want to punish the pressure They did a really good job of handling Louisvilles pressure so far and he scored twice Well he stepped back and he drilled it It feels like one of those nights when theyre knocking down shots like that you just tip your hat Six out of nine to start the night Were eight minutes in They have 24 points This is Louisville Arrington with the timer under 10 No dribble Needs help He threw it away Robinson saved it Opens up for him for a three McNeely and Fu grappling And Fs got McNeely Theyre back on the run Isaac McNeely He looks like he wanted this from a mile away but missed it Rebound for Sebastian Robinson only players been with Grant Bill Meyer all three years at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark Robinsons role is kind of settled this group of guys down and like I said they start five freshman and sophomore and when he comes in the game with his level of experience he needs to settle this group down good defense and Fruit Javon Hadley Adrien Woolly Mel Brown Jr hasnt taken a shot yet Looks like he wants to He did The rebound down to Arrington He lets his guys play And those are the shots that I like to see Mike Brown not take Like just 65 and his ability to pass pass the basketball put pressure on the rim Fine guys you can get that shot whenever he wants McN got his man in the air up top Hadley out to Brown Feet set this time Steps in floater and just couldnt find that one that time Decided to take it inside Yeah no one stopped him there I think hes just getting in the paint Great things are going to happen with his vision You take the one level onelegged pull up there and airballs it and its one of those shots Pat Kelsey says percentage wise its the worst shot in basketball and hell talk to his freshman point guard about that All Louisville so far 249 at Guju coming into tonight Yeah to the side we talked about its why Pat Kelsey said its the most important game in Louisville history He knows the history and the result of that ball game Hes like were not having any slip ups here tonight I want you guys focus and doubt it It has happened before Its a nutty box score Caris Levert scored 32 for Michigan that night That sounds about right Yeah that sounds about right Just a bucket getter himself Dont show up ready to play in college basketball You will and can lose Hadley missed it Louisville has shown up ready so far 53 from the field 6 for 11 from three One for seven start from three for NJIT Theyve been late shot clock a lot Rogers in and out No Rebound down to Ryan Conwell Hes got a couple of threes by Kell Brown Jr Thats his first bucket of the night They got the ball to the court so fast it seemed like the shot clock hadnt had a chance to reset and it was already in the basket Tough night to be the shot clock operator Youve got to engage the basketball a lot faster when you guard and youre playing Louisville You know when the basketballs coming up youve got to engage the basketball Your bigs everyone has to run back Corral the driver put so much pressure on you Folks Saturday morning at 1000 am Eastern ACC Huddle crews live from Charlottesville Virginia Tech and number 18 Virginia for music the Commonwealth Cup Get you ready for another full day of football 2hour pregame show with game previews expert analysis and featured stories right here on ACC and in the allne ESPN app Big football game round THESE FARTS COMING UP DOWN LOW VELIS ZUGRIS Subs with the finish But how about that pass by Mike Brown and thats what thats a vision he has and hes averaging 18 points a game But I think its his vision and his ability to pass the basketball that makes him so special Rogers just missed from that spot He knocks it down to put NJIT in double digits And Cwells in 3 seconds into the shot clock And 5 seconds into the shot clock hes got two free throws I mean look at the vision here in the pass No look bounce pass there Zoug just catches it and finishes And saw him and his family last night We were at dinner Walking past and hes a guy thats earning minutes with this group Hes coming in Hes playing hard Hes embracing his role And usually within a group of guys hes like the third big off the off the bench See dad there No technical fouls tonight So hes sitting away from mom Hes laughter I think mom got on him a little bit about the technical foul If you saw Mr Zukris walking down the laughter street you would know hes Mikes dad whether somebody told you or not His brother could be his twin You know hes younger but he looks just like him From the suburbs of Athens Perry Sterry in Greece Clayville loves to take threes this time distributes Rogers He faked it and then two men converged Mel Brown Jrs got it First time in a few possessions Weve seen 20 on the timer See how long that lasts Brown behind the back Little Conwell in his bag Rare moment The two point guards are on the floor Rogers as he kicks to the corner One more Conwell He drives in Conwell couldnt control it all the way home Fight for it Thats off Hadley Good offensive possession there by Lo Did he get the basket when the basketball Florida State Wednesday LSU and BC and Mississippi State and Georgia Tech all games right here on ACCN as well as the ESPN app comes out with a little running jump Highland is handled the pressure well Step back Clayville couldnt get the bounce Ryan Cwells got the rebound Mike Brown in the back court Conwell sharp I mean its just happening from all parts of the court right now for Louisville Thats the biggest dilemma I think when you face Louisville And you know when you watch film that you can hurt them on the offensive glass but if you do not get that rebound they are coming at you 100 miles an hour and you dont have time to find your matchup You have to find a body engage the basketball and pick it up at the threepoint line Its going to be a long night Five to shoot Clayville inside Had it tugged away Kicks it to the wing Quick three Not even close from Quinton Duncan Theyre now two for their last 11 from three Louisvilles hit eight threes Theyve hit nine a season high in the first half This is just Louisville playing at a very high level Were showing you what theyre capable of I dont think this will be the last time that they do it here Look how quickly they get the basketball up They advance it throw it up No one engages the basketball Too late Three ball 23 seconds on the shot clock and its youre getting it out the net And again that pass that we saw in the middle that Brown to Conwell thats the pass youve been talking about because it it moves the defense Youre youre loading up on one side of the floor They like to skip it across and it it it moves the defense but a lot of times youre transitioning back and teams are coached to protect the paint but you cant do that against Louisville You have to run and and build your defense starting at half court and the threepoint line And if you dont do that its just a long night And Paty was talking to us like if they hit that pass like if you let them have it and youre not ready for it youre done The possessions over They know it And he knows that You saw how excited he was when I brought up like I said the Carolina sideline break Thats just a big part of their offense and hes learned Hes been around a lot of great coaches in his time and a lot of impact from those guys and hes developed into one of the best coaches we have in college basketball Two offensive rebounds on the possession for Zugris Crowd goes Zoo Brown takes a three And finally NJIT has it David Golden the sixfoot freshman jump for that Balden inside their leading scoreer Not close It was tapped up by Arrington and Woolly claims it and he was just hammered from behind by Balden playing hard I thought Balden was trying to throw the lob there I thought he was throwing a lob and it was just Arlington tried to tip it in and and thats what you cant do You cant foul And when that goes up as a guard you got to get back Hes frustrated I mean theres some pride there Hes down 25 Hes a freshman Hes not accepting losing And thats what you want to see You dont mind that foul Its not the best foul you want but if you didnt do it youre probably going down to transition with numbers on the other end Wally hes got eight points He wanted to hit the step back but finds McNeely Thats always a good option Off to Khalifa Back door McNeely jumping out Cany Roots faked it takes it in Cany Roots on the spin Lovely for Cany Roots Big time play there Just unselfish basketball Khalifa comes back door cut by McNeely Youre trying to run him off the line He does a great job cutting Rotation help comes Passes it to Roose and he does great drive and finish Doesnt settle there Great pivot Great footwork Nice lefty lay Pat Kelsey loves him He just epitomizes just see stay stay true to the process Third forward in the depth chart starting last year Injuries to Canai to Case Bryson and next thing you know hes up to playing 25 minutes a game late last year and hes made himself a reliable player for Pat Kelsey in that really deep front line Arrington jumper way up there on the arc Kobe Rogers in transition Theyre in the front court in three seconds Rogers in the paint in six seconds Khalifa thought rebound McNeely Rogers offensive rebound One of the smallest men on the floor Khalifa fakes it across No look at Roots Corner three Khalifa in there Thatll stay with Louisville Eight different Cardinals have scored Watch This is the game within the game that you and I talked about Pat Kelsey on baseline out of bounds They script So you cant worry about what youve seen on film This will be a play that hes drawing us specifically for this game And he challenges his guys mentally Watch the dribble Hand off three Pin down Woolly fire back to Roots Now just play some offense Shot clock down under 15 Rarely is Khalifa back door Woolly faked it Scored it Adrien Woolly hes got double figures already 10 with 425 to go in the first half Well he told us the other day that there was the days over the summer and in the fall that he was the best player in the gym And he just said hes starting to come around Hes starting to figure it out Hes an 18 point per game scorer a year ago He thought maybe to jump up at this level bothered him some early and now hes he sees it in practice Its starting to settle down and hes another 40 shooter from three probably the guy Adrien Woolly you tell me if you agree that were not talking about enough long term for Louisville Hes a guy he just adds to his depth He should be starting for someone else at a high major level but hes coming off the bench with this group and just shows you the depth quality of depth that this program has right now Rogers now to David Balden Hasnt been able to shake free of Kobe Rogers THE VETERAN DEFENDER WOW Kobe Rogers He knew what Balden was doing before Balden did and sets up Wally whos got two shots coming 12 nothing run percent of their shots from three coming in Its top 10 in the country and its you know regardless of percentage tonights one of those nights where its astronomical But regardless of that thats the way Pat Kelsey wants to live in this program Well its the way its going to be And again and it does not affect their intensity on the defensive end of the floor that thats part of their offensive identity But again as we highlighted to start the game its the defensive end of the floor which ignites a lot of those shots and their ability to rebound on both ends of the floor offensively and defensively and and the pressure they apply on you And everybodys dialed in Everybodys taking shots This is a really connected group Look at the ball pressure here And you see them extending their pressure 10 seconds already and they hadnt gotten inside the threepoint line yet And you settle for that shot Bowden knocked it down First make of the night for the NJIT leading scoreer and their first basket in nearly six minutes And hes a flatout score I mean he can he got some wiggle to him and can get his shot off against anybody Thats a difficult shot Found him at an offsite AAOU tournament They were glad it was offsite Hadley joins the party 10th Louisville three Hadley doesnt take a lot of threes but hes shooting over 40 this year on his fifth three on the season and hes going to take open looks like that Hes going to continue to shoot at a high percentage On the other end three of 13 from three for NJIT Sander Fugak of the game is their big man Javon Hadley just hit a three for his first bucket of the night Lob it Isaac McNeely Quick trigger McNeely now three for six from three after he hit five on Monday night on this floor Rogers inside knocked away from behind Kobe Rogers just stirring the drink Hes embracing that role as a perimeter defender Woolly Kick it to the corner Shovel it Hadley Nice spin Hadley They got fouled on his way through Two shots for Javon Hadley Thats his first Yeah we said 52 of their shots come from three All of the other shots except for two midrangers and we saw one of them the other couldnt believe it laughter are at the rim and theyre so unbelievably efficient from both those spots Yes I mean even we saw the last game and they were struggled from behind the threepoint line in the first half and then the second half they completely flipped it and so uh shot over 60 the second half of that game against Eastern Michigan And when theyre shooting the basketball youre going to get halves like this and we saw it at moments even against Kentucky Um this team is extremely explosive on this end of the floor and Pat Kelsey gives everyone the freedom Theyre just unselfish Every night its going to be someone elses night They dont they dont rely on one guy to have to carry him And I think thats what makes it so scary Twothirds of Louisvilles baskets are assisted baskets Top 20 of the country They average 20 assists a night And it feels like the way that they play it lends itself to more assists Well everybody knows if you do your job youll get the basketball And whether its screening whether its slipping you got a bunch of guys So you look at talking about like the bigs Khalifa Fu These guys are passing the basketball as well and they average 12 threes a game Im going to bet theyre going to exceed that Im just just a hunch Ill take my money wherever youre going with it laughter I mean they have nine different scores in this game Six different guys have assist Rogers left alone and he drops it in Oh they giving Pson something to be upset about right there No communication on the switch Leave a wide open layup Roots the other way He had a block from behind That was Malachi Orington whos been battling with him down low Final minute and a half of a first half Rogers way of a tough shot and he knocked it down Jordan Rogers ready for the moment Known as a defender Hes really aggressive on the offensive end Hes only shooting 21 from three Fro nice catch Beautiful hands 49 for Louisville in the first half Thats the difference in the two Fruit is pressure in the paint on the rim Khalifa is more at the threepoint line and Zubris is like a mixture of the two Look at Conwell here stalking Robinson Mano Mano gets it away to Ari Fulton Got a switch Conwell and Fulton Five to shoot And Rogers was on the sideline A lot of standing around right now The basketballs moving around the perimeter Someone has to have the ability to put pressure on the rim and attack the paint And someone else really besides Bowden has to do that Little hole for the last shot Probably be some type of isolation play for Mike Brown and look for him to drive it and spray it over here to the corner to Conwell or Hatton 6 seconds Got it to Conwell Jumped it back Another three Fitting to finish off the night A 50 burger in the first half for Louisville Theyll take a 32point lead to the break Played fun with clocks for a second but lets do it Second half Louisville at NJIT Right before Thanksgiving from Kentucky NJIT shot 28 from the field They were four of 14 from three This guy Jordan Rogers knocked down a couple He is for a guy thats known as a more of a defender He Hes knocked down a couple threes and more of a driver on the offensive end but hes not going to come shot behind the threepoint line I think NJIT has to do a better job of even that possession So much of it happening outside the threepoint line get downhill drive the basketball play with the level of physicality on the offensive end This is a talented group we know but I think theyre settling too much And Lobo is so aggressive on the defensive end of the floor Theyre playing too extended Attack get downhill have some fun You got nothing to lose Why is it so You just said aggression but why is it so hard to drive on Louisville Well one they play pack defense So theyre already in gap So the the main defender on the basketball his job is to apply pressure Rogers fought his way in there Kick it out Arrington found a better threepoint shooter But then immediately Muel Brown was ready for it Step back Golden and they want you to take those shots because the ring gaps So what you have to do is drive the pass through Wow Hello Its a great job there Again quick shots turnovers Theyre out three or four seconds down the floor And again its not just the guards Cruz a beneficiary of that as the big man And we talked about Fu as you know hes positional defender a little bit There are some labels that you know maybe you know some implications to that as Baldin misses it F ripped down the rebound towards Brown Theres some some lowkey pretty good athleticism in there too Its on to F I mean the talents there Conwell Rare wide open miss for him Thats F on another rebound out to Brown Feed set F almost had that one Two on two Jeremy Clayville will take these in transition Hes online but Long and Browns got the rebound for Louisville Three points One for six shooting for Brown in the first half Yeah its a good Thats a shot you want from Clay Clayville He gets that look Its open just like that one 17 for Ryan Conwell Hes got the kind of stroke that when he looks at the rim you believe its going in Every time he and McNeely shoots it it looks like its going in Rogers out of strength Spun it back out Kick to Baldin Man NJITs had a few of those tonight Then Conwell lost it And Ari Fulton strong as an act And again you know we mentioned if theres one thing that Louisville has to do is their guards have to rebound Theyre spread out on the defensive end of the floor and you can attack them on the offensive glass Fo starting right now Eight points for him Fu averaged 126 in the basketball bundis league in Germany last year Lobit Arrington down it goes with Fu on the ground 126 in the German league last year He played in Europe Can you explain you know that level of competition versus where he is now how that stacks up as Conwell drills it Yeah no one steps up on the ball screen there and he gets an open look But I I think the biggest thing is it prepared him for high level basketball It allows him to come here and compete at this level where sometimes you need time but when you play in Europe at a high level you dont need that time Youre ready because youre youve played against grown men And its been quite a bit of a discussion in college basketball about this you see the GLeague coming in guys coming in and theres been some conversation about that and Pat Kelseys front of the line benefiting in that level of recruiting and uh European guys coming over I think was a big part of that You had to let the Americans do it as well Brown missed it out of bounds Thatll go NITs way Number 14 Dirk laughter Ninsky was the MVP of that league that Sedan Fu was in at one point whos dominant at the rim and thats also where you know the analytical numbers really start to come into play He made 75 of his shots at the rim last year in that league Well he can do that here He can and hes going to have to do that here again You know thats his role with this team Great drop finish there Conwell hes hit six threes F all the way in there Jumped it back out Save possession on the refeed Brown back to Conwell One more Javon Hadley Yep Just a great possession there Offensive rebound Ball started in one corner They reversed it all the way to the other side Knocked down an open three And they dont care who gets it Everyone there caught the basketball had a shot passed it to a teammate for an even better shot 14 of 30 from three Four straight makes for NITT Balden made the last one Hes going to the line when we these guys and girls really look forward cheering to those matchups and and you want to win it for bragging rights I mean it really does matter and coaches want to win it for a ton of different reasons as well but cheering you are watching those matchups in those games and cheering for your counterparts David Balden went one for two for the New Jersey Institute of Technology Louisville up massive here in the second half as roots had it knocked away Ali Khalifa against John Kelly jumped it out possession Islanders have settled in over the last few minutes They have went down that time played zone and threw Louisville off and created a turnover You usually dont see a team go to a zone when theyve given up so many threes But you got to try something Balden Tough shot Can I Ruths man Got above everybody and got fouled by David Balden Yeah I like Bold Hes got a level of toughness to him He likes to see hes got frustrated Hes driving and I think hes disappointed hes not getting the whistle when hes initiating contact and hes going down in the paint and the land of the trees and theyre not always going to give you that They were at a tournament a smaller AU offsite tournament They were going to recruit somebody else They saw David Bolton playing They said Yeah we want this kid Kenny Roots Nice finish He hung in the air for that one Great baseline drive and cut there by Roots Finish with the left hand Got to watch that weak side player when youre defending How many teams can throw to their center to push the break Three passes later with Conwell after that he gets inside He ran through a man and thats charge Thats Baldman in there He is not shied away from contact No he is not And I dont know how many times hes going to win that battle with Conwell though and hes big physical guard But great job there Conwell dips his shoulder Youre taught that when he dips your shoulder you got to go down force the official to blow the whistle Its great defense there by Bowden Greg Bilmeer told us you know he is freshman who said Coach you after they played at Cincinnati on Monday night weve never played in front of this many people I did He said Guys Im a little bit nervous Rogers that opened up for him was a little strong Roots has a rebound with two pieces of contact Kai Ruth thats another luxury Get that guy to bring the ball up at 610 and set Khalifa in the post Always looking to pass Looks to shoot second in the paint Gets it to the corner Kobe Rogers Youve got to make him a score Youve got to leave your defender oneonone and make him a score Jump ball Cow was trying to call a timeout So thats how he has to be defended Yes you got to leave him oneonone You leave a shooter hes looking to throw it to him Theyve obviously shown hitting 14 threes tonight but oneonone you got to leave him alone And guys are still diving in the floor and theyre up nearly 40 Theyre up 38 points and theyre still diving on the floor And this is just the culture This is just what Louisville basketball is And theres no let up The guys dont continue to play hard Theyre coming out of the game And hes not clearing his benches very late Another pass You also see the difference right there between when he catches baseline corner and also when he has it out top Yes And thats the difference when we talked about with Khalifa and Fu in the game I mean Khalifa is spends more time on the perimeter with his ball handling skills and passing ability Fu is the physicality gets you at the rim the paint Lobs paint touches Khalifa opens up the paint for the guards so they can back door They can drive Robinson against Rogers Hard hedge Khalifa Spin it out Awad with three jumped to the corner Kelly baseline at the end of the timer He missed it Thats a rebound by Rogers Hes all over the ball handler Hes the first guy to the rebound and a three Nearly couldnt hit And then a foul Look whos chasing down the basketball there Kobe Rogers I mean hes not scoring as much but his impact on this game you can feel it He is as important as anyone You know forget the points I mean hes defending when he comes in He defends the best offensive guard He takes that role Pat Kelsey was challenging his guys in shoot around Hes like Nope nope Hes like Bro hes a score Hes 13 points a game Hes like Hes not getting it tonight coach The only national champion on Louisvilles roster one of the division 2 Nova Southeastern Tonight hes played 13 minutes He has eight rebounds Kobe Rogers wants an assist for Woolly Not that time Can I root the rebound Had it ripped down He got felt as he batted into the corner Looks running it from the bench to come help his teammate up Its what weve talked about Look at this They running and crashing the glass Three guys going into the offensive glass Roots gets it And the first thing youre thinking is when they get an offensive rebound youve got to run out and identify shooters Heres one But a foul and its against Khalif on the screening action 1237 to go a regulation 40point Louisville lead Theyve shot 50 from the floor Theyve shot 42 from three and theyve held NJIT to 12 for 40 from the field and almost impressing But this is just their style You cant be upset when you watch them on film This isnt running up the score This is what hes done here and this is the culture that hes created Theyre not just turning around handing off to the running back trying to run out the clock They are playing the full playbook thats in play Theyre pressing here Look at this defense up 40 and theyre competing like this Look at Pat Kelson still begging for goal talent and then the steadiness that Kobe Roger brings when he comes into the game Hes really as a as a human an amazing story Robinson airballed it and Von Hadleys got it He starts at D2 goes to Charleston Hes there with Pat Kelsey and they brought him hurt here He didnt play last year but they did it because they knew that he could do what hes doing and could do cheering it for this team that really could contend for a national championship And its a joy Yeah its fun to watch Every team needs guys like that You always have room for guys that embrace defending the best teams offensive player as he does 22 points for Ryan Cowwell Yeah he has it going Hes been really good on the defensive end as well Hes not only scoring he has five assists already and six rebounds Barco Awad Tough play found Robinson again Laid shot clock again Theyre nowhere near the basket Zugras in the grill Tough shot Robinson Hadley had it punched away and Isaac McNeely is right to the front court again fired down Hadley kicked it out Brown went by his man Spotted out Three around him Finds Conwell Zubris offensive rebound Third of the night Spattering of Zoos from the crowd McNeely jumped the pass down Got it in Kick it out Conwells got 22 Still not on 25 Kellys got the board for NJIT He missed Can you believe it He missed Whats the He should come out of the game Sub him out Hes having that type of night And then he committed to foul the threepoint shooter He said Take him out Thats on Im grateful for 71 points show that they put on over these last few days Nice crowd in here too You know 900 pm Wednesday tip You never quite know but quite a few people celebrating It is an amazing thing You and I have been here these last few days walking around this city and you feel how much what this team the Louisville is doing how much that matters to people It does Theres a lot of pride here in their program and and this historically this Louisville program means a lot and the last few years didnt represent that but its back The energys back the passions back Theyre getting better and better and this team is rolling along here and theyll get stiffer competition coming up pretty soon Brown hes not quite been all over it tonight Zuber has felt thats one for eight from the field for three points for Brown As you see the the program turn around again Its been well documented 12 and 52 Since then theyve been just completely and utterly dominant under Pat Kelsey And you get this sense talking to people like they have brought people back very quickly to as I check the clock here to believe in this program again which is the most important thing If you spend five minutes talking to Pat Kelsey its not hard to believe in anything that hes selling Youre buying it He could sell you a beach house in Utah somewhere you know and youd be youd buy it wouldnt realize time share Yeah You know so and again its a proven track record of winning Uh hes passionate about it Hes really one of the better coaches in college basketball and they do that Isaac McNeely and he loves shooters So hes always going to be involved in offensively because he recruits offensive players and then he teaches them defense and holds you accountable for what allows you to go You were talking about Brown before and I think its for him its Id like to be see him be just a little bit more decisive I think sometimes hes kind of caught in between maybe dri an extra dribble or two I just would like to see him just be assertive catch it shoot it or swinging it and pass it and not hold on to it as much music And I think that sometimes is how the longer you hold the basketball the more defense ships to you I think thats what hes dealing with right now Theres dad Christopher Brown senior always watching Got a chance to talk to dad at practice and he holds is a reason his son is this music good His dad right there a big reason for it His fingerprints are all over his sons game and his moms an athlete as well and theyve got to be proud of the jump that hes made in college basketball and he thinks hes going through a difficult time right now when hes not Its just the growth He doesnt have to force it I mean hes still 18 and six a night preeason first team all conference Everyone knows the talent and he still has a long way to go and grow and its going to be fun to watch You see this young man now come January February hell be a completely different player even better than he is now Such a hard thing to be as young as he is or any freshman in college basketball especially the way the class has been You know we we blow these guys up and its like everythings perfect right 29 against Kentucky do that You he deserves every flower he got for that Robinson misses Hadleys got the rebound But it also its not a straight line Just like life in anything youre not immediately going to get to you know the the highest point immediately but they believe in the long term And boy they should And hes incredibly talented but on a night in and night out basis at this level a different guy is the best player And thats the first time hes going through that Like hes usually probably nine out of 10 games in high school and everywhere else hes been the best player And this guy tonights been the best player for Louisville And he will be on the media nights And Zudrus has the rebound The Greek god down to Hadley Brian Conwells got 24 There are a lot of reasons why he should believe in Louisville Scoreboard will help tonight as Duncan drills one Ryan Conwells as good of a reason as any of them Oh he is I mean just a great person Sean Miller raved about how good of a person he was Hes just steady you know He doesnt ride the peaks and valleys Hes just really consistent and its why hes a voted a captain on this team Shot clock at 10 Zugris to Rogers Shot clock at five Brown dancing Mel Brown Thats the star He says Hallelujah They made one But even on that one he caught it and he wanted to dribble Id like to see him just catch it and shoot it you know and and thats the problem when youre you play in a system as a point guard and youre accustomed to dominating the ball and dribbling Theres a rhythm to that And in this system they the ball moves and you dont need to dribble as much And thats something hes got to learn and grow and evolve into Like hes you see his body hes standing straight up Hes used to having it and coming off ball screens Hes got to make the adjustment of not coming off ball screens and just playing like right now That goes up Here you go Thats how you get out of a rhythm right there man out of the slump You get you take play play like that cheering Look out folks He is a star 17th Louisville three Thats a season high Im going just say it again 17th Louisville three 7 minutes to go in the game Season high so far made threes surpassed previous 16 and a school record is 22 The question becomes do they get that Its quivering Uhoh You dont you dont believe him Yeah You dont believe him 27 finding his way in his niche with this group and he is fun to watch He plays the game the right way What to you as NJIT beats the press lob it up Thats a Malachi Orington dunk His third of the night you know that Kentucky game Hanks 29 its a big moment the whole countrys talking about it national TV on ESPN all this stuff whats been different to you about you know these couple of games that weve watched here and where he was there McNeely has a rim out it was just his game I mean his night that night like tonight its Conwell hes shooting the ball playing well and and thats what Kentucky is not going to be like everybody theyre not relying on any one person to four The basketball is just going to move which of course is if youre a Louisville fan Mc Daily 193 of the Louisville Knights with three off the school record Thats great news for Louisville fans what youre talking about It is And this is when I say domination They are plus 31 on the glass right now They have 50 rebounds 22 23 assists I mean I mean its just this is a flawless game theyre playing right now And I know the competition is is is youre going to say something about the competition as a fan but this is whats so impressive about them Theyre up 51 points And watch them play Theres no let up This is real This is who they are And this isnt just one night of hot shooting Theyll crack 100 And theyve done it three times already this year And Just watch him run offense The movement the quickness the way the ball goes into Fu right there and he draws a foul Its a purpose Its the intensity of it We are shoot around today and hes getting on these guys and they practice They dont have a relaxed just you go down there and shoot Theyre not playing horse Theyre not playing knockout Theyre getting after it And today we saw him get on Brown and tell them get out of the drill Were going full speed Get your treatment later I mean this is to the eighth ranked recruit in the country This is all buy in about this group and everyone has a role and you have to embrace your role if you want to play for Pat Kelsey Can I root slices through two shots next and there are a lot of talented teams in the country There are a lot of well coached teams in the country A lot of teams that did well in the transfer portal all these things Im not saying there there arent teams that check all of those boxes but I I do know that Louisville is one of them They absolutely have They absolutely have And you look at a team like Purdue it was a more about retention Theyve had some transfers coming in and Oscar Cliff Cliff is one of those guys the big guys doing his role But some sometimes its more about retention Sometimes its high school kids you know in Arizona I mean I think people say Purdue is Purdue and they are the clearcut number one just as it is right now I think so Louisville versus like uh I mean how about Yukon Like Louisville versus Yukon I know Yukons not quite healthy yet How do you see that I think they could very well be teams playing in Indianapolis cheering playing both teams I think Yukon is could be final 14 when they get healthy as and again they dont have Jason Prior yet as you know hes nearly a year from his ACL injury and hes getting healthier and healthier and I I just think that theyre going to be right there in the end I mean when you get to that point in the season I think when come tournament time if this team is healthy would not surprise me if theyre right there playing one of those team elite eight the chance for a spot to go to the final four Combo guy Cameron Cameron for Jay playing hard off the bench for the first time Jeffrey Akinu is in as well I mean look at the lineup on the floor right now If this was most teams this lineup of guys are on the floor Its essentially three starters and two guys that play like starters out there right now Conwell would be over there with an ice pack Yeah hes still out here building on his lead I mean this is just the standard here Its actually impressive and fun to watch Adds to his season high 28 points for Ryan Conwell And then you start to think about the places where this roster is going to get better You mentioned Prior coming back is in concussion protocol right now Hes going to play soon Adrien Woolly who was freshman of the year in the A Sun last year has not even come close to what hes going to be They believe in that Can I root is taking a step and even Mikel Brown Jr their fivestar the guy thats kind of the headline every time that they play is not yet what hes going to be in January And thats why theyre going theyre going to be so scary is youre not you theres no need here Youre not going to play 30 35 minutes a game Youre going to play in the 20s as a starter So you give it a you play hard You compete on both ends of the floor Thats whats being asked of you Move the basketball Be unselfish Kind of let the defense dictate where the shots going And right now Conwells got a lot of those What a night 32 for Ryan Conwell Theyve hit 20 threes as a team Great drive there Yeah by Bowling He is a competitor He aint worried about the score either Hes just competing Sandanda Fruit Got to guard the threepoint shooters Bruts couldnt hit it Woolly offensive rebound Two around him on the floor He got smashed down by Arrington 30 for Ryan Conwell 11 points and he gets a roll to take them within five They havent scored 100 points four times in a season since the 1989 1990 season Now theyre four away Believe it or not thats even before I even got laughter into college So none of your old jokes way Yeah Yeah See take that Cooper Im not that old Earlier you just told
