as we celebrate Valentines Day with you Hope youre spending it with loved ones And thanks for joining us on the ACC Network as the tip is controlled by the Bears of Cal Justin Pippen starts out with the basketball now finds Elos Elish Pippen taking it on the baseline cheering Day Ames off the dribble against Chase Forte Fade away and he gets the roll Pretty good defense by the Eagles but Ames converts Well we talked Ames we just talked about him Hes a guy who can put points on the board and even against a very good defensive team like Boston College hes capable of putting up a lot Forte and Pippen the rebound You see what launched the three Dan but the question is they have to take the smart shot and BC doesnt want to get in an up and down kind of game for Pippid NBA three Elix tries to keep it alive but falls at the Ports hands Now even though even though even though they dont want to get in the up and down game I think they have to take advantage of transition opportunities when they have them Big absence for BC Donald Hen not playing with a knee injury Well get into that in a moment as Luca Taves missed the shot and a turnover Fred Payne takes it away So both teams have been erratic on the offensive end Now something to address today as well as Cal played a double overtime game the other night I know theyve had a day or two of rest but will that maybe factor into things Well these are kids I dont It shouldnt You would hope not right Taves deep on the baseline Payne in the post for Hastings cheering Hastings dealing with foul issues all year Pretty good look but he missed the shot Tracks down the rebound And neither one of these teams are great offensive rebounding teams so any ex extra opportunities you can get would be very helpful You see minus 12 two rebounds per game against the opposition as Kapki gets tied up Thats our first foul of the game called by Jerry Heer on Justin Pippen And our absence is Donald Hand his first missed game averaging 14 points Elite Dor missed the last five for Cal What does that mean for them Both of the guys are key guys Uh and so whenever you lose one of your key guys youve got to make some adjustments and itll be interesting to see what BCs able to do today Forte too strong with the three Here comes Pippa with some numbers Ames with the layin Hes got the first four of the game for the Bears And I think thats where Ames is at his best getting out in transition and particularly playing in the midrange Impressive numbers as you highlighted in the open aim the dribble drive Capy and a foul applause and Cal is a team that can put some points on the board and of course took them overtime but they got to 100 Got close to 100 against Syracuse But you know when they get out and go BCs got to get back and a lot of that is shot selection BCs got to take good shots so theyre in good rebounding position and good position for defensive balance as Capki gives BC its first point of the game The foul was on Ames Just saw moments ago his statistics You saw him at Virginia last year Kansas State before that You surprised that hes emerged as an offensive threat Well it it depends on your role and this is a guy at Virginia they were playing a slower pace game and at Kansas State he really didnt get a lot of great opportunities but here hes got an opportunity and a system that seems perfect for him Elich in the post and he takes it strong He goes Hastings Now we just showed you that Lee Dort the guy Elich is replacing in the lineup has been out for eight games So Elich has had a chance to get in and get comfortable with his role Kapy with a poor pass stolen by Elich Eagles pretty good with the ball throughout the year 10 for game What a block by Bowden Kapi hitting Pippen Heres a three in transition and Payne misses But the put back by Hastings and Ive got no problem with that shot by Payne Its you know working against the Cal defense youre probably not going to get a better one And particularly since Hastings does such a great job getting down the court So another giveaway And here comes BC at midcourt having trouble as Caves tracks it But its going to be over and back against the Eagles in a turnover Both teams swapping a number of turnovers Well and theyre odd turnovers too Theyre like throwing the ball to nobody This is really a nice job by Capki to get back because Pippen he finishes that in most cases Yes he does Pippen second leading scoreer for the Bears making his 24th start Ames for the foul line and he gets pushed by Fort and thats where Ames is the most dangerous Hes driving the ball drives the defender back and the ability to pull up in the midrange and he gets to the free throw line a lot which is a good thing cuz hes an outstanding free throw shooter That behind the back dribble drives the defender away and then Forte just jumps right into the shooter Forts a good defender All Summit League defensive player of the year last years Ames offensive numbers continue to pile up Cals good from the foul line at 78 Contrast that Dan with BC only 66 And Ames is shoots over 90 in conference play Taves had a big night in the BC loss on Wednesday when they fell to Stanford Daves at 13 Fred Payne the Eagles leading scoreer No And out of bounds as the Eagles struggle only one for eight from the field Its a ragged start on both sides Were music back with more after this on ACC Network in the loss to Syracuse Payne double team Another turnover taken away by Ames TT Carr gets the roll in transition The Bears are difficult to defend BC turnovers are are hindrance Thats a tough shot I thought maybe he should have given that up It was He got the nice roll on the glass Third turnover for the Eagles Caleb Steer a freshman guard in their lineup wearing number 30 Payne cant get the hometown rolls and out of bounds BC ball We mentioned the turnovers and BC struggling to shoot the ball and so they certainly cant turn it over I thought Carr had a chance to pass that ball Maybe not but it doesnt matter because he went in and he made the shot and Camden would have been in great position for a rebound Car 61 freshman from Mil Valley California shooting 39 high pass on the entry as Steer hits the deck This is also a hockey arena UC hockey team will be here tonight playing Merry Mack three Boy they just theyre what one for 10 now Yep But despite that theyre only down by six points And in this case theyre able to set their half court defense And the Eagles play half court defense very well John Camdens one of the best threepoint shooters in the ACC And he nails it You got to be able to run him off the threepoint line You cannot allow him to just catch and shoot because as he just showed you he doesnt need much time or room out there A double swing pass to Payne Capki to Chase Forte High dribble out of control and good defense Cal starting to swarm the ball Mark Matsons unit adjusting Cal did play good defense on that on that particular series But Payne had a wide open look at a three And I know hes missed a couple but if Boston College is going to have success today Fred Payne cant get hesitant about his when he shoots the ball especially without their second leading scorer Donald Hand And theres Aiden Shaw You just saw the Missouri transfer Shaws given them some good minutes off the bench He also has made 14 starts TT Carr Camden the welltraveled John Camden Delaware last year Three in the corner Air ball That was hoisted by TJ Campbell BCs defense pretty stingy throughout De Well theres no question you can see there particularly down at the bottom that not one single ACC opponent has reached their season average for points a game against BC And Urgants guys have done a great job Their defense has kept them in the game but their offense just hasnt been enough to push them over the top in these close affairs that have been typical for Boston College Five to shoot for Ames Nice through the defense Boy hes tenacious I think if Im Boston College I get out and I try to pressure the three on Ames but I dont pressure it so hard that I give him a chance to drive by because thats what he wants to do So aggressive Hes got eight points to lead all scorers Taves and he hits the deck at Evan Burrow One of the officials calls the foul this time on DJ Campbell Its Evan Burrow Jeff Bond and Jerry He officiating crew Now you see there Boston College has two guys run at Dayday Ames and he just fakes and goes right by him And thats what Ames wants to do You got to keep your feet out there Force him to shoot a three over top of you Caleb Stagger Taves and pain in the BC back BC on a threeminut scoring drill but thats ended by Luca Taves TAZ has gotten better Dan offensively Hes gotten a little more confident offensively Yeah they felt like he would be a excellent performer when they brought him in Hes on the Japan national team A three from Ames is off the back iron cheering Eagles shooting just 18 Tay trying to shake Carr Shaw Boy he lost the dribble Looked out Three by Steer That was a rough possession but they keep it alive Payne punched away Kapy tracks it Eagles just look a little bit uneven Little too much standing around watching other guys dribble but Kafki converts That was a good pass by Luca Taves Kapi is a guy we talked about before the game Thats again its not really a strong inside defense for Cal He only averaged three points last year but hes up to 10 for BC when he he was at Butler last year Hes shooting 47 Also averaging six rebounds Bar too strong and Kafky engulfs the rebound Payne couldnt get by Elich but a foul is called Thats on Cal We will take a timeout So Fred P and BC shooting just music 23 They trail the Bears by seven music last year But BC hanging around with Cal Cal has led the entire way with his sevenpoint advantage Eagles with the basketball after the foul before the break was on Elich Rodanovich is in the game for the Eagles Marco Rodanovich wearing number 88 in gold He didnt play the other night in their loss to Stanford Good ball movement Kappy though air balls it BC keeps it alive Taves the deep three and he nails it And now Taves can do that You give him that much time I dont care how far away from the basket he is he can make that shot Hes 44 from three Well you talked about his improvement Thats where hes improved is taking the ball to the basket cheering DJ Campbell left open Mcdanovich the rebound cheering See BCs got to get the ball movement They need better ball movement and player movement Its too easy to guard one guy dribbling while everybody else stands around And a steal by Pippen denying the ball One man fast break He lays it in That was much better job by Pippen that time The last time he had a fast break opportunity he went oneon four missed the shot and it was a buzzer shot but horn sounded and he got taken out of the game cheering Transfer from Michigan Caleb Steager the freshman Jerry Heer calls an offensive foul Thats on Aiden Shaw Kavky that that was a bad pass I dont know why hes trying to throw it that low And Pippen absorbs some contact but nonetheless scores Pippens got a size advantage Its oneonone Wow throwing the ball to the other guys too much today Yes it is one thing the PCs done well this year along with their defense minimizing turnovers Theyve only won nine games Boy and Pippen missed the wide open John Camden for a threepoint shot Thats usually money Interesting shot selection there by Tippen but they get it back around the arc Bell Dorsy on the weak side Another transfer for Cal Hes fouled Pippen was looking for a foul And I thats always an iffy proposition but once they got the ball back great ball movement And I I think you take a wideopen three by Chris Bell just about every time down and Dorsey bails him out with a rebound Well Bell had four threes in eight attempts at Syracuse on Wednesday Former Syracuse forward played 75 games for them Heres Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header Number 20 Clemson in Winston Salem squaring up against Wake Forest to start us off at 7 Eastern Then 15th grade Virginia takes on Georgia Tech in Atlanta Like everything else both are also available on the ESPN app You know Boston College has turned the ball over and has struggled shooting it but yet theyre still in the game Theyre only down eight Deep three and its good Asamotto nails it Jason Oamoto the Baylor transfer who was from Lin Mass just down the road from Chestnut Hill Well he doesnt shoot a lot of threes but he is a low volume high percentage threepoint guy Its his 113 and 27 attempts But theres another one for Cal So they match it as Justin Pippen hits it That wasnt an easy shot by Pippen No sir Taves skips a pass Shaw powering with a big Thats a really good play by Shaw to catch the ball moving to the basket not waiting until the ball comes to him And because he was moving to the basket he was able to use that momentum to get a nice shot Look at those rebound numbers too Dan 64 rebounds for Shaw Hes been a good addition for Earl Grant But Pippen starting to feel it Justin Pippen heating up with their last five points Well particularly with Ames on the bench Pippen is going to be the primary perimeter guy cheering powering it Its Hastings and he draws contact applause Pippen Thats his second foul And this is why you cant have Pippen on the bench cuz he can make plays like this Drives Hastings off Hastings much bigger than Pippen but hes still able to get it up and go And heres what Im talking about Oamoto excuse me Shaw catches the ball headed to the basket and as a result the defense cant get him stopped Thats really a good play as length is also a disruptor too Hes not an easy guy to defend as Hastings converts after the foul on Pip and Pippen to the bench now Day Ames started hot with eight points TT Carr back in for the Bears Payne also back in the Eagles lineup And Camden gets the BC miss Here comes the Bears Bell double Look out Dave Bonner I think you were the intended receiver Well then that was a terrible mistake on the part of Cal But Mark Madson cannot be happy with his teams very sloppy ball handling They I mean if theyve handled if they handled the ball just halfway decently theyve got a big lead in this game Certainly an erratic start Thats an erratic move by Jaden Hastings Out of control Bell cut off on the baseline by Asamod The three by coaches is another one of those guys you know he can shoot the three He doesnt shoot a lot of them but if you give him a lot of time then he is able to convert it Thats a really nice play Coaches wide open Great arc on the shot Tades BC is struggling Another scoreless drought for them which has been an issue throughout the year Theres Cal has hit their last three shots Late in the shot clock Bad pass by Taz trying to find Kapky and another turnover Thats the sixth for the Eagles So Cal has built a 10point lead And how about this basket there Now Pippen is a guy who can do this Thats really a good step back Look 10point lead Free flowing kind of style that guys like to play Great pass by Ames to Bell Slip through cheering Californias largest lead Thats what Im talking about You spread the court good movement off the ball and thats good things happen And Jeff Pond calls a foul against the Bears BC needs to figure out something on offense day to get back in it How do they do it Well one of the things is attacking inside and that I mean Elich thats just a really bad play You dont want to foul Hastings that far from the basket going away from the basket And thats two fouls now So coaches music comes in the game and So Pippens out with two fouls Elix is out with two fouls So Golden Bears two of their starters on the bench with fouls Asamot nifty dribbling and he hits it But thats something thats created after the ball changes sides of the court forces the defense to react and gives Asamoto the chance He has five off of BCs bench Camden for coaching smothered in the post by Capki Here comes Fred Payne from the elbow Hes got it What youre looking for Payne is really good in transition and you dont want to get in a run up and down game with Cal but you have to take advantage of easy opportunities when they present themselves Day AS Camden and Bell around the arc Bell deep three Yes sir What a shot But you just you have to make him put the ball on the floor And again good ball movement by Cal Good player movement Homecoming for Bell coming from Syracuse Hes from Conquer California East Bay native Capki in the post for Hastings Hes been quiet Tries to back in and too strong Struggles with his touch close to the rim D Thats your big guy has to make that one That was a good entry pass And to get one that close even if youre defended you have to make that TT car mismatch there against Hastings Bell open three Hes not going to miss any of those Uhoh Once he gets rolling hes capable of lighting it up So Hastings misses a really point blank range shot down on one end and Bell knocks down a three on the other Eagles shooting 36 after starting the game two for 11 Cal 59 Good ball movement Pay cheering and a foul Now you mentioned ball movement and Cal has shown you some pretty good ball ball movement right there Now coaching simply drops the ball and Bell goes to and finds an open area and nobody finds him And when Bell gets the opportunity to shoot threes like that hes not going to miss many Eagles last possession You like what you see here Thats a really good really good pass They move the ball Now Payne passes up the open three and drives the ball inside and picks up the foul Again Payne missed a couple early and youd like him to remain confident in his shot but hes also a guy who can get to get to the line Nice look by our crew as well Overhead camera at Connie Form as Payne converts applause Heres next weeks womens basketball double header here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app number 21 Tarheelss and Virginia Tech Tangle at 6 Eastern and Miami host Stanford in Coral Gables applause And you ask one of the ways that BC can get back in the game You attack the basket you get to the free throw line and you convert Now of course BC struggles sometimes to convert from the free throw line but not Fred Pay Camden will take that shot nine times out of 10 DC scoops up the loose ball Oh here comes Payne again Payne has been a revelation since transferring Rambling Louisiana native one of the most improved players in the ACC Forte to Hastings bustling it again cheering More contact Yians in the game 23 in blue for Cal This is his first action of the year of the year That tells you that He actually did a really nice job there knocking that ball away without fouling I can tell Cal struggled a little bit with their inside game cheering Theres a foul on Caleb Steager but another turnover for BC Yep Eagles theyre mounting seven turnovers And BC normally a team takes pretty good care of the ball BC has lost five straight games Ames to Yian and Payne gets the rebound Here he comes Well since thats Yians first shot of the season I dont know whether it was a good one or a bad one I was hoping the fade away by K They cant afford Accurate assessment Bell Thats a good shot I know Thats a good one though All right Somebody has to guard Chris Bell This just it for four on threes and then Fort is out of control but a travel is called on Cal the BC ball So Cal builds its largest lead at 15 points at the Chris Bell show Again when he gets hot he really gets hot music music Very exciting was double figures in threepointers in his last four games and one of those guys when he has confidence Dan look out Well hes made three threes today Cal has made six and thats been a big story BC only has made two threepoint shots Theyve given up 10 points as a result of their turnovers Its 100 points off turnovers Those are the two key stats of the game How about the double team by Cal but Jeff Bond says its a foul on Koshus Kapki was flumxed by the double team and BCs been flustered all game Cal has been doing a great job double teaming when the ball goes to that area of the court to one of the big guys They made a mistake committing a foul Weve seen Kapy turn it over once before on that play That time he was falling backwards He was very fortunate to have the foul call One and one for Capki Again BC playing without Donald Hand out with a right leg injury and Cal without Lee Dort Free free flow woes continue for BC Just a 66 team from the foul line The little things add up dont they As Bell launches a three Hastings has the board Those type of things Dan you look at youre nine at 15 when youre not making your free throws Well you miss the front end of a one and one Thats giving away two Steager for three Tried to use the window but a foul I dont think he tried to use the window I was trying to on Valentines Day Thats coach and I think thats his second foul as well It is one and one for Hastings So you mentioned Dorts not playing Elich has two fouls and hes the starter Coaches is the sub Hes got two fouls Youre next Another missed front end of the one and one Pippen who has seven points and two fouls Yep Bell leads the way with 11 Ames started out hot the first five minutes Great pass on the back door Camden though fouled by Hastings Good look Camden came off that screen an offball screen and Camden comes wheeling down into the lane but Hastings does a really nice job following coming from your left to right Hastings is right there and Camden hesitates Very fortunate that he drew that foul Coming up later at 6 Eastern 3 Pacific After our mens basketball triple header on ACC Network and the ESPN app the Nothing But Net Crew breaks down the day in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every mens game We look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week Moving time in college basketball Dan February hectic month A lot to play for No question Caleb Steager and Carr has the board That type of day for BC Camden nails the three And that type of day cheering for Cal and Camdens telling me you know telling you know throw me the ball Thats the seventh three for Cal in 16 attempts And well take a timeout as we get a look at the John Camden three Yeah hes impressive Great form by the Delaware transfer music So Cal has a good tournament resume Dan Arolinardi has them on the cusp maybe of making the NCA tournament first four out But what do you make of their quad one wins Well theyve got four quad one wins And of course youre going to get the opportunities for quad one wins in the Atlantic Coast Conference because of all the strong teams but our Joe Lonardi has them at 75 And remember theres 68 teams go to the tournament So Joe has them a couple removed from getting in there cheering And this is Al Davis time for all the teams Just win baby Taves Good move by Luca Taves That ends the BC scoring drought at three minutes And Taves is not a guy that I think BC expects to have a lot of offense from but it looks like hes going to need to produce more offense with Donald Han not being available Day Ames look out somehow keeps his dribble under a minute to play in the half Chris Bell three to shoot Not what youre looking for Good defensive possession by BC applause Heres what were talking about Uh Virginia Tech with a big win during the week at Clemson Theyre now number 69 Joe says theyre the first team out of the tournament and Cals among that group in the next four out according to Joe We said number 75 in Joes rating system Rigorous conference schedule for everybody Excellent lead this year Pay hits the three So BC a little juice with Taz and Payne counter Now Mark Madson told his guys dont take the ball out of bounds right away Let the clock run And so Camden accidentally dropped it and it rolled away So now they can get the last shot cuz there was like 33 seconds when the ball went through the basket They ran it down to about 28 before they threw it in Shot clock off Cal delivered Carr the take Camd didnt I dont think he got it off in time Nope he did not Pretty good look for John Camden Could not by the 36 field goal shooting just three threepointers Eagles the eight turnovers and only averaging 10 and a half turnovers per game So and Boston College is not a great offensive team Nope So it really makes the uh task of coming back from down 15 a big one but they got to get started early and just keep going Thats a good start Thats a great start Jane Hastings 69 forward from Orlando Thats his second bucket of the game But Pippen screaming down the defense draws the foul Hastings does a great job coming from the foul line to get into that play but unfortunately he hits him with the body Hastings really plays hard Yes he does And he is an excellent shot blocker Thats the first free throw miss for Cal today Cals 78 for the year from the line cheering Pippen with his eighth point Justin Pippen the son of the Hall of Famer Scotty Pippen Around the arc its Payne Forte and Taz and the BC back with noticeable absence Donald Hand out with a right knee injury First lay by Pain Two possessions for BC two scores right at the basket The post up move and then the drive Thats the Thats the formula but they got to get some stops on this end An adjustment perhaps by Earl Grant his coaching staff at the half Noticing something of the Cal defense Elish to Pippen cheering Leech converts Boy that was easy for him That was good patience because he recognized that he had pain guard and he didnt try to do too much You got a little guy on you you just get close to the basket and put it up over top Theres a mouse in the house Cedric Maxwell likes to say on the Celtics broadcast here locally on radio Payne for three No good Cal looking to run in transition as they have all game Bell hot and he continues to be hot That was a great job by John Camden getting that ball out to get that transition started And Chris Bell I mean when youre a shooter like that you run to that spot in the corner in transition Fourth three of the game for Bell matching the four he had at Syracuse on Wednesday night in their double overtime loss Ky is doubled Look out crosscourt Chase Fortes got his three First three of the game for the South Dakota transfer Well and thats fine You know Forte hes only a 16 freepoint shooter in conference play So thats one you dont really expect Pippen tried to match him with a three Al has led by as many as 20 points Forte again too eager that time Well you know as I said hes only made four threepoint baskets in conference play Bell hes made five today Billy Yes boy You know its one thing to be open and get a threepoint shot Its another thing to be a pretty good threepoint shooter Bell is Forte is not Bell averaging 13 points He has 17 Five for seven on threes Hastings trying to wheel but he cant Goes out of bounds And one of the good ways you can get a threepoint basket is in transition And John Cam gets that ball out extremely quickly and then he gets it back And I mean and the ball hardly sits in his hands before he gets rid of it So two great passes by Camden in transition result in an easy three for Chris Bell How about those numbers Sparkling for Chris Bell Camden Can he match Bell Yes he can Uhoh I mean BC in conference play they hold opponents to 33 shooting from beyond the ark and Cal has been much better than that Theyre close to 50 They are right at 50 Fred Aid hits the three So theyre swapping threepointers And when youre trying to come back obviously you cant swap points Yep And if youre BC Im not sure you want to get in a threepoint shooting contest with Cal Cal 37 as a team from three in the post for Elich usually hits that and a loose ball scooped up by Chase Forte Kapki for Payne trying to shake Ilich Taves Kapy the put back Good pursuit off the offensive glass by the Butler Tress And thats all because they got the ball from side to side They forced the defense to react You see plus five in the rebounding edge over Cal Cal just keeps moving Constant motion for Mark Matson and a fade away by Pippen High percentage shot Paying the board The fall away over the 69 Hastings Im not sure thats a high percentage shot Runner by Payne Hastings to Tains Pippen has eight points Hes three for eight from the field You see in the late stages of the shot clock again Look out Hastings No but contact Thats a foul against Pippen John Camden Part of the threepoint coming out party for the Bears Dan but theyve hit 10 today and Camdens knocked down a couple of them And again they get great spacing Youre going to get great shots Hes certainly developed as a much better defensive player the last couple years When he had an injury a couple years ago he tore his ACL Heres Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header Number 20 Clemson Winston Salem will square up against Wake Forest to start us off at 7 Eastern Then its 15th ranked Virginia taking on Georgia Tech in Atlanta Like everything else both the roster available on the ESPN app theres lots of time left in the game but Boston College has to find a way obviously to get stops on the defensive end and then they have to play better offensively than theyve played in a long time Cal has led from the jump Ames quiet in the last 15 minutes or so Dy back to the first half but not that time A problem for Boston College Its hard to make a comeback when you got a guy on the other end who can basically go get a basket anytime they need it Scored eight points in the first five minutes of the game applause And an offensive foul on the Eagles And Capki just ran But heres Ames He drives the ball and hit despite the fact that Kavky comes over Ames is really good at getting the ball up on the board Ames the 62 junior transfer from Virginia from Chicago Here he goes again Low dribble too And the high shot That was impressive Wow You know the only thing about that is everybody else out there is standing around watching him and Cal has been so good in this game with ball movement and player movement But if Ames is going to get your basket at the end of that then youre fine with it Hes good late in the shot clock Hes created What a DUNK BY AMES SHOT AN equally outstanding pass from Fred Payne Speaking of creativity nice job by Fred Payne Fred Payne Got to match Ames creativity And Ames goes down Hes slow to get up Swarming BC defense in the post Well hes made two out of three really tough shots And that was another tough one Hes holding his elbow A Yeah Luca Taves doubled Payne the three and hes fouled Hell take three foul shots And if youre BC thats the guy you want at the free throw line And the Cal defense has been doing a great job jumping those screens out top all game long And I think that has really disrupted the Boston College offense Yeah good observation You know the the guard comes off the screen and then they jump him and now suddenly hes backing away and trying to throw this long lob pass and thats not what the offense is designed to create The foul was on Carr Payne gets another two at the line 77 from the stripe Ames goes up against two guys and he does a great job He keeps his eyes on the basket He never looks down and so he doesnt even try to protect himself Landed on that elbow and hes gone out of the game Although hes not getting any treatment on the elbow The textbook shot performed by Dayday Ames just didnt go Here comes Cal leading by 14 John Camden fouled by Luca Taves says Jerry Heater And thats a situation where I think Taves was surprised that Camden was going to try to dribble past him Got caught flatfooted Eagles coaching staff very impressed with how hard Taves works Camden off the side of the backboard Hes seen better shots than that one Payne Dog fight for BC to cut it under double digits Credit to the Cal defense Double on Taves Boy high dribble that time and a wild shot Thats just out of control there Dorsy for three Campbell transfer as his first three of the night Why not Hes known for his defense Thats only his fourth made threepointer in CONFERENCE PLAY SHOT MY GOODNESS take off and flush it home Boy hes got some bounce doesnt he He sure does Problem is that only counts two and Cals getting threes Kosis kept it alive 5050 win Pippen got his man in the air and he converts Well done by Justin Tippen and an N1 As we head to break BC trailally by 179 and Cal in their status is next four out there Theyre 75 So they got a couple of teams to climb over and the way you do that is you win games and you know todays game is a quad three game for Cal based on Boston Colleges net which is in the 150s But you just have to win games Thats why the loss the other night to Syracuse was significant Well its not a bad loss because basically that was a quad one game but that would have been a significant win Aiden Shaw had a nice half but he didnt get that one At this time of the year theres no such thing as a good loss Thats extremely valid Forced pass by Dorsy out of a double team is deflected away Well now he saw Bell and that was fine But how you cant no matter how hard you throw the ball if theres a guys arms there its not going through this Its called the door Yeah Bell three Rare miss from three Hes five for eight Eagles have Forte Payne and Steiger in their back court Paynes got the Thats a twopointer Close to a three but two points for Fred Payne Well he was definitely on the lines but And that was a tough shot Yes it was Hes pulling up off the dribble He has 16 to lead the Eagles So Payne continuing his impressive campaign averaging 15 points applause Chris Bell again trying to cut through A lot of cutting going on for Cal And that time I think it was Shaw that grabbed on Thats one way to prevent Bell from getting through But third foul on Aiden Shaw the Missouri transfer Shaw has six points Tied for second on the Eagles with Hastings six Pippen fade away Shaw the rebounds He is athletic and he is springy Played over 50 games from Missouri Backed up a good player named Mark Mitchell there And good pick up by Earl Grant Nice shake by Forte Now thats I think thats the best part of Forts game Hes quick Hes strong Hes taking a couple of threes and if youre open I suppose you got to take them But hes better driving to the basket Smart player back door Dorsys got it Oh he converts nicely The ball moves from side to side and then just when you think its going to continue to go to the other side they bring it back and back door Dorsy has seven Here they go Theyre attacking again What that does is force the guard back toward half court Totally disrupts the offense Tough shot for Paid Bell the rebound Hey youve had youve been on that all game What Cal has done to adjust on the defensive end He traveled He did I dont know those travel as much as he was carrying the ball One or the other Fifth turnover for Cal but Chase Forte the drive was impressive Well he does a nice job He gets his head and shoulders past Pippen Hes got the speed to do that Then hes got the strength to finish at the basket Again in conference play hes a 16 threepoint shooter so he ought to be driving the ball a little bit more Also feisty on the offensive end as you just saw the Summit League defensive player of the year last year for South Dakota Caleb Steer out of Dallas the drive Hes strong NBC ball Eight to shoot Harold Landry Patriots defensive end is here Former BC star linebacker defensive end Here with his family Also next to him is Frank Perano former Boston College strength coach Now the Patriots strength coach Deep three Forte Hes got it He doesnt care about that percentage What do I know Good for him Chase Forte beating the shot clock That was a pretty one for Forte Get that percentage up Yep Illich Absolutely laughter cheering Tried with the ball fake Well its a pretty good move if you can get away with it But um yeah once you establish that pivot foot you cant be picking it up and putting it down Thats not advised Forte to the rack and he draws contact but hes aggressive Hes following the Bonner playbook Well he senses that they back off You know Camden of course Elich went out there and then Elich backed off and Forte saw an opening and just took it right to the goal Now can you convert the free throw Its a fourth foul on Pippen Heres next weeks womens basketball double header on ACC Network and the ESPN app Number 21 North Carolina takes on Virginia Tech at 6 Eastern Then Miami hosts Stanford with Coral Gables Stanny Ash continues all season long on ACCN Great to have you with us Happy Valentines Day to you and yours Hes Dan Bonner off me for producer Russ Ken our outstanding crew TT Carr and the lefthanded layin Boy hes been silenced but that was that was nice Carr is a guy that very high on him He can penetrate to the basket Hes a good finisher around the goal Shaw see disjointed now trying to find a lane Payne instead takes the three Elish DJ Ames with it Bell The drive and the conversion They make it look easy at times They get the ball up the court quickly They dont waste any time They dont let Boston College really set up the defense Its just an efficient offense 55 from the field Pain three No he got foul instead of foul So BC trying to cut this deficit but right now its at 15 with under seven to play It works and they go to it Even though the numbers would indicate that Boston College is pretty good from the defending from the threepoint line hasnt affected Boston College at all Theyre expert threepoint shooters have knocked music down 11 threepoint baskets A very impressive offensive performance And how about this BC could sign him up A fan from the stands a BC student and he hits the deep three Pretty good Part of the proion here at County Forum but Cal with the basketball after the offensive foul was called on Fred Payne And now an offensive foul on Cal Elich on an illegal stream Yep Third on Elich Now Mark Mark Madson a little bit frustrated by that All El E has to do is stand still They were running a perfect play for get a really good threepoint shooter a shot and get a foul And BC has have trouble today Theyre getting the ball close to the goal Forte the last couple of possessions has been able to beat that perimeter defense but BCs had a hard time doing that for the most part throughout the game Forte with 11 23 minutes Elage in the post pretty much uncontested and Elich good hands When guys off the ball are moving its really hard for the defense to guard everybody And they just lost track of Elich Back door Hastings to Shaw His third slam of the half 50 back door call Well and its its a 13point game You would think it would be a much larger margin And a foul on Chase Forte Much to his Shagri but the last BC hoop was special Well its really a nice pass on the inside and that brings Camden up from the baseline because Hastings is in the middle of the lane and really a nice job there by Boston College to recognize the opening Youve been talking about Shaw He just saw the open area and went right to it Yeah hes definitely come on here for Boston College I think they expected him to be a contributor off the bench but seems the last five six seven games hes definitely gaining much more confidence TT Carr with the free throw and BC just cant cut into the 15point lead It was 15 points at halftime Cals been able to maintain that BCs never led Forte Camden got called for a push but thats the ability to beat that defense on the perimeter and get to the basket really puts pressure on the inside Call by the way 161 when leading under five minutes As we approach the fiveminute mark Asamod takes the three but instead a foul away from the ball on Elich says Jeff Pond I think thats four on Elish but they told just stay in the game He averages close to five per game No theyre going to put coaching this in now I think thats a smart move Montas Kosinish replacing Milo Shilich Luca Tay with a quiet second half Sha Oh nice by Mullen high off the window Last couple of possessions BC has done a nice job getting the ball to one of the big guys in the middle of the lane That causes the defense to collapse and the other big guys open Eagles shooting 44 but Cal 56 Heres a three by Ames and he nails it Thats their 12th three in 25 attempts And in conference play only Ames is only a 31 threepoint shooter And Cal now showing you a little bit of zone NC State hit 13 threes against BC this year Thats the most theyve yielded But Cal one away from tying that Taves counters with a three You know for a guy who can shoot it so well Taves doesnt really look for his shot You know there have been times when the balls kicked back out to him on the perimeter and he is not either not in position or not ready to let it go And if you shoot it like that boy you ought to be ready to get it rid of it as soon as you catch it Dont you like that though If youre a coach if hes unselfish No if hes can shoot threes I want him to shoot threes Especially today when youre down by 13 points His car cow called for a shot clock violation So BC still hanging around a little Efficient offense Dan BCs tried to counter with their share of threepoint shots and just an offense thats been inconsistent Well BC has been much better offensively in the second half and in the first half but so has Cal The drive by Hastings with a burst after the timeout Last break points in favor of Cal 152 Well and all that being said its an 11point game Yeah its remarkable that BC is kept at least within manageable limits but maybe not so much that time as Chris Bell This is his sixth game with 20 or more points 20th game at double fig Every time you think that BC might be in a position to make a little bit of a run Cal has an answer And usually its been with a three Chris Bell huge part of their success in their game at Syracuse music Chase Fores had an impressive second half Thats his third three of the night Well he had made exactly three threepoint baskets in conference play coming into the game So he has as many threepointers this afternoon as he does in the in the previous 11 games How about that Taves and a feathery touch for Luca Taves So now its a ninepoint cheering game Look out applause Fullourt pressure You see always playing hard Thats what Earl Rook talks about Seems like cheering every time they lose Camden oh boy Just brought some more snow and chest down Wheres going to close out I I I think I think that Forte he was there but I dont think he believed that Camden was going to shoot that ball from that distance I mean you got to make Camden put the ball on the floor Forte feeling it Wild shot Camden the board Eagles Three timeouts remaining Cal with three left Well Cal going to be very content here to take some time off the clock And you know you if you can get fouled go to the free throw line Cals the best free throw shooting team in the ACC And theyve made 82 at 9 for 11 Well theyre nine for 11 And the only guy whos missed a free throw is Pippet Hes one for three Yeah hes been quiet Does have four assists 10 points now 11 Our next All Access the ACC Life premieres Monday night featuring Stanford swimmer Tory Hus Georgia Tech womens basketball guards Brianna Tur and Sand Samuel Wake Forest womens basketball guard Milan Brown who get unprecedented access into the lives of the student athletes coaches staff parents fans 7 oclock Eastern here on the ACC network and the ESPN Taves Hastings keeps it alive He can eat the glass and he converts Thats 15 offensive rebounds for Boston College and they have done a tremendous job Theyve got an advantage 226 advantage in second chance points They made five of their last seven shots The problem is Cal has made seven of its last nine and pay a tie up jump ball Arrow towards Cal That was a very bad pass by Chris Bell Theyre lucky to keep that one Just a very athletic play by Pippen to even catch this ball throws I mean throws it behind him Pippen catches it in the middle of four guys Thats a heck of a catch Cal take Well they made up for the turnovers with their ability to rebound the ball on the offensive end but the threepoint barrage is just too much for them to overcome Day Ames swinging it to Bell trying to milk the clock here Pippet beats the shot clock and its kept alive by Camden and hes fouled Caves got him You know that thats tough situation Youre scrambling around and Bell he waited a long time He did passed up a shot on the baseline passed up a twofoot shot to save a couple of to get rid of a couple of seconds Rare miss by Cal the line DC ball Pippen lost it Throw Eagles on the verge of losing their sixth straight Cals remaining schedule the traditional rivals Stanford coming up in a week with SMU and Pit Georgia Tech and Wake Forest All on ACCN Jaden Hastings in the post And thats the thing BC they show some signs of life They go stretches where theyre scoreless for three minutes Theyre theyve hit six of their last eight shots So girl always talks about forest within the trees the peaks and valleys been that way for the last five years under Grant It just unable to close the deal establish any consistency Well this is a BC team that scored 75 points Correct 75 points is a lot for BC So their offense really hasnt been the issue today The issue has been that Cals offense has been so good and the BC defense just not up to the drill today And its always up to the drill And the point you brought up Donald Han his absence with a knee injury a disconnected defense perhaps due to some of that op absence And you know BC theyre they havent helped themselves from the free throw line and they normally dont Nope I think in the first half they missed at least two and possibly three front ends of the one and one Theyre theyre 56 from the line there And keep in mind that BC theyre trying to make it to the ACC tournament and this is a pretty tough schedule cheering Camden has missed his last couple The burgers on the line as part of a promotion here at Chestnut Hill but he hits much to the chagrin of this crowd as Kay loses it Kosis gives it up to Pippen drain the clock time as Cals going to walk out of here with their 18th win and sixth in the ACC VC is lost
