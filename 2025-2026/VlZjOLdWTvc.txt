It shouldnt take long for Sadi White to come in off the bench Get a look at the starting lineup The same as Syracuse used in both preseason games And Bingington down a couple of starters due to injury Well tell you about that as we get rolling Bearcats have the games first possession And quick point guard Jeremiah Quickley gets them going Buffalo transfer Bryson Wilson off the mark on a three And now the Orange possess it first with Nathan George at the controls George calls his own number Turning the corner gets his own rebound and the putback is home Thats what you want to see early from Nathan George Just being aggressive not always looking to pass the ball but look to score the basketball first Freeman quick to get back to the rim and deny Orange struggled so much with rim protection a year ago George to JJ Stling for his first touch in the paint against the biggest Bearcat Demetrius Lily and Stling dribbles out with it after a miss Freeman very strong in the two preseason games against the University of Buffalo and Division 2 Pace Out for Nate Kings draws a foul action on the floor So no shot for Kings on the first foul for either team And Kings coming in known as a shooter but much improved putting the ball on the deck You see him aggressive straight line to the rim The Orange have a significant height advantage in the back court George 63 Starling 64 King 65 Jeremiah Quigley is going to have a tough time keeping up with them in terms of size but he is very speedy Good seal by Freeman on the baseline out of bounds and he rings the bell for the first time I love what Syracuse is doing early on setting the tone getting the ball inside being aggressive at the basket Orange extend the half court defense West Peterson the only returning starter for the Bearcats as the ball is knocked out of bounds applause They have a couple that well tell you about in time that maybe would have started but have significant injuries for Bingmpington that have set them back before the year even begins Adrien Octry starts his third season and a minute and a half in the Orange lead four zip posting up above the threepoint line Steel Starling sizes up an opportunity Floater in the paint Bit strong Kyle saves a second possession out for a Kings lefty threepoint drive Kyle in pursuit Keeps this one alive for Freeman and he cashes in Lets take a look at DevOs die and his keys to the game for both teams as we get an early timeout from Bingington coach Lavel Sanders applause Back to the basket here Good passing among the bigs A great job by Donnie Freeman turnaround jumper soft moves much improved jump shooter but just work your way inside Youll always have those opportunities outside of the perimeter Adrien Audrey season number three just beginning now 20 wins in his first campaign only 14 a year ago Feels like he has a roster he really likes that are in his image here Grinders love basketball bluecollar players with a chip on their shoulder here Your keys dbo your dimes for the cues Yeah for Syracuse I think just competing and bringing high energy all 40 minutes right We didnt see that in the two exhibition games versus Buffalo and Pace These early nonconference games if they could really compete at a high level for all 40 minutes they should be set And then secondly run Get out Get early opportunities at the basket Get your cheering shooters in space Get some easy looks Binghamson tried to run out of the timeout and turned it over Thats a big issue for them Yeah speaking of turnovers Bingmpington was big A lot of turnovers last year Turnover prone So thats the first key Take care of the basketball Try to get those extra possessions and then rebound the ball Limit SU chances and then also give yourself some more possessions hopefully to leave some baskets for these Bingington Bearcats Averaged 13 and a half turnovers per game last year Jeremiah Quickley brought in to help that some in the lob to the rim Makes it easy Starling to Kyle for the jam What I like early on Matt is these guys arent settling Theyre looking to get to the basket and theyre taking advantage of what opens up for them Quickly a blur to the front cheering court for Lily May have stepped on the line and thats another turnover for Bingmpington cheering Too early and the Orange are cashing in A great job by JJ getting downhill waiting waiting probing lobing up to Kyle One of the most athletic guys on this Syracuse basketball team Knows what to do with it cheering Now for the first time in a game that counts Kayenne Anthony brought in early as JJ Starling hits the deck in front of the Syracuse bench and athletic trainer Mike Mangano first on the scene So as Starling stretches out we see Cayenne Anthony and so highly anticipated and followed for years here Melo made such a great contribution in just his one season at Syracuse And Cayennes another jumper off the right elbow is good for Nathan George Didnt shoot it very well in the first two exhibition games Hes got four early points on a 10zip Syracuse lead And as much as we know how good of a passer is youre even more effective being a passer if youre looking to score the basketball first Great job by Nate George looking to be aggressive scoring the ball Three straight turnovers by Bingmpington and a foul in the back court The Bearcats are compounding their mistakes in the early going and it wouldnt be the first time if Quigleys maybe a little bit uh overheated here at at the start playing a little out of control He did play for George Mason last year Did not see a great deal of action Was much more regular for Iona the year prior Kings from the corner Thats an air ball Going the other way with Peterson who did handle the ball quite a bit last year Quigley tracks it down for the open man Zier Beverly but he loses it Thats four empty trips in a row for the Bearcats Still yet to score Freeman on the open floor on the fadeaway Not this time JJ Starling has gone back to the locker room to get some extra attention from the medical staff Well keep an eye on that This is just a different Syracuse team that we seen against pace even in the early going They just got an extra pep in their step Theyre aggressive Theyre bringing ball pressure and theyre not settling on the offense Hughes relates to senior guard JJ Starling Hes already gone back to the locker room A little bit of an awkward step here Yeah it just looked like he maybe landed on that left foot and maybe did something to his calf or his hamstring Hopefully its not too serious You want to see him out here playing especially in his last year Back to the locker room with team orthopedist Dr Todd Betaglia So in good hands there as they go to check that out into the game for the first time Sadique White you can see in the foreground along with Luke Fenel who missed the second exhibition game with a minor injury of his own Kayen Anthony was the first sub off the bench Tyler Betsy in there too So not quite a five for five switch as we saw in the pace game but Adrien Autry not afraid to make a wholesale lineup substitution as Jeremiah Quigley is too deep on the first free throw attempt And Bingington is still yet to score Well Matt its good to have those options off the bench You know you really dont lose much And Im really excited to see what Fenel brings I know he cheering a big prospect coming out of Australia Big 65 head guard who can shoot it Looking forward to seeing how he does serves as a capable ball handler and in the game with Nathan George out How about the size on the floor right now Youve got a 66 plus point guard along with Kayen Anthony who goes 65 Finel splits the top of the defense for Tyler Betsy Again wind blown from the right corner and on the run out West Peterson gets by Fenel Still the lid on the basket for the Bearcats Run down by Demetrius Lily Orange out rebounded by a division 2 team in their second exhibition Not necessarily at the rim sometimes on the long ones Lily a rocket off the top of the glass Comes down into the hands of Freeman And its 5 minutes without a point for the visitors from Bingmpington The Bearcats coming off backtoback 15 win seasons but a lot of firepower on the bench Eban Ash and Seer Sangor both expected to start this year Lamont was in the mix as a another ball handler and point guard and uh all unable to go here at the beginning of the year and maybe all year Well they already struggle taking care of the ball Now when you take two of your guards out of the lineup youre going to struggle even more especially how Syracuse is playing early on defensively pressuring the basketball Not a lot of depth to start the season for coach Sanders on the drive A bounce pass by Quickley in the lane The lefty finish does not go Loose to Lily And finally at 1431 of the first Bingington is on the board Lily probably their best player Senior from Philadelphia transferred from Lasal Probably a good decision by coach Sanders to go in zone off the rim and Akir Suare is over the back for a foul in his early action The one thing that is going to keep Bingmpington in the game is if Syracuse turns the ball over that previous possession when Freeman had a bad pass You got to be able to take your time If you dont have it in transition slow it down set it up in the half court Quigley waiting for a screen He is initiator for the Bearcats who were picked preseason fifth out of nine in the America East Little fadeaway finds the mark for Zire Beverly Whenever you get that deep in the paint bad things usually happen you know for the defense So you got to be able to make sure you cut that midline off at the free throw line area and defend better Orange really spread out the offense Anthony has range from deep punched in the air and kept alive by Suare Betsy tes one up Still having a tough time from distance in the early going More than a threeminute scoreless stretch Well you see the difference from the beginning to now They were attacking the rim not settling Now Bingmpington went to that zone Has Syracuse playing more outside on the perimeter Six straight misses by the Cuse Anthony drives by Quigley couldnt get it home on the finish and a rebound by Demetrius Lily Right idea though by Anthony attacking the zone trying to get in the paint make cheering something happen Matt I keep looking at Quigley Hes not five1 Generously listed at 511 on the drive Beverly wanted to go for the drop off And again the Orange have size and athleticism with Betsy going coast to coast and he draws a foul to get to the line So we talked about in the pace game Eric almost as a as a criticism that Syracuse was only excelling because of being bigger faster stronger Here theyre clearly uh more athletic and gifted than Bingingtons material but theyre in the right places as well Well they have they have better players I mean thats obvious But when you compete at a high level for all 40 minutes usually thats going to put you ahead of the game But now you see them executing doing what they do best offensively attacking the attacking the rim and then defensively theyre up pressuring When guys get by they got guys at the rim using athleticism altering shots Betsy the Cincinnati transfer stops a scoreless streak of more than 4 minutes and 20 seconds Bingmpington doesnt figure to sub a whole lot tonight Ryan Richardson first in off the bench Matt I think a big thing for Syracuse against the zone You dont want to get into playing ring around the Rosie and just swinging the ball the flash a guy into that middle get it into the middle break down the zone and then they could collapse Now you got options to kick out or you can attack from the free throw line Second free throw for Betsy makes him two for two on the trip and the Orange extend the lead to eight Theyve got some ability here again with you look at the athleticism and the depth Thats what is going to allow them to play a 66 guy defending 80 ft from the basket as Fenel was picking up back there Post feed low and left and Hansen the cookie jar for Akir Suare Second foul You look at the lineup the Orange has on the floor and they can switch one through five I mean you see Sadique White hes guarding the point guard Betsy whoever it is These guys are not only athletic but they can move their feet Suare out and starter William Kyle back in Ryan Richardsons a junior from South Florida loses the grip and Cayenne Anthony Now Sadik White rather ready to oblige Betsy loses the grip but a reachin is whistled against Bingington Second foul on West Peterson of the teams fourth I really like Fels game I think he just understands how to play the game If its not there hes not going to force it Hes not going to try to do what he cant do Hell slow it down and get guys into a set To the rim a little bit too high but there was a reason for that Foul call Hard to beat too high in the air for Sadique White He can get up with the best of him We talked about in the pregame I mean I Ive seen a lot of Syracuse basketball over the years Hes probably one of the most athletic guys the last 15 to 20 years I we were comparing him to Wes Johnsons athletic ability and thats saying a lot Well Syracuse has had that assembly line just blessed over the years to have the Jeremy Grants and Hakee Wars and the type of folks that youre talking about as JJ Starling takes a seat and doesnt look ready to return anytime soon Fenel can look over the defense Kyle on the back down spins baseline and blocked Itll stay with Syracuse though with the shot clock at seven So the Orange will have a baseline out of bounds when we come back Theres Robert Harris the new strength and conditioning coach Every dog has his day Every dog gets a bone Well tell you more later And off the baseline out of bounds Good play called there for Sadique White Couldnt get it home I mean I think it all starts with the mindset right Youre going to go through a lot of ups and downs during the season but having that dog mentality means you fight through those moments and you stick together as a team From out front just off the mark for Bryson Wilson Only a 24 threepoint shooter last year for Buffalo Kyle wide of the lane looking to get it inside first Pass is deflected but reeled in by Fenel clears throat Look at the push first right Then they have taken a bunch of threes havent made any yet but they havent really felt like settling Their early offense is seems to be improved so far A few possessions when they Bingmpington went to zone You see them just settling for the threes which is which is normal but you want to be able to get in attack and and play off the closeout Three at the scores table for Syracuse I think early in the season were going to see that a lot Quigley among the trees out for the jumper by Richardson which goes begging and a foul on the rebounding effort That is on Quigley his second Syracuse doing a much better job of closing out on the shooters Second half in Buffalo and in the first half against Pace they were just standing there with their hands down Even if theyre open contest the shot Make it hard shot Syracuse is doing that Orange lead by 10 And now bringing back a couple of starters into the game as Donnie Freeman and Nathan George along with Nate Kings return And I love this I love the combo of of Nate George and and Fenel out there together Both ball handlers both smart decision makers Lets see how it works out for the Orange Allows Kings to camp out in the corner in front of the visiting bench George off the hard screen that pick and pop Syracuse still looking for his first threepoint hit Freeman in the two exhibition games one of seven total on threepointers but those are the ones that youre okay with him taking Youre okay with him taking that pick and pop Its a wide open shot Hes capable of making it You dont want the ones where hes going into a dribble and do work on the inside first but if you get those opportunities theyll be there Montana State transfer Bryce Zephr in the game for the first time Hardnosed defender makes his impact on this end of the floor You can even lefthanded freshman number two in green Well they can switch everything You know you just the athleticism the versat versatility they have on both sides of the ball Shot clock down to two Tough shot there and tonight anyway shot clock violation against the Bearcats I think this what weve seen so far is a little bit more what the idea is of Adrien Octi for this year Shuffling in players turning up the intensity on the defensive end Well you see right here a little bit different than last year right You have youre going with Kyle You have Freeman right there You got Kings Great job of crowding the basketball and making it tough at the rim Kings on the baseline drive Lilys holding his own Hes a little more familiar with the bigger stages started his college career in Penn State and has also played out in the South Lily cheering against Freeman right of the lane Good move by Lily but the finish not there again And the loose ball dribbled out by Nathan George And these are what these possessions are going to be Good defensive possession allows you to get out and play fast in transition Great decision by Nate George to set it back up scores the jumper The Orange still have a three And for as good as Syracuses defense has been Eric they have 14 points in 11 minutes Well I just think you dont want to Okay if the threepoint shot is there take it But against a team like this especially early on you see its working Attack the basket Now you can get to the free throw line Now they got to loosen up a little bit more Those threepoint opportunities will be there Bingington with six fouls already and you figure you can take advantage of that off the dribble handoff fake Its a turnover by Bingington and Zire Beverly He played at East LA Community College for those of you that are into Netflix series about uh that kind of thing At Elac and Adrien Autry set to call this next play as the Orange Walk it up against fellow New Yorker Lavell Sanders He goes back with coach Audrey a bit but more with assistant coach Alan Griffin They grew up in the same neighborhood of Brooklyn And depending on who you ask that theyll tell you what who won the most battles right Sanders a very good player Nearly 1400 career points at Satan Hall Freeman hierarching triple try and the Orange still for the night and nine tries from long range Now those are the ones I cant I cant deal with Stand still Nothing going on Shoot Get the ball moving Get something different Kelsey on the sideline and the turnover Woes continue for Bingmpington Scoring droughts for both teams because theyre having a hard time hanging on to the ball Bingington hasnt scored in some six minutes Theyve turned it over five times in that stretch And again I dont want to take anything away from Syracuse I think the intensity and how theyre playing early on is is great but you got to know Bingmpington is without two of their starters right Theyre going to have to be able to bring it on this on this end offensively Wow You see Kyle showing his athleticism right there And Nate George one of the best decision makers in the ACC Pretty easy to make the decision to make it look good when you flip it right up to the rim And William Kyle brings it down Kyle as advertised would jump out of the gym ability Lily stripped in the lane Great job by Nathan George Starts the break with Kings on his left George right to the rim lays it in And this is really what Im excited about for the Syracuse Orange defense into offense Nate George one of the best in the country of getting it and going George leads the Orange with a half dozen points Just four points at 13 minutes for the Bearcats Quickly whiff on the leak out Donnie Freeman and another timeout taken by Bingington Its 20 to four cheering Well now the big So far hes already got eight boards and we played only 13 minutes Has a knack for the ball Big frame 69 230 Well and Matt for Bingmpington you just dont want to stop playing You dont want to stop competing and lay down I know youre down a lot but you you know its tough to learn from these moments Seepher was on the baseline Itll stay with Bingington here Conversing with veteran official Bert Smith and Cayenne back into the game replacing Bryce Zephr mom in the house tonight along with Roger Neil the venerable longtime voice of Bearcats basketball down in Bingmpington and Vestal Way Hes a legend on the drive Quickly the pull up 10footer too deep and tipped in That might have been an own goal Oh we just got done talking about Lily just him being active around the rim getting his hand on the ball Got a put back Stops a long scoring drought for the Bearcats And a look away lob wide to the rim but not wide enough Theres no challenge to William Kyle Man can he get up We talked about Sadiq Whites athleticism I mean dont sleep on Kyle I mean this guy has a 45 in vertical and his head and shoulders above the rim Orange with the length against Quigley who whips it for Wilson and the return is intercepted Nathan George looking for options Nate Kings all alone Oh could have followed his own but he had Freeman on the scene for the rebound A foul against Bingmpington And Jeremiah Quickley the point guard picks up his third already You just see the potential that Syracuse has on the defensive side of the ball Theyre doing a great job of just reacting and rotating When a guy gets by theres another guy right there to contest Great job just being active on the defensive side of the ball So Freeman to the line decent foul shooter right around 80 last year Horns sub as Sadi White returns replacing William Kyle Donnie on the Carl Malone award watch list for the top power forward in college basketball pretty good company in the conference Thats a heck of a list right there And right now we see Donnie at the five and and honestly I like him at the five a lot because he can do that pick and pop and he has even more of advantage offensively and then defensively if he can really lock in hes gotten stronger Hes going to be able to hold his own on that side for right now Unless Sheffy Diawara develops into that Syracuse is not going to have a footer you know a sevenfooter Its in there lumbering and eating up a lot of space and protecting the rim Theyre going to do it with a guy thats a little bit shorter still pretty tall by general standards and very athletic And thats what Kyle and Freeman Suare bring to the table Certainly Sadi White as well And youre not going to see guys throwing it into the post really playing out of the post a lot anymore Thats not what the game is Shot clock dwindling for Bingington Takes them a while to get into their offense with Quigley on the bench and its turned over out front by Jackson Bedign grad student who is returning to the Bingmpington program but this uh a bit of a challenge for him 14 turnovers already for the Bearcats Its right what they knew would be an issue coming into this season Syracuse has just two Leave Sanderson said Look we stop giving it to the other team We make a few free throws Those are things we can control Cant connect on the lob this time Its hard to score the ball when you keep giving it away to the other team Beverly along the baseline and official Mike Kits has a foul against the Cuse This one on Donnie Freeman his second And I just cant say enough about Sadique White I I I mean he hasnt scored a basket but all the intangibles that you want from a player being active communicating playing with passion he has all that as a freshman coming in flying around making an immediate impact just by being on the floor Just under five minutes to go in this opening half All the way into Benigny on the far side and he drains the three Its the first for either team in the game And that was probably the first shot where he didnt get out there all the way and contest But other than that Syracuse has been solid defensively Draws a tough defensive assignment and fouls Cayenne Anthony which will get the Syracuse freshman to the line The Orange are doing exactly what Lavel Sanders prescribed as a recipe for his own team Dont turn it over Get to the line Make free throws Make easy baskets And thats where we will see Anthony I feel like Anthony is forever going to be tucking in his shirt throughout the season laughter Thats going to be a regular theme two shots The Sports Center next 100 36 ranking and folks around these parts have been keeping an eye on Cayenne Anthony for quite a while And and obviously youre going to get the comparisons to your dad but thats unfair You cant do that Carmemelllo Anthony hes in a a league of his own but his sons not that bad either Hes hes coming here a high high recruit number one recruit out of New York Three level score I think he adds a little weight He gets stronger Hes not going to get bumped off his straight line like he just did but hes a guy whos capable of coming in and scoring in bunches One out of two at the stripe for his first point of the night But then hes got his hands full with Sadique White just past midcourt Its unreal They dont have that in the American East He wont have to worry about that later in the year And thats a foul on the backside by Nathan George His first just seeing how he moves his feet Thats the point guard right there that hes guarding moving his feet causing havoc Sadique White is a first round NBA talent and hes hes a first round NBA talent without even scoring the ball Brings a lot to the table And here even just guarding the inbound Those long arms make it difficult Jaden Kelsey and Jackson Benigny make up the back court for Bingmpington Benigny for another three fouled this time Cant do that Luke Fenel is the guilty party It was a great job by Suare early on not letting Lily get that inside touch Just a glancing blow right Fel flying out at him But he played only seven games for the Bearcats last year Averaged two points per Hes got four already in this one And thats another thing for the Bearcats You got guys that are injured so it gives an opportunity for other guys to come in and make an impact And then coach Sanders gets to see you know what type of impact they can make going forward in the year But is a Stonehill transfer Syracuse will host Stonehill later in this preconference season has six for the Bearcats Half of their dozen so far as Fenel turns it over Binghams is starting to get a little momentum here breaking the ice inside the JMA wireless dome Theyre not going to go away Theyre going to compete The biggest thing offensively on this side for Syracuse they need to be able to play in space Love to see Syracuse pick up defensively in the back court Weave action up top for Bingmpington The Orange worked on this a bit in practice yesterday and over the baseline and touched last by Syracuse Time for a breather The Orange got out to a big early lead scoring the games first 10 and theyre up 2512 at the moment Staring uh just alone with his thoughts looking into the distance there as Bingington works a baseline out of bounds pass there got big off his spot trying to make something out of it but uh Akir Suare had other ideas Well Akir came all the way out from the basket guard and then went all the way back in to get the block I mean thats rare to see forwards be able to get in and get out like that Anthony adept at handling the ball Certainly doesnt shy away from it out to Betsy straight on three and finally the orange hit on attempt number 11 of the night and hes the guy besides Nate Kings that you really think can fill it up from threepoint land once one goes down confidence starts to go skyhigh the first exhibition Betsy made all three and the second one he missed all three thats how it cheering goes shoot or shoot Lily trying to size up Suare spins baseline Spit it out to Kelsey and further out for Wilson Four on the timer Beverly got in deep and banks one home Its a great finish strong by Beverly But Suare these last three possessions he is flying around active Hes doing exactly what Coach Red brought him in to do Anthony off the window and in First field goal of Cayennes young and promising Syracuse career And look hes a talented kid And I think sometimes just for him slow it down because hes so talented He just wants to go go right away But if you slow it down be able to make better decisions with the ball Beverly got by Sadique White for a lefthanded triple try on the corner line drive misses the mark and Luke Fenel dribbles it out himself for Betsy Bingmpington boards the miss with a 16point deficit And Matt I I I get if youre open shoot the three but early on what got him this lead was being aggressive getting to the basket getting free throw opportunities Kelsey runs the rim Betsy the rebound Syracuse again with two at the scorers table Red Audreys been trying to bring somebody into just about every whistle Finel great deal of FIA experience Anthony is a creator for sure and he pures one from the free throw line and hes a guy who could make tough shots right He Hes super talented You dont want to be have to take tough shots all the time but if hes in that situation hes capable of knocking him down cheering Final minute of the opening half An extra step and the officials didnt miss it Another Bingmpington turnover George number 42 turnover number 15 in this first half for the Bearcats just been making it so tough to even get by You know the bigs and the guards doing a great job of keeping the guys in front Leave the Sanders thinking about his halftime message here and can Bingmpington get a stop to close the opening period Stfan Snag sophomore from Queens is in Well Matt I think honestly youre okay with 32 points scored You know you just want to be able to score more than 14 Yeah So many empty trips because of the giveaways by Bingington Shot clock about 7 seconds ahead And Adrien Oct will take a timeout Looked like he was there gets the timeout that he cannot take to the second half anyway And Anthony takes the ball out which means if hes going to be the guy theyll be looking to get it back to him See if he can slip the defender White to Betsy in the corner Sheds his defender and hangs on the rim Does not fall and Bingington should get the final shot of the half at the horn It is short for Benigny and its an empty trip for both 20 minutes deep It is 32 14 is all about So thats how it works Theres uh you figure they would I dont know licensing and marketing and and lob to the rim here right off the bat Talk about atto plays and any play with William Kyle above the rim is a high percentage effort I mean just throw it up anywhere at the rim William Kyle is going to go up there and at least can get a chance Quickly they try to do the other way How about that hold by Speedy The reverse jam by Zire Beverly Got to give it to Bingleton again Theyre going to keep fighting What an athletic play right there by Beverly Syracuse by 18 Donnie Freeman takes a bump Bingmpson had early foul issues in the first half and Syracuse figure will continue to pound it inside Rolling and cant get it to drop Freeman will go to the line for the second time tonight And that was a great job by Freeman of getting open Cayenne has to be a little bit quicker right when hes open He has to be able to get it to Donnie a little bit earlier so he can have better position Great job of working it down into the lane and opportunity for two free throws for Freeman So Freeman to the line was two of two on his first trip You can see him sporting the Lawrence Motton patch there LM21 will be on the teams jerseys this year Not going to harp on free throw shooting with it Syracuse up 18 one minute into the second half But when youre need your better shooters to deliver there and get to the line more than your not so better shooters but a guy like Freeman hes capable of being 80 from the line Its just did that last year Yeah Its just going there focusing and knocking down your free throws It makes a big difference when youre able to knock down your free throws Its what takes away any margin that Bigington may have in this game too to overpower them to get to the line in the first place and then make the shots Beverly out of a brief double team back up to Quickley who was set back by foul trouble in the first half Good Kyle on the long lob ahead Good find inside for Freeman Lost going up but then drew a foul on his second effort So Freeman back to the line See right here great heads up by George just getting it to a taller Freeman going up there and get it and then just be aggressive at the rim Eric we talk in recent history about players that were great at drawing fouls Tyus Battle maybe none better Judah Mintz how about a big you somebody thats a really tough cover get the ball into Donnie Freeman and maybe hes somebody who can get on the line quite a bit Well anytime you get it that close to the rim all you got to do is be ultra aggressive and yeah you want to put a little acting into it a little bit of ah this and there but Freemans doing a great job of not settling Hes getting it close to the rim and hes being aggressive Freeman poised for an allconerence caliber type season Its one of two on this trip And if he rebounds as well as he did in his freshman season which was historically good for this program then he is on his way And I think we know he can rebound the basketball We know about his skills offensively but defensively is where I think he can really take a step up in his game Peterson very short but Lily is there to clean it up Demetrius Lily has just four points You can see him being a factor in the American East So big and active Hes not going to be facing Donnie Freemans and William Kyle in the America East And Freeman draws another foul on Zire Beverly Beverly on Beverly himself and three on the Bearcats just more than two minutes into the second half Now Bingmpington sub Stfant Snag who wasnt in the early plans to come into the game just played in the last minute of the opening half Hes in already for Beverly And Bingington with these injuries is going to likely struggle with depth at least early in the year And Matt I think when youre a basketball player when you play hesitant youre not going to draw as many fouls But when youre assertive youre aggressive youre just going to fall into those fouls Freemans doing a great job of really being assertive and looking to go ahead Kyle got it tangled with Quigley Its setting a screen The whistle is for the clock though So well have a little administrative work here as the officials want to take a look They do have a file on Quigley and they want to look at it So remember quickly got tied up there Heres uh Mike Kits going to share a word with us All right so they have an off the ball foul and theyre looking to see did the basket count while there was a foul up by the free throw line that drew so much attention Quigley got kind of tied in there with Kyle Youve got a 6 foot n 230 and Quigley is more like 59 and maybe generally listed at 170 Take a look here I mean Matt but it all starts with Nate George looking to be aggressive scoring the basketball Hes such a a much better player music when he looks to score the basketball kind of figure that foul was ahead of the shot but uh maybe a little continuation there as the officials get together Still early in the season for everybody Opening day across college basketball The Orangeer home again Saturday against Delaware State before going on the road to Philadelphia the following Saturday Bingmpington starts the season with a crowded schedule Theyve got RIIT coming to Vestal on Wednesday Then they play Greg Pollaces Niagara team on Saturday The Orange doubling Bingmpington as we look at a review here have to review The shooter was in the act of shooting before the foul occurred So its two points for Syracuse as well as the ball out of bounds on the side So as Bert Smith tells us score the goal and the foul on Quigley his fourth Two points for Nathan George here Yeah Again a great job by Nate George just being aggressive looking to score the ball You become a better passer when youre being aggressive looking to score the basketball So the Orange extend the lead to 20 Syracuse scored the first 10 points of the game This is their widest margin of the night And now with the ball on a side out Good curl there One more pass for the jam by Kyle Those are the quick hitters you want to see on the offensive side of the ball Kings coming off the curl You see the help come Great drop to William Kyle throwing it down Love that little extra pass after you already have one good shot See if you can get a better shot And its quick like basketball Its quick decisions and its a great decision right there by Kings Now with a big lead the Orange can also be much more aggressive on the defensive end over the swinging arm of Kyle Score the goal for Demetrius Lily Pulling up early feeling it Count it for Nathan George And we knew Nate George wasnt going to play like he played against Pace We knew he was going to be much much better Hes having a staff stuffing game right now But again hes a much better player when he looks to score the basketball first Everything else opens up for him Georges first triple in the team second George leads the team with 11 points so far Good ball movement here for Bingington into Lily over two defenders and Freeman rises to the rim for the board Great job by Freeman coming over on the help George feeling it Hes calling for a screen Thought maybe hed pull the trigger there in the lane High switches to the left and scores Forcing a timeout by Bingington coach Lavel Sanders early in the second half getting it going on the offensive end as King sets up Kyle off the initiation from Nathan George Theyre Syracuse doing a good job of just being decisive Quick hitters making the right decision getting to the rim being aggressive You see Anthony right here just getting downhill being aggressive finishing with the left hand The extra passes the chemistry among newcomers only helps when youre sharing the ball and everybody eats I think the biggest thing is were happy what theyre doing defensively right Syracuse is happy with their pressure and forcing turnovers offensively Thatll come Theyll continue to get better on that end Lily a little bit of a threepoint shooter Did knock down 25 last year for the Lasal Explorers Bingmpingtons going to need some of those to get back into this game Freeman on the post up Kings instead plays it up top Freeman just get a little bit lower on that post up so he can have more of an advantage Anthony on the step back Oh thats smooth Matt I tell you what he he has a little of those little crafty moves from his dad Just a little bump right there creating space right there Onelegged fadeaway shot Hes a crafty player He has that in his game Hes got a lot to learn as all freshman do but theres no lack of polish Hes got every scoring trick Hes been shown that and learned that by the best Back door and Cayenne up with a slap against the board And now you see these guys starting to play more free Theyre having fun Guys are moving off the ball Great decision right there and find by Nate George Sometimes you see this you go why cant you do that from the jump But it is sort of a rhythm thing right Getting into the game Youre playing with house money now with a big lead Especially when you see the rotations in and out in and out You really cant find that chemistry You see hes kind of sticking with his guys right now Foul on Nathan George And heres George at the other end finding Cayenne for the flush Yeah great job just just finding that back cut and Cen Anthony 67 big frame knocking it down Heat Heat cheering If you were wondering just when might Cayenne Anthony find his groove it didnt take long Yeah forget about Carmemell Anonys son This guy is a player in his own right right A guy whos been doing it all three levels Ultra confident being super aggressive tonight getting to the rim and then he has a lot in his bag Bump music creating space fade away knock it down Great job moving off the ball getting the dunk Great decision by Nate George Kayen Anthony is a guy who can score on all three levels music and hes going to make an impact immediately as you can see tonight for the Syracuse team Starting the second half with the injury to JJ Stling Lets get more from Sean Yeah Matt I just spoke to Cayennes mom Lala who is here at his dome debut She said shes feeling good She wants to see Cayenne and this team both keep going in his first official game in a Syracuse uniform Vansson tried to get the long range shot to fall which has been very difficult for them in this game so far Their only hope really to make any kind of game of it the rest of the way Itll be a lot of fun to see Melo and Laa here more regularly throughout the year The development of Cayenne finger roll from distance doesnt quite go here and Sadique White looking to be heard from too Sadique has not scored in his dome debut but there will be plenty of opportunities And I think even right there for him hes capable of hitting that free throw line jump shot but go ahead jab him off and just rip through and then use your athleticism and be aggressive at the rim Cayenne gets a nice round of applause and the pat on the back from Robert Harris and JJ Stling and others as he makes his way to the water stand Now the key is can the Orange keep up the intensity here right Theyre prone maybe to lulls and giving some back Well see if they keep the hammer down And you know offensively they want to try to run sex sets and execute but you dont want to take your foot off the gas You want to continue the momentum especially going into Saturday against Delaware State Tough shot for Fenel Too tough Looking for these other freshman to get their name in the book for the first time Finel and White So many newcomers of course to the roster this year So therell be a lot of firsts and milestones along the way Jeremiah Quickley back in with four fouls and Bingham looking to run a little more smoothly with him on the floor Zephr Fenel Betsy Suare and White This is the second unit for the Orange No starters out there at the moment Betsy a little whirling shot is good from the ACC logo I really like Betsy cuz hes more than a shooter Hes a guy who could put it on the deck Hes not going to give you too much more than a straight line but great balance right there Great feet getting into his shot knocking it down Nine points matches his careerh high for Cincinnati against Gramling last season Quigley lost it going up and Bryce Zephr surprised at the foul call his first And thats just a little thing right there I noticed right when you see that drive Sadique White has to come from that weak side to meet him all the way on that opposite block Opportunity for a charge No opportunity at the rim for Bingmpington Just got to be earlier on that It be interesting to watch Bingington this year and see what type of seasonwigley has They have high hopes for him as he gets his first point of the night Hes been set back by foul trouble quite a bit in this one but theyre looking for him to be more to the form of how he played for Iona two seasons ago Didnt get quite as much run at George Mason I dont think in the America East youre going to see a lot of big guards going against I think for him they want him to be able to get in the lane and just create and make good decisions knock down open shots in the lane A bulldozer move and a foul is called out of Kier Suare His third lower the shoulder a little He could have played on honestly and I did about four or five games last year where I saw Suare play at Georgia Tech Hes going to improve offensively right Hes hes more raw What Coach Red wants him here for hes doing really really good job of just being active defensively being around the rim and youre not going to see a lot of post catches for him in this season Circus defense extending all the way out to mid court Finel on the rotation pokes one away Its another turnover Thats what Sari is really good coming all the way out and then being able to get all the way back in recover at the rim See if Sadique can get going offensively Thats a rocket pass that Fel did well just to catch in front of the bench Betsy Quickleys got speed and draws a foul on Zephr So you can see what Quickley does well And Dan might have the most foot speed of anybody on the floor right now Hes doing a great job just probing and just being aggressive at the rim When youre that little you got to be crafty at the rim You got to be crafty with your change of speed Good job by Quigley drawing the foul played two years of team takeover and in the DC metro area He was all conference in the same way that Donnie Freeman was all conference there Its one of the top AU programs in the country Sure And thats where Coach Audrey and Brendan Stron have a background with those teams So Quigley a known commodity A lot of great basketball played in that area You see Bingington a little 131 action or a high 32 Coach Bam Hall always used to say LOOK AT THE DIAGONAL laughter Look away pass Betsy cant convert Offensive rebound and finel a chance He gets his first points from the free throw line And I think Lukes a guy who the more opportunity he gets the the better hes going to be Hes a smart basketball player He knows how to play the game He can shoot the basketball and rarely is he going to make a bad decision Nobody got back there and it is cleaned up by Ski both And Nathan George stucking the stat sheet and we knew he was going to step his game up One of the best point guards in the ACC but I think one of the best point guards in the country Just a smart decision makers Five for seven is 11 points six assists four steals music zero turnovers Nate George in my mind is the best player on this Syracuse basketball team And when hes rolling this Syracuse team is going to be rolling as well He certainly you can easily make the argument that hes the biggest key to where is their ceiling this year How can they improve off of last year get the most out of the talent that surrounds him Off the baseline out of bounds Bingington goes right into Lily gets the basket and the foul And for Q these are just the little things you you you want to clean up Communicating on the defensive end on the out of bounds being ready That was just a case of just not being ready Good job by Lily sealing and having the advantage at the rim So Lily looks for a threepoint play and converts And Matt he was a preseason allconerence player for a reason get into conference play Hes going to be a major impact for this Bingington team Hes got nine points in this game And off the miss a foul Zire Beverly has been active in that department in the second half Now Kyle actually called for a foul this time so hes got two Label Sanders has a realistic point of view Looking to continue to up that win total in America East One seven of 16 each of the last two years right around 500 Both blocked and stolen And Kings threeon one to the rim for Kyle And man you see Nate Kings not having a great offensive night but doing a great job making plays defensively Hes active Hes engaged Well the Orange get two but they give up an easy two the other way They didnt get back basket and a foul in this case Great job Nate Kings right there just f find finding William Kyle Seems like he has about eight alley hoops in this game But they got to do a better job of getting back in transition defense and making it hard for these Bingmpson Bearcats The type of pass that Sherman Douglas made famous in this building Just get it up at the rim for the athletes and let them go to work Kyle has matched his career best 12 points Did that for UCLA against Iowa in January Well Matt Id love to have three guys with a 45 plus inch vertical I Im not even looking Im just throwing it at the rim Yeah because not only can they get up there they have such a wide radius of catching and getting the ball to the rim from where they are athletically Foul on West Peterson is number four I mean Im watching Kyle and hes literally head and shoulders above the rim No lie His shoulder is above the rim I mean these guys are some of the most athletic guys weve seen as Syracuse And you think through the years of guys that could really get up here New Yorks been blessed with tremendous athletes Its always a fun parlor game Who do you like for best leapers in program history Tony Red Bruin and Hakee Warick Jeremy Grant West Johnson You got to put West in there Johnny Flynn for a smaller guy They showed his dunk at Ruters on the video board during one of the breaks 46 in vertical Ive seen it plenty of times in person He I mean he was an incredible athlete laughter Not quite that high but it wasnt that farfetched the idea from Nathan George a halfcourt lob that eluded Kyles reach Well you see how Bingingtons playing so far up from the rim That baseline is wide open every single time for Syracuse From long range Lily tried to show his skill Offensive rebound Beverly good move but denied And Kyle works it out to Anthony How about that one William Kyle off the Cayenne Anthony Feed Literally just throw it anywhere He went above and beyond to go grab that Along the baseline and up the escalator goes West Wes Peterson for his first points Getting a little playground now which is I think fine for all concerned Were in the final quarter of the game Kings cheering is sweet along the baseline His first points Thats good to see him just knock down a jump shot Thats what he was recruited here to be He shot almost 46 from the threepoint line last year at Oregon State Hes a knockdown shooter Great seeing him knock down his first one of the year Sadique White to the scores table I think for Red hes going to have to decide what whats the rhyme and reason to the substitution pattern You know he always tells the players go all out I want everybody to go max effort and well find somebody else and well get you back in there in a hockey shift type approach But you dont want to take a hot hand out either And so its kind of figuring out what will be his method here William Kyle exerting a lot of effort getting to a careerhigh 14 points Maybe not done with nine minutes to go and Sadique White in to replace him as Beverly goes to the line Well I think the good thing that Coach Red has is he has options right So if a guys not playing well you got somebody on the bench whos ready to come in and theyre not losing a lot when they do that Beverly connects and another free throw coming with 901 to go Syracuse headed more than likely to its sixth consecutive season opening win and its sixth win in as many games ever against Bingmpington Beverly makes both Hes got 10 Orange next in action this weekend taking on the Hornets of Delaware State That is a one00 game with football on the road A 330 start on the grid iron at Miami Anthony nice pass Threading it in to Donnie Freeman Couple of nice assists for Cayenne Anthony and Freeman pays it off Well great job by Donnie knowing he has a smaller defender on him Great job sealing him not letting him getting around Great pass great finish Steal here as it falls in the lap of Kings Races to the basket and scores with the left hand Forces a timeout The last of the day cheering cheering Now Syracuse has widened the lead now to 26 Ottawan crew loving it One of the things theyre enjoying seeing is the dome debut in games that count by William Kyle And I dont know he it seems like he had about 10 lobs today But just throw it out anywhere for this guy into outer space Hes going to go up and get it and just a workmanslike attitude Hes going to do what he does defensively Hes going to be around the rim Hes going to be active And again music throw it up anywhere to this guy Hes going to throw it down William Kyle is having a great opener for the Syracuse Orange Hes from the Omaha area Began his college career at South Dakota State Two years there Then last year at UCLA averaged just three points and two rebounds a game only 10 minutes a game and he figures to exceed that by plenty this year for the Orange Very good opening night for William Kyle Careerhigh 14 points Well its interesting Matt Its all about fit and also coaching style right You see a lot of guys who didnt have an impact where they were but then they go transfer to another school and theyre a whole different player Yeah Style of play who youre surrounded by has a lot to do with it Bingmpington will go back to the drawing board on that drive on 81 South on the way home tonight Theyre going to be lamenting turnovers again They still have not solved that problem Yeah its just been tough I mean Syracuse has done a great job with the ball pressure and then when they they are able to get by they have you know two three guys right at the rim waiting for them First career points for Sadiq Whites So now all who have played have scored except Akir Suare and Dry Zephr J not counting JJ Starling was limited just two minutes and change Great communication right there Donnie Freeman I can hear him from here Lily draws another foul Foul on Zephr is his third all in the second half And Matt I think its important right here these last 734 just to continue to play hard Like keep the in intensity going and you dont want to lag off any bit and and going into the next game wondering Oh I could have played a little bit harder Keep the intensity for these last seven minutes Lilys got a little attitude about him too right I mean this is a guy whos done it on the big stage had a four threepointer game last year at a place called the Dean Smith Center for Lasal against North Carolina and snaps the net on both free throws here Well you said he hell be the best player for Bingington this season You figure hell be one of the leaders too you know on and off the floor communicating making sure his guys stay locked in Freeman comfortable with the ball A long way from the basket Little baby step and does get the foul call Fouls on Stefan Snag his first And I think right there for Donnie when youre playing that far away from the rim be assertive Just go sweep get downhill straight line drive Great job playing off the contact drawing the foul This is the stuff they work on in practice every single day close to every hour right These individual moves to the basket protect the ball rip it through drive with authority and you dont have to do much Youre 611 You already have the advantage right there Just go straight line drive and play through the contact Try to keep your balance to get a good looking shot work the easy ones at the line and Freeman gets both Jaden Kelsey freshman gives them a another option as a ball handler behind Quigley Quigley a nice move there Jump stop in the lane but no finish And Zephr looks up floor to Cayenne Quick trigger Lily the rebound He one thing he does not lack and that is confidence I I love it Hes freshman coming in He Hes ready to play 13 boards for Lily on a double double night to open the year A little baby step there No whistle Snag got in too deep with the put back The Orange are threeon two the other way Freeman You can hear the little whistle call with the ball Nice find by Sadique White and its a great luxury to have when you have your 69 forward able to push the ball and then get it to your other 69 forward down low Great pass Great finish by Donnie Orange by 30 and off the quickly miss Its four on two now with Zephr in the lead The drop PASS FOR THE JAM Sydney quite cheering well The Orange are up 32 leaving no doubt in this season opener still with five and a half to play I think just after seeing these guys practice this is kind of what you expected You know the pace of play the pressure defensively Yeah they still have a few things they have to work out but if they compete for 40 minutes play with pace and lock in defensively theyre going to be a tough out Lily gets the roll and another trip to the line Fourth foul on Donnie Freeman So Freeman exits and Kyle comes back And thats what you need to have to compete in the ACC You have to have answers You have to have a backup have to have a constant wave of these types of players not just one or two And and right now the Orange are better rostered for that type of competition Absolutely I mean you see these guys theyre interchangeable theyre versatile theyre athletic You guys got guys who can make decisions shoot the ball make good decisions with it And I mean theyre going to need that come ACC play Its going to be one guy is not going to be hot Its its time for another guy to step up Lily converts and then exits in favor of Zire Beverly And the Orange look to remain hot on the offensive end White has some guard skills Looks over the defense Tough one in the lane and Betsy cant get the roll Trip to the line Jaden Kelsey fouls on Jaden Kelsey Benzys capable a game now Hes a big kid Hes 68 but hes not small right He Hes got a good size body Get in there play with the contact Hell have opportunities at the free throw line this season With Betsy and Beverly an episode of the Golden Girls has broken out laughter Lanch couldnt make it You know what I cant say I used to watch it but my mom did so I guess I I was a part of that The fact that your mom and I have similar laughter taste in television comes as a surprise to no one So we can see what what Zephr brings right away And thats a great on the ball defender Great ball pressure right there You got to be strong with the ball against Syracuse You do not want to have loose passes long arms These are the longest defenders the Orange have had in quite some time Zephr skip pass for the lefty three Rebounded on the far side by Jackson Felgy Theyre very comfortable extending the defense there going all the way out to mid court if need be Well you see these 68 69 guys going all the way out to half court That just shows how athletic and how much they can move their feet Five on the shot clock Kyle applying pressure Good move by Snag and Kyle gets the last laugh right at the cup Second shot clock violation of the game by Bingmpington A long arm of the law William Kyle having himself a beautiful Syracuse debut and everybody gets an opportunity at the rim Im the bat boy So they had nine previous winners and then they need one more Im the uh just the extra and somebody has to caddy for all these people so I might as well do that Yeah youre welld deserving and Im thankful for you Matt because you really started me and allowed me to get into this media space So Im just thankful for you creating these opportunities and giving me the reps and um welld deserved Congratulations Speaking of creating opportunities Cayenne Anthony knocks down his first college threepointer 14 for him in his season opening game Love to have you here Eric And uh excited to keep it rolling Were going to have a lot of fun over at New House tomorrow night So thanks to everybody for obliging us and putting up with this nonsense cheering And another foul underneath the basket This is where Shawn Mcdana would make some crack about the referees still blowing their whistle this late in the 30point game Well if I could nitpick and Im and Im going to Im going to nitpick I mean that was Cayenne He was just again he was late He he should have got in front of Lily right there and he would have took that pass away but I mean Syracuse this whole game has been outstanding defensively And then this second half youve seen him step up offensively get down in transition making good decisions making shots If they play like this its gonna be a heck of a year for Syracuse Orange Lily at the line again About Sean on his uh night off from NHL and all the other things hes involved in Comes back to his alma mater hanging out with the director of athletics John Wild Hack over there to be a fly on the wall in that conversation You know it always amazed me what you guys could do the playbyplay Youre doing basketball then you go to football then you go to golf then you go to lacrosse Im like I Im just trying to figure out whos playing today laughter As Donnie Freeman does And to that point theres about one person who does that and its Shawn McDonald Mike Tico up there too Two of the alltime greats Been great to me personally and great to a lot of students that have followed them here Kelsey the southpaw threepointer misses by quite a bit On the leak out is Cayenne again in front of the bench Oh yeah he didnt lick that off the wall Trip to the line here for Anthony drawing the foul How many times have you seen Melo do this Get the defender off balance and at least get to the line Oh he learned this when he was seven years old You know just knowing how to get your defender up in the air how to use your body how to create space Its the little things that make offensive players really really good And Cayenne Anthony has those things at a young age Shes just going to continue to keep getting better Off the mark on the first Well first games for each No comparison but Cayennes going to get a win And Carmelo didnt do that at Madison Square Garden Second kid They went against a pretty good Memphis team that first game in the Garden I can imagine Cayenne having this or Melo having this game up on his phone somewhere even if he is uh working tonight for NBC or wherever he may be and going what slow down little guy right its about halfway home to Melos impressive debut against Memphis at Madison Square Garden lost that game but got on a nice winning streak from there and went 30 and five bank shot on a spin by Lily whos in his bag Now you can see the skill he has the great footwork and hes working both right hand left hand hooks Hes going to be good for Bingington Kyle in deep banks it in Kyle just musling his way through the defense right now 16 points Well he he doesnt do anything that he cant do when he gets the ball around the rim Hes just looking to do one thing and thats go up strong on the pickpocket Whats Donnie got Look out below cheering and applause He doesnt want to show his best dunk in the first game of the year Hes going to work his way in There might be an endgame dunk contest to be had this year between Freeman and Kyle and White Well question is with one minute left are we going to see the only walkon that Syracuse has on their roster My goodness Is that a champ for Noah Labell in the uh audience Reds walking down the bench The student sections getting excited Come on Red You got to let him get one laughter There he is Noah Lell the pride of Faith Heritage Just a compact package of twisted steel adrenaline and horsepower First free throw short for Bryson Wilson See Aaron Wmarmac next to him Maybe a red shirt candidate this year but you dont have to commit to any of that in game one Second free throw is good for Wilson Binghamington next in action Wednesday against RIIT Then Saturday against Niagara Their first mission will be to turn it over less They knew coming in that would be a big factor Freeman had grand intentions there Stripped of the ball going up cheering Matt this is this is really what you wanted to see from Syracuse in the opener Set the tone get confidence get momentum going forward because we talked about early on theyre going to be challenged early going to Vegas Kansas and Houston Tennessee coming back home But you love to see Nate George being aggressive Even up 40 still looking to score the basketball Knocks down his second three of the game Were in the final 30 seconds team cheering The chant is we want Noah applause Theyre getting into it there Well no one represents this bunch here right I mean thats Lets tell what it is Free throw good for Beverly Dont know that its in uh Adrien Autriys thoughts here for the final 22 seconds Second free throw winds up in the arms of William Kyle and the Orange will not have to shoot it again applause and cheering Well Cayenne Anthony started the second half for Syracuse Went on to a very impressive Syracuse debut The ball will be in his hands as this game ends and from start to finish There was no doubt about it The Orange roll Bingington for the sixth time in as many meetings 85 47 Tipple
