They very well could be undefeated in league play now Yeah no kidding A couple of onepoint losses a threepoint loss inside the Atlantic Coast Conference That is Brown And this is Javon Hadley And straight to the basket cant get it to go and the Hokes get it for the first time Ben Hammond normally wears number three Today he is wearing number 11 And hell run the show Thats Bedford He averages 10 They have seven players that average nine points or more This is Abdales Little fade away Hadley will do a little bit of everything He can score He can rebound He can pass This is Conwell Brown His first try back cheering And you knew that he was going to come He saw this dude warming up and he didnt miss anything And again welcome Welcome back Hes missed eight games Louisville fans are happy to have him back Well youre not lying about not missing anything You and I were sitting here watching him I mean he must have made about 18 out of 20 just standing there from right about that spot And thatll be a foul on Louisville Wow Virginia Tech or rather Pat Kelsey feeling like that could have been an offensive foul Welcome back Brown Man heres what well tell you man Players shoot to get hot Shoot to shoot to stay hot Mel Brown comes in was like Im back Knocks down that three man Again what a way to start this game off He averages 16 points five assists three rebounds a game the number two overall high school point guard in the country coming out of Orlando Florida a year ago Tried the alioop to Sandanda Fu and he couldnt get his hands on it Bedford for three Tie up Itll go to Virginia Tech Virginia Tech began the year at 6 and0 They had wins against Providence Colorado State They lost backtoback games to St Marys and VCU under head coach Mike Young 62yearold native of Ratford Virginia But then they ripped off six straight wins three in overtime including that triple overtime thriller against their rival Virginia Cavaliers And then Heartbreak City threepoint loss to Wake onepoint loss to Stanford They had the 48 ft shot by Bloopy Miller in a onepoint loss against SMU Good box out there by F Louisville doing a good job of being able to finish out possessions with that defensive rebound And you know that theyve got multiple guys that can get that ball and then get it to that fast break Take away by Hammond Two on two and Hammond will cross underneath and lefthanded put it in Oh man what a play by Hammond again Hes going to do a good job of being able to get into the guards of Louisville Active hands You saw him come up with that steal and then finishes up with that steal at the break Conwell off the mark They have three guys that can really shoot it from downtown Yeah Conwells going to get up about 12 attempts from behind the arc McNeely is one of those guys Hes open soon as he walks into the arena Sloppy pass there by Hanssbury and Brown Jr off the mark Slow start offensively for its team Nearly three minutes in and a 32 Louisville lead This is his game as you talked about at the beginning Its good defensively Brown did a good job of defending without fouling through up with the right hand and off the glass does not go and hell go to the free throw line Unable to finish his Hanssberry but hell shoot a pair And you see early Hansberry being ultra aggressive I like the fact again we talked about him in open that hes a guy thats going to put the ball on the floor puts a lot of pressure because his ability at that four spot to get downhill Hes a physical player and how he is able to get downhill and draw fouls Hanssbury on his third school He came out of high school was the Maryland High School player of the year three years ago Spent one year at Illinois and then transferred last season to West Virginia where he was a starter for the Mountaineers averaged 10 points and six rebounds per game McNeel and F McNeely and Fu will leave for Virginia Tech cheering One of two from the line Woolly has checked in for the Cardinals cheering 11 Youll often see that that Louisville will put Brown in that post up position at 65 Hes got a smaller Hammond at 511 Try to take advantage of that mismatch but Hammond will hes not going to give anything up easy Great feed good head fake and then a kick out rather than going straight up And its an air ball Very surprised Khalifa did not go ahead and try and score right under the basket Heres what Im going to tell you As a guy that that breaks the paint in Brown I set you up big fella You got to go up and put that one up because again the next time I penetrate you want the defense to stay at home so I can give me an easy bucket That was a missed opportunity right there for Rubville 33 game nearly four minutes into this one Smaller crowd today because of the threat of severe snow much like a lot in the country today applause Woolly got bumped and hell go to the free throw line to shoot a couple So Mike Brown theyve been waiting going all the way back to when he was injured against Memphis in the middle of December wondering when he would be back Well welcome back Both of these coaches have been honored as Atlantic Coast Conference coaches of the year Neither one of these schools has won an NCAA tournament game in quite some time for Virginia Tech 2019 Pat Kelsey had to basically rebuild And you made the comment This is a great brand in college basketball When Louisville is good its good for the sport and theyre good again And since hes been here he has reinvigorated this program because again for this Louisville Cardinal fan base its almost like a professional team here It is great because you can see it And even a day where the weather is not expected to be his best this is a really good crowd because they show up to support this this Louisville Cardinal team Yes they do Woolly for the second try and he gets a favorable bounce and that will put the Cardinals back in front by one Woolly starting to really play well Get more and more playing time with Brown out Hes been in double figures six of the last nine games Shot clock at 10 Hammond will let it fly Bang for three by Ben Hammond A nice shot by Hammond Realized they had nowhere to go Louisville cut off that first off on that post off to Hsbury One of the things that theyve got to knock down some threes if theyre going to get this victory today Virginia Tech basketball playing a scrappy defense by Virginia Tech Again you understand coming in this game Louisville leads the leads the conference and made threes They understand that theyve got to blow up and force them off the drive And you see great defense a hustle play Thats going to be one of these things today because Beford is with his length and athleticism can do a good job of pressuring the threepoint shoots from Louisville cheering For a guy 69 Abdales handles a ball a lot and he can shoot They go the lob underneath Great body control but unable to finish was Low and good defense by Fruit Was able to challenge Low and not allowed him to get that in Lock up with the defense Rebound Thats way downtown from McNeely Get ready to say I thought hes going to try it again former Virginia Cavaliier the last three seasons was an excellent player at UVA and he knocks it down and Bford did a good music job that first time of stay with McNeely but you know this is a guy thats got the neon light hes going to continue to put it up doesnt need much time to get that one off again missed the first one and now to go get two for a Cow Low for three Thats not his game Its not Good job by Louisville Big guys down there to sit down and smother Hanssbury How about that little hesitation by Kobe Rogers Rogers with a nice little hazy to be able to freeze a defender to get that shot off Watch Rogers right there A little bit of a hesby with the blowby Gets there just in enough time to get that on the glass You again you know that this Louisville team is going to want to play with pace Starting to amp it up a little bit McNeely thought he was coming out He went over to the bench area and was told by Pat Kelsey No youre still in Rogers leaves He was like Man you coming in I just You just hit your last three bro I need you to stay on the floor N I got time for you Louisville up three six and a half minutes into this opening half from the Young Center in downtown Louisville And theres a Cardinal takeaway twoon one Woolly around rejected by Abdales and a take away by Bedford Two on two going the other way and Bedford going to pull it out and a nice little head fake there but couldnt get the floater to go And heres the thing that even though Virginia Tech has not get him to go I like the fact that they were able to put a lot of pressure on that basket and get to the rim You see what could have been which what is actually a turnover by Brown miscommunication And if youre Brown I think youre saying Why wasnt he cutting to the basket to begin with I need my big man to cover But heres the thing is that you see watch F Dallas We talked about him go above the rim for that block And this is what this Virginia Tech team will do Theyre going to play hard on defense Theyre going to get back in transition You see that Louisville has not been able to get those traditional threes off Now for them theyve got to be able to finish around the rim So far the bigs from Louisville doing a great job of being able to lock up the paint Neither team shooting it well Louisville just three of 11 Virginia Tech two of 11 Shot clock at 10 Abdales Great defense right there by Fu And good defense by Fu being able to guard without fouling Staying vertical Brown will let it fly in and out Not a lot of second chance opportunities for Louisville early on in this one Yeah Virginia Tech is doing a good job of defending and also locking up that possession with the defensive rebound sending five guys to the defensive glass Foul underneath going to go against Fuard 13 Thats his first flag on Christian Gerak freshman from Charles Town West Virginia Not Charleston Charles Town West Virginia Grew up in Germany So many more foreignb born players all over basketball Pro game we know that but now in a college game and especially it seems like here in the Atlantic Coast Conference Well heres the thing is that when you look at how global this game is you know its so developed over in Europe because you have so many different players that get a chance to play and now its opened it up with this NIL to the fact where you can make it good really fast and ultra competitive because if you got support where you can put in those funds and allows you to be able to bring in some topnotch talent Great spin move and then he lost his footing and I think Hadley saying no he slipped I didnt push him But the foul is against Javon Hadley Pat Kelsey wondering the same thing Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State The Young Center Were talking about the international player for so many teams around the Atlantic Coast Conference Three foreignb born players on this Virginia Tech roster Oh and you look at the level of talent that they are able to bring in And I think thats what it is is that youve got certain scouts that are going to go over and theyre going to scout the European leagues And then when you can get guys like that that have the skill sets that the Virginia Tech guys because you look at Abdales hes 69 Hes got point guardlike skills and hes super athletic for that size And as if on Q Coach Oliver And heres the thing I like that his ability to be able to finish at the rim A guy that does good as far as being able to p to penetrate Love him And Mike White you young youve got to be happy with his ability to get to the rack Yeah he is really athletic for a guy that goes 69 215 lbs Yep Virginia Tech has done a good job as far as being able to stifle the offense from Louisville Already forcing them into five turnovers Not something that Pat Kelseys team traditionally does by Gillis Zagurus comes in off the bench misses a layup and again to the basket Offensive rebound looking for a foul It was Virginia Tech It wasnt called And I mean to tell you Hanssberry is some kind of upset Nice catch under there by Hadley to lay it in And nice pass by Conwell Like again we talked about for Louisville Whoever gets that rebound is able to come up with it You saw Hadley get ahead Great pass and finished by Hadley Step back three Bang right there by Jaylen Bedford Bedford did a good job realizing that Hadley was there playing him for the drive and was able to get a little separation knocked down that three Thatll tie the game at 11 So both of these rosters have virtually been completely overhauled from a year ago the whistle away from the ball and that is going to be his first on Zuberus and see Zurus he has to stay still on that screen that last time got caught moving was coming over got wide open Virginia Tech has done a great job of being able to chase the threepoint shooters off of the threepoint line understand it again theyre going to have a lot of their offense from that three and trying to play with pace hammond to the basket couldnt get the left hand to go and here comes Louisville the other way Brown to the basket and lay it in And that last time Brown Jr was able to freeze Abdales again We talked about with the pace get the ball up Brown is at 65 athletic and get to the cup and finish Louisville 13 Virginia Tech 11 Just past the midway point of this opening half from the Young Center in downtown Louisville Kentucky have Dallas for three and I mean didnt even catch iron and I think theyre going to stop The shot clock should not have reset to 20 because it did not hit the rim and it did He didnt even hit the side of the backboard I mean man watch this THAT WAS A FAR screaming TO THE RIGHT THERE YEAH not even the side of the bar Wide rights Okay theyre going to put five seconds it looks like on the shot clock Virginia Tech will inbound the ball over by the Louisville bench We knew coming into this game with Virginia Tech sitting at 4 and three and also Louisville at 3 and three This is going to be a really competitive game I like the fact that both teams are playing with base You see theres a little bit of a war of attrition down in the paint but the big men from both teams Virginia Tech has got to get a couple of shots to go but I like the fact theyre able to probe that paint to get what they want Virginia Tech even with the time out on the floor to check it and tell everybody they were res setting the shot clock did not even know it And if youre hamming you got to understand this is a veteran point guard You got to understand how much time you have If anything you get the ball and you put the your head down and you try to make a play thats one of those turnovers that you can ill especially on the road replacing number 32 Well Mike Young is just an outstanding coach You know for many many years 17 of them he was at Wford before coming to Virginia Tech 7 years ago Been to a couple of NCAA tournaments The last coming in the 22 March Madness Look at Brown Great ball movement And heres the thing is that the breakdown by Brown was able to create that shot because when he does he gets down there and then he forces the help You get the ball out pass a good shot for a better shot cheering So now a fivepoint lead for the Cardinals Way out and he can shoot In fact hes named Shoot And shoot is one of those guys again he doesnt need a lot of time too Great penetration You allowed him to be able to get a wide open shot Knocks that one down Thats a former Duke Blueevil Was a top 50 high school recruit in the country Spent two years with Duke in his second year now with Virginia Tech Nice move to the basket by the South Paul Conwell And Conwell known for being a threepoint shooter Can put the ball down on the on the floor Like the fact that he was going to play cheering through contact was asking for an and one Lead at four Shoot again this time short and Fru with a rebound Lays it off to Brown Jr Conwell feeling it You can just tell hes hit a couple of baskets here and he is Louisvilles leading scoreer at 20 per game Tom Im going to tell you man when you got a dude like Muel Brown that can go ahead and get you a a bucket he makes it easy for everybody else Louisville up early by four this team to another level We talked about his playmaking outside of the scoring as well Well you could tell that uh the Conwell is feeling it That one was just off the mark Thats what we call giving yourself a chance This is a guy that when Mike Brown Jr was out was covering this team offensively You see that he comes up a little bit short averaging about 20 points a game in his absence still hovers through the season about 19 a game So that looked like a crazy pass map dollar to to to Lal but Lwal has a 49 in vertical So when you got a dude that jumps like 50 in in the air you throw it anywhere around the rim and hope he can go get it Problem is he was coming down as the ball was going up Cromwell coming off the screen Tried to lay it off to Fu and a takeaway again for the Hokes And he just did it a minute ago Jaylen Bedford does it again from three And Bedford is one of those guys that can get to the cup And I like the fact that when hes got the ball you can go and get a bucket Does a good job of getting that little separation to knock down that three ball Nice back door feed and rejected cheering Virginia Tech doing a great job of being able to guard their yard and dont you dont see a lot of blowbyss in this game and then theyre able to finish Theyve got shot blockers and then again trying to get out in transition Louisville doing a good job getting back Dallas a little strong on the fadeaway Louisville with the ball leading by one 620 to go until halftime again Nice cut to the basket and a nice bounce pass for the big fella Yeah good pass by Khalif for the Rogerville in the back cut Virginia Tech is doing a great job on McNeely and and Conwell on being able to face guard them and not allowing them to come out and come off of those threes Louisville being really patient Get that back door cut Oh Oh boy Had bad intentions and just couldnt finish it And Conwell leaves a five on four Khalifa he can shoot and a little strong And a foul underneath against Virginia Tech Thatll be on Hammond For Hammond thats his second now with 543 to go until halftime Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Back end of our double header It was tight for a while in Durham and then the Blue Devils rolled over Wake Forest 9069 The final big story in the ACC today North Carolina roars back from a 16point deficit to shock Virginia in Charlottesville Carolinas largest road comeback in 12 years And Hubert Daviss program they need that They dropped two on the west coast of Stanford and Cal Huge win for them Like I say right around this January time as you get to the end of the month youll see a lot of jockeying for a lot of teams A log jam a lot of teams hovering around three and three in the conference Dont be surprised Fu has a beautiful music stroke Hes only attempted five of those all year long but when you watch him in warmup hes got a nice stroke And heres the thing when you got big guys like that that can knock down the three youre going to go to lobby coach and say Coach did you see my stroke baby I need more plays to get me wide open and a takeaway but a foul That was after the takeaway And if youre Virginia Tech you cannot afford these these type of turnovers This pace of the game right now it favors you right now You talk about a little under 5 minutes left to go Louisvilles only got 23 points This is a team that averages about 88 points They want a track meet They want to get up and down Right now what you want to do is you want to grind this out You have to value the basketball The Cardinals began the year at 70 including a big win over instate rival Kentucky Then they lost at Arkansas by nine but came back with a win against Indiana They lost at Tennessee He won a couple of games in a row but it was a game against Memphis where Brown got hurt What a block by La Wall on that weak side Oh boy Shoot Shoot Cant believe that was called and that is his third personal already Tom we talk about this defense from from Virginia Tech Watch Lal comes over Hadley thought he had an easy layup He comes over We talk about that vertical And one of the things that Virginia Tech has been able to do to keep this game music close even though they havent shot the ball well is their halfcourt defense has been really really good Isaiah Pasha checks in for the first time Sophomore out of Harrisburg Virginia Conwell In and out And the rebound to Hammond is playing with two fouls This guy gets hot Look out And hes been feeling it Hes the guy thats really been really carrying the offense from Virginia Tech Chant Tech did a good job of getting to that third option Allow Bedford to be able to get that little runner Conwell thought about it Trapped Nice bounce pass and a foul from behind against Luau That was another one So a timeout on the floor 354 until halftime and the Cardinals in front of the Hokes 239 Im the guy sitting next to your girl on a kiss can this game just got a lot They wont get up and down and they have it where theyre putting a lot of pressure already 10 of their 23 points in the paint And how they do that is they try to come out Anybody that gets that rebound youre out and running You want to keep your head up and advance that ball And when you got your best player and Mike Jun Brown Jr helping you out It makes it a lot easier for guys to eat and then to get going early And you see season 15 seconds per possession Its the second fastest in the conference Thats Yeah And we mentioned that this starting lineup that theyve gone back to Louisville Brown Hadley Conwell McNeely and Fu 7 and one Their only loss was the game against Arkansas Theyve only lost one time with Brown Four and four without him Talked to Pat Kelsey before the game today He said Look I dont know how long he can go Hes going to be a little bit winded He just came back to practice this week Well and you could tell by the way hes playing You dont seem like hes at any type of setback right now And and going back to this Louisville team you know right now 24 points but just a little bit under four minutes Like I said this pace really favors Virginia Tech We talked about this is a team thats number one in the conference and how they defend the three and so theyve done a good job of being able to limit Louisville on those wide open threes and theyve done a good job of being able to lock up possessions and get the defensive rebound Its a rare miss early on in this one for Bedford McNeely going to let it fly in and out and Fu rips it out of there after Lal had a hand on it Conwell drains a three and you know the best time to shoot a three is on the offensive rebound You saw F do a good job of getting into Conwell and you know Conwell does not need much time to get that baby up Conwell just came about uh roughly a 100 miles south from Cincinnati where he started Xavier and all Big East performer a year ago and then a push underneath cheering I think theyre going to get Woolly his first 16 So theyve done a nice job in this game on Hanssberry His only point came from the free throw line Well and you know that hes one of those guys that wants to put his head down and try to get to the basket And I think that the bigs from Louisville have done a good job of being able to put up a wall around him and they have not allowed him to get easy looks And then what theyre doing theyre sealing him and not allowing him to get the offensive aboard as well Well theyre mismatched somewhere and theyre trying to find him against a smaller defender and still cant get a field goal to fall He is Virginia Techs leading scorer Oh man good block by Lal came out of nowhere Talk about going above with a pogo stick Watch the wall I talked about that 50inch vertical This is what it looks like Tom Renman go ahead and get that out of there man Yeah he is some kind of athlete transfer senior from VCU Averaged 12 points seven rebounds last year Right about that mark this year Abby to THE BASKET AND ITLL FALL Hell head to the free throw line And great move by Hadley And understand that this is one of those guys that comes with his lunch pail Like the fact that with his last time you swing the ball over there freeze a defender with a pump fake and goes right for the chest Absorbs that contact for the oldfashioned threepoint play Heavily wellraveled He started at Nor Eastern went to Indian Hills Community College Colorado a couple of years now his second year of Louisville He started every game for the Cardinals last season music Like to invite you to stick around Halftime presented by Subaru love Its whats makes Subaru Subaru Well get a recap from Tom Wormy and Mike Jaminsky The Gman back on his home turf today at Cameron Indoor Stadium And well tell you about next weekends triple header That and more are all coming up on the Subaru halftime report Going back to Javon Hadley when youre Pat Kelsey and you look like the type of douche that you want to have in your program obviously you want dudes that can play defense You want guys that can help you with your pace but Javon Hatley is one of those guys thats going to always play hard He does the dirty work When you look at right now we talked about the fact that Hansberry has not been able to get going Its that matchup and Hadley has been done a good job of being able to stay in front of him match the physicality and then when you need a guy to get up and give you a bucket you see that he makes those little plays the 5050 balls and he comes up and plays big for this team Well hes got four points in a game He averages 11 along with five rebounds Outstanding defender Just a rock solid player And heres where it if youre Virginia Tech this game is starting to get away from you It was close 11 points You got to go ahead and continue the space run your offense You got to get some finishes around the basket right now as you see go for an alley uke for Lal comes up short Oh man Oh man is right cheering That back looks like its doing okay And you know what Brown said He said Dont let the smooth t fool you You allow me to go up man Im kissing the rim to the upper room Well he is much taller than you think he is because hes a point guard but hes 65 and he goes up Yes he does He is some kind of player and only a freshman Offensive rebound Virginia Tech in desperate need of a basket and able to get another offensive rebound and they throw it away Mike Brown Jr said Tom Brenamman you want to know how my back is feeling ITS FEELING QUITE NICE right now I jump off the opposite leg and again you know I can shoot the three but you know what I got a little bounce a little bit to go with it Theyre on a 142 run a 9 nothing run to open up now a 13point lead and thatll be a problem Again we talked about Virginia Tech and how they need to get some buckets Blueville has amped up their defense If you watch them they understand that this Virginia Tech team can shoot the three but theyre not one of the league leaders and so theyre locking down that paint Theyre cutting off their options to penetrate and theyre doing a great job of being able to fly around and Virginia Tech is not getting anything easy We see theyve got guys out there handle the ball They got to find a way to get to a guy like that and hopefully he can get going Beford is that dude that has knocked down the three keeping this game close He has 10 including three threepointers in the game Hes had a weird year He started the season double figures four of six games Thats a force shot there but he got his own rebound Kicks it to Conwell who buries it And if youre Mike Young you got to be upset with your team because you had a force shot by Miguel uh Brown Jr He gets the rebound and gets it out for Conwell for a uncontested three to expand this lead back up to 13 cheering And Conwell watches as Woolly lays it in I mean the Cardinals are rolling 5 seconds left until halftime Posasha to the basket rejected and thats the way the half will come to an end Louisville can get what they want We talked about that run that Louisville had Virginia Techs got to find a way to use defense to manufacture some offense lob into Fu and thats too easy Hey good pass by Hadley on the back side of the defense to get the ball up to Fu and a lot of times for a big guy put it up where he can keep it high and F did a good job of being able to finish the basket Sandanda Fu is a junior from Berlin Germany But a big time find for the East Cardinals Theyll have a another year of eligibility You know you look at the top two scorers on this Virginia Tech team and theyve combined for one point in the game McNeely in and out And Hans Bears got to find a way to get going I thought that he has some really good looks just couldnt finish They got to find a way to get him rolling Good rotation and good hand active hands by Adley The handy averages almost 16 And you got LW who averages 13 and one point combined And thats a push off underneath on Javon Hadley And good job by Hammond are on fronting because you saw him at 511 He realized that he could not play behind Hadley Hadley just had to seal him off And look give him a little bit of a nudge Now it gives the Hookies an opportunity to have a play 17point lead for Louisville Excellent defense by McNeely Not going for that ball fake Short on a threepoint try by Darles We told you Fu got a nice stroke He made one in the first half Not this time Yeah Big fella said that if I make the first one you leave me wide open Guaranteed Im going up Im going to give myself a chance Hansberry working on the smaller McNeeling and thatll be an offensive foul And frustration foul by Hanssbury He talked about the fact that he couldnt get anything to go and then McNeilly does a good job of being able to follow up And then what he did is he lowered that shoulder and came across across the side there And then McNill did a good job of being able to sell it And the Oscar goes to Louisville with seven minutes left to go in the first half had a onepoint lead 187 but then that 19 to5 run the difference in this one and the fact that Georgia Tech or Georgia Tech Im looking at you saying Georgia Tech Virginia Tech um shot almost 40 from threepoint land on twopoint shots Mike Youngs team was three for 20 and because Louisville has done a good job of being able to bottle that paint when you See Brown Jr coming If he had hit that off balance three this place would have exploded Brown Jr cant believe that is a foul They may want to look at this if you get back because watch Bedford He gets ready to go up ill intent I dont see any contact It seemed that he was not expecting maybe unless they got Hadley on the swipe behind Now you can challenge certain calls for but not every call and to the line This is not one of them Bedford hes a cop Shes a cop Together theyre unstoppable CW Hit Series Wild Cards returns all new season 3 Monday 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW And Bedford getting his first two music points of this second half Virginia Techs first two points He has 13 in the game Hes got 13 of the 24 And again we talk about the fact that hes got to find someone to give some offense and a takeaway coming the other way Bedford Virginia Techs going to need a pile of those to get back into this one Bedford working on McNeely Lauo did not score in the first half Hanssbury did not score a field goal in the first half Still doesnt have one Shorten by Hammond on the 12footer Conwell leads the Cardinals with eight WHAT A MOVE OH MY my Brown And and thats what they have been missing is a guy like that because you want to understand why NBA scouts are so high This kid his ability to be able to blow by finish at the rim through contact with the off hand and again a little bit of a heavy catches him flatfooted and says you know what man I am back I know you guys miss me The baby face assassin is in the building Well youre not lying He is now the leader in points with nine trying to make it 10 First trip to the line where hes an 84 free throw shooter And heres one of the things that I really like by Mike Hale Brown Jr is that this is a guy that oozes talent but hes able to get his within the flow Talked about the fact that he averages six uh assists a game and he basically plays within everything and make sure he gets his teammates rolling Fourth threepointer of the game by Jaylen Bedford And Jaylen Bedford said Hey you know what Im going to keep you guys afloat And good And last time better job by Hadley Realize that he had Hammond in there Realize that he had a smaller guy He was able to seal him They do a good job of lead him to the basket Junior T got to understand they cant leave Hammond down there on the island 4427 in favor of Louisville Well rather than going up Lau tried to kick it out Its taken away and a travel by Wooling Pat Kelseys team back at full strength and playing like it Lets go bud Hurry up Come on Im Commonwealth of Kentucky no different than a large chunk of the United States under a major snowstorm watch today and tomorrow They moved up the start time of this game as we did the first game of our double header We were supposed to start here about 345 with a night cap at Duke at 545 A Duke game went off at noon and we moved up to 215 I saw down the road in Lexington they started that game at UK I know Louisville fans dont want to hear about that but laughter they started that game at 1100 this morning That Arctic blast has not been affecting Louisville in this second half But right now for for Virginia Tech uh Pedfords 5 for 12 The rest of the team abysmal 4 for 25 Thats a guy Im surprised they havent used a little bit more today And Dorne he is a monster A freshman from Hamburg Germany They did a good job Got the ball to Durn He was able to dislodge Khalif and then be able to finish at the rim Fouls on number 77 Thats his first and third So heres what I will tell you is that with a little bit more than 15 minutes left to go time for Virginia Tech youre down by 15 Youre going to crawl back in this thing with your defense At times youve seen them be able to really stifle the offense from Louisville And then what you have to do is you got to continue to press that paint make that ball pop But then you want to generate some offense by getting some stops and try to get in transition McNeely off the screen Head fake Thats too good Knocks it down And if you shoot you got to understand that when you got system needed to clear out space for the fall They called the leader in mobile storage Eagle Leasing We supply clean water type Give you that pump fake Let you fly by and then sets his feet and gets that three to go Lived the ACC in threepoint shooting a season ago at Virginia Dorne got his hand on it and last touched it McNeely historically is one of the best shooters from threepoint land in NCAA history And watch this next play And you see Shu come in there Hes like Whoop Excuse me See you in a minute Puts the ball on the deck allows him to line that baby up and gets it to drop And again he he is one of those guys that theyre going to continue to run plays for him and you have to stay glued to his hip Nice screen and McNeely lays it in But it was the pin down action on the opposite side because youre trying to trail him thinking hes going to come for a curl for a three You follow him and he comes right into a lane wide open and gets to the basket Largest lead of the game 20 for the Cardinals And thats the first field goal of the game It comes from downtown by Hanssbury and maybe that will get him going He has not been able to get anything close to the basket Its a wide open three And so sometimes for a guy thats struggling see that basketball get in it may give you a little bit of a heads up to get going Wide open in the corner is shoot and he knocks in a three And five consecutive points by Virginia Tech And I talked about thats what you want Good defensive possessions and then you get something to go right now Cut that lead down to 14 Need another stop Backto back threes but too easy there for Javon Hadley Hadley was able to freeze Hansboro that last time A little bit of a threat to shoot the ball and then gets the quick blow by Closing in on the 13minute mark Dribbled it off his foot Two on two the other way and Kobe Rogers has his third basket First of the second half Thatd be frustrating for Mike Young You do not want him in the middle of trying to get a run as he calls a timeout to try to get his troops together Louisville continues to be able to press press forward Well Mike Youngs team on the ropes on the road at Louisville 1253 to go threepoint shooter wide open to the basket You saw watch the little pin down by Isaac McNeely Normally coming off for a threepoint shot shot realizes that oh Im wide open at the bucket Looks like he wanted to go up there for a little bit of a tip dunk right there And and again weve talked about the fact that this Louisville team and what theyve been able to do to expand this lead with how theyve been able to lock up Virginia Tech That spacing and touching the paint has really created issues for them And when you got guys in Conwell and then Male uh excuse me Brown Jr they have come out and they have blown this team wide open Lead stands at 18 Hooks have the ball Hanssbury into the paint and lefthanded got it to go down Hanssberry realized that he didnt have anybody to pass the ball to and then was oneonone and decided to put the ball on the floor Brown drains a three And if youre a hammer you got to realize that a guy like that you have to make sure that you stay attached to it up defense Youve got to show on that pick You cannot allow him to walk into that three First game back Hes played a lot of minutes here maybe more than we even thought he might He only practiced Monday and Tuesday this week They had an off day and then practice the last two days Yesterday more of a walk through and he has 13 points and Hammond buries a three Good pass by Abdales over to Hammond and again you see Virginia Tech finding some offense Now what you have to do is kind of get some stops Louisville right now has been able to get whatever they wanted Offensive rebound Cant get it Got another one Rejected And look at Hanssberry run the floor and then he missed a layup A missed opportunity You had a chance to cut this lead down to 14 Thats a foul I think away from the ball Thatll be the under 12 timeout Louisville 56 Virginia Tech 40 on CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Eastern 1030 Pacific only on the CW Good block My god You think Louisville tried to run that elevator play for McNeely and then the wall just said Oh no no Im not having that man Set that into third row That was on its way to the Indiana border which of course is right across the river Im looking at where you see that Louisville is up by 16 And for Virginia Tech you got to continue to play your defense You see good pass over to Khalifa and hell shoot a three and knock it in How many times do you see one of the best threepoint shooters in college basketball set up a big sevenfooter for the three and good good set up by McNeel to get Khalifa wide open uncontested Tell you what he can shoot it out there now Hes 17 of 37 from threepoint land on the year Khalifa is So both of these big guys are more than capable of knocking in a three Boy the nightmare that creates for a defense right Abs Absolutely Absolutely They Heres what happens when you get the Dirt Ninskys of the game And then you got big fellas like you know what forget playing in the post man Im hanging out by the three He strikes a post Make sure that he leaves it Gets the follow through And again this is what makes this Louisville team good we talked about when theyve got all their parts and pieces You know earlier in the season they were just steamrolling teams and like I say this Virginia Tech team they have not been able to get the offense going but right now a lot of it is that the fact that you see a good penetration and finish Bedford has really been cooking but Louisville right now theyre just theyre rolling right now Yeah Bedford has 18 They dont have anybody else in double digits in and out closing in on the 10minute mark and its been since it was 1817 at the 7minute mark in the first half its been all Louisville shoot man can he fill it up and and thats a guy that if youre Mike Young you continue to try to get stops you leave him in here because he can catch fire really fast doesnt need much time and he is a flatout shooter you see good penetration again Brown Jr continue to put on a show Like I say weve seen him Hes got good bounce I think the elevation on that jump shot Watch this move right now He gets a little little herky jerky right there Gets that big is like Oops now you see me now you dont Absorbs the call and he was like You know what You can get that one out of the bottom of the net And again absorb the contact And that lets me know right there that when hes able hes like Yeah baby I am feeling it YOU THINK ITS COLD OUTSIDE ITS KIND of spicy up in here Well if he hits this one he hits his season average And again this is his first game back in over two months He was injured a back injury in a bad fall against Memphis They thought you know okay bad fall maybe you know tweaked it Hes going to be all right It just didnt get better And so he did not play He virtually did not practice after initially trying to come back from that back injury And they just said You know what Were shutting him down When hes ready hes ready And man hes ready And and thats the thing is that with a player of his talent and how he impacts this team you want to air on the side of caution And what you do is that you allow him to be able to take his time This is still a relatively good team without him You talked about the fact that they were four and four Theyre three and three in the conference You got plenty of time You get him back and make sure that hes healthy That takes this team to a totally different level Not so much in the conference but also nationally And when you look at the teams they lost to I mean look they got beaten triple over or they lost to Duke They lost to Virginia Those are two of the top teams in the conference There are others but I mean theyre two of the top teams in the ACC this year So its not like theyre losing to you know maybe some of the bottom feeders so far And the other loss was on the road at Stanford Thats proven that thats a tough place to play especially when theyre at home How about this game by Jaylen Bedford Bedford said You know what We still got plenty of time and his ability to score and knock down that three Theyre still hovering right there in striking distance right there at 14 Its going to be an offensive foul Its going to be against I believe they got Sando And watch this player again by Virginia Tech You you you occupy the defense Before realizes that what hell do is freeze you right there Knocks down that three Virginia Techs got an opportunity He get a bucket right now He going to make this thing interesting Trail 62 to 48 and a force shot That was actually a pass to the Wow Hes got a score down there with his jumping ability but great defense And they call a foul on Hadley Looked like pretty good D but maybe got him on the arm on the way up And I thought it was a while As well as you shoot the ball you just got to go ahead and go straight up Hadley does a good job right there And then you see he probably had he swipes at the ball there and maybe they caught him on the swipe because I didnt think it would challenge much of a foul Now Virginia Tech you got opportunity now to cut this game down to 12 if you make both free throws cheering Nope Your favorite board games are now your favorite game shows All new seasons of Trivial Pursuit hosted by Lavar Burton Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson On now every Thursday 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW Low misses them both with a clock stopped and then a foul will be whistled against Bedford going for the rebound What does your scrabble game look like I bet you not good No thats surprising I imagine that man You probably got some really good words Not good at the most of the words I use You cant PLAY WITH YOUR KIDS UNFORTUNATELY laughter That would be you Youre the engineering guy What are you talking about Hey my Scrabble game is quite nice man Hey man Its really competitive in Oliver household with Scrabble man Is that right Yeah I got a teenager man and sometimes you know shes trying to hit me with these words and shes like This is a word this out because we we play Scrabble with English and Italian and so with Italian words Thats right Thats right Italian words man You met your bride when you were playing overseas I did They double team me Oliver House can be really competitive and stabbed Now that would be fun playing it both in English and in Italian Thats good stuff You take a look at you know Virginia Tech offensively clearly UH THE THREEPOINT shot has been there today all day Its everything else and a lot of we talked music about the fact that theyve got to find a way to manufacture points and theyve done a good job with doing that because again music Bedford has been one of those guys thats been that bright spot offensively for them but youre talking about right now youre down 14 and youre still talking under nine point nine minutes in this game you string string together a couple of stops and theyve got guys that can really score you just need someone else outside of Bedford to give you some offense imperative that you get these stops right now for this offense for Louisville well theyre going to put it in the hands of Mike El Brown His first game back in two months he has 16 points Hadley got bumped by LW and I think thats a 17 foul So yes the rest of the way itll be the one and one for now When we get to 10 of course we go into the double bonus And if youre wow you cannot allow your frustrating frustration from not having a really good offensive day kind of impact you overall You have to make some really good plays defensively on Hadley defend without fouling Im going to go by Havly Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Just another solid quietly solid game by Javon Hadley Brian was talking about him earlier Hes got 11 points in the game And hes your do everything kind of Every team needs a guy like that thats going to play defense thats going to be able to put the ball on the floor thats going to get rebounds thats going to be your leader the guy thats going to ignite the team and and get stops And he has been that team for Pat Kelseys last two years Well hes right on his season averages with eight minutes to go 11 points five rebounds Shot clock down to seven Hammond in the land of the Giants lays it off to La Man can he elevate first basket though And great steal by La And I like the fact that with his athletic how high he goes up you get a ceiling you just go straight up Nobody is getting that shot Well lets see if Virginia Tech can now at the 8minute mark Get a little bit closer Trailing by 14 Not over yet We got a game now All of a sudden creeping closer after the three by Hansberry Virginia Tech again and theyre staying disciplined to their defense right now Youre getting a chance to make this thing interesting Another turnover by Louisville Time is out You see big guys want to get out and shoot And we talked about the fact that this Virginia Tech team needed somebody to get scoring You pass up a good shot for a better shot and your man Hanssbury lines it up and says Get it out the bottom of the net This lead is down to 11 Single digit margin Louisville led 2719 with three minutes left in the first half But now this flurry of threes by Virginia Tech has the Hokes within 11 And you and I talked about the fact that one of the ways for them to get back in the game was to get some music stops and make some shots Theyve come in the second half and they have been lighting it up That first half they struggled but in the second half seven for eight from behind the arc music You and I talked about Jaylen Beford being able to carry this team until someone joined in but guess what his teammates kind of woke up and now what youve gotten music is that youre only down by 11 with an opportunity now to cut further into that lead music Fullourt pressure for the first time weve seen it from Louisville today But now theyll just drop back after they put it in the hands of Hammond And heres what I will tell you is that Hammonds done a good job with that double pick and roll of being able to probe the paint and enforce that help And theyve done a good job of being able to move the Louisville defense and pass up good shots for better shots Another three and another made three and all of a sudden here come the Hokes Do you remember in one time out Hansberry was over and got a scolding from Mike Young I dont curious what he said to him because hes got you see through come in cheering to be able to play through the contact and kind of offset that run by Virginia Tech That was a much needed bucket for the Cardinals stretching the lead back to 10 Hey we talked about Hansurn the fact that he was standing He was like I cant get anything inside Let me drift outside and get the three ball going And then when you get the big fella comes through gets that ball handles it well plays through and Lal cannot stop from fouling him Ru had a good afternoon as well for Louisville Yeah hes a nice player cheering To a three from a line is through And after the three they get a old school threepoint play FU has nine points and nine rebounds And you you see I like the play though because again you go back to that double pick and roll Big fella runs Oh and Low rejects it into the stands What a great look that was by Brown A and you see Pat Kelsey over there asking for a foul but watch the pass ahead by Brown And you see F goes up and then Low was like nah not at all And you see watch this See if theres any contact Think there might be Yeah a little bit And you hear that faithful that looked like some collision we saw last Monday night in the national championship game Have Kelsey over there upset but again youre Mike Young This is the type of response that you want from your team right now Try to come underneath on the other side and cheering a foul though against Tech I think theyre going to count on goending Ah okay On that shot from Fu Maybe Lal went up and touched it once he hits the backboard Mike Youngs over there talking to his staff Hes not convinced Watch right here and FR is able to position himself gets that ball on the backboard and then going wild slaps that backboard But Im going to tell you that that little double pick and roll action that theyve been running I would continue to run that until Louisville stops them So now the lead is at 13 Oh my gosh what a game for Jaylen Bedford He has 24 points in this game It has been his ability to knock down that three that last one That almost by the logo cut this lead down to 10 I was talking earlier early in the season Four of his first six games he goes for double as Brown answers at the other end And this is where hes a gamer This is the guy that you want when you want it You need a bucket Put it in your best players hands Weve talked about Mel Junior Brown Jr and his ability to go and rise to the moment He has 12 points in the second half 19 in the game to lead Louisville cheering Its hard to believe Bedford went seven straight games this year without getting into double figures the way hes played tonight cheering Caught a break there Should have been a turnover Hammond had to fire it up with a shot clock at one Good defensive possession by Luggo not allowing Virginia Tech to get downhill and force them into that contested shot Conwell has not scored here in the second half but its been the Michael Brown Jr and Sandanda Fu story No sooner do we say it That one up You know what ON YOUR WAY HOME YOU STOP AND GET YOUR A LOT You just call that one right up Doubt it right up for Conwell comes off that pin down opportunity to get a fourpoint play Well you know he knew he hadnt scored Well and watch this been there Fruit comes down and then the last thing you want to do is get underneath You see Hammond underneath and then Conwell knocks down that threepoint shot And that was that was a momentum shifter for them because Virginia Tech what you saw is that that momentum was starting to shift in their way Conwell comes up knocks down his three and opportunity for a fourpoint play Yeah you you feel like theyve sort of survived the storm Now theres still 511 left A lot of things can happen but they survived that run They did because Virginia Tech had gotten this thing down to 10 points GC Conwell come out and you change one threepoint sniper for another McNeely comes in Conwell will leave and McNeely right back in there Virginia Tech trailing by 17 They want to get the ball in a little while Hadley do did a good job of denying that pass and Hammond rattles in a three And man how about Virginia Tech in this second half Tom and how they have been able to get that three ball going They definitely have used this as a weapon to keep this game within striking distance Yeah 10 of 14 in the second half Theyve hit 15 threepointers in this game Whens the last time you saw a team hit 15 threes and be down by 14 points Well heres the thing is that their ability to knock down and see someone lost their shoe right there Looks like that was Magne Brown has played a lot of minutes in this game for a guy that has not played in a real game since he was injured against Memphis on the 13th of December Well that goes to show is that probably Pat Kelsey and his coaching staff wanted to make sure that he was able to come out here without minute restrictions without any type of hesitation And again he has hes not shown any type of ill effect because you watch his lift his ability to play through some contact and finishing at the rim He doesnt look like hes having any kind of setbacks or any type of problems You know its interesting Were talking with Pat Kelsey Louisville is supposed to travel tomorrow to go to Duke And that game is scheduled right now for Monday night It makes you wonder if theyre going to play that game Pat Kelsey has said theyve already been told by their you know plane company their charter that they dont think theyre getting out of here tomorrow So maybe they have to travel day of game Monday But with a snow expected in a place like say Raleigh thats not used to having a foot of snow well see And and heres the thing is that you never know with delays and being on a plane that thing can impact your legs again And for a team like this that wants to get up and down Interesting to see how things work out And you see Lau coming up short I dont want to see him try to bully Mcneel I like to see him just take one dribble and just jump over and just put that ball in the rim Conwell back in there Steps Man is that smooth That was smooth And what do you Hammond did a good job of playing defense cheering Conwell just stepped back and realized all he needs to do is tee that bad boy up Soft shot by Hammond to get inside realized that Khalifa was not going to come out Was able to get a little bit of a giant killer right there Its been 4242 each team in the second half Lot of offense Remember our halftime score was 3722 and each team with 42 points in this half and still three minutes to go And good defense by Lal that time when handling the penetration was able to stop him from getting all the way to the basket Still down 15 Shute thought he was going to let it fly Hammond will good pass by Chute That three ball has been something ugly for Mike Young and his basketball team Right now you keep getting that three ball going Tom Brenamman And again you have guys like but Louisville is able to sit back and keep it clump said hey I got you Still up by 12 Look ahead to a week from tomorrow as CW womens double header number eight Louisville Watch them before the mens game today Man they are good Heading out west to take on Cal And then Notre Dame led by Hana Hidalgo takes on Perennial Powers Stanford CW womens soups double dip next Sunday 2 Eastern 11 Pacific only on the CW When are we going to be calling your daughters name Hopefully soon man Shout out to my little hooper Hayden Oliver Man she is a sophomore at Campbell Hoscow Shout out to the Lady Spartans Theyve been had a pretty good season Well its pretty good What does that mean Yeah You know what These former athletes you know you guys are very under under Hey man you got to understand with this group this teenagers group I got to keep her modest man Cuz shes going to already tell me that Shes coming after me Shes like Daddy I thought you were nice when youre in high school I might be able to take a run Im like Hey slow your roll Thats right Whats a team record How are they doing Uh you know what I got to think They played last night I dont know how they at they won last night I think they were like 14 and maybe three or something They played in some Christmas tournaments They go out and they they go get it Theyve got a really good coach and Randy Mccclure and theyre one of the top teams in the state Love it Theyre one of they they they check they music go after the smoke I like them I like the way they play Love it Love it And number zero what a return game it has been for Michaelel Brown Jr the freshman out of Orlando Florida We often talk about him and then how he impacts this game Love how hes come in Well he is our progressive insurance player of the game And when you look at how hes been able to hit the ground running you knew it was going to be a special afternoon when he hits his first shot down that three And you see his his statline the 20 points seven of 11 had three threes And I like the fact that not only with the scoring weve talked about him how hes able to impact this game We get his teammates push that pace and you can tell that this team is a totally different team when hes on the floor because he uplifts them Progressive offers 247 protection when you bundle auto home and motorcycles Learn more at progressivecom taken away by Hammond and rejected by Conwell but a foul And man every time you think that this Louisville team is going to blow this thing wide open in this second half youve seen Virginia Tech theyre a scrappy bunch Hammond comes up with that steal tries to challenge Conwell Conwell goes up now still with an opportunity this game with two minutes Weve seen Stranger Things have three points And the fact that this Virginia Tech already a season high 16 threes that three ball has definitely kept them in the game Well you dont need to tell Virginia Tech about how leads can get away I mean they were up four points at SMU 8 seconds left in the game with 8 seconds Up four They had a turnover SMU got a two They missed the front end of two one and ones And then Boopy Miller hit that 48footer a threepointer to win the game They nearly blew a ninepoint lead with one minute left the other night against Syracuse And you and I talked about this you know theyre sitting at four and three as they extend their pressure They could easily be 7 and0 because outside of that they lose one by by a game by one at Stanford Yep And then they have that other loss at weight by three points So you talk about this team going in this game could be really at the top of the the conference at 70 Yep combined three losses or only three losses before today it looks like by a combined five points Oh man thats too good I tell you what I know that Brown is our MVP But this guy right here Fu hes had a double double third time this year He is a Hes a force now He is 13 points 10 rebounds But the play before if you saw him Im going to ask to see that one again because he literally shot clock goes down He dances with the ball breaks the paint and then puts it up there where you big can get it Man has 13 points to go with 10 rebounds Nine of his points have come in the second half And with a minute five left to go Louisville will just slow it down cheering in route to its 14th win of the season But more importantly they get Michael Brown Jr back And theyve only lost one time this year when he was in the lineup That was against Arkansas all the way back in December early December Nail in the coffin Nail in the coffin And when you see again we talked about the hockey assist that last time the pass over to F F gets it over to Hadley for that wide open three Bucket by Gerdak and this will run it down Shot clock is off Final 20 seconds of the game So Michael Brown Jr was injured applause against Memphis back in the middle of December He missed the last eight games where the team went four and four without him He comes back today and they put 85 on the board in an 8571 win over Virginia Tech pen
