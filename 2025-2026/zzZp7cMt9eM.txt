Kell is the leader of this basketball team or Tim Craft Fanta Cababa and Dorm matched up Lee Cassell Doug shows Adam Floyd our officials the Catamounts and the Hokes Fifth all time meeting We are underway in Southwest Virginia Both these teams run some nice halfcourt offense and both teams like to play manto man Quick pass inside Jaylen Bedford gets his hands on it to force the turnover Turnovers the number one concern for Tim Craft coming into this game going up against a Virginia Tech team thats top 10 nationally in protecting the basketball Much improved over last season for coach Mike Young Numbers hes happy with Right partner No question Among the best in the country like you mentioned Dallas draws the foul and he gets thrown to the ground Dallas did not appreciate that Yeah kind of a silly play It didnt look like it was vicious but it was unnecessary for sure and will probably result in shots here cheering Foul on Dumasi who draws the start Yeah just stop right here Yeah that was just un unnecessary Dumasi the transfer from Southern an experienced player Yeah to really he was he was second team all swack and really a nice combo guard can really play anywhere on the perimeter for for Tim Craft who weve mentioned but came from Gardenner Web where he had a lot of success Tim Crafts beaten six power five teams in his career a little bit of balance but right here just let it go and he just pulls on him and uh again unnecessary Ive used it a couple times but thats what it was Im glad that we IDed our officials right at tip off Theyre put to work here early Yeah Lee Cell Adam Flory and Doug Shows After further review we have a dead ball contact technical foul on West Carolina number 22 Virginia Tech will have two free throws and possession of the ball with 20 seconds on the shot clock An unusual way to start this match up No doubt Well and going back to what you said as we talked to Coach Craft what did he mention to us before the game Turnover Here comes foul Yeah Doug Showls good enough to come over and explain There were two fouls on the play Obviously the common foul and then the upgraded foul So Damassie is getting a start takes a seat and Dallas puts the Hulks on the board first Weve seen Dumasi weve seen Pway weve seen a little bit of rotation in that starting five at the guard spot for Western Carolina Yeah still still trying to figure it out And some of that has been injury related too Johnson left hand easy finish Tough matchup there for Western Carolina Ford Stanberry gives up a couple inches and a lot of pounds Tyler Johnson Hes coming off that great game in the win against George Mason Western Carolina fell to USC Upstate last time out Sumaro who has been with coach Tim Craft for quite some time draws a foul Yeah Bedford that time And you have to expect the officials are going to tighten things up right away So uh you have to adjust to that as a player the other player that has a good ma a mismatch if you will or good matchup possibility Uh it doesnt matter who they put on Ammani Hanssbury Hes going to either be too quick or too strong for somebody out there Stanberry known for his shooting ability Drops it off under the basket and another Catamount turnover Yeah two in in two possessions and Tim Craft wont be happy with that We saw the mismatches against George Mason too that uh that the Hokes were able to exploit early and often Quickly why was that such an impressive win for Virginia Tech Well Mason was was just playing such good basketball Came in here very confident Uh big game emotionally for them an instate game that they dont get to play very often Only the third time the two schools had ever met Dorne using his size unable to pull it in in transition Stanberry able to find Sumaro out of the Bronx Elbow jumper in the air and true Yeah theres a veteran player who played for Coach Craft at Gardenner Web went to East Carolina got a medical waiver and had another year left and rejoined Coach Craft can play both guard spots and he knows what coach Craft wants done offensively and defensively Very important player for this team for the Catamounts Dallas Dorne and a whistle and the head coach of the Catamounts Tim Craft Congratulations to him Just won his 200th career game a couple of weeks back Yeah Garden they they were giant killers They they have whims against Clemson Georgia Tech Nebraska Purdue Wake Forest Georgia He is no stranger to playing in these big time atmospheres How about the fact he has scheduled in his head coaching career 48 games against opponents from the ACC SEC Big 12 Pack 12 Big 10 Big East or AAC Yeah And and there are a couple reasons for that Money is one reason for that but but also he really likes to challenge his team and give them the opportunity It helps him in recruiting too You know kids want to play against the best people Early 42 lead for the Hokes A win today would mark the best 11 game start since the 2223 season Contested three Stanberry off the mark Yeah Stanbury is a good shooter Has not been shooting well this season so far Had a risked injury early in the in the fall Long three from Bedford He knocks it down He has struggled a little bit lately too Thats a good sign for Mike Youngs hookies Bedford just two for 18 from behind the threepoint arc the last six games And Western Carolina answers back CJ Highland Yeah hes been a 50 threepoint shooter Just doesnt take a lot of them And thats one place that that they have struggled that that Coach Craft thinks theyll be much better at Corner three Johnson too strong Highland whos been in double figures the last three games Had a good game against USC Upstate Hokes dangerous when they get out Johnson of Dallas TWO STEPS FROM BEHIND THE THREEPOINT ARC DRILLS IT Smokies are so good in transition and that time honestly Western Carolina got back but Odollis has range There goes Hansberry THE RIGHT HAND FLUSH THE CASTLE GUARD LOVES IT TURNOVERS biting the Catamounts again applause How good has Ammani Hanssbury been the last four games Yeah I the first time I saw him in in the summer I thought Wow hes going to be special And it it took a little while to find what his role is but uh he ease a difficult matchup no matter who Virginia Tech plays Stansberry nobody home Another Western Carolina turnover Coach Young fired up over there on the sideline Nice job there Deflection Nobodys going to catch him and nobody should get in his way Hanssberrys coming off a career day in terms of assists A great look right there Six on Saturday against George Mason Right Thats impressive Coach Young after the game said the kid is brilliant He said not smart brilliant Hanssberry and the Hokes out to an early 125 lead in Blackburg Give or take traffic Welcome back to Blackburg Early start for Virginia Tech of Dallas Thats an offensive foul cheering And nice job by Highland that time bodying up stay in between him and the basket And Aldis got a little frustrated cheering Finally ran out of patience there The freshman Donna bounce pass but a whistle first Yeah And it looks like Bedfords second foul And immediately subs come in for Mike Young There comes two guys that he refers to as starters Ben Ham and Jaden Shoots Yeah And and Christian Durac coming in for Antonio Dorne Couple of big freshman Jaden shooting last time out He was feeling it He was on fire He He didnt need much space He didnt need much time And his teammates were finding him And here IS HAMMOND UP AHEAD THE REJECTION from behind from Justin Johnson Yeah nice play by Johnson the Arkansas State transfer They were the Sunb Belt regular season champs while he was there Really nice defensive play Its hard to catch Ben Hammond but he did Here is shoots trying to go off the window Nearly another Catamount turnover Highland meets Christian Gerach HIGH LOW PASS BEAUTIFUL AND THERES Ammani Hanssberry with the lefthanded finish Yeah Again that matchup that we were talking about and a really nice pass by the freshman Gerak Highland lost the handle Hammond has space Open transition triple right side of the rim Johnson a little bit of space leaves the floater short And Tech dangerous in transition So many people who can finish Very unselfish Back and forth Shoots Johnson Uh whistle first on the floor Carolina High percentage offense sometimes is created by good defense Its the block shot the push in transition We mentioned Pokés really share the basketball And this time a little high low look Good act to Hansbury Johnson had the electric dunk on Saturday He got everybody up out of their seat including you partner He may have Hammond Tough shot No problem Hand in his face Playing with so much confidence Played well as a freshman especially toward the end of the year And he has carried that confidence over into his sophomore season And thats going the other way Offensive foul against Western Carolina Yeah this time Marcus Kell with the illegal screen Point of emphasis Weve seen it all year And another turnover going the other way Thats seven first half turnovers for Tim Craft squad Yeah And he he was afraid of that And of course that the big part of that that he was afraid of is the transition At least this one was a dead ball turnover Sincere Jones checking in And there you see those 14 turnovers a game Yeah And theyre on a much higher pace than that last in the SoCon Couple of fouls on both sides Yeah they havent adjusted yet laughter Pway comes in the game immediately picks up a foul Western Carolina has already played 10 in this opening half That way a really talented freshman Hammond left wing three Not that time That way reclassified late so he was a late enroll but what a good pickup for Tim Craft and his staff The kickouts Stanberry Dumasi with 10 to the right block and draws a contact or draws a foul contact from Christian Gerdak Yeah Gak got the ball but down low Got him with the body sending him to the free throw line Little probing and you see the right arm Gak pushing while the left hand got the ball Western Carolina 71 on the year at the line as a team and the first good for Dum Massie and somebody that I think coach Craft and company thinks could really be a big part of this team later in the year Yeah has has a lot of skill can play a native of Paris Paris Franks Have you ever been to Paris Many times you I have not been to Paris Tennessee Paris Texas and Paris France of Dallas Almost chance for a threepoint play Pway picks up his second number Both teams feeling a little bit of foul trouble Bedford has two for the Hulks Meanwhile Pway and Dumasi have two for the Catamounts that way from Worcester Mass Dallas has been a frequent visitor to the free throw line early Mac Im sure its got to be difficult to match up with him with the size he presents Yeah he really hes a nightmare at 69 with his skill set You can see why the NBA folks love him cheering and screaming He can beat you in a lot of different ways He he has hes made everybody on his team a better passer I think he has seven games with five or more assists Kell open three Not that time Offensive rebound Dumasi Stanberry loves the three There he is right on Q There he is Only 27 this year but Coach Grab really likes this kid from long range and thinks hes going to be a big part of things in Southern Conference play His by nine of Dallas active early Gerach cleans up the second chance opportunity Gak has been solid He hadnt had a lot of minutes but when hes been in the game hes done a nice job on both ends Just a freshman Charles Town West Virginia Thrilled to have you on your Thursday night Evan Hughes Mac McCarthy the rest of our outstanding ACC Network team Long rebound Dumasi cheering KELL LEFT BLOCK KURT GOT HIS HAND ON IT AGAIN Sumarro skip pass Nobody home on the left wing applause and cheering Here we go with the defense Get it out of here the freshman says to the preseason Oh so conourt advantage there But uh some of that is the folks that you play on the road too Theyre going from here to the University of Georgia Thats backto back tough matchups with the SEC and the ACC Dorne creates positioning and scores inside Hansbury with another assist You mentioned he had six against George Mason Dumasi has been active early Kell one of the top scorers Stansberry probing Ben Hammond got his hand on the ball and he stepped out on the baseline Yeah it was a nice switch by Virginia Tech and Hammond was at a size disadvantage but he definitely had the advantage in the quickness category and almost came up with another turnover Coach Young said after the game on Saturday I dont like playing without him Referring to Ben Hammond looks like the Energizer Bunny He really does And he has been playing at a high level and particularly since Toby Laauo has been out Stansberry trying to follow his miss Hammond shoot How about a transition three Not that time Thats something that Coach Youngs teams have been doing more and more this season shooting in transition and getting out in transition Nice play there by Dumasi You see why Coach Craft talked about him all day at shoot around shoot corner three right side of the rim and the rebound from Bantacaba Dumasi out to the right side Sumaro guarded by Shu His defense has been good this year Much better Much improved Stansberry off balance Wanted a foul Wont get it cheering Hammond will try the transition triple and drills it Transition is such a good time to shoot though You get wide open looks while the defense is trying to get back Sometimes they flatten out a little bit too much and you get that shot that Hammond just got He might not be a starter but as coach Young said he might be a guy whos finishing games for this Tech team Simaro trying to answer back unable to Theres Hammond Yeah and he he just outquipped a very quick player in tomorrow His go a little too quick that time His active hands back and forth full hot potato Yeah Yeah Neither side was really happy with that exchange but Cater ended up with the ball Three set to check in for coach Craft and Abdai Fan A Cababa goes to the free throw line for the first time today Transfer Its a really nice play See the defense flatten out trying to get back and protect the rim Ben Hammond says I appreciate that Hokey birds are liking it as well Hokey bird cheering cheering These are this weeks ACC Network featured mens basketball matchups The number three Duke Blue Devils host Lipgum on Tuesday at 6 Then at 8 the number music 14 North Carolina Tarheelss host ATSU Coverage of both games will be on ACC Network and the ESPN app Thats 42 on the year Connects on the seconds Pressure from Western Carolina Theyre known for mantoman but theyll mix up their coverages a little Trying trying to change things up a little bit Pick up full court See if they can get a cheap turnover Hanssbury Bedford rise and fire three got knocked down cheering and Western Carolina fouls the jump shooter And you know how I feel about that Just one of the colder rules Kate B the jump shooter You sure fell a threepoint jump shooter Wide open And it was it was accidental incidental still a foul And Lee Cassell is going to the monitor Yeah maybe check to see that it was a three but at first glance it surely looked like a three I dont know what else he could be looking at Oh verify the shooter though Okay So it was Johnson who was fouled and it is a one and one And it drops up on I was totally confused I thought Bedford there was found on the threepoint shot but yeah Yeah we were looking at a whole another thing I was lost Sorry partner Supposed to be keeping up with this stuff Theres Johnson 71 on the year Having a really good sophomore season It must have been a foul off the ball before the threepoint shot You got it straight now Certainly was 2612 Hogs 8 and a half minutes first half inside of Castle Coliseum Sumarro kick OUT AND THERES TYLER JOHNSON DEFENSE TO OFFENSE AND HE LAYS IN THE LEFT HAND Good play Tech is struggling a little bit with those ball screens but theyre just bigger and stronger and theyve been able to get by even when they even when they switch it and its big on little or little on big Theres Fisher Brown who can really shoot the basketball Mac I think we talk a lot about Toby Lau not being on the floor what it means offensively What does it mean defensively for Virginia Tech Well shot blocking and rebound that thats two big things and hes among the among the leagues best at that He was number five in the ACC when he went out and blocked shots and number two in the ACC in rebounding Hanssbury takes a dribble Dorne strong rebound strong finish Dorne is getting better and better He and Gach both threes have been a big part of the strategy for Virginia Tech Theres the steel We talking about defense creating offense Tributes in so many ways He can you know he can block a shot at 69 and just has the thing that amazes me is his vision and his passing Hes capable of big night scoring We saw that with 33 against Providence Out of the timeout tomorrow late whistle Ben Hammond top five in the ACC in steals He was looking for another there Yeah he he had him sized up but uh Samaro really has done a nice job of attacking on the dribble Six fouls now on Virginia Tech There you see a little bit too much body right there in Kell A kick out Kells been held scoreless Averaging Hes done a nice job against him Left wing three Gets the friendly bounce does CJ Highland Yeah hes made a couple already out of Loganville Georgia He went from November 13th to December 2nd without playing Its great to have him back on the floor Yeah hes started a couple but he missed three games and uh hes valuable Hes hes just hes strong in the back court even though hes not real tall Hansberry patient GOES UP AND GOES TO THE LINE Ammani Hanssberry cool calm collected I love when a guy is patient in the post and remembers be the second man off the floor Let that other guy get up in the air Wait wait wait till he gets up in the air Now youre at the advantage So hard for that defender You want to block that shot M Last year Ammani Hanssbury in West Virginia he averaged just under 10 points per game under seven rebounds per game This year 16 boards eight rebounds The biggest difference in his game is what Well I I think confidence is part of it but also just the way hes been used And uh oh my goodness theres a silly foul again cheering with two fouls in about 5 seconds But but uh I think the way that Mike Young finds uh to to utilize people in their off in his offense and and Hansbury has got such a skill level You know he can beat you off the dribble He can shoot the three Weve seen him post up run the floor got shoved in the chest and gets to go to the free throw line His today five for nine What a womens basketball matchup we have for you Sunday afternoon right here on ACC Network in the ESPN app India Navar leads music number 12 North Carolinas balanced attack where they host Laura Seagler and number 22 music Louisville at Fort Eastern at Carmichael Arena That is the house that Michael Jordan built Yeah Jeff Walls and Courtney Bangart going against each other Sum Marorrow knocked down multiple threes his last four games Again as you mentioned off the dribble Mack hes doing a lot of good things Yeah he he hesitates and he you know if he gets the switch hes hes awfully quick and if theres some hesitation about whether to switch or try to fight over he hes taken advantage of that Hes done a nice job You You can see why coach Craft was glad to have him back after coaching him for a few years at Gardener Web So cool multiple guard web Then he goes Ill go to East Carolina as you mentioned earlier and then goes back in the portal and says Let me go back to Coach Craft Cool story Got the medical waiver Thats the new age college athletics A lot of people getting waivers for a lot of different reasons I think Diego Pavia may play three more years I think theyll figure it out You know he wants to keep playing too And there goes Stanberry So backcourt violation Mac weve talked about the turnovers a lot Thats number 10 for Western Carolina Is that what Virginia Techs doing Is that a little bit of Western Carolina not operating on all cylinders offensively What have you seen Its a little both but Virginia Tech is theyre improving so much on the defensive end Theyre theyre physical and and just stay after it of Dallas hesitated for a moment Not that time SUMARRO HAS IT SWIPE BY ODALES The lob for Hanssberry Takes his time and the easy layin Of Dallas always finds the right person to give the ball to after a nice deal on the other end Highland drops off Fantaaba the 7 foot sophomore center Good job by Tyler Johnson using that length staying away Deep three from Stanberry off the bottom of the backboard but the second effort from Taan Smith the freshman out of Raleigh He delivers Yeah big strong freshman getting a few more minutes each game Theres a nice backside rebound Better put a body on him of Dallas ran into two defenders Sumarro all the way to the rim Last touch by Virginia Tech Yeah it looked like another turnover but this one Virginia Tech This is nice right here Flip it away And in transition he knew exactly where he was going with that ball music Hansbury talking about all the different ways he can score and why hes averaging so many points There you see six steals tonight nearing their season average Baseline jumper is true Yeah Justin Johnson really nice play right there 68 big long wing Very athletic This teams got a lot of depth for Tim Craft Got to clean up those turnovers Got to start shooting the three ball a little better Shooting under 30 as a team Bedford knocked down an early three Good defensive possession by West Western until that Catamounts trailed by as many as 17 down 13 Feels like an important 4 and 12 minute stretch for Tim Crafts bunch Yeah they need to get a little something positive going into the halftime Theyre right in that danger zone Fanta the high low pass to Pway about the block shot by Ben Hammond Steals blocks jumpers The sophomore doing a little bit of everything He wants the OFFENSIVE END HES GOT IT WITH THE RIGHT ELBOW JAY make the defensive play score on the other end Stansberry trying to create his own shot The Pepperdine transfer Got it back Turns and he is stuffed by Hanssberry Johnson lets a three fly Hes fouled on the close out from Jaylen Bedford Yeah just cant do it Just cant do it His leading by college football playoff Therell be some good matchups I think that one is just a matter of whose quarterback plays better Marcel Reed Carson Beck Well last year so enjoyed the first round matchups being at the the host of the That ought to be a great one Theyve had over 103000 for every game this year Youve got notes on everything basketball football Were thrilled to have you Well get into the NASCAR settlement in the second laughter half 3723 your score Evans Mac McCarthy Mac for our viewers just tuning in what do they need to know about this first half thus far Well I I think Western has done a decent job of running Virginia Tech off the threepoint line They just turned it over too much too much But they have done a nice job on the backboard and as soon as I say theyre doing a good job of running Tech off the threepoint line Jaden Shu gets involved in it They out rebounded Virginia Tech so far and that that was going to be a big part of this game too But 11 turnovers is tough to overcome Virginia Tech has dominated the paint Johnson teardrop front rim and down Boy I like his talent Really like his talent Long athletic You can see why he helped Arkansas State win the Sunb Belt regular season a year ago Hammond Johnson downhill going to the free throw line Jaden Shute got going late in the first half on Saturday Here he is knocking down another three Yeah a little bump screen right there He does not need much space or time Watch this There His defender had to go around that screen Too late And we talked about how his defense has taken strides in addition to his scoring I think coach Young also hit the nail on the head in his postgame press conference on Saturday He literally knocked on Wood for a couple of seconds that hes been healthy which has been a big reason too for his success No question you know he missed his whole year at Duke before he transferred to Virginia Tech And and of course the defense sometimes goes along with the offense When when that shot goes in you have a little more energy on that defensive end Really settling into his role Hammond checks out ADA replaces him Eight different scores tonight for Western Carolina Its Highland off the bench who leads all Catamount scores with six Dumasi Sumero rattles home the triple Really nice He had Odales running at him Mentioned it earlier Sumaro has knocked down multiple threes his last four games Yeah hes third in the Southern Conference in percentage from that Jaden shoots Yeah that time he had no space Had a hand at his face He was off balance too Kind of hanging in the air Kell getting to the rim and the red shirt junior out of Fort Mill South Carolina scores finally gets on the board and thats thats his skill set Surprised it took him that long but give Virginia Tech credit for making him a priority on the defensive end and doing a good job Hi looking for Jaden Shoot Hanssberry can knock down the three Open look Open make Yeah he hadnt taken as many lately but but he certainly has the stroke Its a nice looking shot Shoot this time was the passer instead of the shooter Hulks by 18 Rest of the first half after these messages music music Welcome back to Blackburg where that man Jaden Shu is staying hot from behind the threepoint arc Yeah this time he finds another brush screen by Hansbury and then he returns the favor by drawing two men to him and Hansbury says I got this one out of the use it or lose it timeout from coach Theres a back door cut two hand flush Dustin Johnson Nice play out of the timeout A double high ball screen Confusion on the defense Back cut and Johnsons had a big first half Under 60 seconds Shoot Gets to the rim Shows that he can score under the basket A rare twopointer Largest lead of the game for Virginia Tech Great on ball defense there Dumasi couldnt get the layup to fall but theyll get it right back Yeah Hokeis done a nice job of taking care of the basketball this half Just their fifth turnover A little above their average here and averaging under nine per game That is a a core value of Mike Youngs program taking care of the rock Yeah last year averaged almost 14 turnovers a game Big improvement to Massie picked up by Johnson Bounce pass left block the sevenfooter Fantaaba Yeah they they have found a little success with that ball screen action and trying to make Virginia Tech make up their mount Are you going to switch Are you going to double it or you going to you know try to fight over Shoots reverses HANSSBERRY WITH TWO PUTS IT IN BEFORE THE HORN and lets the crowd know that hes loving it Really nice play They were going to do everything they could to take shoot out of that situation but Hansbury found it Found themselves wide open as the clock runs down Top score for Western Carolina held to just four points in 15 minutes of action Yeah And got those late in the half And like we talked about they did heat up a little bit offensively but Virginia Tech when you score three for two you gain points Its really good math there my friend Its about as good as I could do laughter right there with you Hansberry help brought Dallas on the kick out Doesnt get the friendly bounce Yeah Hansberrys not happy about that That would have been his sixth and tied his careerhigh for assists So thats 11 assists including today over the last two games for Mr Hanssbury The point forward Point forward There you go Tomorrow right hand finger roll pulled down by Hansberry OF DALLAS THE LOB THE LEFT HAND LAYUP FROM JOHNSON Rims out Wow Of Dallas He makes such great decisions Johnsons got to finish that tomorrow We saw him penetrate successfully in the first half Stansbury left wing three Not that time from Julian Sumaro and a foul on top of it Bedfords playing with three fouls Good job by Bedford on the backside getting that rebound Damasses had a couple you know just unusual fouls and that was another one He kind of got a foul that time for sort of getting out of the way Bedford fell down Wrong place wrong time for Damasie Saw some of his talent in that first half Made a couple really nice plays after getting two quick fouls on the first possession Hansbury of Dallas from the logo Yes applause and cheering Got some skills doesnt he Putting it all on display here tonight A little bit of everything for the freshman Western is running two people at Hansbury down low snorts That means somebodys going to be open And that time Tyler Johnson with the nice dribble handoff Little DHO I was going to say that was from NBA range I think thats good from any threepoint line What say you partner Im Im with you On the other end Kell releases and drills the triple Uh he had his feet set catch and shoot And Hansbury got there too late Last year he shot 38 from behind the arc This year at 28 So a little bit down You know with Virginia Tech ties Thats right Both of his parents Hokes Hansbury Dorne tips the ball to himself and uses every bit of his height at 7 ft tall Dors got some real ability and he just adjusting This is a nice job Quick reversal Feet set pulled the trigger Thats why hes preseason all Southern Conference Last year he averaged almost 15 points per game in SoCon play Yeah 16 games in double figures for the Catamounts You got a lot of people in the building who know a thing or two about Southern Conference basketball Youve got Tim Craft Mike Young and M McCarthy Yeah The uh Kell I actually had 31 against my old school Chattanooga who ended up winning the NIT a year ago Thats right And then mo more recently he had 27 points two games ago against High Point Thats a very good basketball team Yeah High Point picked to win their league The Big South 20point Another purple team Spot on Step back to Massie front iron right side of the iron Good job getting back in transition They havent given up many fast break points Coach Craft will be pleased with that Hansberry the bounce pass Stay with Tech is Dorne is helped up to his feet You know Dorne is a big dude When theres contact with Dorne in either direction theres going to be theres going to be a collision Theres a nice bounce pass and a good job defensively of sticking that hand in there and knocking it out of bounds Jayen Bedford Johnson trying to find out Dallas in the post Dallas with big size advantage He wants to use that and he did and he does it perfectly on the turnaround jumper Yeah Darn if you do darn if you dont You your body up against him and he can do that little step back That looked reminiscent of that Providence game back in November Pick your poison Yeah where he had 33 cheering in an overtime win Ke the bounce pass Massie Hanssbury there on the closeout One on THE TIMER THE REJECTION FROM TYLER JOHNSON Ansberry has 14 Bedford unccors the open three and the excellent box out from Dada Yeah didnt catch it in rhythm that time Had to adjust to the pass A lot of coaches say dont shoot a bad pass cheering Hanssberry slips by Dumasi and lays in the right hand layup Little spin move Just going to start using point forward all the time Point forward Well you know Nicole Joic has been tabbed that in the NBA Giannis a little bit Not uncommon cheering Next stoppage to a media timeout Right hand layup You bet The freshman Samuel Dada Yeah nice penetration Set that

defend that Step out again Got a center on it A 6439 lead for the Hokes trying to start nine and two on the year Thanks for hanging out with us on your Thursday night Kell spots up for three and connects Oh nice play by Tim Craft out of the timeout Little dribble handoff Miscommunication by Virginia Tech And theyll say foot on the line even though that had threepoint distance Looked like it My fault And Western Carolina forces a turnover Heres Johnson Arkansas State transfer is fouled on the way up by Johnson and he will shoot free throws when we come back Hokes leading 6441 inside a Castle Coliseum star players Marcus Kell his parents are Hokes and here they are watching their son play at Castle Coliseum Very cool Lots of connections between the two universities and uh great that the the folks can come up there from Fort Mill right outside Charlotte Not a super far drive right As long as traffics okay outside Charlotte Always good to get the Hokes back on campus even when theyre cheering for the other team When we talked to Marcus before the game and asked him if he has any favorite memories he said a Virginia Tech Notre Dame game inside of Lane Stadium Yeah in like 16 or 17 Im not sure what year it was but yeah he got to come to multiple games but that was the that was the one that was most memorable to to him This has got to be mean mean a lot to his family Shoot Hammond surveys with five Hanssberry to the rim Lost it Great defense in hands from Justin Johnson Yeah Johnsons had a really good game And thats a foul on Abdelai Fantacavo Yeah a little aggressive on the box out but you almost have to be or Dornes going to run you up under the goal So he was the one that got called for the foul He transferred in from Denver You know he missed all of nonconference last play last year as a freshman Then he made 16 starts in conference play and transfers to Western Carolina averaging seven points eight rebounds Yeah Number two in the league in re offensive rebounds number 12 in the league in blocks And he shares that time a lot with with Dada that that position those minutes Ive seen a lot of Catamounts on the floor Hansberry open three Miss fired aboard for Western Carolina One of the top rebounding teams in the Southern Conference And strong take from Justin Johnson whos been one of the best players on the floor tonight for Western Carolina Johnson and Johnson have been uh matching up quite a bit tonight The last couple times Justin Johnson has taken it to the hole Tyler Johnson was trying to get in his way Both players are sophomores You mentioned it earlier part of that Sunb Belt regular season championship at Arkansas State last year Sunb Belts a fun league to watch Stretch all over cheering I think all the way from Texas to West Virginia Johnson looking to get into double figures and he does his fourth free throw You think about for Western Carolina Max so many players have seen minutes tonight Thats not uncommon And just a reminder from the 10000 foot perspective its December 11th Lot of season to go and every team in America still trying to figure out rotations and what thats going to look like come conference time Yeah this this team was picked seventh in the Southern Conference I think I dont think theres much question theyre better than that Part of that depth part of that uh uh six returnees that played significant minutes You see Marcus Kell right there with a nice offensive rebound and they forgot to get back But ah good job of stopping him and the turnover Both players pleading their case Officials say thats last off of of Dallas And I think they got that right mentioned you know a thing or two about the Southern Conference Lets take a look at the preseason poll Picked to win that league They were the NIT champions a year ago Furman looks like theyve played the best basketball so far but uh I tell you what I I think Western Carolina has a shot to finish way higher than they were picked in that league They open up against Waford Mike Youngs old school cheering for their first conference game after after another uh yeah Kevin Gilner another tie to Virginia Tech Kevin Gilner the longtime assistant for Mike Young now the head coach at Wford is alma mater Western Carolina has a game at Georgia Then they get to conference play Look at Abdales Strong take through contact No problem for the freshman Yeah that height pays off in so many different ways Got a slight lead right there and can elevate over the sevenfooter No problem Dallas and Hansbury both now with 16 have good balance in their scoring They they had five averaging in double figures for quite a while but now they have seven averaging nine or more Yeah you think about that Yeah Go lets go big picture for Virginia Tech No Toby LW on the floor and this Tech team a lot of players stepping up and and you know we talk about you know replacing his production and and taking care of his minutes but but also the the offense it has to look a little different when you got a couple centers down there on that block Uh you know its a little bit different look for Mike Young offensively and defensively Johnson got to create two seconds Gets the three off Hits it before the horn He is having a night Has scored 23 points over his last two games And you mentioned a moment ago hes in double figures He is staying hot Yeah played well at USC Upstate and now comes up with a steal and he stepped out of bounds I think he wanted a foul on ADA Yeah Coach Craft thought it was a foul on AD Dallas He was in good position to make that call but nice job by Johnson Pokes at it Oh yeah he stepped out of bounds and and really just slipped It wasnt a foul on Dallas Hammond got by his defender The teardrop missed off the window Johnsons had the hot hand Here he is The bounce pass inside and the layup for Samuel Dada Yeah Justin Johnson doing it all 12 points A beautiful assist right there Dallas goes down hard Hell have free throws when we come back Justin Johnson the 68 sophomore out of Miami Florida is having a really good night for the Catamounts The music three right there Hes had a couple nice plays going to the basket A beautiful passing points Uh after doing a really good job uh the Hokes did did on Kell in the first half There you are Theyre having a little trouble finding him here in Johnson has just been outstanding And of course overall the Catamounts zero turnovers in the second half Have outs scored the Hokes by three here in the second half Dallas its been a great night for him If youre just tuning in 18 points to lead all scorers in the games Most points he has scored since the St Joes game midway through November St Joes playing at Syracuse tonight One to keep an eye on I dont think they tip it off till 900 The Hawk will be there The Hawk will be there flapping them wings And our officials I believe might take a look at something challenge Well heres something new to college basketball The challenge system You get one challenge and there are things you can challenge things you cant challenge And if your challenge is successful you maintain that challenge The call on the floor is West Carolina ball Virginia Tech is challenging the call Oh yeah its absolutely off of Western Carolina Mike Young is going to be successful on this technology that you can have on the bench now enables you to take a look at those kind of things You were asked this a couple days ago Ill ask it to you on the broadcast Your thoughts video review challenge system What do you think it means for college basketball Is it a good thing Oh well it has absolutely cut down on the on the opportunities to uh to interrupt the game with going to the replay So I think thats definitely a good thing And uh this sort of a copy of of a little bit of what they do in the NBA And I think its been clean Uh a lot of different looks We got great camera work dont we partner No question about it Great job from our crew It might be coming off the forearm of Johnson Thats what it looks like right there Comes off of there and then hits it one more time before it goes out of bounds right there I think whats interesting you know weve weve caught a lot of games over the last two months When it was first put in I think there was thought hey is this going to be an everyame thing And it really hasnt been No not at all And then and then it stays the same in the last two minutes where you can check about anything or most things Conclusive inconclusive I try to use that with my wife Jean It it doesnt work at all It doesnt work at all the great Jean McCartney Anything I say is in the coachs challenge is successful cheering The ball went off West Carolina last The clock will be reset to 1122 Virginia Tech will retain their 30 second timeout and have an additional coaches challenge And Im sure too Mac I mean Coach Young saw that the whole way there but sometimes in baseball we see it The coaches rely Im sure a lot on the players to tell them what they think Sure do Yeah And sometimes thats successful and sometimes its not Catamount show pressure when Bedford know three points today for Bedford Matt got off to such a great start Hes going to be a big piece of things down the stretch Yeah he hes got to play well and he he hasnt been consistent Hes been really good on some nights And going the other way an offensive foul against Virginia Tech Yeah Hanssbury that time on the roll A little too aggressive trying to get position They get tangled up And Barry goes to the bench and Dorne comes back in Little different kind of lineup here Four guards really for Virginia Tech And Dorne in the middle Johnson Its been his night Misses the right hand layup Heres Ben Hammond Coach called him the Energizer Bunny Extra pass JOHNSON OPEN LOOK EUBATS How many times do you see the extra pass lead to a wide open three Johnson sees a lane Dada the board I dont know Thats a good looking freshman Pway That balls on his right shoulder Trying to create late in the shot clock Good burst but a foul on the way up with five on the timer Yeah Bedford that time gets called for the foul in transition One pass back to Johnson Knocks it down And then heres the drive A little handsy cheering Got a lot of ball right there But Pway going to the free throw line the freshman that we talked about in the first half that reclassified and rolled late in Koi ACC PM Monday through Thursday from 600 to 700 Eastern And Friday a special 2hour football focused edition from

second half looking to create with seven He turns he fires swirls around the iron The Catamounts a little too No thats a foul against Virginia Tech Yep Dorne that time on the offensive rebound effort Western Carolina was very good on defense that time and forced AD Dallas to take a contested fall away shot Wasnt a bad shot in the lane but it wasnt out of the offense In order to press and and try to create those turnovers youve got to score on this end Kell going to work on Johnson trying to turn He doesnt He hits a tough jumper Oh really nice play right there Back Tyler Johnson down Oh Johnsons a good defender Marcus Kell was a better scoreer than he was a defender on that last possession Hammond contested three He wanted it He hits it Yeah really good in rhythm Hes got a good feel for when to shoot that shot Hookies continue to be hot from beyond the ark Tech leads by 20 Largest lead of the game 25 Yeah Western continued to battle hard on both ends Dada lost that out of bounds and da hes want hes wanting to challenge this time on the floor right now Well first off lets see if coach Craft elects to challenge No As they show pressure Mac youve got Hammond on the floor right now as well as Jaden Shu Coach Young talked about the punch they bring off the bench What kind of luxury is that as a coach Yeah its so important you you when you go to the bench you you dont you certainly dont want to lose anything and and Virginia Techs got some folks who can bring it especially on the offensive end Hanssberry tough turnaround lefthand hook shot wont go itll stay no itll go catamounts Hansbury has gotten a lot of attention here in this second half and hadnt had the same success he had in the first halfsbury and do laughing at each other in a in a really good spirited way Pwway Kell up to 14 points LOOKING FOR MORE JOHNSON BIG BLOCK BUT A FOUL YEAH and he certainly got the ball but may have bodied up a little bit right there Kale was making that move with a lot of confidence Yeah maybe the follow through Its what Doug Sha saw Yeah that might have been the follow through Still looked pretty clean over there partner It certainly brought the crowd to some oos and as You see Marcus Kells parents Love the sweatshirts theyre wearing there with the number Thats pretty neat Very cool state of North Carolina cheering You see the the clock tower on there the Catamount logo Hooks by 18 Hammond another tough shot Not that time Hanssbury goes down the rebound Yeah Dada on the box out fell under eight media timeout Hulks by 18 Come back with us on the other

Carolina won SoCon title back in 1996 Shoots open look Clanks front rim Nice play again Atto I love attos coaches drawing them up out of the timeout cheering Its a nice move by Damasi Just couldnt get the finish Hammond downhill A drop off Well read Theres Damassie on the defensive end And Kell up AND UNDER OF DALLAS WITH THE BLOCK YEAH hes cheering so deceptive You know you you watch him play and you you kind of get used to him doing what he does but hes 69 Hes got some reach And this was a nice job of protecting the ball on the back side of the rim Did not matter Odales said I can block shots too Kell working against Johnson Thats been a fun matchup in the second half and its Johnson who wins that battle that time You know before the game cheering was going over my my boards and I had written down that you know Abdales was held to a season low six points on Saturday So I had written down intentionally coming in Mack how does Neil Odales impact the game when hes not scoring I think weve answered that plenty coming and he has shown that today No question No question Of course right here Damasie takes it away from Odales And the layup in Damassie heated him up Males wanted that ball back but Hammond comes down takes care of this run the set play and then a silly foul away from the ball Its a nice pick right here Pick it away and the finish of Dallas tried to get back into it Damassi he has shown some ability doesnt have a lot of numbers in this game but uh you can see why Coach Craft was talking glowingly about him This Western Carolina team they defend with purpose and intensity Yeah they theyve been getting after it here Its been a you you have to play good defense to win on the road And he had him in the right frame of mind And we talked about the fact that he had hes beaten a lot of a lot of power five teams from a basketball perspective We throw the Big East in there Ill stay here His keep the possession Now as great as Ben Hammonds been we talked about his defense his steals his offense today Something Coach Young mentioned after uh Saturdays game he allows Neo to get off the top and into other actions that Coach Young finds important Yeah To be able to play off the ball a little bit Dallas through contact Little Euro step the floater on top of it You cant say euro step in the end can you Its just his step His step The neoep Dumasi too strong cheering Again cheering these two teams early in the year Were calling this the Neostep Mac Is that what youre saying Yes The Neostep Were going to use that again No question So will he And the dunk No but the foul Anticava going to the line Hanssbury got up on the side and then had to catch up and fouled instead Hsbury now with this fourth cheering Kakama one for two at the line cheering

could get him squared up Kell recognized that and he goes back to the free throw line You mentioned earlier how Western Carolina preseason pick to finish seventh in the SoCon coming off an 8 and22 year last year in coach Crafts first here But Mac the makeup of this team You can see the pieces and the potential here with the Catamounts Yeah got good guard play Got three or four point guards Seen Justin Johnson come off the bench Theyve got good size Start a sevenfooter Bring a 69 68 in the game OF DALLAS WANTS THE TRIPLE HES GOT another applause and cheering I think that turnover got him

in double figures all but one game Hes got nine Abdales turn shoots How about the friendly roll Everythings working for Dallas Yeah Western thought he pushed off a little bit cheering And theres Johnson going to the line Western Carolina shooting just 50 a little bit Need a little space there Went under the ball screen Cant do that And then right here Hammond relaxed just a little bit I think he thought Johnson was going to step up and maybe switch that But good shooters will make you pay if you dont do the right thing on defense cheering Johnson went a little quiet on us but there he is back in the action Dallas heating up in the second half Thats impressive How about seven for nine from the floor Hanssbury in that first half of Dallas says Ill take care of the second half cheering And we coined the Neostep You coined the Neostep Most points at Castle Coliseum for Neo of Dallas with 25 points Hes got plenty of time left Gernak turns to the left high arcing floater wont fall Turnaround hook Wasnt really on balance with that Cabba Fanta twohand flush Yeah Cabba that time got loose on the ball screen Miscommunication with Gerak Fantabas got five points six rebounds AND THERES ABDOLLIS TO THE RIM Do a lot of different things like you talked about He doesnt have to score to dominate a game but he is certainly capable of it tomorrow the whole way A Dallas might have gotten a piece of it He dives Keeps the basketball alive for Johnson And then the rejection but a foul before Fair to say hes all over the place Abdullahs got a couple blocks on that possession on the offensive end Got the size advantage Big sevenfooter comes over Play right on through that kind Hes leading Western Carolina 8465 Lot to like tonight from Justin Johnson Yeah 14 points Lot of lot like like here in the second half by the Catamounts They now have outscored Virginia Tech by one here in the second half And Im sure Coach Crafts going to like theyve really protected the basketball in the second half Yeah cheering it has been Neo of Dallass night with 27 points Especially here in the second half Hanssbury had a big first half Hadnt gotten going here in the second half They they paid a lot of attention to him Another three Not that time Hanssberry the rebound THE REVERSE UP AND UNDER LAYUP YEAH right on Q hadnt been doing much in the second half but good offensive rebound right there and 18 points for Hansbury He Johnson and Bedford playing with four fouls Kell line drive three bottom of the net Johnson Tyler Johnson got there too late again Kell with a big second half Big month of December for me Can I bring up I mean high points in NCAA tournament team 27 Hes got 19 tonight There is more Neo of Dallas flexing and another assist by Hanssberry tying his careerh high Six assists on Saturday six today What has it been about Hansberry his passing thats been so good I I think I mean hes been Look at this nice pass I think hes been hes been capable of this the whole time F first time I saw them at practice uh Coach Young pointed out they can initiate their offense through him at the high post and and of course uh they they do some of that but not as much of it without Toby Lau in the game Its 30 points for Neil of Dallas Two and a half minutes to go Size advantage Size advantage by Kell Working on Hammond Help from Hansbury Got stripped but a foul Western Carolinas in the double bonus Second half Neil of Dallas more of number 17 He has lived up to the hype I would say Evan not just tonight the entire season Well and again any given night M as youve talked about hes going to impact the game in different ways Yep Seen him block shots seen him defend Certainly weve seen him pass every night Right on two Johnson corner three down He finds the right person almost every single time I mean hes got his back to the to the court standing at midcourt and finds Johnson wide open in the corner Tyler Johnsons got 13 points Had 13 on Saturday A nice response after he was held scoreless against South Carolina And hes going to foul out Yeah Tyler Johnsons been a very dependable defender for Mike Young this season Has not had a great night defensively tonight Of course hes had to go against Kell Awfully good Justin Johnson He has fouled out as we said cheering Well what a womens basketball matchup we have for you on Sunday afternoon right here on ACC Network at the ESPN India Navar leads number 12 North Carolinas balanced music attack when they host Lauren Seagler in number 22 Louisville at 4 Eastern at Carmichael Arena Sigler the transfer I think from St Joes Louisville almost had that upset win over South Carolina in the ACC SEC challenge Hanssbury of Dallas looking for more just short and the pass on that play Hanssberry Hanssberrys hit him a couple times that hes missed shots Im sure theyre going to talk about that This crowd tonight has been treated to some great offense in the second half Samaro cant get that to go including the uh the castle guard as theres the fifth foul Romani Hanssbury his fifth I was just going to mention that today is reading day Reading day you did you I in my time in college of course I was such a I was a 40 student Ive heard that but Ive only heard it from you so I dont know how about three we might have to verify that but you know what if I was a student where would I be today if there was a basketball game you would be at the game not a good free throw shooter too talked about Fontacabas struggles cheering He sinks both Sure Mike Young wouldnt mind seeing a little clock run right here Not happy about that kind of pass Shoot Good job by Highland closing out on shoot Hammond the right hand draws the whistle and more free throws for him Hes got 11 points on the night Yeah Hammonds had a good game Created some offense out of defense Always puts good pressure on the ball Hes made a couple big shots You think about whats coming up for Virginia Tech Maryland Eastern Shore on Sunday and Elon and then Mack How about New Years Eve to close out 2025 Yeah the University of Virginia and uh I think both these teams are you know looking at NCAA possibilities Virginia has a new roster Theyve got uh they got a lot of depth and theyve got a couple really good European players named Tess Ditter a Belgium player whos outstanding A 68 240lb power forward for Virginia Thats going to be a heck of a matchup to start league play They start with Virginia and finish with Virginia It kind of feels fitting Think somebody had something to do with that Brian ODM in his first year Here comes Isaiah Pasha for the first time tonight And theres the curtain call for Neo of Dallas What a great second half for Neo applause Step back Samaro Hammond thinking about it Yeah he was thinking about it and then he thought about go Jung over there laughter Now he wants it Gach creates positioning Hell stay here And obviously you never want a player to be hurt Hokes would love to have Toby Lau back on the floor but you think about something good from something bad The minutes for Gerak and Dorne Oh yeah A lot of guys are getting minutes that they wouldnt be getting Shoot finishing things off for the Hokes probably but yeah that its valuable experience and uh and they and you just dont know how long Toby Lows going to be out cheering and applause Well thatll just about do it Yeah I imagine theyll dribble this ball out You think about this Tech team those backtoback losses in the Bahamas and how they have responded now winners of three in a row Yeah really good response and and they had to kind of reinvent themselves a little bit Thats your ball game Virginia Tech knocks off Western Carolina 96 74
