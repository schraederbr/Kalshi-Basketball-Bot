for us and we are ready to go The Skyhawks and the Seinals UT Martin controlling the opening tip Good ball movement right out of the gates and B Miraovich lays it in right on Q It took it right down their throats And now here comes Florida State One of the quickest teams in the country Kobe McGee cheering has it knocked away on the three attempt Itll remain with the Seinals Drago Lungu knocked it out of play for UT Martin Thatll give us a chance to identify Florida States starting lineup here in Tallahassee tonight Same cast of characters saved for one Martin Somerville gets his first start of the season The Nles will be without the services of Chanty Wiggins their 610 transfer from Clemson missing his first game since his freshman season McCrae the fifth down the lane does everything but drop And now here come the Skyhawks back the other way Aon Trinka making start number two bringing it up into the four court for UT Martin And theres Matis Denish giving it up to his teammates Stolen away by Steen And Florida State loves to run in transition WHAT a start for the big fella out of Florida Southern Alex Dean is not worried about the handles on those UT Martin Skyhawks Took it right from him Two wall and some early fireworks here at the Donald El Tucker Center Montistious kisses it off the glass Thatll be an and one for him And the defense is doing disruption and chaos just what Luke LS likes to see And then the strong finish cheering Steam was a really good player in division two Was a highly soughtafter postman in the transfer this cheering year Sean was really good score for Luke LS Hes responsible for both of Florida States points Meanwhile couple of buckets from a couple of guys for UT Martin who have been weekly award winners Another lob for Florida State Seen that a time or two over the last few games for the Seminals Ducish leans in and draws the foul Kobe McGees moving his feet a little slow there Its these guys can handle the ball especially you take all these kids from European basketball Well take a look at the UT Martin starting five Avon Trinka Drago Lungu Philipovski Andrea Bukovich and Matis Denish who has made a name for himself this season Continues to do so tonight And another foul will be called music this time against Martin Somerville Someville trying to get a little too high up there on the defense He should just kind of let him go and let one of the big fellas block that shot So Buk Mirovich who scored the opening bucket of the affair tonight will go to the free throw line to shoot a couple more Hes three of four at the charity stripe through the Skyhawks first three games this season First one up and good Hes a guy whos averaging nearly 80 from the floor 70 from three And while yes its a limited sample size at the free throw line hes only missed one so far this season there as well You can tell hes the veteran for coach Schulman The way he just kind of carries himself Having played for him in junior college too gives him a nice settled effect with with his coach and a good relationship UT Martin a young team that experience has been important for them Steam comes down off the miss tries to put it up off the window and the fight for the loose ball A pile of humanity down in the low post Itll be a jump ball and remain cheering on this side of the floor The Skyhawks are a tough team Also you know Steve is the toughest guy on Florida States squad Hes hes really like a disruptor himself Hes just going in there like a bull in a china shop every time he goes to the rim crashing the glass But coach Schman has his Skyhawks constantly going to the rim They a lot of times hell go five people to the rim trying to get a rebound You saw Steen make his way to the bench Tom Bong checks in Robert McCrae the fifth rolls it through and Florida States got their opening tray of the contest That doubling on the post is going to hurt UT Martin because the way LX likes to play in his seinals theyre going to kick it out for those open threes Sean and McCrae showing us what he can do with it Yeah Florida State wants to collapse the defense and find the open shooter You put two in the post youre going to leave somebody open somewhere Thatll fly out of play and will go to Florida State So another turnover by the Skyhawks And you mentioned Luke LS year one for the FSU alumnus was the starting point guard for Leonard Hamiltons 2020 ACC championship team nine seasons in the NBA and he has brought his NBA offensive system to Tallahassee and theres the direct benefit of it A couple of early threes for the NLES and after they trailed early they lead by one Strong take to the bucket back the other way by Povsky Got the finger roll to drop and the Skyhawks take the lead That is not what coach Laps is wanting to see with his defense Hes he wants to stop that penetration Speaking of penetration Somerville gets to the logo Sprays it out to McCrae now Back up top McGee Turn around Thatll drop and one I think everybody was shocked even myself McGee is a sharp shooter from deep Sean But to see him put it on the floor with the penetration and then have the wherewithal where he reathers himself spins around and gets that shot off with the defense and playing through the contact Its good to see a veteran leader right there Hes got a lot of games under his belt and got a lot of poise and he practices every day Hes the first guy in the gym You got to love McGee Kobe McGee the senior from Drexel on the board with his first bucket couldnt connect on the and one opportunity Denish Jay Jones will be called for the personal Our ACC officiating crew determining that it wasnt all ball there And so a couple of free throws coming yet again for Denish Matz is two weeks in a row Newcomer of the week freshman of the week Im sorry for the OBC and he has just really established himself as a freshman here from coach Schulman the UT Martin whos coming from junior college as we talked about in his second season up here and and had a a good record last year but hes hes bought into the European concept of bringing his kids and his players all from overseas and I think 16 players on his team are all from Europe or two from Africa Yeah a couple from Africa majority from Europe They win the rebound And there from the wing is Povski Positive start here tonight for UT Martin Theyve gone on the road and beaten UNLV to open the season then beat the NIT quarterfinalist Bradley McCrae the fifth splashes another three from the wing McCrae is feeling pretty good tonight Not only can he do it with distributing the ball I think its because Chanty Wiggins is not in the game which is and its allowing him to play the offguard get more shots up Timeout on the floor as Drago Lungu splashes a three through Florida Reard Community College at the time but he went all in on International Kids and he gets all his points from there gets his rebounds And its crazy how he has changed his offensive sets to totally match what you need to do with the European style player because it changes you to a more direct offense Your defense is different You cant play as athletic up and down and thats he tries to disrupt who he plays against with his style of play Yeah A lot of cutting a lot of assists in that European style Yes exactly And good shot choices and thats why theyre shooting five of six 83 from the floor Robert McCrae the fifth nearly lost the handle Dishes it to the corner and there is AJ Swinton the sophomore making his first three of the season Florida State bringing the pressure Skyhawks able to break Lungu had it knocked away Robert McCrae the fifth got his hand in there Then Lungu steals it away himself Cam Miles the freshman tried to track it down in front of his bench Great effort by the youngster but instead it goes back to UT Martin It looks like the shot clock did not reset so we might have a momentary delay here but you can see with both those plays that were executed with the steel down here by the Skyhawks the way Lungu shot the lane and didnt try to go close out He went to the pass Thats some European influence And then that the way they kind of know where to be on the floor is Shmans approach versus you know he he Luke Ls system is about making decisions on the floor and he trains them in practice and works on it every day And hes like these games early in the seasons they got to get better at decisionm and theres not a lot of decisions necessarily Its about being and running the sets for Shman and UT Martin Meanwhile for Florida State defensively controlled chaos is the theme They forced four turnovers Le Jones tes up the three That is too strong So here comes Pikovsky who had eight assists on the road against Bradley The euro step by Wongu high off the window Brought back down by Denish and Leger Jones corrals the second one Thomas Bon 73 wingspan right there causing problems Sean big problems indeed for the Skyhawks that allows Jones to run the floor in transition and draw the contact and a couple of free throws And Jones started off the season with a hot hand Had some problems down in Gainesville with fouls etc But Jones getting up long right there and wrapping it up and taking off for Florida State But Jones is a tough guy and really brings a hardnose approach also to go with SKs approach in the paint Jones does it on the wings and and Jones is just a tough mindset Coach Fly Michael Fly talks about it where his transferring and going from school to school and going to Bvard Junior College made him a tougherminded kid Hes not like worried about the small things in life Hes worried about where he wants to go and he wants to go to the NBA and thats why he transferred to Florida State Yeah its been a heck of a journey for Leger starting at Charleton State as a freshman then went to Barton Community College as a sophomore where his dad played and was one of the best players in program history by the way Then went to St Bonaventure last year as an everyday starter averaged 11 and six points and rebounds He makes a couple of free throws here to put the NL in front by two And on that trip to Barton Community College he also won the MVP of the national tournament and did not like that doesnt happen every day You got to be a good player cuz theres some really studs out there when you go to the national championships So thats been the journey for Le Jones who will earn a breather Swinton aggressively came in there tried to pick off the pass I like how Trinka slows him down says lets get in our set as the big fella Denish penetrating into the paint cheering It comes right back out to the freshman Trinka under five Buovich for three High off the window and through with the bank baby Night time The ATMs open here at the Tucker Center Kobe McGee Two defenders in his face Could not get the layup to go Its a onepoint lead for UT Martin Theyre going to run the clock down Get late in the shot clock Thats what Luke L wants is a pick and take off to the corner McGee too strong Steam checks in corrals the loose ball draws the foul on the floor as well Itll go against AJ Hopkins Hopkins coming in from Atlanta cleanly like the Windex baby Just bank it on home Great camera work Good booth back there folks Love that stuff And thats the guy who comes in averaging nearly 70 from beyond the ark Got a little assist out the window That euro step he put up a minute ago He missed Like that was a wicked euro step So Marovic and the Skyhawks lead by one Swinton finds back iron Heres the freshman Miles spinning dumping it off to Steam Nice pass by Miles and Florida State takes the lead And not always do you kick it out when you drive in the paint for Florida State Sometimes you throw that little over the top pass to your side kick down low Steams great at staying short corner going opposite the ball Its one of the things Coach L talked about in practice Get on the other side make yourself available down low and also out there on the perimeter for those spray out threes Four points three rebounds now for Alex Steen And a foul will be called against Somerville Already has one personal foul in this game He doesnt agree with the call Miles putting on the floor so hard getting by and then Steen knowing his teammatess going to be there Ste flashes over and gets a great clean pass over to finish up top Miles from ING Academy traveled around a good bit Originally from Chicago Illinois played some AO ball out in Arizona And how about Florida States defense yet again AJ Swinton had the ball knocked away by AJ Hopkins who toled up to get a good block but as the ball was falling down Hopkins couldnt get out of the way and got a little touch as it rolled out of bounds for UT Martin who comes in undefeated with a couple of big wins on the road Their issue this season their biggest one has been turnovers Theyve coughed the ball up four times in the last 3 and 12 minutes and they are going to go to the bench and bring in Amaso for the first time this season Coach Shman we asked him if Amaso was going to play tonight and tried to hold out on us I guess we got it right but so did Kobe McGee He just got it right from the corner with that deep three Once again Florida State has made five of 11 shots from beyond the ark By comparison UT Martin has only teed up three but they have made every single one of them Fourpoint lead for the Seinals Their largest lead of the night Ratakovic lost it McGee had his pocket picked Aan Trinka behind the back dribble Two seminals come his way Ratakovic now off the right wing these contrasting styles are so fun to watch Sean From a basketball perspective its cheering so opposite Another turnover And here comes the freshman Miles Coach Schulmans seen enough Sean applause Timeout Skyhawks Miles quick hands running the plate layups theyve had contested and uncontested but the transition game on defense is not fast enough for UT Martin so working the baseline kicks it back out to Lunu Lungu looking for some help is checked in after the timeout bounces round and out Itll remain with the Skyhawks Luka Colche got that same European step He had a little Euro step through kind of right there trying to clear some space for his shot Hes bringing his horses back now for coach Schulman And there is Colch checking back onto the bench with AJ Hopkins Speaking of Colche teammates with Drago Lungu on the Romanian international circle Heres Lunu off the inbounds Alier Malucas checked in for Florida State Heres Picovski inside 10 cheering Bu Mirovich that is short and thatll be a shot clock violation cheering Thats a good break for coach Schman It gives him a chance to get his defense back Its not a good break on the the turnover with the shot but it gets his team back to stop this runaway train as Florida State tries to take off on a dead sprint Strong defense by the Seinals yet again on that possession Florida State trying to stretch the lead Its as its at its largest so far and McCrae the fifth caught that iron Foul on the floor McCrae in the fifth will be called for the bump of Pakovski McCrae does a lot of good things and he does a lot of good things on defense as well but hell pick up some bunnies out way out cheering on the perimeter where he should not get that knuckleheaded foul that hurts you late in the game and put you on the bench Thatll be his first personal of the game Mush weve seen him go to work off the low block Hes got range as well McCrae the fifth finds Jones in the corner for the response Trinket keeping that ball alive Sean tipping it to himself Boy look at UT Martin running the floor in transition Thats been Florida States game so far tonight Standing nothing No overturn So we just got to go Sean you heard it first We certainly call you upheld Florida State will be charged a timeout and have zero challenges for the remainder of the game So Florida State loses a timeout and they lose their challenge for the remainder of the game It remains a bucket for Birroic and the lead is down to one With that new rule its a tough job sitting over there with the iPad You better get it right or the head coach is going to be hot Florida State looking for a response McCrae the fifth couldnt get the layin to go And now here comes Avon Trinko Active hands there by Leger Jones And Jacob just watching Florida State operate defensively seeing where UT Martin has to start their offense cheering They got to push They got to push way out Sean which is kind of where they want to work from because it gives the the Skyhawks more space to work And this play right here is the one I know theyre worried about because they throw that ball in a deep in the short corner theyre in trouble because theyre going to trap it and take it away from them Inside 10 for Lunu who tries to round the corner Got Maloo off his feet but its a travel by Lu Its one of the toughest plays is that jump stop and landing those feet and then you cant change a pivot if they both land at the same time Its the ninth turnover by the Skyhawks as Somerville brings it up into the front court for Florida State No look to Jones And here is Leger Spin move and the finish The Jacksonville native thought he was going to cup that thing and throw it home Lead back to three for Florida State Trinka leans in He said it a few minutes ago Sean Theyre hanging around Theyve got to hang around this trap And theres another steal Florida State turning up the pressure even more defensively Jones off the shot fake skips it to Somerville Oh good ball movement by the NLES Itll result in free throws for Maluke So you mentioned just a couple of minutes ago he was looking for a block He was looking for a dunk And so in a couple of possessions here hes had a chance at both Stays under control And such a wise decision Get the basket Its a close game Dont go get a fancy miss dunk Thats a veteran move Thats what Jay Jones brings to this team is his experience He and Chanty Wiggins are the two guys thats played the most games at this type of level So its such a good move for for Jay Jones to be out there as a leadership position So theres the veteran Jones looking on as Maluke one of just three guys who was on the roster last year for Leonard Hamilton to return to this years roster under first year head coach Luke LS misses both free throws for Florida State The lead will remain at three Pikovski fights off McCrae the fifth for the moment Roberts right back on him again It is ball pressure central out here in the back court Got that right Andish is off to a good start tonight and he has kept it going Hes a man among boys with his squad He just goes through anybody Has been unfased by the moment unfazed by the opponent as a youngster Hes had a lot of moxy hasdish as Florida State comes up empty in their offensive possession Povsky on the trailer Thats the kind of shot that UT Martins got to knock those shots down Off the carum leans in Thatll be a couple of free throws for Aar Maluke coming up after the under eight media timeout Florida State in a tight one with UT Martin at the Donald El Tucker Center One at UNLB having one at Bradley You know theyre not really phased by the moment now Its a different type team that the athletes and and the style of play that Passner has taken in UNLV I dont know if its the same approach or the same level that competed at Florida State but theyve got to not turn the ball over to stay in this game Theyre doing a great job Theyre shooting 60 67 from three but the points off turnovers 14 to zero Florida States favor And they got five extra second chance points Thats whats putting Florida State in the lead Other than that the Skyhawks and Tim Hart and coach Schulman have got to be filled with where they are and how theyre playing They have stayed in the conversation from the drop The Skyhawks have led by as many as five at times tonight Couple of free throw makes for Maloop Florida State stretches the lead to three The Nolles themselves have led by as many as six Colche back into the game for UT Martin And heres Mcmeirovich going up top to Trinka inside two seconds Thatll go to Florida State cheering Another empty possession by the Skyhawks But they keep holding on They they make good defensive plays They dont get crushed in transition Theyve done a good job containing Florida State a little bit Done a really nice job on the glass as well 14 rebounds for UT Martin In fact actually leading in that category so far in this contest McCrae dishes it to Bong Couldnt get the roll Battle for the loose ball It comes away with the Skyhawks Lungu looking to run the floor in transition A dish to Birvich and one Birvich may have got lucky He almost traveled but the contact from the defender kind of bailed him out But Birvich continues to just impress Not phased by the moment going right into Le Jones softly And weve talked about 77 coming into this game cheering from the field and 69 from threepoint range coming into this game for the season And cashing in the and one to tie us at 29 here at the tuck Thats the second personal on Jones He will check out So too will Robert McCrae the fifth We talked about he had foul trouble Le Jones got in foul trouble down in Gainesville last week that that really hurt the nose offensively whether he was scoring or not His presence on the floor and his position in the offense is Alex Steen and hes been tough down there on the low block Hell earn a trip to the free throw line drawing the contact from Trinka Steen does such a good job of staying down on the block knowing his position and hes just got a strong he works on his core You can tell hes got such a strong body to to just stay there with his legs with everybody on his back and pushing around and still gets a shot up from all parts of the floor And applause and cheering its obvious why he was such a good player down there cheering This is the first free throw here Florida States gone without a bucket for the last two and a half minutes They cashed in a couple of free throws from Maluke Steam misses both We remain tied Five of six for the Skyhawks Florida State now four of nine at the charity strike Got to make free throws That every coach Im giving coach a heart attack in the locker room McGee tried to get a hand in there Good work by Trinka shielding him off Now its Bukirovich going up top Cold check tes up a three and thats knocked back out to Trinka Lungu discards Bong and is fouled Lunu looking like LeBron did a great job on the landing getting a little contact going down but hes quick to release that bad boy and puts it on the floor Great work But the guy they have active hands Everyones cheering crashing the glasses If you can get those rebounds thats what happened early when Florida State was getting those run outs They would get the ball on the tip and go with it or get the steal And when UT Martin is able to not get that ball tip away from them they can keep it down there and get second chance opportunities cheering Boy and they have gotten some friendly bounces too havent they A bank off the window for a three hitting back iron on a free throw and popping up in the air and crashing through Anyway Skyhawks have played well though They lead by two McGee looking for room Gives it up to Somerville Somerville down the lane dumps it off with Steam and Florida State executes the offense really well there Stes ability we talked about it earlier he stays short corner right there on the opposite block and his teammate knows hes going to be there and so they just give it to him when they lead the floor and he stays in there and makes a good move Six points now for Steen Lungu splits the seminals Lost the handle out of play Itll remain with the Skyhawks with 11 on the shot clock One of the things they talk about with Steen is his motor He plays so hard Its not that hes got a bad motor He cant go but so long because he plays so hard You can just see hes like so winded and gas Hes like How can you not want to put that guy on the floor with you You want to play with a guy with that type of energy Boy Lunu skies for the ball Florida State was looking for another steal Great job on the offensive glass by the Skyhawks Second attempt though no good Florida State able to clear the boards Lob to Steen And that will be an and one for Alex Steve this is what we said right there Short Cory runs the floor sucks the defense down with him and then stays where hes supposed to be His teammate finds him gives him a little ball fake Everyone thinks youre going to shoot right up and finishes right there keeping that ball in check Just sells that fake Going to get me an extra from the free throw line Alex Ste now four of six from the floor for Florida State Eight points looking for nine Hes already Florida States leader in field goal percentage also rebounds And this time after missing a couple of free throws he cashes in the and one opportunity And to your point Jacob hes going to take a breather Oh he wont be there long Nope But they have to get him off and get you just We had a guy like that at Auburn one time when Mame the Nai was a freshman Wed put him in to get the jump ball We take him out on the first dead ball Oh nice dump off by Lu and Bu Marovic lays it in on the other end McCrae the fifth gets it to the corner Deep three for Somerville cleared by Povsky and Berovic lost it out of play Was great ball movement on that possession Sean Yeah there was four five six passes trying to whip it around looking for the right look but dont count out UT Martin Theyre flashing in there to get those rebounds McCrae strong take to the basket No luck though for Robert the fifth has not had the friendly roll so far tonight Has the veteran from Jacksonville but Leger Jones got all three of those from the corner Florida State leads by four once more And thats one of the things coach L talked about is they wanted to get back to who they be who they are cuz they got stuck playing a little different against Florida Yang checking in for the first time Couldnt hit the turnaround and now a reach in by the big fella on AJ Swinton Thatll take us to our under four media timeout here in Tallahassee the college route because you got to get a new roster almost every year like Luke LS has done And UT Martin whos in a different situation kind of went bluecollar and went and got a junior college coach from Florida whos never coached in the NCAA in any capacity Hes only worked in junior college in NIA and has went with him and is a winning guy 14 seasons 13 championships I think or playoffs But that you see the difference in what youre working with and Martin made some great decisions to bring something different to the table for them to compete at this level And they certainly have competed well including here tonight where they only trail the seinals by four This is a Florida State team that gave Alabama everything they wanted in the preseason Gave the reigning national champs everything they wanted on the road But man that moxy that we have seen all night long by the Skyhawks They refuse to go away Another three for Trinka And a massive collision underneath the basket I think we had a elbow connection hard play Both guys going hard AJ Swinton trying to go at the rim and Philip Povski doing his job defending the situation We talk about drinking just a minute ago And here you see the content be some back spasms in the morning for AJ Swint Boy thats got me hurting over here Thats where the training staff comes in baby Hell be heated during the game and icing it in the locker room And of course to his credit these young guys so tough Took a second but he got off the floor with a big smile And then he makes the and one Hey makes everybody happy You can see its hurting right now Hell get him loose Halftimes coming up too So Swinton showing plenty of toughness Made a three Gets the layin through contact Cashes in on the backside while still in pain Florida States lead back up to four Nobodys led by more than six as we have two and a half minutes left here in this opening half in Floridas capital city You see theyre attacking differently Florida State is pressuring from different directions Hopkins off the mark Swatted away by Steen And here comes Kobe McGee That is knocked away Cold check with the rejection of Steam And Hopkins will tee up another tray This time he hits and the lead is back down to one Dont count that shooter out from Atlanta McGee off front iron Hopkins there to clear the rebound Inside two minutes here in Tallahassee and UT Martin who already has pulled a couple of road upsets hanging in there with the seminals here tonight as well Lunu down the lane will shoot a pair of free throws Theyre so tough in attacking the rim Lungu I love that guy And just they swing it Dont hesitate Hopkins from deep giving it the stare down Be the second personal called against Kobe McGee sends Lunu to the line cheering and we are tied again Couple of substitutions Ty Price checking in The freshman out of Kentucky for UT Martin Tomas Song will come in to relieve steam cheering This time the Skyhawks dont get the roll Were still tied at 40 McCrae tried to break it down off the dribble Gets it to the corner Now back on the wing This has been where he has been redhot Hasnt been able to get a layin to go but he has been money from beyond the arc I dont know what Colche was thinking He didnt even close out on it Four for five from the bonusphere for Robert McCrae The fifth Florida State leads by three Inside a minute to play in this first half Lungu in trouble Somehow the Skyhawks maintain possession inside 10 Buovich off the left wing deep over a defender off front iron and cleared by Basson cheering Jones McCrae great work on the offensive glass Bong had it knocked away though and UT Martin Hopkins Reese up there flatfooted just smacked it from behind Has a chance to tie this game here heading into the half Colche here comes the pressure by the NLES and Colch calls timeout And thats what we were talking about just a moment ago Florida State is mixing it up with what they do whether it realizes Look at Luke with a stare down Icy and here comes GT Martin Price lost the handle Miles pull up in transition off front iron But Florida State manages one last look heading into the locker room Eight points in the paint for UT Martin off that penetration So well get back to the action here at the Donald El Tucker Center It will be UT Martin now working right to left on your screen And theres another turnover by the Skyhawks Robert McCrae the fifth dumps it off to Steen And Steen and guess where it was Sean Short corner opposite block where he makes a living all night long Into double figures Back the other way Heres Lundru And theres that pressure Consecutive turnovers by the Skyhawks cheering And you can tell coach Lou talked about it in the locker room and thats uncharacteristic of Trinka Trinka is a really good ball handler and a good passer Thats he just let that one fly Yeah he was the primary ball handler a season ago for UT Martin led the team in assists Now here comes Denish running the floor Couldnt get the roll Steam fighting for the loose ball Swatting it away And that was last touch by a Skyhawk Last touch by Lungu and the toughness of steam down in the low post just won that possession back for the NLS Dont sleep on his his non jumping above the rim ability He can block shots That is no question 11 points a couple of blocks for Alex Steen Three rebounds all on the offensive glass And heres McCrae McCrae off of Denious Heres Pikovsky bringing it across into the fourth court for UT Martin Got a mouse in the house down low cheering Steam there to close out How good has Alex Steam been especially to start this second half Active hands and deflections count but so do follow through But right there tip that rebound out Steen is everywhere Fresh possession for the Seinals cheering Jones working on Trinka Somerville penetrating off of corner Bumps on the baseline I think hes got Book Miric riding him out of bounds Yep as he drove the baseline Hes trying to cut him off the baseline as his help like a help defender off the inbounds Quick trigger for McGee And thatll go to UT Martin A personal foul called I think against Le Jones It was He was right in his back and kind of went over his back and put a hand over his back and gave him a shove Thatll be the third personal on Leger Tough break for the semino for Jacksonville Hes two games in a row hes been sidelineed with some fouls and never really couldnt get into a rhythm in Gainesville with all the time that he spent on the bench for Florida State Trinka lost his footing Still got it to Denish who dumps it back down Here is the freshman once again batted around and man nothing is coming easy and that shot clock did not reset We had one official pointing at the shot clock A personal foul called against Bong But lets lets talk about Montes Ducius He is fearless Hes going in there The one dude hes just trying to go at those post players Anybody in the paint for Florida State he is goes at them so strong No fear in this freshman First free throw up and good already Two for three now Make it three of four for Montas And we see why hes back to back two weeks in a row Freshman of the week 11 points at ENLV 20 points five of seven three or four from three and seven rebounds at Bradley last week Id like to see another freshman doing numbers like that in the OBVC And a guy who represents Lithuania internationally he averaged 8 and a half points roughly at the FIBA U8 Euro baskets this season So a lot of quality experience even though he is just a youngster Somerville over the top and through Florida States got their own youngsters too Somerville the sophomore way downtown led led UMass Lel in threes Another turnover picked up by the Seinals and here comes UT Martin back the other way Povsky beat the song couldnt get the layin And how about the toughness by the seminals Somerville wrestles it away and McCrae lays it in and one Hes about to get a liftoff on there Sean He was ready to crank it up but Abaso was not having any part of that The step through to finish at the rim McCrae what a pickup for Luke LS in his first season here in Tallahassee 14 points looking to add to it here at the free throw line five of 11 from the floor Hes recorded three assists and hes a guy who can dish it to his teammates and set a program record Hes a guy that can drop nearly 30 on the road in Gainesville What is it about Robert McCrae that to you makes him so special Well hes a physical athletic guard cheering Hes unselfish And Florida State has really been menacing on defense Another turnover forced Just active even from the inbounds play here underneath the basket And another possession awarded to the NLES And theyre constantly using their hands trying to cause disruption and deflections is part of one of the things Luke Flowers wants his kids coming through with Off the weak side Maluke stick back wouldnt go Two good looks Im surprised they didnt fall Been a few of those tonight for Florida State They lead by nine and a bump is going to be called against Maluke 60 run for the NLES over the last 46 seconds Maluks got to let him go up top too He cant Dont put your hands on the guards Youre too big Just tall up Use your body and your size get the impression Jacob with the way that Florida State has been able to assert themselves this possession here for the Skyhawks is going to be awfully important cheering And its another turnover McCrae to Maluke dump off Bong and the Seinals are at full song in the second Timeout UT Martin Theyre definitely singing Sean 11point lead for Florida State early in the second half over UT Martin outscoring the Skyhawks 102 and theres more of that pressure by the Seinals and another turnover Here comes Kobe McGee Miles hit the step back and the tray cheering out of a call timeout Sean that is an absolute dagger for coach Short Everything going the nulls way here in the second half cheering We talked about handling these traps and pressure and its not going so well right here at the start of the second cheering Lunu trying to answer No good And a bump on the baseline Thatll go against Birroic But Coach Hamiltons got some unbelievable stories And theres a the ACC network is is doing a special on him that theyre releasing I believe in February that everybody needs to check out Its going to be worth it And Im sure the seminal production folks here at Florida State theyve got some unbelievable footage from his from him as well Speaking of unbelievable how about the burst provided by Cam Miles extending the Florida State run to 14 And the NLES are playing a brand of basketball that Coach Ham sitting in the front row courtside certainly is going to smile about here in this second half Its not his brand its Lukes brand but it sure is fun to watch and Cam Miles They were high on him and have said a lot of positive things about his scholastic play that most people didnt get to watch Better ball movement here for UT Martin And that is a much needed bucket Its a run buster for Trinka and puts an end to a 140 run by Florida State over two and a half minutes Jump ball called It will remain with Florida State And thats been the only thing that hasnt gone McCraes way here tonight Hes had a few decent looks Back iron just hasnt been friendly For the veteran though hes been able to cash in from beyond the arc And and thats what Coach L is talking to him about right this moment Hes talking to him about finishing at the rim and like going through it Hes you can see it with his hands Hes motioning right through it You got to love that And thats why these kids are so excited to play for him cuz he is in there been there done that You say it Its such a special opportunity for Florida State to have hired somebody of Luke Lapss caliber His seminals have played incredibly well here to start this second half and they are growing leaps and bounds That closeup right there Sean that 42 on his lapel I want everybody to recognize that Thats for Ryan Reed one of his teammates when he played Ryan Reed played here shortly after a function they had for Coach Ham back in the spring Ryan Reed had a massive heart attack and passed away on the highway And so the team is wearing that in remembrance of Ryan Reed Florida State applying the pressure right in front of it Sean I feel like Im trapped I know It held me speechless there for a second cheering Claustrophobic in fact Pikovsky tes up a three and Steen athletic rebound in traffic from the Florida Southern transfer Somerville for three The Nolles have found their rhythm They did make seven threes in the first half in a back and forth uptempo affair And while they do like the tempo to be quick it feels like the rhythm has been a little better in this second half as well I agree with you Sean And what Somervilles been able to add to them tonight with Chanty Wiggins not being in the starting lineup or dressed out has allowed Somerville more minutes and his offensive flow and really where hes really made some hectic things happen is on defense with his hands quick hands and deflecting some steals Neither of these teams led by more than five or in Florida States case six in that first half and the Nullles have established all kinds of breathing room here Cam Miles his distribution that one pass to the corner Somerville just doing what you should do if you play for Luke Lo Get behind that line square those feet up And theres Chanty Wiggins the most experienced guy on Florida States team Played at Clemson transferred in the offseason Theyll have him back there Blongu cheering excuse me That is cold sh the headband Sean got to keep an eye out for the headband I missed a seven is what happened 77 and seven I caught one Jones from in front of his bench Mirovich Florida State gets back on defense Now hell try to turn the corner Looking for room looking for help Rescued by Trinka Pedovski gets it to Trinka driving on the baseline Got tripped up by Swinton Its hard down there on the baseline And both these coaches emphasize stopping the baseline Dont let him penetrate baseline So if you dont beat your man to the line you got to let him go And its hard because you its just an instinct to try to stop him And then youre going to get that block called just like AJ and someone I cant remember exactly who was he had the same problem for UT Martin in the first half down of the other end Thatll be the fifth foul against Florida State as a team UT Martin with four Each team with a couple of substitutions here This team will earn another breather for Florida State cheering Maluke checking in There he is with the pass up to McCrae McCrae strong off the window Theres Maloo wrestling it down Miles from the opposite corner off back iron The foul called underneath the basket and against Florida State Craig got a little anti trying to get the rebound Gave a little shove in the back But hey news flash for uh UT Martin Luke LS kind of has kept that same baseline trap that Leonard Hamilton used when Luke played for him And dont throw that thing in the corner when youre out of bounds under youre going to get trapped And the hands have been incredibly ACTIVE FOR FLORIDA STATE LOVE screaming AND A FINISH HEY JAY SWINTON MY GOODNESS HEY dont get so excited young fella cuz if you slap the backboard youre getting what you get Thats a technical foul on the dunk over excited for the sophomore Caught that thing right off the bounce Thats a a lesson theyll talk about Such an unselfish pass and then just pulling chin ups maybe but cant slap it You got him front and center right here The camera these guys dont miss a beat You can see that raw emotion Eight points for Swinton in this game but the technical will send Ratikovich to the line cheering And Philip Ratakovich who was dayto day cheering with some injury issues coming in cheering Still have another free throw here cheering Sean Clarence Armstrong was confirming if he didnt did just did the dunk but the pull up in the slap got him the technical foul But in a game like this you got to do that Its just admiration for the refs They have a hard job No ones ever happy Eight points the emphatic dunk couple of steals Couple of rebounds for Swinton Hes had a good night UT Martin looking for an answer Pedro Santos checked in off the bench at the last stoppage and Santos rattles that through Held his pivot foot Still got that shot off And Robert McCrae the fifth fouled on the way in on the floor here against the Skyhawks turnovers they forced from UT Martin and then but 15 assists on 23 baskets as far as they when the game nearly hit the turnaround from the top of the key Heres Pikovsky Hes got four personals Lungu looking for space and thatll be called underneath the basket Santos went up skying for the rebound Problem is he went over top of a seminal Thatll be the sixth against the Skyhawks Next one will put Florida State into the bonus Both squads are putting their hands in their opponents backs on these rebounds sometimes and the official doing a great job calling that little push Oh what a find What a dish by McCrae the fifth and Aar Maloo lays it in for Florida State Great job with Malier Aar reeling in that bullet pass from McCrae and keeping it up high so the smaller Skyhawk didnt rip it from him Lead to 15 for Florida State Kicked out of play remains with the Skyhawks Well take another look at the pass with that athleticism of McCrae He has got a bullet pass and Maloo just reels it in Keeps it tall and high And lets not forget he should be a freshman Yes he was here at Florida State last year He reclassified to graduate early to get to Florida State and get to campus a year early So hes still growing and becoming the player that he will be as he gets there But McCrae is such an athlete Sixth assist of the game for Robert McCrae The fifth Santos pulls the trigger over Somerville Catches left iron Brought down by Buk Mirovich Back out to Santos UT Martin trying to swing it Now heres Povsky off the dribble penetration to stop that threepoint right there Bang forced a bounce pass on the perimeter which helps your defense come to you And so the penetration contact hits him up high You got a good call And hes taken a couple blows to the head tonight Yes he has That contact right here in front of the same place on the floor But the song on that play before to to force the penetration and not give up the open three cheering created a bounce pass on that perimeter ball movement which is a slower pass versus an air pass that goes straight to the guy next to you as Florida State gets away with a lot the way they whip that ball around spraying threes cheering Powski splits the pair of free throws and here comes McCrae after picking up personal foul number three tried to hit Alex Dean on the high low Its a turnover by Florida State One of the few just five now for them as a team Pikovsky trying to work around McCrae Thatll be personal number four on Robert And we talked about it earlier He has a tendency and and and this early in the game still save it for later Just let him get by you But hell kind of push up on guys in the back court But hes given an opportunity to Cam Miles whos having himself a pretty good little night As you mentioned Cam Miles subbing onto the floor in place of Robert McCrae the fifth Eight points three of six from the floor Made a couple of threes a couple of assists a rebound and three steals for the freshman Derwin Kitchen right there sitting beside McCrae one of Luke Ls former teammates that really ran the point in front of Luke until he graduated until Derwin graduated Player development coach for Luke LS Boy youre taking me back to the days where I was applying to Florida State and then the won the ACC championship when I was a freshman myself So boy trip down memory lane there if you will First in the history of the school for the program You got that right Inside 10 here in the second half Povski with an arm in the chest to Somerville gets it to Santos Pulls up from the logo and Steen there for the rebound into the corner Nice ball movement again Bong turned away Mirovich met him at the rim Fearless is a Skyhawk leader but Bong about to get him a highlight reel Kobe with a great pass Ban it and McMirish right there Let him play baby Its a block for Birovich whos got 14 and 11 A double double for Andrea here tonight Florida State turning up the pressure cheering 13 Theyre just hanging around 13 Colche fouled on the three Itll be a fourpoint opportunity for UT Martin You mentioned that they are hanging around and now theyve got a chance to cut it down to single digits And its what they do They just stay in the game They did it at UNLV And Colch right there drains it Steam closes out You know biggest thing is close out by the shooter Dont run at the shooter go by him just to intimidate him with some air and dont follow through hard swing but Colch stood right there know the knew the contact was flying at him knocked it down cheering allconerence player formerly with Schulman at Eastern Florida State College Northern Colorado transfer Montana won at both schools he really doesnt stack the stat sheet for you but hes a winner he wanted the big sky went to the tournament went to went to NIT tournament The guys a winner And just like that its a 6 run over the last minute and a half for the Skyhawks McKe up top Pristine Throw it high to the big fella If youre going to throw an interior pass throw it up at the rim Let him go catch it cuz no one else can go up there with him Bumeic in front of his bench All three of those for Andrea Down to single digits for under 10 Thats where you want to be if youre Schman Eight point game here in Tallahassee 17 points for Birvich Le Jones with the left hand Swatted away Lunu behind the back Nearly lost it in a sea of gold Birovich The toughness of the Skyhawk players is crazy their mental toughness and coach Schulman talked about it Theyre there with a purpose Theyre not there to go out and have fun Theyre there to play basketball and get an education Knocked out of play and right into my lap Thatll take us to the under eight media timeout The lead is eight for the seminal as as a way to get into the coaching business And they just hang together You see it right there playing But they got to hang right there Turning it over Florida State runs the floor again Swinton was looking to pick up a poster Bu Marovic rising with him to contest the dunk once again Just the wind ready with the and Birvich taking the contact getting hammered to the floor on the defense and the bench is like whoa As good as Buk Mirovich has been offensively how about the work those last couple of possessions on defense His his ability to defend those plays at the rim for his size Its crazy I would have never guessed that out of him Can the Skyhawks keep the run going No they cannot Swinton got a hand in there up ahead of the race Another dunk for AJ Swinton Clarence Arshaw giving him the stare down after that dunk because he was about to do the same play but Swins a big time athlete Thats all they talked about last year when he was a freshman was his athletic ability And he can shoot it too But were seeing some of that athleticism tonight Bir goodness I knew I was going to get tripped up Buovich from the wing Heres screaming Jones cheering Theyre parting the Red Sea right now Sean and and we got another defender coming in to help control the paint But the ball movement ability gives Swinton in the open floor to get the breakaway and just showing us his hops with that man bun That hair flops around a good bit when hes flying around Its like a propeller You think he gets extra lift Its lifted laughter I tell you he got some lift He and and Jay Jones wasnt playing around with his lift Look at that lift right there Cant beat it Im telling you You know its was a kid we had at Auburn Chris Porter And it was funny to hear that coach Moran was talking about it and Luke Blouse cuz they were talking about it cuz they saw him in the NBA But Chris Porter could jump out of the gym and he was everybody thought he was tall but he had this big kid in play style haircut this really big mini throw And then Moran was like when I saw him in real life I was like Man that hair is deceptive You know its kind of AJ he getting that deceptive hair Im just hoping some point in time maybe I can grow a little bit more so that maybe I can you know stand my hair up on end a little bit Got a little supply and demand issue here Theres all things things you can buy man They advertise everything laughter when he gets you know I dont even know the brands So back to the action here So back to the action here Jacob the cumulative effect of the way Florida State runs their offense under Luke Locks Getting into the paint kicking it out finding the open shooter right Obviously getting in transition helps but were starting to see the Cs part Its opening up those driving lanes Yeah the dunks have been fantastic but the reason that theyre happening in the first play is these lanes are just opening up and theyve worn them down Also its one of the things that Coach L talked about I was fortunate and visited with him and I had an earlier game and sat down with him for a little while before his first game and he was like Were going to play into shape and were going to be in better shape than everybody we play against and when we get to the ACC I dont know whos going to be able to run with us at that level So we got a little contact here to the head Theyre going to go get the review cheering Yeah the whistle was ahead of the action I was watching the inbound and from what were hearing there was a tech called against Florida States head coach Luke LS cheering and the Simol faithful are rewarding coach Luke him for defending his players cheering Duke Mirraovic makes the first free throw cheering and the second And just to sort of circle back to that sitting in on practice the players love their head coach and especially as a first year head coach with a roster that you have rebuilt showing your team that youre fighting there for them and with them Boy thats only going to build some of that credit here in Tallahassee for Luke Not that from what I gathered in practice that he needed to build much more equity anyway No and he does He He is a unique guy He was a great player and a great leader on his team full of good players and you know that that team they had was loaded in 2012 and and he was the the driver of the of the bus and hes driving that bus for his team every day and and really building something special with his style of play and the kids and the way they play UT Martin looking couple of free throws gets the layin to go Lu just went right through them to the ring Lu and Birroic have both had some timely answers in this game for UT Martin And if theres one run left in them its going to have to come quickly for the Skyhawks Theyre moving on defense well right now Theyre keeping Florida State out And as I say that Jones goes right to the rim But I like their patience also from Florida State not to just take a quick shot out there as theyre moving around Theyre looking for a good look in the half court set And this is a tough game for Florida State but this is what LA needs for his guys to get better And he knows that Thats why he put him on the schedule A chance for Le Jones to increase Florida States lead up to as many as nine here with the strip to the free throw line two of nine from the floor bounces the first free throw away And Florida State collectively as a team eight of 16 at the charity strike By contrast UT Martin has made 16 of 21 Second one is good The lead up to eight And Somerville got a hand in there off the inbounds And thatll be a reach called against the Skyhawks Thatll go against Lunu And its hard for Lunu and the rest of the Skyhawks cuz theyre not used to this explosiveness And and then you know if they decide to go theyre taking off Theyre not just penetrating Theyre dribble driving downhill attacking the rim and and its costing them some blocking fouls for Martin Florida State 18 steals as a team in this game They have turned over UT Martin 24 times have been getting after it on defense limiting the number of possessions that UT Martin has had To the Skyhawks credit once theyve gotten into their sets once theyve gotten into the front court they have been efficient Their offensive efficiency youre right is pretty solid scoring once they can get to the half court but they cant get over half court a lot here in the second half Florida State nearly came away with another steal just deflecting everything Active hands active feet making life difficult on the Skyhawks Pikovsky still with four has manage being in foul trouble for the majority of the game Nolles got in there still with the Skyhawks Lungu inside five Goes back up top two left Lungu heaps it from the wing and Steen clears the glass 10point lead for Florida State Somerville lost it out of play The half court defense is effective from both teams really But but UT Martin when they can stop the ball penetration theyre in good shape Its just when they can get penetrating Lungu short got it back though and its back up top Pikovski swings it to Buovich And Bu Mirraovic has eclipsed 20 points in this game 22 for Andrea Hes got such a sweet shot He finds a way and his teammates move the ball to make sure they get it to the guy they feel most comfortable shooting it Miles how good has the freshman been here today Its a little bit of a breakout game for him Everyones wondering where he fits and how he fits into his rotation Well hes showing you what he can do in the rotation Three of six from three into double figures 11 points for Cam Miles Lead still at 10 for Florida State Nice take there by Povski facing a couple of seminal defenders Laid it in anyway Trims the lead to eight Great action by the NLES Little wheel route curled that screen to it right down the front That was one that you could watch happen in slow motion Theres nothing Florida State does slow but you could watch it almost in slow motion there as they reextend the lead to 10 cheering from us And now heres Trinka Theyre so patient offensively even when theyre under duress that they dont speed up the Skyhawks UT Martin just stays with the offensive sets cheering Three minutes to play here in Tallahassee Lead at eight for Florida State miles off the turnaround makes that for Florida State applause Dont let that man in the kitchen cuz he is cooking tonight lets say So 15 points six of nine three assists as well for Cam Miles cheering Dump off by Denish Back out to Trinka Athletic rebound there by Jones in traffic And now here comes Leger Hes fouled on his way into the paint by Trinka Thatll take us to our final media timeout here in Tallah What does he do Well it is that he can shoot pass and dribble well Well I mean what else you need to do You know like that is thats hooping baby But he did it early He had 10 points in that exhibition game up in Birmingham and hasnt really got going until tonight The struggles continue at the charity stride for Florida State The lead back up to 11 though as Leger Jones splits the pair Povsky finds Trinka Nice ball movement there by the Skyhawks getting it to Pirrovich in the corner Short on the three though And now heres Miles all the way to the rack You know its one of those teams that the way its happening the last few days takes a different guy every night and its and L talked about that Hes like weve got a lot of guys that can do it and hes got a different guy turning the switch on every night cheering Florida State thought that was last touch by a Skyhawk Jose Jones wants our officiating crew to go to the monitor to no avail It remains with UT Martin 10 left for Trinka and company and Florida State Theyve turned over UT Martin a bunch in the full court but that is just showcasing how good the defense has been in the half court as well And thats been a point L has been wanting to work on and hes obviously getting the guys better at it because they just showed you that the sweet music to any head coachs ear is a shot clock violation off the defense cheering Florida State led by three at the half withtood some serious blows from Tennessee Martin at various points tonight McCrae calls his own number Doesnt get the roll but will shoot some free throws But when you assess what youve seen out of the seminals here in this second half what has impressed you most Jacob Their reaction coming out of halftime You know they came out of halftime and you know you were thinking that Schulman was going to be able to adjust and and not get turned over and get that pressure in check but their first few possessions I dont know three or four possessions in a row which is big bang boom uh turnovers for Florida State cranking that defense up and his guys to stay that focused and not play to the level of their competition because not not that you thats a negative thing but one of the things that I was talking to the assistant since today and Ben ODonnell who played with Luke LS uh said that they played at the level of competition If theyre good they play good If theyre if theyre not they dont And but they respect their opponent to bring it in the second half Cam Miles gets it ahead And Florida States just showing off how good they are offensively The depth the depth of Florida State has worn down You can see it in the Skyhawks Weve seen a before these guys been on the floor the whole night It seems 16point lead for Florida State inside the final minute Good ball movement there by UT Martin And Cam Miles who by the way his 17 points tonight a careerhigh will bring it into the four court for Florida State The big four for UT Martin has played over 30 minutes each Marovich has been on the floor for the whole game I dont think hes been out of the game 38 minutes in the game McCrae short on the three Florida State wins it back on the offensive glass cheering and applause and they can put this on ice cheering applause It wasnt easy but the Seinals came out of the locker room inspired tough resilient and now three and one Two
