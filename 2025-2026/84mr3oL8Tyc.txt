You saw Butter Johnson there Efim Johnson getting his first start as a Clemson Tiger today Well see his impact in the early going Itll be the Bears with B with the basketball Okoji setting things up for Mercer Back cut gets him free and a turnover Zig got when he gets in the lane hes dangerous there Clemson enough bodies to force the turnover Well he really is And he usually draws the foul He gets to the free throw line nine times a game Heres a look at Clemsons starting five A normal look except Johnson And theres a back door cut Nicely done Nick Davidson Little inverse high low there as the big feeds the guard for two Yeah back screen there by RJ Godfrey is what freed him up This is Quinton Perkins will fire and hits Mercers got good shooters Theres a lot of 35 37 38 shooters on this team right And they are athletic Look at those quick hands Justin Porter quick trigger answers Boy he got going the first half of the BYU game He is shooting it redot right now He really is Great pick up from the transfer portal by coach Brownell and his staff This is shoulders a whistle First foul of the game will go against Nick Davidson Heres a look at our sharp shooters One end to the other Perkins first Yeah we had a little miscommunication there leaving that shooter wide open And Justin Porter with the response Talked about the shooting there Perkins at 42 There are four volume threepoint shooters for Mercer in that ballpark and who is Mercers head coach Coach Ritters made several stops see you University of Tennessee at Martin They did a good job at UT Martin handful of years there and now trying to do something that hadnt been done in 5 years at Mercer thats finished with a winning record Theyre off to a very good start in that regard Pick and pop Davidson got it cold shooting to start his Clemson career If he can get that going itll open up a lot for him Yeah hes uh hes certainly a big key for this team and uh as you said he did get off to a cold start but hes picked it up a lot from the free throw line here of late Yeah Davidson 37 last year in Nevada just three for 16 from three coming into this game Heres Armani Mighty and an offensive foul Thats big for Clemson there because Mighty shooting over 70 Hes been very hard to guard for everybody He has Hes the transfer from Boston College Now you RJ had great position and you know a lot of times you see that flop and theyre doing the acting job but that was a pretty good shot he took right there Good job RJ Yeah Mightys not doing anything half speed right Davidsons got a mismatch with shoulders on him He spins the up and under Skill on display for Davidson with five quick ones Heres a Williams He fires Tried to bank it in from the corner Heres Porter The Tigers four for their first four Porter misses for the first time Tried to get the call and did not get it Mighty with the rebound and uh Hes had five double doubles so far this season Off to a good start in the rebounding category Williams a blow by Rejected Davidson cleans the glass Great job dropping down level with a basket ball right there and help playing good help side defense again A mismatch with the four The Tigers going to look to do that Shoulders just undized and Godfrey backs him all the way in I look for Mercer uh if they have trouble matching up manto man They play Ive been told they play as many as five different defenses So they may change defenses here multiple times Godfrey tightly guarding Mighty away from the basket Pick and roll Ooji drops it down and the hammer by Mighty Little delayed pick and roll that time coach Right Very effective Godfrey spins Didnt get the kind roll Okoji just had his first assist Looking for two and he gets it Williams finds a bucket 500 run for Mercer in about 20 seconds Yeah that was a deep three too Williams is a transfer from Wagner University A fouryear player there at Wagner 37 from deep and a giveaway Little transition Williams will fire again screaming Johnson the rebound Fastpaced game going up and down Theres the mismatch again Not a game for your defensive stalwarts there Any defense fans Brett two years ago looking to get to third consecutive NCA tournament And again off to a good start in the top 30 of the net rankings Chase Thompson a quick trigger three cheering Jim Davis told me just hours ago this is going to be Chase Thompsons breakout game and buddy off to a good start Good start Deep three from the corner I love it Okoji barking out instructions with his team down six Carter Welling all over mighty there and Ace Buckner got a little handsy Timeout on the floor in Clemson The Tigers up early Quote he says Hey be patient and he knows hes theyre going to have a good team because the strength of the team is the team and he showed that by going five in five out which is a rarity for a coach to do but hes comfortable doing it How about Mercer How about Perkins coming out of the timeout launching one in hes got six in the early going Two for two from deep Jake Wallen coming off the bench and Zack Foster threw it away looking for Welling to cut Willing stopped a step short there to post up and he had a guy on his back Got to do better job getting the ball to him Zack these two teams have combined to make six of eight threepoint attempts so far in this game Heres Okoji fourth in the SoCon in scoring first in assists and he gets his cookies taken by Carter Welling cheering How about that quickness for a big man Wallen coming off a ball screen Pick and pop Welling short Good rebound Wallen hits Welling down the lane Hell get free throws Perkins Perkins picks up the foul but hes off to a good start Look at the distance there Yeah got to close out much quicker than that Mr Buckner I think Coach Brownell may be speaking to him about just that thing right across the way Carter Welling a really good foul shooter Sitting at 72 on the season Hes been very good of late Second free throw up and good Welling has now made 14 consecutive free throws And Im saying it now because I dont want to trigger any commentary from the folks back home Okoji working off the left wing Back to the basket Mighty A strong move from Mighty and he delivers over Welling A lot of bumping going on in there between Mighty and Welling Tigers up three Wallen gets the entry angle he wants Trying to get Mighty away from the basket with ball screen Chase Thompson the beneficiary and bricks one This is Kyle Cuff Jr Syracuse transfer He lost the handle Freshman Zack Foster the trigger man for the Tigers offensively 15 to shoot Late clock The balls in Wellings hands Buckner inside the arc cheering Somebodys got to shoot it Foster will way short May have been blocked by Servin whos at his fourth school And a shot clock violation there for the Tigers Partially blocked Is high level It is no doubt And once again he transferred from Boston College He talked about his five double doubles averaging 14 and nine and that includes a game against Tennessee where as you can imagine that was a war in the paint right Thompson Bowling Arena in Knoxville 10 Tristan Gross gives it off to Servin Okoji a skip eyes in the back of his head and a connection from deep Brady shoulders a 29 threepoint shooter and Mercer is ablaze right now The Bears four for six from deep Thats a great job assisting by Okobi Okoji Wallen with size takes advantage Tigers in front now 1917 cheering Seven different Tigers have now scored and were not even eight minutes into the ball game Nice spin move Okoji stop and pop First miss for Okoji Ace Buckner wide open Good rebound Chase Thompson on that back side Thompson ready to shoot if he gets it in that corner Dylan Hunter an opportunistic shooter sees one Welling and serving able to come down with it Okoji transferred in from Memphis Hes been in this building once before Played a little bit against the Tigers last year Jake Wallen Thompson going to work on shoulders No advantage game there Theyll enter the other side out of the help Dylan Hunter Clemson you got to make them pay for a double team down on the block Bears will call timeout and well take a timeout with them They take it to national championship games Uh but George Bennett just had such an impact He started something called the Tiger Cub for the children to get them involved early in when he was AD at Ferman football team won a national championship I mean you he and his wife Nancy certainly well respected members in the community beyond just a service to Clemson but boy itd be great just from a Clemson perspective to honor his memory with a good performance today So far so good on the offensive end in that regard That is true But Clemsons having trouble stopping their uh down after RJ Godfries whistled for the foul Thats his first interesting situation on Mercers bench Head coach uh and his son Coach Ritter and his son are well blocked by Davidson Yeah its a family affair over there on the sideline and two brothers on the sideline there Head coach and assistant coach Wellraveled You spend a lot of time in some smaller gyms and small I this this is a group of grinders right here that have really worked their way up through the profession No doubt about it and uh you got to pay your dues and those guys have done it Perkins misses Perkins playing with two fouls Wallen in transition Jake Wallens had a lid on the basket for about a half dozen games Im sure thats a sight for sore eyes to see one find the bottom of the net No doubt Its his first threepoint bucket of the game And with his length hes a tough matchup for a small forward Last five games coming in just one for nine from three This is a guy that came in as a three and D with length Nice floater right there at the top of the key Gross Foul line extended Able to drop it in Some good shot making going on in this game No doubt about it And a foul called If thats Perkins thats his third foul So Quinton Perkins who averages over 12 a game for Mur fouls coming at really a a bad leading scoreer in the gym right now with six in significant foul trouble at the moment with over nine minutes left in the first half Oh a nifty move from Davidson Nice whirl move That quickness I havent seen out of Davidson before That was really quick You never know how transitions are going to go in the transfer portal Feels like Davidson has really taken a little bit to find his real niche on this team And theyve maybe had a little bit of a hard time finding ways to get him intimately involved in things And you could tell even in New York there were times against BYU there were times against Alabama where they found ways to get in the ball in the right spots Right Heres a look at some of the shooting right there while in transition And guess who found him Dylan Hunter Dylan Hunter with the assist No assist needed on Grosss bucket there in the lane Again these two teams going tip for tat What a shot by Okoji Tried to draw the foul didnt get it parallel to the ground Banks it home Okoji couple of assists already today Hes got himself a bucket there Heres Davidson Hes a skilled big Sees the pass Justin Porter follows his own Itll stay with Clemson there Theres shoulders not able to save it in One more look at Okoji the finish Look at that I started to say great balance but that was off balance as you could be Thats a great finish Great everything Yeah And we were both in shoot around today Clemson spent a lot of time reinforcing You cannot foul him He wants you to foul him Right there is the second time he went in trying to draw contact That time he just happened to finish as well Well he scored 29 points at Elon 18 of 20 from the free throw line Carter Welling has it rim out from short distance Mercer a chance to take the lead Okoji going to work on Porter Oh nice bounce pass and the kind bounce off the back iron from Williams Hes got five Mercer has taken the lead Thats a steal Hunter got his pocket picked by Williams Third turnover of the game for Clemson Servin is a great shooter Has a mismatch with Hunter on him inside Dylan though walls up nicely Shot clock winding down Okoji fades knocks it down cheering applause How about the start from Mercer threepoint lead cheering Mercer fronting the post not letting Clemson get to their high low I tell you you got to appreciate Mercer if uh because they are being really really tough and physical inside with those big uh oversized post players Ill tell you what feed Nick Davidson right now if youre Clemson Hes four for four with nine points Hes showing us some nifty moves in the early going Okoji the maestro Look at that skip rebound serving Long shot long rebound Second chance opportunity They clear out Wellings on his own Now they help him and its stolen away And a whistle there against shoulders leads us to a timeout on the made those threes The Tigers with four threepoint makes with four different players on their end RJ Godfrey back in the lineup after a rest Heres Budda Johnson Nice kick to Foster Foster you got to take that one Hes going to take this one Almost got it to go Theres one guy on this team that I think when he sees a oneonone hes got really the full bag of tricks at his disposal And its that young man who is going to be a real problem in the ACC Mighty inside got the seal on Godfrey Armani Mighty now Six points three rebounds Johnson to tie it Another offensive rebound cheering Tigers have just two second chance points on four offensive rebounds And that continues with the giveaway Lets handle the ball one more time Little more length on Okoji with Johnson there defensively Pick and roll Justin Porter making it hard on Okoji Palm fake lean shot blocked with a foul and Brad Brownell cant believe it While Brad Rell Ryan Ritter head coach of the Bears UT Martin really good coach The results would back that up Finished below 500 last year but again theyre halfway to their win total from last year already We havent even gotten to Christmas yet As coach doing what he does best get to the free throw line And hes going to make him Hes 85 No doubt Mercers got its largest lead 3126 Tigers going to flip the side and run a set here Foster gets inside Blow by in the layin Great athlete Nothing but a big big upside for Zack Foster Breaks a two and a half minute scoring drought for the Tigers Williams inside the arc Quick trigger Boy that guy catches like a shooter He just moves like he knows what hes doing out there No doubt How about shoulders takes it away but he stepped out of bounds Second time he took the ball away Blowby and a finish Tigers though down five to Murf finish but program records and wins and then they lose 90 of their points In fact theres one contributor that returns and they got balance The balance and the depth of the roster is the strength of this team No doubt about it They can play uh 10 deep and not lose a lot And we saw already early in the game about the 16minute mark all five starters exit five new players come in Weve seen that a handful of times this season already No drop off and youve had several players start that are now coming off the bench Jake Wallen was a habitual starter for this team coming off the bench today Welling a misguided hook shot and it goes off Foster out of bounds Mercers made six of their last seven from the floor Some of the shots are tough but it feels like Mercers executing pretty flawlessly Theyre getting where they want to go Well Joby creates a lot Hes a very good guard Very good point guard Creates a lot Six points four assists already Okoji going to work on Foster Little nudge and a step back 3528 a sevenpoint Mercer lead Welling refuses the handoff and theres a whistle Fouls going to be called against shoulders Heres a look at Okoji again Coach up a little shoulder bump there Little push off Little step back Finished for a Clemson fan Heres a look at the foul before we get to that Shoulders on the reach in a lot of contact in there Yep Neither team in the penalty yet Look at Okojis game Little Maris Reed in there if youre a Clemson fan right Get into that midrange Little elevate slight fade a little bit undersized Heres Welling going in with bad intentions but couldnt get it to go cheering Good pocket pass by Dylan Hunter right there but got to finish it big guy Okoji inside the paint skip to the far corner serving Mighty goes down and the Bears a little discombobulated Well then he got up and hes got a chance at a threepoint play and its a ninepoint Mercer lead The Bears pouring it on right now with a 6 run Does it help him to take a seat here coach Well that was a really really bad mistake of helping way out too far there by Carter and left his music man wide open Uh really I thought uh I thought Butter Johnson committed the foul way before they called it Free throw off the mark Clemson facing a ninepoint deficit Dylan Hunter tries to shed Williams harder than hed like cheering Davidson short Nice hustle by Wallen cheering Godfrey with a new clock Nice feet inside but Davidson he called for the ball and then couldnt hang on Got to shoot that one RJ Got to shoot that one You cant get it He didnt have any better position than you had Fifth turnover for Clemson cheering which is unusual in itself 90 seconds to play in the first half Mercer trying to really put a chasm between itself and Clemson Williams feeling good on the hop Transition chance for Wall Johnson inside the lane tough runner He continues to impress He had a couple of games where he didnt do much but in the last four or five games he has really come on as Mercers got a timeout against BYU defending especially the big BYU game You could tell that Mercers watched that film cuz a lot of what they call one five ball screens where you get the point guard with the ball and put the five in a screen action after the two lobs that BYU was able to execute down the stretch Heres another one right here One five ball screen Okoji in the lane Rims out Rebound Wallen Thats five boards for Jake Wallen Go along with five points for him Give that man a shot Well find Dylan Hunter trailing to play Got it Good ball movement Little kick back right there on that uh pass from Wallen to Dylan Its usually Dylan to Wallin but uh yeah Hunter gets the assist for a change Makes the shot Five for Okoji Step back Oh what a shot What a way to end the first half Okoji offensive rebounds That was a problem in the second half against BYU too Even in the first half the Tigers werent capitalizing at the rate youd like to see on second chances Clemson will inbound to start the second half here The fans who maybe thought they were going to be in for again a leisurely stroll through a basketball game they may need to be ignited here at some point to help the Tigers out Dylan Hunter first possession post entry RJ Godfrey elevates he is such a confident player more so than when he left after the 2023 24 season You know I was talking with the coach this morning one of Clemsons assistants and uh they said you know Dylan Hunter is is the leader of this basketball team but RJ Gods the heartbeat of this basketball team came back after a stint at Georgia How about the floater inside Okoji just backing down Johnson isolated that side over there Clear cleared out the entire side and he had better oneonone Johnson got the start today Bit of a quiet first half Justin Porter quick trigger Boy quick release Its disarming for the defense even in a smaller body Yep Now that defender was within arms length of him that was a really quick release as you said Perkins back on the floor There he is with the three fouls Long euro step for Williams there Shoulders out of a double team Moji short and theres Johnson with a board RJ got the hand on that to tip it away from Mighty deep position Davidson all by himself Again we were not seeing that from Davidson in the month of November in a Clemson uniform That was right down the right down the floor I mean a direct look I dont know what they were thinking in terms of Marshall That one five ball screen and Okoji is fouled on the way by Heres a look at RJ Godfrey now Tigers within one He gets the bucket to start the half on the entry Coach its just a confident Look how spring he is getting off the floor Yeah quick off his feet No doubt Theres a look at him He of course was an integral part off the bench of the Tigers run of the Elite 8 He goes to Georgia looking for a starting role from the outset I think Bradell kind of missed him too and so in our what an impact Brad Bryell has made on him and how excited he is to be back Yeah Not just on the basketball court but he said he made an impact on him in life and thats thats what he misses And RJ with the steal right there 101 Godfrey all by himself cheering Just like that Clemsons in front by a point And here comes the crowd on a Saturday afternoon Clemsons heartbeat right there Seven straight points for the Tigers Defense to offense Okoji clears out One four low Spinning Missed it Okoji kind of jogging back and Hunter threw it away cheering Dylan Hunter says the pass was tipped That might be worth a coachs challenge They may have a point on that one Tigers going to put in their pocket though Much more active and aggressive defensively The Tigers We saw it the first couple of minutes And then Dylan Hunter is going to be whistled for the foul Again we talked about activity aggressiveness Mercer was more aggressive in the first half Well you talked about mismatches Mighty and Hunter was a mismatch Dour and Hunter had no choice but to drag him to the ground Okoji from his knees A low release and Mercers back on top Okojis now got 15 Strong screen from Davidson told you only a 24 threepoint shooter but he made that one I tell you what you wouldnt know it Oh Porter blows the layup there Mercer was going to let him have it Williams with seven points Feeds it off Godfrey physical with Mighty Five to shoot screaming cheering again They clear out for Okoji Step back foul line Thats his move Thats big time Thats his move every time to get inside the threepoint line and go to work 17 points for Okoji Porter looking to answer Cant get it applause Similar to what we saw in the first half Back and forth to start Mighty with deep post position on Godfrey Okoji again They clear him out Pocket picked Porter to Hunter off two feet Throws it down Twoon one again Defense to offense Offense right Left elbow Mighty has it knocked away cheering and applause Godfrys done that a couple times Serving Godfrey switched on to him Serving will fire Rims out Clemson to tire take the lead now after the empty series Davidson going to work and hes fouled Tigers turning defense to offense in the second half within two after the steel and the flush down on the baseline Porter gets inside throws it up and a whistle He got bailed out there He thought about two things and really dis Hope hes shooting Tough to guard when the player doesnt even know what hes doing laughter And he might have been better off making the pass because uh Carter Welling is wide open But we tried to make that pass earlier in the first half there and we threw it out of bounds Justin Porter to tie the game Knocks it down Clemson perfect from the line Just four times theyve gone there though And now a little pressure just a little bit Make things more difficult on Okoji Wear him down hopefully You mentioned changing defenses You know neither team has really done a lot on the defensive end so far for both teams playing as efficiently as they have on offense Heres serving on Davidson Three seconds You would think heres shoulders to the basket Blocked cheering in by Wallen Wallen got a piece and the English got it to go anyway Yep Aggressive denial there by shoulders Any pass parallel to the half line is a bad passing angle Porter for the lead Nope Heres a look at the Bears on the offensive end here And a tough finish Shoulders now with six points Mercer nine assists to seven turnovers Both teams with a positive assist to turnover ratio today And Okoji takes a seat Now again this is critical spot for the Tigers because Okoji has not taken a break so far in this game Portland got a hand on that one Just couldnt come up with it Tigers much more active away from the ball in the second half like that right there Good help side defense by Jake Wallen Wallen could play in transition Welling refuses goes up banks it home Were tied He got the switch big on little that time Right up over the top of Zer Williams Perkins now with the basketball again Hes been protecting three fouls He had six points quickly in this game Williams Oh gets the roll cheering Look at the finish over Foster 18 Bit of a scissor kick to boot right there Wasnt much contact at Denny screaming Threepoint play Every time Clemsons come at Mercer the Bears have responded Now heres a little fullcourt pressure Change up on the missed free throw Theres Davidson all the way in Lost it on the way up but Mighty is whistled for the foul And thats three A look Good job coming after the basketball Some people just come over there and put their hands straight up Doesnt do any good And Welling on the other end He fronts the post He gets ahead of the pack Davidson misses the free throw first good foul shooter through his career and this was the prized pickup for Clemson in the transfer portal out of Nevada His brother Blake was committed to Nevada Ended up signing with Clemson after Nick came over in the portal Hes red shirting this year for the Tigers We used to call that a cow and a calf deal Ah yes Cow and a calf If you didnt know youre here for all of the uh East Tennessee expressions from my good friend Jim Davis here Theres one on the tote board Williams from the parking lot Foster picks it out of the air Threeon two ALL THE WAY ZACK FOSTER MY GOODNESS SKYWALKER with authority The freshman ties the score There cheering are things he can do that not everybody can Okoji got him off his feet for a moment Williams the answer Zire Williams with 13 cheering Second threepoint make for Williams Chase Thompson wants a response Fosterss got it after the ricochet Another offensive rebound Lets see if we can get some points off second chance points here Opportunities Welling thought about it Going to go to work downhill May have gotten blocked That might have been a goal too Close Mercer up three with 1050 to go serving Williams That was that was the shot they were looking for too They fired up for that one You wonder when they move Okoji away from the ball Porter tries to shadow Okoji with 12 to shoot Foster too strong Rebound batted around Shoulders has it Oneonone with Wallain And a layup Good Fivepoint advantage for Mercer And a timeout called by Clemson Zack Foster electrified this gym for a moment Quick down the floor and the flush down the lane Tigers down five I would have players come up to me afterwards and say it meant so much more to me than I think it did to the the young people Mean a lot to the young people in attendance today if the Tigers could get some stops Down five to Mercer The Bears keep coming Dylan Hunter around the corner Misses a floater Davidson the rebound Coach we were talking about it during the break Thats the eighth offensive rebound for Clemson Only two second chance points in this game Theyve not capitalized As close as he got that thing to the basket He didnt need to put it on the floor Go up and score Shoulders guarded tightly by Davidson Williams fires while fortunate there Williams averaging 11 points on the year and hes already got 15 today Fourth foul there on Armani Mighty A critical call as we go to break here in Clemson Mighty has had to go to the bench now He picked up his fourth foul against RJ Godfrey who makes the first free throw there Coach thats a significant development in this game because Clemsons most consistent offense has come on points in the paint through back to the basket play Yeah and theyve uh theyve got a few good feeds to the post in there but theyve got the ball in there sometimes and they just simply havent been able to put the ball in the basket like Nick Davidson on that offensive rebound All he had to do is go up and I know its easier over here than it is out there but uh double team kick out Perkins with 10 on the clock Davidsons on the ball now with Okoji fire from three Air ball short That was not his best decision today Thats really the only Well Im not saying the only bad decision but he hadnt made many bad decisions today Thats for sure Now I told you he was only a 24 threepoint shooter Uh so be careful RJ Yeah RJ just about caught a cheapy there But a Johnson Hunter in the corner Got it Dylan Hunter is an opportunistic shooter He doesnt shoot a ton but hes over 40 from three when he does You know hes shooting the ball so much better this year than he has in years past And its obvious hes done the work in the the summer Much improved as a shooter And something tells me there will be more volume to come especially as the Tigers get into ACC play Serving backing down Johnson gets the banker again A response from Mercer every time Clemson starts coming Foster downhill Missed the layup Skip pass up ahead Wing three Perkins rimmed out Box is an athlete He was way above that rim on that rebound Godfrey dunks it No whistle there from Servin applause cheering Foster By the way Brad Rell was upset with him He didnt work quite hard enough at one of the timeouts He hustled all the way back after the miss layup to get the rebound Yeah Well that really wasnt a foul on RJ right there That was layup there by Perkins Miss That was a good find by Okoji Thats a layup missed on both ends here Johnson rushed Not a good shot brother You want to see that maybe later in the clock right Right Heres Perkins now Mercer shooting 56 for the game over Godfrey Short Johnson A rebound Clemson wants to push They can Foster in the corner Good block out by Zar Williams right there on RJ applause Mercer minus seven on the glass But again theyve done their job in first shot defense today One for low Yeah heres ISO Okoji gives it up this time Two to shoot over Foster That was a good job by Foster right there Perkins had no choice there Had to put it up Made the shot fake cheering cheering RJ Godfrey to Zack Foster Now 10 on the clock RJ thats a flop Oh boy I mean but you could tell thats sort of I think Mercer understands the sizewise at a disadvantage So that thats about the third time youve seen them really lean into the contact there down inside Okoji on the bounce Heres Williams Tigers switching everything right now defensively with seven to shoot Armani Oh my god Shoulders way off Thats two air balls in the last couple minutes late in the clock for Mercer Armani uh M is back in the game now Clemson really missed an opportunity when they had him on the bench with four fouls and uh didnt take advantage of it Clemsons next game Tuesday against South Carolina Thatll be nationally televised Good opportunity for both teams Zack Foster step back Got it Tigers lead with 440 to play Ice water in his vein Zack Foster is a freshman Hes not cheering supposed to be able to make that pressure shot is he You know hes 0 for five from three but he cheering really never factors that into his shot taking decision Guys got the unconscious streak of a much older player Okoji the help the turn no good Good defense and finished by Dylan Hunter and finished with the defensive rebound Davidson the screen and a foul called against Okoji have their 36 here in the second half The Tigers have made half of their shot attempts Thats why theyre back in front And they theyre working on points in the paint in there too Thats the reason their shooting percentage is going up RJ Godfrey got deep rejected cheering Mighty from the backside Swats it off the underside of the glass Exactly what coach Brownell wanted RJ was trying to make too many moves there You got to power it up sometimes Serving looking for a lob Mighty again Playing with four Forgett Okoji with eight to shoot now screaming again Switching everything Dylan Hunters on him Okoji to tie the game Missed it short and Foster with the rebound Zack Foster has seven points and seven rebounds off the bench today Hook wanting to push that basketball down the floor Porter off two feet Justin Porter a quiet second half Hes now got 10 for the game Three Tigers in double figures A 70 run for Clemson now Tigers led 12 to four early in this game but thats as far as it got And they didnt lead by eight for long Mercer came right back Foul called against Zack Foster there That was great footwork on the part of Zack Foster that the the foul was created by the offensive player but uh nice use of jump stop there for Porter And heres the foul I got to be honest I dont I dont know what a defender is supposed to do differently there Right Three off the mark Clemson guards are really doing a good job rebounding here on the defensive end The difference between a good rebounding team and a great rebounding team is how well your guards rebound Lean rebounder We told you Foster was seven Porter looking for Davidson Had the duck in for a moment Didnt have the passing angle though Good good decision not to pass that one Dylan Hunter with three to shoot Hoist from deep and he is clobbered applause They going to the line to shoot three Thank you Serving came way out He was flying in the air Watch this I mean this close out is unbelievable from Servin Look how high he is in the air cheering He had no chance to avoid a foul there right Big free throws right here Clock scoring with the clock stopped Hunters first free throws in the game cheering applause Dylan Hunter a veteran presence Tigers were down five on Tuesday night in Madison Square Garden against BYU He had taken two shots all game Dylan Hunter wanted the three at the top of the key to cut the lead cheering to overtime if not for the heroic miracle shot by the Cougars Again two shot attempts the whole game but he wants it in his hands in these moments 17 seconds He scored five points in 17 seconds He makes all three free throws there and Clemson leads now by seven A 100 run and a sixminute scoring drought for the Bears Okoji goes up and will get some free throws Foster got him Thats his third Heres a look at it The start and stop of Okoji Little nudge from behind from Foster Okoji now at the line These are two big free throws again 6 minutes and 2 seconds without a point for Mercer and he misses 85 from the line He leads the Southern Conference in free throw attempts and free throw makes this season just his third and fourth free throw attempts of the game Coach Don Billy Donan and coach Brad Brownell had Zack Fost there for a teaching moment Here comes that press that they worked on today in shoot around cheering pass stolen away Serving up ahead shoulders screaming foul and again Tigers get down way way way early I mean left for dead against Alabama on the road Second half of the game there see from a Brad Brownell coach team Right Or any coach team Thats right Spoken like somebody who knows Two free throws missed by shoulders 75 coming in cheering Mercers missed some opportunities They missed three of four at the line A 706 foul shooting team right And a lot of that attributed to Okobi Okobi Foster five to shoot Triggers missed it short Heres Okoji back the other way Layup good off the glass and a timeout called by the Bears Three straight points now in that group as you can imagine Furman is number two And like I say they get to go on the home floor Both those teams right at the start of conference play Dylan Hunter trapped in the corner Clemson still with two timeouts Didnt have to use one there Foster all the way Jams Oh my Oh my word Foster with authority down the lane Skywalker No reverse on that gear shift He was full throttle all the way Godfrey the rebound Heres Zack Foster screaming with an exclamation point all the way coast to coast I mean he responded like hes done that a million times Freshman true freshman one of the highest caliber recruits Brad Brownell has ever signed His brother Marcus played at Ferman transferred late in his career to Xavier and Zack from a recruiting standpoint a little higher caliber but Foster was an incredible player part of some really good Furman teams here in the local area as well as what he did when he transferred up to Xavier 46 seconds remaining in the game RJ Godfrey at the line Missed the front end Mighty the rebound Mercer has one timeout left They need a bucket Okoji may not give it up He does there Too strong on the three Mighty the rebound He dunks it with two hands Fourpoint game Clemson in front Becomes a press as you might expect Pass goes in to Justin Porter Davidson loses it Gathers it back Fosters fouled He might have tried to dunk the next one He wanted to You can see those eyes get big Got to make free throws Good teams make free throws down the stretch when the pressures on Zack Fosters first trip to the foul line today He is 4 for 11 from the floor but that is not remotely adequate to talk about his impact particularly in this second half Hes a 83 free throw shooter on the year One and one Was I supposed to say that Is that the old broadcaster jinx Im sorry laughter Well see coach Well see Come on Zach Bail me out Now four Tigers in double figures Godfrey with nine There he is Right there 50 this trip Okoji with it Team down five Hes got a window to shoot it And he missed badly Dylan Hunter stole Godfreyys ninth rebound Theyre going to talk about that later This is the significance of today This is the year I like where your heads at there Clemson up six now with 107 seconds left And it speaks to certainly longevity but it speaks to consistency No doubt We talked about Clemson looking to go to the tournament for the third consecutive year 20 plus wins for the fourth consecutive year Off to a good start to get there Top 30 in the net Still very early No league games under their belt yet And every team they have played if Im not mistaken has been very highly ranked Thats right No bad losses so far at all Okoji going to work on Foster He falls down turns it over and thats going to do it A nip and tuck struggle today between the Tigers and the Bears And its
