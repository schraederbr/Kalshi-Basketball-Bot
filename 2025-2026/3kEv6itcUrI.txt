Georgia Tech was eight of 11 and a win against Merist Mohamed Sila wins the tap and here are the Jackets with Lamar Washington at the front of the offense Yeah I think Damon starts figured out that Lamar should be the point guard from here on out Reeves this is Cam Craft and back to Washington playing in his 105th college game Three ball front rim miss And this is Mark Butler averaging almost four assists a game and nearly nine points You see the lineup Williams Butler Andrew Phillips on the perimeter Share Jackson good freshman to keep an eye on And this is Cila through the steel and the layup fell off the iron Washington couldnt finish it Are you kidding me You steal the ball put ball around your back with the left hand lay at 610 And theres Mohamd in the lane and Georgia Tech on the board first Good job Mo Find that little pocket little touch shot Get the Jackets on the board Third straight game By Dongo not playing tonight Neither is Jaden Mustaf who misses a second straight game And theres a three from Phillips out on the perimeter and Lafayette answers Yeah you got to keep eye on Phillips Quick release out the ball as you can see Knocked down a big three Told you Williams the third best scoreer in the Patriot League Andrew Phillips is seventh at almost 15 a game And Craft the answer on the perimeter Good early sign for Cam Craft Great call partner Two guys that can really shoot the ball So they have to keep eye on each other tonight Good thing we told you about threes Theres another one for Lafayette And its strong from Humphrey Rebert and a lead catch for Reeves Hell turn in front and thats Share Jackson The rebound Yeah Ku didnt make that shot but I like the fact that Lamar Washington is advancing the ball to try to get some early offense Williams back for Jackson who squeezes around Mohamed Silla and scores Share Jackson talented freshman I really like his game James understands where he is as a young m young guy playing in the Patriot League Good call Out of the corner of Kai Fleming who draws the start again tonight Four double figure games in his last five pass Craft couldnt handle it Priscilla and it will go back to Lafayette And with that heres Chaz Kelly An early substitution off Damon Stoddires bench Well to your point right there Jackson using his body great to get around Caler for the left hand layup So Williams with Butler in the back line Phillips who weve already seen knock down the three And heres Jackson at the front of the key cheering Williams all the way through Kick out Corner three is short Jackson with the big rebound Using that body once again cheering Butler wheeling through traffic Back for Jackson Lay up Good Good job Butler keeping his dribble alive not picking it up early And then Jackson once again using his body nice around the basket Lafayette an early twopoint lead here back door the lob Washington waited patiently You called it pardon No ball pressure on Washington Good vision for the line Seven all game three minutes in Jackson nice pass in traffic Butler couldnt do anything with it 10 to shoot And heres Williams Got Washington into a screen Fall away is good First basket for Caleb Williams We talked about a partner in the pregame show Under control Gets into the paint Doesnt rush Big time shot And a foul as a pass ahead to Aai Flemings going to get Georgia Tech a couple of free throws Andrew Phillips his first Thats the first on Lafayette Were already seeing substitutions at the table now both ways as a Kai Fleming will go to the line He is 73 on the year And the first one good for Fleming David Starttomire season number three here in Atlanta 38 wins enjoyed our visit with him this morning after the shoot around about all things with this team and the learning curve hes going through with the team No question about it And and thinking big picture knowing this team is trying to figure out who they are from an identity standpoint but I mentioned it earlier I think he finally figured out that Namar Washington should be the point guard now You can build from there Bevel was coming to the ball game He wears 34 for Lafayette Hes also been joined by Joshua Weiss who wears number 23 for the Leopards So a couple of bigs off the bench for coach McGarvey Jump shot got left on the rim Heres Washington trying to steer Georgia Tech in transition again Cut through and Fleming couldnt control it And Anthony Eates who works with Justin Porterfield and AJ Des Andrew Phillips for his second You see Lamar Washington breaking down the defense again and Fleming doing a great job moving without the basketball And off the bench quickly comes Kamani Murdoch 66 sophomore from Mount Pleasant South Carolina So hes in the neighborhood so to speak over in the Charleston area Hes into the lineup for the first time averaging about three a game Chaz Kelly on the floor with Payton Marshall who plays at the post and has the ball now Inside goes Marshall up strong Okay big fella Nice spin cycle to the baseline under control and finishes it Yeah hes only averaged about three and a half minutes the last couple ball games but early bucket from Marshall Baseline Butler left wide open I like what I see out of Butler early in this game under control finding his spots Heres Washington or Fleming rather pull up on the baseline and Weiss back into the front court Williams against Reeves Bevel behind the bounce pass Heres Butler and turned over into traffic Heres Reeves Oh a little euro and then got it stripped out Itll stay with Georgia Tech Timeout on the floor though Weve played five minutes here in Atlanta Kaci Reeves and the Jackets and Lafayette tied here at 11 Caleb Williams already on the board for one bucket and then back door to Mohamed Sil Back to Midtown in a moment Starttomire gave everybody a chance to cut through the chase He gave everybody a chance Washington is a differencemaker for where they may be able to go More ball games Understands what the task is each night as being a real point guard or quarterback on the floor Out of the corner three ball is good Lamar Washington on Q So that lets you know now that Damon has a comfort level now with a seasoned guy running the show The fact that the head coach and Washington are both from Portland is irrelevant to the conversation but it dont hurt laughter It doesnt hurt at all But it dont hurt Yes sir Heres Williams stripped of it by Washington Outlet for Reeves Hes got Kelly with it Kesi to the basket Good move First points for Kesi Reeves Jr And once again Damon talked about the defense being the key to get out and getting an easy offense Fivepoint lead for Georgia Tech Remember Andrew Phillips who got off to a hot start for them with an early threes to the bench now Heres a long three by Williams at a back rim miss And Payton Marshall whos getting some early spin Yeah Trying to get that confidence back from Damon Reeves out front back quickly from Marshall He couldnt handle it Turned it over to through Betnost a big sophomore from the Ukraine into the ball game And here goes Williams 13 to shoot for the Leopards who trail by five And the miss on the three out of the corner off the hand of Murdoch Washington all the way through and off the glass with a left hand Confidence right there Playing through the contact Good poise steals sharing the ball Corner three Sevenpoint lead for Georgia Tech here 3D Jackets have hit three of their last three and are on a seven nothing run in the last 90 seconds Williams out front from Butler Four to shoot inside Pnost and fouled with one second on the shot clock by Pton Marshall Yeah these are the situations where Damon started gets a little frustrated with Pton Marshall Hes playing hard trying to put some impact on the game but picks up some cheap fouls Yep So the foul on Marshall And it was on the deck So no free throws here Jackson has come back into the ball game to replace Bened Nost Share Jackson right back to work against Marshall here in traffic Had it poked away Theyll scramble for it and Washington the takeaway Here come the Jackets Kelly tes up a three Its good Chaz Kelly knocks down a three and Mike McGarvey needs a timeout Yeah good job once again Lamar Washington advancing the basketball Craft catches it kicks it back Sharing the ball in transition Good throwback 10point lead The largest of this first up here for nothing folks When your number goes in the rafters here as number four did a couple of years ago It doesnt happen by accident Theres that banner for sure First Final Four trip Dont worry it wasnt yesterday but it was a while laughter back Were telling our age 36 years ago Unbelievable Its crazy Unbelievable Phillips has come back on the floor To show you how concerned Mike McGarvey is on the floor right now is Andrew Phillips with the two fouls Well theyre stretching the defense His knockdown shooter Yep Keep an eye on 21 Theres Jackson the young freshman at the post against Marshall Three to shoot here Williams and I mean deep Missed everything Kelly recovered the air ball Yeah coach didnt like that Butlers coming to get him You see Davi Grimagan has come into the ball game too wearing number 10 for Georgia Tech Washington Back to Raogen Good pass Marshall the dunk Good unselfish interior passing on that one from Marshall for the finish Davi Raagan is a young man from Cologne in Germany Hes got a future I think hes fortunate that Lamar Washingtons here though Yes you can learn a lot from a guy thats got Washingtons kind of experience if youre young Regagi theres the drive and another foul on Payton Marshall Thatll be his second First Georgia Tech player with two Well to your point once again Martin Adobe has to keep his man in front of him Now Marshall picks up another cheap foul as the guard gets to the basket to the free throw line now Dont forget Georgia Tech playing without Bayongo today So Marshalls two will bring Mohamd Cila back onto the floor Theres Endongo Free throw is good for Caleb Williams Hes got threes Hes the third best free throw shooter in the Patriot League Hes been double figures every game as Williams and hes had 23 times already this season for coach McGarvey Its a talented talented player from Rebo High School in Jacksonville also two number Mark Butler will replace Williams 10point game And Caleb Williams and his head coach talking as Williams exits Butler back in the ball game We get our first look also at Fammy 64 sophomore from Houston He wears number 24 for the Leopards And a zone employed by Mike Maccgarveys team Cila in the lane Tap follow and boy Akai Fleming that foul is going to be on Fabola Fami from Houston third on the Leopards but Fleming Dennis I call your attention to the follow here He was going with bad intentions He was going to follow up dunk that free throw good his third And each game hes getting better and better figuring out where his spots are offensively in the half court offense Hes knocked down a couple threes As that outside shot continues to improve his game will improve And perfect at the line Lead is a dozen Georgia Tech nine of 15 from the floor And they have put three threes on the board already Fiami out front This is Mark Butler trying to attack Chaz Kelly shuts him down Two to shoot again and a long three Humphrey Rebert bounds away Heres another quick out Fleming Raagan Felli trying to get it inside Knocked away into the corner and did it hit the inline Last touch by Lafayette says AJ Bak Thing I like about Mike McGarvey youre not scared to swap out guys either at all And hes teaching hes coaching in the middle of the game I love everything Im seeing right now Guy comes out you explain why youre coming out learn something get a drink of water and put Kelly twin right back in the game To Kelly tried to get it to CEO on the entry pass in the corner Here goes Fleming baseline and a reachin foul on Miami Thatll be his second I just think coach McGarvey has done a solid job of finding the right kids that fit into his system And once again each guy thats come out the game hes explained why And as a player you want to know why so you can regroup and come back in and be impactful in the game Kelly for crab Three ball rattle around and foul is going to be against Bevel 611 freshman Newfield New Jersey Fifth already on Lafayette Raaga As we get to the midway point of this first half Kelly looking inside for CLA Mohamd turned had it blocked Theyre going to call the foul on Sheree Jackson here It looked good up top I thought underneath the body area Thats why the foul was called Share Jackson 16 foul His first Another look inside at this young freshman going to work See up top Look good right there around the lower body area I think thats why the foul was called All right Heres where young Cila has struggled However though 3D Yes he has 15 of 40 at the line and the first one bounds away Washington will replace Kelly for Georgia Tech So I tried to explain to Cila and by that said you guys work so hard to get to the free throw line You created the space in the post You get the ball Now you just give the money back by missing the free throws Youre giving the money back Yeah 13point lead Cila got one of the two Largest of the ball game for Georgia Tech Inside 10 minutes to go First half now Jackson Hands for Phillips Remember hes got the two fouls Heres Jackson squared up on Cala Six to shoot Phillips working against Fleming on the drive Tried to scoop it Kicks it for Butler Caleb Williams attacks Fall away Missed

Perfect possession Lafayette got to be a little frustrated Five turnovers now for the Leopards They were getting easier shots the other night at Charlotte Not so here this afternoon in Atlanta Craft for Washington Quick bounce Fleming strong to the basket Hesitated Double clutched it Cala the rebound trying to fight through and a hell ball is going to be called and then it will go to Lafayette on

basket getting to the paint Have get a couple guys knock down a few shots for him as he gets to the free throw line here And the Butler free throw hits the rim Hes 86 on the year Just his fifth bid in

can be successful Second of the two for Butler is good So hes got 14 And heres Sila back into the lineup And that right ankle doesnt look right No hes not Hes not nearly at 100 Theyre playing without Dango and Mustaf already today Fourpoint lead it is for Georgia Tech in the basketball with Lamar Washington Hell shun the screen hit the drive and couldnt finish it And last touch by Mohamed Cila and

they call a challenge Shot clock They will retain a timeout They will also have one challenge remaining for the game There we go Theres the brain trust behind the bench Every teams got them Everybody

foul line Knocks it down Same shot same spot different result Yep So Butler knocks down his second field goal of the half Remind people when you have a good point guard you have a chance to win every ball game And thats why I love Chance screaming Chance controls the ball game That ball got deflected away Fleming scoops it up That got blocked and a foul will be called Jackson rejected the offer by Fleming He went in there with bad intentions Yes he did That is fourth foul on Share Jackson with 845 to go So Bevel Aquas got to come into the ball game Yes Good competitive basketball Jackson says nope you got to earn him from the free throw line And the first free throw good for Akai Fleming Pebble Aqua checks in Out comes Jackson with 845 to go So well see how long Mike McGarvey keeps his big freshman on the bench Meanwhile Fleming knocks down both free throws Hes now double figures for the fifth time in the last six games Dennis yes consistency Each game getting better and better Sevenpoint lead Okay Contact on the screen from Craft Thatll be his third Five on Georgia Tech Junior from Chicago Transferred from Miami of Ohio Has played at Xavier for a couple of years in his career Last year shot 43 from three in the MAC for the Red Hawks Big Cam Craft Butler now weaving through traffic Peyton Marshall doing a pretty good job Three to shoot Heres Humphrey Shot fake three Front rim miss Fleming pulls it away Washington trails in the secondary for the Jackets Heres Fleming back for Marshall Couldnt handle it They scrambled for it It was recovered on the far side by Reeves He got rolled into by Humphrey Point lead under eight to go here for second half Well every time they put this zone entry pass against the zone It Its like the premium element right I think its a lost art partner feeding the post and attacking the two3 zone or one3 zone about finding that guy in the middle of the zone and making the proper pass and then having a good decision maker once he catches in the zone One and one here for Reeves out of the timeout and the free throw good for Kesi Reeves who now has six in the second half 14 in the ball game I got a followup for that when we get a chance Reeves had the second one bound away gave the money lead Gave the money back again 7163 Georgia Tech 752 to go and Lafayette starting the offense with Caleb Williams Theyll go right back to the basket Marshall blocked it Heres Reeves Open floor Hes got Phillips to beat with a dunk Whoa that was nice Kesi Reeves now eight second half points 16 in the ball game lead is 10 Largest its been since halftime for Georgia Tech Humphrey Rebert now to the left side Long three ball from Murdoch bounds away This is where Mike McGarveys had that sequence of game where hes you know were there and then were not there right Theres always a three or five minute stretch he talked about before the game where hes not making shots not rebounding And theres Payton Marshall for easy layup 10 for Marshall And its quickly gone to 12 And Georgia Tech on a seven nothing run And were going to get a break here Season high for Marshall with 10 Taking the initiative to take care of his body Now each game get better and better Reeves stole the inbounds Hell run the floor with Carowak That ball got knocked away Dribbled off his foot Here goes Williams Hard to the glass Hell draw the foul End up against the Stanson is okay The foul is going to be on Chaz Kelly Thats his fourth And the sixth on Georgia Tech but couple of free throws coming for Caleb Williams and Damon Starttomires face Shows you what he thinks of that sequence Get a great play by Reeves You give it right back with the turn Give it right back Gave the money right back Free throw good Williams is three for three at the strike You see Kelly go out of the lineup Lamar Washington is back and Williams hit them both Want to watch a couple freshman battle Keep an eye on Kiraak and Jackson cheering The two bigs physically are dynamically different Interesting to watch and see how that unfolds as Craft launches a three Reeves tried to follow Hes going to draw the foul here And thats on Share Jackson And that is five And thats what coach McGarvey talked about too in that zone You give up offensive rebounds Now Jackson you bet Kesi Reeves will go to the line Dennis Kisy Reeves only played six games a year ago In 24 he

their rhythm Theyre fifth in the Patriot League and made threes per game at eight cheering Theyve got 10 today Three here in the second half Georgia Tech has got seven in the sec and seven for the game but one in the second half cheering and that belongs to Chaz Kelly by the way Meanwhile you saw Williams hit two free throws Little half court trap there after the free throws Yeah how about that Mike McGarveys got a lot in his bag He does Im very impressed They are They got a big catalog what they do defensively Washington with Phillips defending Number seven game There goes Craft on the drive and a whistle foul underneath and it is on Williams Caleb Williams And thats his fourth Mike McGarvey thought for sure it might be on the Jackets It is not And heres a Kai Fleming back to the line Georgia Tech trying to join Louisville who was a 40point winner over Montana today Earlier today at the Yum Center Theres a free throw by Fleming I bring that up only for this Dennis Second straight game the Cards play without Mike Brown M hope the young fellas back is not as bad as we think it may be So he misses the second straight game for Pat Kelsey The other night the loss at Tennessee and then today against Montana Louisville by the way opens on the West Coast when ACC play breaks by the way Oh cheap Theres a foul on Reeves Thatll be his first three throws now for this Lafayette team And today the Leopards are 11 of 15 And thats 11 more free throws than they shot the other night in Charlotte Only four were attempted against the 49ers Heres Williams and he knocks down the front of the one and one Hes perfect Seven for seven now Hes got 20 Lets see if Lafayette gets in that little half court trap after making free throws like it did last time Looks like theyre

and the first of two is his first miss of the day at the line That one hurts standing for his hes a point away from his fourth 20point game of the year Second one is good Theres his 20th point Cant begin to tell you how impressed I am with Williams Butler and Phillips for this Lafayette team I know theyre good teams in the Patriot League but my goodness Washington attacks against Phillips draws the foul and one veteran guy And the reason that plays is such a smart play Craft won the alley Lamar said No Imma keep it Attack the rim Old school threepoint play Yep So Washington will pick up the field goal His fifth of the day See right here driving it Hes asked for the alley Keep it Play through Phillips Get to the free throw line Thats a smart veteran play right there Hes got 14 Does Lamar Washington to go with nine assists Tell hes going to be handy in ACC play Yes he is 222 to go Lead is 11 Leopards probably need to be hunting threes Dennis Yes sir Williams on the hard drive There it is on on out of the corner Murdoch On Q partner Six for Murdoch Lafayettes got one timeout left Theyre down eight Georgia Tech probably content to squeeze the clock here as much as they can Be smart Get the ball off one side of the floor Make lifes defense move Little matchup zone Looks like Ree trying to help with a screen Washington step back three with a left hand Oh let me know how you really feel to close out this ball game 9079 Lamar Washington that was strong now Big time Hes got 18 Heres a miss and the rebound for Reeves And with 75 seconds left Washington will walk it into the front court here against Butler And Leopards content to let the shot clock wind down here Craft eight to shoot Spins back and the rebound from Murdoch Lafayette will have to hurry now Inside a minute Theyre going to try and cut the possessions Back door cut Theres Butler No basket Foul before the shot Still to get him two free throws Its on Kesi Reeves So Mark Butler to the line Eight and a half 18 in the ball game Two shots coming 442 to go Itll be three possessions if he hits them both cheering And I think Lafayette will have to foul if they want to try and extend the game Pretty gritty effort though by the Leopards Im very impressed man Im very impressed Theres a look at the way the Patriot League will open for Lafayette You see New Years Eve against Colgate Matt Langleys got a terrific team seemingly every year at Lyola Maryland Then they go Beu at Navy Weve seen Navy Thats a nice team Mhm At Bucknell Pretty sturdy first five to be honest with you for Mike McGarvey now in season number four Ninepoint game Williams has come over here next to 3D to buy a spot while he waits on a possession Theres the foul and thats on Butler Thatll be his second So Kayla Williams going to hand that water off and walk right back in front of us Little offense defense Yep because hes got four fouls Cant put him on the floor to foul No you cannot Theres Williams Hell wait on the first free throw by Washington before hes a welcome back And heres Lamar And the free throw good And I want to say it again partner Last 32 seconds that I think Damon has given every guy an opportunity By the way yes they got plenty of talent Play at the garden tonight against Texas Tech Lamar Washingtons a help Kesi Reeves is a help Cam Craft has to make shots by has to be healthy You got to have those three guys in particular right Yes And Cila whatevers going on with that ankle it has to be 100 Yep In the corner Baseline drive baseline drift and jump shot no good Rebound for Williams with 15
