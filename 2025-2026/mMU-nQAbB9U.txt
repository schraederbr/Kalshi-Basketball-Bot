tonight Not just whos going to take him is going to determine what happens here tonight Lee Cassell AJ Decide Justin Porterfield are your officials in the opening tip off smack deep into the back court and it will be Georgia basketball as Justin Porterfield overrules himself Itll be Bulldogs ball 4 seconds in He wouldnt let anybody else overrule him I know that for sure cheering So this is a Georgia team coming off a 42point win over Tennessee Tech on Saturday They jumped out 11 nothing in that game Florida State was down 11 nothing against Texas AM First shot for Jordan Ross wont go And here come the Seinals cheering Leger Jones Officials looking at each other White ball Florida State keeps it And both teams thats what theyre going to do Theyre going to take threes and when they dont go in its just not that much fun to watch laughter And its not that much fun to coach that But theyre not going to be deterred Theyre going to keep doing it Well coach Luke LZ was honest when we asked him how does he feel about the shot quality of threes that theyve been getting He said it hadnt been very good And he used other words than that Yeah JOHN C WIGGINS FINDS the range When they go in its great Everybodys happy But you know you got to get good ones That was a good one But they did that off the pass They passed it in to Steen and he was able to get the ball reversed and they got a wide open Jeremiah Wilkinson unable to answer Good block out by Steen Rebound for Wiggins Rob McCrae the fifth on the drive Rejected by Sto Surreal Georgia leads the nation in block shots Thats what they do You cant just drive in there and do that Theyre going to block it Well what you have to do is youve got to know theyre coming to block the shot and find the open man But McCrae is the guy of all these players on the Florida State team When he drives it appears to me hes looking to score Yeah And he can pass Hes got a lot of assists this year One of the toughest guys in the country Beheim was open but Steen cut him off He got it I wasnt quick enough Gray gets it Steen the D2 transfer from Florida Southern Jones has it poked away cheering and applause You know both these teams are in the top 10 in the nation in steals Well and one thing that you can see when they throw the ball into Steam in the high post Georgia is backing way off Thats what you dont want to get your threepoint shot blocked Two blocks already for Georgia But theres the steal for FSU on the floor to scoop it up Kobe McGee Jones scoops it for Steen Surreal standing tall Contested three wont fall from McCrae And its Blue Kane who throws another pass toward Bonner this time Picked off by Wilkinson and he goes to the basket They really get out and go And Wilkinson is a guy who is very effective in transition Hope you guys keep your hands ready cuz a bunch of loose balls are coming your way Now if I got my hands ready it wouldnt make any difference Id still get hit in the nose Come on Dan Both of us McGee off the catch Rebound deflected to the Georgia bench Itll be Bulldog basketball Well they pitch it out and Wilkinson is a guy who just goes you see hes one on four but he is undeterred He really likes to score in transition by driving it to the basket Both these teams play with freedom Freedom to go ahead and take their shots And you know when they start making some which I think theyre going to it just takes some time Whole new team whole new system Kane nice move Kane shoots over 60 from twopoint range So does this entire Georgia team Were top 10 in the nation in that too Wiggins didnt really look determined to finish there Wilkinson the other way Counted in the B in the foul Wiggins made a mistake He had an open three and he passed it up got his shot bothered and then he loses the ball and as a result you get a run out Thats you cannot do that Your offense has to be efficient to prevent Georgia from getting those opportunities to go and thats how they score When they get out and run and the same with Florida State when they can get out and run thats when theyre most effective Theyre either team struggles in the half court Smurf Millander and Justin Bailey First subs in the game for Mike White the fourth year coach who really plays his bench Jim they go very deep Everybody squad I would be nervous coaching this You think youd forget about something I wouldnt even I cant remember past seven or eight So no not 12 Steen looking to pass Wiggins Another contested jumper and its out of bounds Last touch by McGee Steen is not going to shoot that long jump shot and Georgia knows that and theyre playing off Bulldogs have scored seven straight points and theyre looking for more They scored 60 in both halves of their last game Im surprised I didnt think wed see single digits in the shot clock all night Oh Surreal with an ambitious follow and he got fouled Florida State needs to put a body on him And if youre Florida State and you have them in a half court set when youve been able to set your defense your defense doesnt stop until you have the ball and nobody blocked out Surreal They got pounded on the boards by Texas AM Just really just took it to them And it was the first game that just shocked them And you know thats the kind of game you you learn from and you say Okay were not letting that happen again Or you dont and they look like they have learned a little bit Practice today they were really right on Coach had them doing the right things talking about the right things but you got to be physical against this Georgia team We hear coaches often say you know tonight was bad We cant let it affect us for the next game How realistic is that Well thats what you say and thats how you go and you work in practice And the coach said they had two good days of practice and the players were talking that way They were talking about how they know they cant do that cheering So I I think thats all great They play 11 guys Georgia does double figure minutes and you can see why Theyre trying to get up and down and they just keep running guys in Number 25 Abson who just came in the game Hes every bit as good a shot blocker as Surreal who they just took out Yes indeed I dont remember a team that plays 12 guys Dean I mean Ive Ive coached a long time and been around a long time probably too long but Ive never seen a team play 12 guys and guys playing double finger minutes Bong into the game finds Wiggins in the corner Offensive rebound for the Frenchman Tom Bong Been a while since Florida States made a shot Theyre 0 for their last seven Scoring drought nearing four minutes and it continues on the Bong miss But thats the kind of shot they want to get and Bong is one of their better threepoint shooters percentage wise Offensive rebound battle Its a tie up Itll be Florida State ball on the arrow as Bong fighting hard Weve seen all three of those facets of their game Theyre 0 for four from three so far And Florida State music yes theyve taken eight threes but theyve only made one There has to be another way to score You cannot win shooting threes unless youre a 35 to 40 threepoint shooting team And they dont appear to be able to shoot at that percentage Two teams have combined 1 for 12 beyond the arc so far Well see if that changes here Well it did change but not for the better Well Somerville is their best percentage threepoint shooter Well Georgia has the ability to score some inside which so far cheering has not shown Tough contested jumper from the corner Wont go for Bailey And itll be Florida State ball ACC and SEC both getting two wins so far Now Virginia Techs win was in overtime They finished off South Carolina 8683 in OT And can I say that the Orange won a monster game tonight That was a cheering turning point without their best player to beat Tennessee is a kind of a season turned around even though its early and the conference Everybody everybody benefits from that and Virginia Tech winning on the road Thats huge So this is a Florida State team that played Florida really tough and everybody was encouraged about year one with Luke LS and they go up to Tampa Lukes hometown Clearwater right nearby And they get embarrassed this past Friday by Texas AM He has liked the way his team has responded in practice since they had good spirit energy and shoot around today Dan is it as simple as are the shots going in or they not going in or is it about getting the right shots Well obviously its about getting the right shots your shooting percentage is much higher when youre taking good shots but theres no question the games a whole lot easier when the ball goes in the basket And that thats a nice job by McCrae to get to the free throw line Jim was just saying that you need to score in other ways except the threepoint shot And one of the ways you can score is to get to the line Fullourt pressure here from Florida State Georgia plays 11 guys double digit minutes and turns it over there A little contact but we play through it Lukes an ACC champion 13 years ago part of Leonard Hamiltons 2012 title team Leonards in the building tonight We saw him earlier today as well A lot of Florida States offense is built on beating your guy off the dribble And if you cant beat your guy off the dribble then the offense is going to struggle A create to the corner for Wiggins Thats what they want to do Force the defense into the lane and then kick it out for a three Nice job defending the rim by Mohhamd But when you miss threes you allow your opponent to get out and go Seinals one for 12 Theyve missed their last 10 shots THATS A HIGH PERCENTAGE LOOK THOUGH for Mohamed They can make that one I know George Oh that was deflected in Theyre going to call it a goalend Doesnt matter The one thing George is doing Mike White talked about today theyre multiple defenses different fullourt press different traps at half court some zone defense So theyre mixing things up and that takes a little bit of time to get your team ready for that And in his loss they made two mistakes in their trapping defense and that enabled Clemson to get two open shots to win the game That overtime loss for Georgia Their only set back so far this season That was in Charleston On the drive Jones cant convert Ross who scored the last two triggers the break This is Wilkinson Santos Surreal Hes tough The D2 transfer Steen miss Fires Gets his own miss Kicks it out for Jones Steen Another chance Missed again Another rebound Seinals cannot buy a bucket Boy its tough to play a coach this game when you cant put the ball in the basket Theyre getting effort Theyre getting tremendous effort from everybody Christine goes and gets two really tough rebounds gets open shots Balls not going to the basket Itll change Itll change Theyll theyll get some Theyll get going How do you assure that the defensive intensity remains what it needs to be when youre not making plays Well youre trying to tell them look if were not made we got to play even better defense Weve got to stop them more now because were not making things Two teams that combine one of 16 from beyond the arc Catchings it home Wow That was one of the harder threes that theyve tried and it went in Largest lead so far Bulldogs up nine And thats from a 25 threepoint shooter Feels like an important early possession here for Florida State Steen tries to go past Surreal and he gets fouled Thats what you have to do when youre not making shots Try to get to the basket Try to get fouled You just cant keep shooting threes Well theyve been having a hard time getting open threes because the Georgia defense has been really effective pressuring the ball The one thing when you play 11 or 12 guys youre going to have fresh guys out there and they can pressure the whole time Youre playing seven or eight guys are going to get tired The second half especially its hard to pressure but they can pressure the whole game There are some undeniable similarities between Texas AM and Georgia in terms of their depth and their pace and Florida State was humbled in a big way up in Tampa on Friday OH MY LOOK OUT Cannon catchings throws it down Thats what Georgia does Well they got the ball up the court quickly and thats why they got the dunk Florida State has to be able to set its defense and to do that you have to be able to make shots Theyve made 12 of their shots so far Two out of 17 Jones on the drive challenging Surreal Steen Another offensive board and he pays it off this time Ill tell you what he gives you every effort He gives you everything hes got and thats always good to see Georgia down the floor scores with 26 on the shot clock Well you cant relax just because youve scored a basket because theyre coming right after you Jeremiah Wilkinson getting out in transition and Canon catchings Finally breaks the seal from deep Georgia over there I feel like its not that big of a deal but its not ideal either Well anybody who ever played in Pits old Fitzgerald Fieldhouse knows that thats no big issue at all They didnt hit that would be a good board in Fitzgerald That would be a really good board Its a byproduct when you have the parquet You have those idiosyn idiosyncrasies in the floor and the way it bounces Ive heard stories of the old Boston Garden Oh yeah We played there True stories Oh yeah All the way Steal for Cam Miles lays it off and a missed layup for McGee He was worried about catching coming to block the shot Kane on the drive misdirected by Jones Somerville leads the break the other way This is the type of pace we were expecting tonight Yeah And its one thing to run up and down but if youre McGee hes one of their top threepoint shooters You have to run to a spot and be ready to shoot He caught that ball and he didnt have his feet set Theyre just fortunate to be in this game shooting one for 100 or close to it right now But Georgia is not shooting the great either So thats a good thing Yeah but you saw there both of those teams really like to get up and down and thats what theyve done so far tonight They can do that cheering Unfortunately Dan they dont give you points for getting up and down Thats true Le Jones too strong off the window tip from Wiggins would not go again Theyre taking it in there trying to do these fancy shots I think because theyre worried about getting their shots blocked Thats what theyre worried about KANE THROWS IT UP and Stag throws it down Kareem Stag the freshman from Chesapeake and a steal Smart Millander lays it in and Florida State just threw it away again but it was deflected this time This is a real problem that Florida State had against Texas AM turning the ball around here There Kane penetrates but hes not looking to kick it out to shoot a three He penetrates Hes throwing it up in the air for a dunk And theyre in pressure every time Make a miss Theyre getting up and you just make a couple mistakes and you give up a couple baskets and they cant afford that because theyre not scoring enough Tough drive from Rob McCrae The fifth he flips it in Well he can he can get in the lane and that time there were no shot blockers back there and he recognized that and was able to score Bulldogs are nine of 11 from two so far in this first half and now theyre one for eight from three Its really simple Florida State needs to back off and let him shoot threes Johny Wiggins big shot He got the other one didnt he Yes Thats his second and Florida State second in 12 attempts It just takes one more and youre back in the game as bad as you really shot the ball tonight Both these teams do a nice job getting hands in passing lanes Theyre both in the top 10 in the nation in steals Florida State over 50 of their attempts are threes Theyre attempting the most threes per game of anybody in the nation 54 is a lot of your shots High percentage of your shots from beyond the arc And when youre not making many of them its not great Moving screen on Bailey And again when they can make Georgia just slow down for a minute by setting their defense good things have happened Yeah If if they can get back and take away the layups Georgias having trouble scoring too So get back take away the layup make them shoot the three Let them Theyre going to shoot threes They want to shoot threes too Let them shoot them Theyre not making fakes it takes it makes it Le Jones for three That time he got a he he worked his way into a real good look Thats a tough shot though You fake you set again Lots of times you see a guy miss that one Yeah youre right But for them that that was a pretty good one Out of bounds Last touch by Florida State cheering Eight straight points for the Seminals after this bucket Thats a really good fake right there The guy flies by but he takes his time Lots of guys they just hurry after that You dont need to hurry The guy just flew by He didnt rush it and got a good shot Tough pull up jumper comes up short for catchings chance for Florida State to further carve into the deficit Wow that is really a tough shot Well he was not in position He needed to be two steps closer to the line He was out past the NBA line if there was one here Yeah you dont get extra be shooting from out there Under eight minutes in the first half Millander got Wiggins off his feet kick to the corner and Jake Wilkins thats Dominiques son knocks down the triple Pretty good uh family history there Hes had some spectacular Sports Center top 10 caliber dunks this season but not with threes Hes only a 17 threepoint shooter He comes up with a steal Smurf Miller rise and fire and a foul against Florida State on the rebound action Well get ourselves a timeout 728 to play in the first half 22 so far Victories for Syracuse over Tennessee Big win for the Orange Virginia Tech winning on the road in overtime in Colombia against the South Carolina Gamecooxs Here Georgias led by as many as 13 Florida State continuing to fight Shot clock winding down One of the longest possessions of the entire Georgia season ends in a foul that will continue things Shot clock resets to 20 A little bit of a bailout call there but they had nowhere to go Number two on Bang Hillander exceptionally quick Dylan James bouncing the dribble with seven This is Wilkins TOUGH TAKE GOING WOW Jake Wilkins A lot of contact and a really tough bunker They call him baby highlight That was kind of under the rim but still a really nice play Thats just too long You dont like that shot No its too long And Wilkins I mean he puts the ball down and he goes to the basket You got to get in front of him but he does a nice job keeping McCrae on his side and uses his body to protect the ball I mean thats a heck of a shot And gets fouled Yeah at least once maybe twice Not that were going to talk about the referees tonight Just might mention it once in a while First foul on Wiggins and free throws for Dylan James We got family here tonight He grew up in Winter Haven cheering earns the second by making the first But James is is a really good offensive player for them coming off the bench Hes a really solid rebounder and even though that ball bounced around a little bit hes an excellent free throw shooter Hes now 10 for 12 on the season Earlier this year Mike White said that Dylan James is as consistent as anyone Ive ever coached Thats high praise Thats high praise See part of the problem Florida State is having against this Georgia defense is theyre dribbling against the defense for a whole 94 ft There arent any outlet passes to make it a little easier And seven straight points for Georgia to answer Florida States eight nothing run Clock winding down Somerville in and out at the buzzer and the rebound for Surreal You get in there at the end of the clock you know the shot blockers are coming You take a tough shot Under six minutes to go first half These two teams played two years ago in the challenge Three would not fall for Ross Florida State had a 17point lead late second half and then let it slip away Georgia won it by two at the buzzer Another another shot blocked there but he got a piece of him on the way in But its hard to get a layup against this Georgia team Theyve got different guys back there that can come and get a bot Florida States just really struggling trying to create the offensive opportunities that they want to get And even when they do create them theyre only shooting three for 14 from beyond the threepointer Rob McCrae has had some big games so far this season Season high 29 points against Florida He tied a Florida State record with 17 assists in their season opener against Alorn State Theyre counting on him to be the quarterback of this offense Well he can make plays but hes got to be getting into the people that can make shots Reaching foul in the back court against Somerville And another one and one coming up for Georgia Well speaking of fouls Florida States only two for six from the line And theyve been able to draw fouls They havent been able to convert So one and one here for the St Marys transfer Jordan Ross And this is a really good Georgia free throw shooting team shooting almost 78 as a team coming into the game cheering Theyre six for seven so far tonight Theyve made two threes but they have enough offense from other sources that theyre ahead by 13 Tough take there McCrae gets two That was a little after the I think it was accidental but he got a he took a good shot but it really was accidental Theyre going to review it I dont think that was accidental Neither do the fans here at the Tucker Center Well he didnt swing his elbow No he its good to pick up full and try to get something too Try to create something We welcome those of you that may have just flipped over from ESPN Duke taking down Florida So the ACC now leads this challenge 32 Lu Kane earns free throws here to further anger the locals here in Tallahassee Well hes trying to get some excitement going but the best way to get the excitement going is to have his team put the ball in the basket Yeah cheering First foul on Steen Blue Kane junior from Knoxville the highest rated freshman recruit to go to Georgia since a guy named Anthony Edwards And this guy is a 96 free throw shooter Number two in the SEC top 15 in the nation And we jinxed them We jinxed them And the rebound flipped back up and in by Dylan James Well the problem there is Steam was complaining that James had violated and the referees didnt call it and he didnt block him out Bad pass intercepted by James Bulldogs by 14 looking for more Wilkinson rejected by Steen Still plenty of time 16 on the shot clock Ste blocked that one from his hip Wilkinson going downhill And thats the second on Steen He doesnt like it Well thats that is what Wilkinson does He is extremely aggressive and and theres no question he gets his arm in there Got his arm in there But Wilkinson he is the guy who is looking to attack attack attack Well the officials have done a good job They didnt call something that maybe people thought they should but then they these were fouls down there and they called it They didnt let it go Wilkins hit a star in the ACC last year with Cal which is still strange to say cheering Threetime ACC Rookie of the Week ACC six man of the year for the Cal Bears last season transferring back home to play for Georgia McCrae nearly had it poked away Miles fouled by Ross Sarcastic cheers from the crowd Well this is when you should drive because theyre going to call a foul You want to drive make them make a call Is that because the last few whistles have gone against them 100 Steen stays with it Theres another Don James Boy Stes a worker I give Steen a lot of credit He plays hard He goes after everything Hes Hes limited sizewise weightwise against these guys but hes going after every ball Luke Lux did say I would love to coach a team full of Steen Miles in and out Rebound tipped in by Wiggins Wiggins is a guy who gives you stuff You think he can give you more You always think I thought when he was at Clemson he could always do more Georgia has its third three of the game as Wilkinson connects cheering And then McCrae driving in cheering creates contact with Wilkinson Theyre going to call that foul now There was almost no contact that time First foul on Wilkinson His three makes it a 16point game FSU shooting one and one on the other side Times These arent SEC ranks These are national ranks out of 365 teams Number one in total points number one in fast break points and bench points and blocks Theyre number six in steals Not on the graphic Top 20 in force turnovers Theyre still only shooting 30 from the three for the year When they start making threes theyre going to be in the 90s every game Florida State continues to hurt itself by missing free throws Now three for eight from the line Tough contested jumper Wont go Those are the threes you dont want McCrae swatted away Nice play by Justin Absson Kane swatted by Jones Florida State trying to make the argument that it was deflected off of Kane but Lee Cassell not buying it Georgia ball If they want they can challenge that I I dont think thats a good idea at this point in the game But well the challenge rule if you He did challenge it Yeah but if you win it you still you got one left but you only got one left And if you use that one then you have none at the end of the gate Thats right So Georgia by 15 keeps the ball Millander kicks it Wilkinson sticks it You talk about a guy whos ready to shoot every time the ball comes his direction Hes ready and he gets a good look Gets a good shot How about that answer Miles with a right hand Absome couldnt get to that one but again youre taking it inside Thats what you need to do You know we often talk about teams defense struggling when their offense is not clicking Florida States defense isnt clicking but their offense just continues to go quick Like right here is an easy two for Abson on the nice pass And theyre driving and theyre not trying to kick it out for threes Theyre trying to get layups Absson wasnt ready for that or that would have been a dunk cheering Yeah And theyre doing a great job pressuring the ball McCrae playing oneonone against Kane No good That was tremendous defense And again you can do that when you have 12 guys Theyre fresh Theyre going in fresh 11 Bulldogs have played already Nine of them have already scored Jump ball Its going to be Florida State possession Beg your pardon 10 different Bulldogs have already scored in this first half Yeah Absson number 25 is the only one who hasnt scored but hes got three rebounds and a blocked shot They played 11 guys And even though they havent made threes theyve only made three in the half Thats right They could very easily get to 50 points When they start making threes theyre going to score a lot more points Scored 123 making program record 21 threes on Saturday against Tennessee Tech cheering Wilkinson the steal the quickness the transition Two Jeremiah Wilkinson the transfer from Cal coming home to the Peach State Powder Springs Georgia native He just outmuscled the Florida State guys for that ball and then he used his speed to get all the way to the goal Bulldogs by 20 He was a very good player last year and hes got Wiggins Johny Wiggins has 11 for Florida State Hes made three threes The rest of his teammates have just one combined As we tick under a minute to play here in this first half and a reachin foul is going to be two shots for Georgia Well Wilkinson just look at him take off He just beats everybody down the court You know he started behind him and he gets I mean he just beats him Well he won a lot of freshman of the week awards He would have been the freshman of the year except for that guy who played for at Duke Yeah that guy at Duke was pretty good Not bad He was good too laughter Well he would have been third anyway Georgia has been very consistent offensively too Now their threepoint shooting has been inconsistent but this is the 16th half out of the 17 that theyve played where theyve scored at least 40 points and theyre knocked on the door of 50 in the final minute here Yeah And when they start making threes its going to be But some of their threes were hard Theyre not going to make some of those The ones they made were better looks But here they come with pressure again The whole game theyre pressuring Theyre trying to trap different looks McCrae creating for himself Will get to the free throw line Again you dont get an easy layup in this game Not against Georgia Theres nothing easy now And McCrae he got to the got to the basket Hes going to get to the line But Im not sure thats the way Florida State can come back in the game Everybodys standing around watching and him driving the ball to the basket Second foul on Ross How much of what youve seen in this first half from Luke LSs team is reminiscent of what happened on Friday in Tampa against Texas AM Well they havent been making threes Theyre shooting a little too quickly They cant beat people off the dribble and so it is a little bit reminiscent and part of their problem here is when theyve gotten to the line they shot the free throws very poorly Praise just four for eight Seols as a team four for 10 Also against this Georgia defense they dont have anybody else that can penetrate So they really Yeah dont have somebody except for him to get to the basket Corner jumper wont go but Surreal an offensive rebound He could pull it out and look FOR THE FINAL SHOT BUT WHY DO THAT WHEN YOU CAN posterize Sha Mohamd with two hands My goodness cheering thats disheartening disrespectful McCrae to beat the buzzer doesnt get the bounce and Georgia on the road their first true road game of the season up 19 in the halfies but Georgia is shooting 14 for9 which is 74 from inside the arc and theyve gotten layups theyve gotten dunks theyve driven the ball to the basket thats where their advantage has been they were seventh in the nation twopoint field goal percentage coming into tonight According to Ken Palm that number will likely rise Georgia looking to add to its lead Blue Kanes put back Third effort goes Kane is just everywhere Really good player good passer good shooter Georgias got a really good basketball team I mean McCra the basket denied by Surreal And they they turn right around and here they come after that block Kane attacks and scores again He just senses where the advantages are and he moves to capitalize Largest lead for the Georgia Bulldogs tonight 23 Wiggins cant cut into it And a loose ball foul going against Surreal Well you talked about Kane and hes the guy I mean he just contributes in so many different ways and this he just sees hes got an advantage there Takes it right to steam Kobe McGee was very quiet in the first half and he flips that one in from on his back of the floor his first points of the night And with 23 on the shot clock Georgia answers and thats what they do They get down the court they get in scoring position quickly and they attack This is the Georgia Bulldogs team thats fourth in the nation in adjusted tempo Of course Florida States ninth in that department McCrae answers in a hurry But McCrae is basically he and Wiggins have been the offenses But its not going to work for the Seminals if they just trade makes back and forth the rest of the way They need to find a way to get some stops at this end Georgias just a really really good basketball team and theyre ahead Theyre theyve got better players right now Coach came in here late and just they just dont have the same talent level and theyre playing hard Theyre doing what they can do but Georgias got better players right now and a lot of them Weve several times they play 11 and everybody who comes in off the bench makes a contribution Kobe McGee just picked up his third foul I mean you look at their Georgias guard play is really good Lu Kane is really good Wilkins is really good one of the best players in the league last year at Stanford And you know hes only gotten better from what Ive seen You mean Cal I think you said Stanford Theyre close arent they Close out there Yeah they are but they dont like each other No I know they dont They wont like that I said that But yeah Cal I thought he was Its like mistaking Georgia for Georgia Tech That doesnt go over well either I thought I must have thought he was smart S smarter Went to Stanford Although are you familiar with clean oldfashioned hate Cal might not Yeah I remember Syracuse Georgetown I remember that vaguely cheering But hes really good player and you got two veteran guards You got size inside and you got depth You know Wilkins is a tremendous freshman They they just got a really good basketball team And a guy like Serill on the inside he he doesnt try to do more than he can do No he reminds me of Syracuses William Kyle Hes just rebounds blocks shots and dunks which thats pretty good to be able to do that Kyle had a nice game tonight The Orange big win over Tennessee Kyles is one of the hardest playingers Ive ever seen at any position Clock winding down on Wiggins and he banks it into the buzzer Didnt call it but it still counts again He made that shot but if those are the type of shots youre going to be forced to take youre not going to shoot a very high percentage Two more for Blue Kane Hes been the man so far in the second half Hes coming off those screens and nobodys getting in front of him Wiggins has it poked away from behind Surreal the steel came ahead down THE LANE STORE TIMEOUT for have been dunks one of the reasons he shoots a pretty high percentage But Georgia is now shooting 19 for 25 from twopoint range in this game What can Florida State do to change that Well they got to stop turning the ball over for one thing Get back on defense Dont let them have fast break opportunities That would help It would slow him down a little bit Its not going to stop him Georgias really good basketball team I think never went a lot of games this year Gray now with 10 points Kane for three Thats the one thing they havent done well today Shooting below 25 from deep McCrae to the basket Finishes with the left Play McCrae has shown us time and time again that he can get in there and finish at the basket when the big guys not back Yeah Hes not there And different Bulldogs have scored Luke Kane strong start in the second half This is Smurf Millander for three Has good ball movement You move the defense around You get the open three He takes his time and he knocks it down Hes a gamer He lost a tooth diving for a loose ball in the Georgia Tech game Came back in the game Get a hand on that ball Bailey ahead for Kane Scoop it in 26point lead on the road for the Georgia Bulldogs Mohamd spins and will get to the line Surreal picks up his third foul Luke Kane is always getting down the court Georgia cruising The white color signals the cancer survivor Yellow that AJ was wearing represents the family that hes lost Jim Valvano all these years later Jim Beahheim still continues to leave his legacy on the sport as we pursue a cure for this disease Well hes one of the few that can keep going Hes just eternal And you know Jimmy set the example for all of us and coaches around the country get together every year and coach versus cancer events and golf tournaments and raise millions of dollars So Jimmy started that all and we all should be involved Justin Abson adds two more for Georgia A lot of easy points tonight for the Bulldogs Yeah thats thats been the key Thats been the key Theyve been getting easier baskets Things dont get easier for Florida State moving forward Their next game against Kelvin Sanssons Houston Cougars Look out Oh Wilkins couldnt tip it in But right there was Canon Catchings And thats a perfect example of whats been going on here Cannon Catchings beat the rest of the Seinals down the court for that tip Yeah The one thing you have to do when youre an underdog in fighting a scramb you have to get back You cant get layups And theyre getting layups now Steen does tie up catchings but it will Florida State ball Thats a very fortunate tie up because they had another fouronree break all all day Dylan James coming back into the game for Georgia replacing catchings Georgia has done a really nice job pressuring the basketball really good exhibit Z right there Well they mix it up just enough Theres a little trap here or there Some fullcourt pressure here comes from behind gets the steal They But theyre trying that time Hes trying to go too fast a little bit You know you got to catch the ball first and then start dribbling It was a 19point game at halftime Georgia went up by 21 with the first bucket of the second half Theyve been up by at least 20 ever since Dominant game Wiggins Tough two inside Yeah I think Wiggins can be effective inside but he hangs out around the threepoint line Over 60 of his field goal attempts are threes And I know they want him to shoot threes but you know they could use a little bit more inside offense I dont think they ever thought of Clemson that he did as much as he could do What youre talking about get inside rebound get something around the basket Tends to hang on the perimeter and shoot threes which he can make but he can do that too He can get inside too Somerville back to the bench with four fouls Nice ball movement Sets up Millander for three more Now theyre making threes and theyre unstoppable then Scary Good Whoa But the bonus there is they dont get a fast break You Its been very frustrating The Georgia defense has been smothering Just trying to enjoy your sour patch kids in the front row and you got projectiles coming at you Well thats the risk of sitting in the front row Do you think the rest of the SEC realizes what this Georgia team can be as they head into conference play I dont think theres anybody in the SEC afraid of them but theyre going to respect them The SECs good again this year I mean its been good Ever since NIL came in they stepped right up right away went to the forefront and has spent money And thats why theyre where theyre at And I think the ACs caught up a little bit Got a little ways to go Miles attacking multiple defenders Unable to convert Ross bumped by McCrae But Jim this is what youre talking about Uh last years this the ACC SEC challenge was 142 in favor of the SEC but outside of the challenge during the regular season the SEC was 16 and two Yeah they just they overwhelmed everybody They were the best conference It was clear it wasnt close but they uh and theyre theyre right there again this year They havent been as successful in the nonconference this year but theyre still very strong Theyre still strong The ACC did use more resources and I think some new coaches came in got some resources at Miami Virginia I think that made a difference and I think the league is much better than it has been the last couple years Well it be hard for the SEC to be any better than they were last year No they theyre going to drop You have to drop a little bit Seven teams in the Sweet 16 13 in the dance Yeah theyll probably only get 10 or 11 in this year but Jim so this may be a hard question for you to answer but I want to see what you think because theres no hard questions anymore Theres been a lot of talk I think reasonably so about all the institutional memory and historic success that veteran coaches had in the ACC Who left Coach K Roy Williams Tony Bennett Leonard Hamilton right here at Florida State yourself Its about money now Evan Its not about the older So you you think thats overrated Thats overrated I mean theres John Shris got John Shris done a great job at I mean they have great players and they have great resources to help him So I dont see any fall off there and hes a young coach Uh I think that Virginia spent a lot more money this year in the transfer portal and theyre much better The same with Miami So I think its it unfortunately comes down to money in college basketball you have to face the fact Thats what its about And its until its under control The teams that spend the most are going to win Three more for Blue Kane Hes got 14 of the game Most of them here since halftime And youre right Jim When theyre making threes theyre scary Really scary 16 to nine McCrae goes down Numbers for the Bulldogs That was a nice job by Florida State getting back to pull the ball out Wilkinson deflected to the perimeter and Georgia has a second chance and gives it away Thats a couple of times now theyve thrown it just a little bit too high perhaps Just the ninth Georgia turnover Florida State only has eight turnovers and yet theyre still down by 32 are really good players Middle name is blue Named after Dukes colors His father Chris played golf at Duke Another block for Georgia here The Bulldogs come at you in waves dont they Wilkinson Tough scoop shot Wont go The other thing about Kane he was originally committed to Josh Passner at Georgia Tech but then Passner was let go reopened everything up went to Mike White at Georgia Did he just try to dribble through 14 people there Yes he did I thought he did 13 but youre Yeah you got What would your message be to him if you pulled him on Come have a seat laughter So thats thats whats called a buzzer play That play happens and the next dead ball theres a buzzer Possible As soon as possible Kane connects with Wilkinson Three more And another assist for Kane Im telling you when Wilkinson takes his time out there and gets set hes a dead eyee threepoint shooter Georgia over 80 with still half of a half to play Its starting to get away from Florida State here Maybe more than just starting Yeah I think it started a while ago but its definitely going now But now its theyre not really doing anything on offense just run down and shoot the ball unless youre going to make the shots And Georgia suddenly is making shots Theyre making threes I mean theyve been dominant in fast break points Theyve been dominant in the lane Theyve been dunking the ball and now theyre shooting threes One thing when youre starting One sec Jim Third annual ACC SEC womens basketball challenge begins Wednesday Auburn at the Dome against Syracuse 5 Eastern here on ACC Network Then Thursday night Arkansas SMU 7 Eastern Both games also on the allnew ESPN Now where were you I think one thing that happens when you lose you put giving other guys a chance Youre getting beat lets play somebody else But sometimes some of those guys really arent theres a reason theyre not playing Theres a good reason theyre not playing but you know you want to try to play him because youre obviously getting beat real bad You know you try them but that doesnt necessarily help the team McCrae bucket snaps a 13 nothing Georgia run as we tick into the fourth quarter of this basketball game And McCrae has 16 in the game now Evan He can get to the basket Yes he can Now there is a really hard shot and he feels his rhythm then I think I think he generally feels his rhythm I dont think he has any problem with that Hes got 21 Wiggins quick fire Thatll go I beg your pardon that song from the corner Song is a pretty good threepoint shooter Dan back to what you said about McCrae 16 points but hes got just one assist and he needs to be the playmaker to make others better like that Kareem cheering Stag with a onehanded stuff Well to be fair with McCrae a lot of his passes have gone to guys that have missed shots too So thats true To get an assist your teammate has to make a basket Somebody has to make one Theres a catch Hes good at getting the basket especially when the big guys out now Steal for Swinton AJ coast to coast for two Well Swinton is a very athletic player Both teams have made their last four shots Georgia for the night shooting 59 In the second half theyre shooting 68 Wilkinson another nice dish and Kareem Stag with another easy dunk Sixth dunk of the night for the Georgia Bulldogs Theyve been able to beat that seminal defense out front and get whatever they want Maloop dishes to Swindle He gets two more So it appears that for both teams defense has suddenly become optional Youre almost 40 down Its hard Another three for Georgia And Blue Kane now has 17 points Georgia might get to 120 again at this rate Well we got seven minutes left to go in the game They already got 93 Scored 123 on Saturday We got free throws for Florida State when we come back But Georgia is absolutely dominating taking everything that they want here in Tallahassee 19 points for the Orange in their home win over Tennessee And this balanced performance from the Georgia Bulldogs is going to add another win to the SECs column Now Georgia was 17 down with seven minutes to go two years ago and won Florida State down Theyre not a little bit more Theyre not winning tonight Georgias really been impressive A lot of guys a lot of different contributors but really two really good guards and a big guy inside How about this Theyre just relentless Catchings ends up with two more They just keep coming at you But once you dont get that first defensive rebound its awful hard when theyre big guys grabbing at it Somerville in and out Good hustle on the rebound from McGee Hes coming off a 21point game his best offensive performance of the season and hes been exceptionally quiet here tonight His job is to shoot threes and he just hadnt had the opportunity tonight Has been in a bit of foul trouble and that hadnt helped him Foul against Surreal on the rebound action talking about Georgia Theyre going to get to that average And their fast break points a little bit behind but not by much And their bench has really produced Theyve got those eight block shots And look at their inside scoring I mean theyve just This has been a dominant performance by a very good team And a nice dominant performance to have when you have the next 10 days off their next game 11 days from now against West Millers Cincinnati Bearcats in Atlanta who struggled a little bit this year So Georgias in a great position Aar Maluke welcome to the score sheet cheering Steel in the back court Somerville knocks down the three and Mike White wants a timeout First ACC game on December 30th in Chapel Hill at the Dean Smith Center Its not the best place to start Jim what would your advice be to Luke LS after what he has endured Friday against Texas AM and here tonight against Georgia Well you try to go back and have good practices Thats all you can do And especially with Houston coming up its just its you just dont get out of those those kind of games Its its theyre teams that punish you And you know its one thing to lose You can lose to a lot of teams but teams like Georgia and TexasM they punish you Houston They just keep coming at you And when youre not really talented enough they just beat the heck out of you Heck of a block from Maloo And the other thing to consider is Luke LS has six transfers and four freshman Heres Swint to show you some of that athletic ability Bring some energy Theyre theyre trying to play a very fast style with guys who are not used to playing a fast style Its going to be an adjustment period Its not easy Its not easy to try to do Theoretically playing fast is fine but Oh heres coach Hamilton sitting up there I dont think he gave up 95 points too many times in this building Different coach half defensive coach defensive minded And he looks happy cuz as he said today Im really happy Im not worried about anything Im not even thinking about basketball some days He had a carefree spirit too Shooter out today got to chat with us and as soon as you retire you look 10 years younger Not me but Leonard Hamilton looks 10 years younger But just because youve had a lack of success against two pretty good teams is no reason to abandon your plan No its just when you play fast youre playing into the teams like Georgia that play fast and theyre better you know I mean theoretically when youre not as talented you normally play slower to try to slow them down but they want to play fast and thats good for the programs future and thats what hes looking for Smurf Millander floats in two more You know the other thing that Ive seen from Georgia today is their guards really do a nice job finishing at the basket Sure do You know theyre theyre theyre good guards They finish They can make shots They make plays They defend the ball And theres a lot of them Well laughter the two that are the most impressive are you know obviously Luke King and and Wilkinson Theyre really high level players I mean Wilson proved that last year at Cal when he was playing Smurf Smurf Millander hit a gamewinning shot against Xavier in Charleston Hes double figures again tonight Yeah theyre going to be up and down too a little bit because they play fast and take a lot of threes So they have a bad shooting game theyre going to have some problems in that game Clemson was a had a really good win against Georgia and they came back and won right at the end So that was a good win for Clemson But and the other one of the other problems for Florida State tonight they just simply as hard as Steam plays They simply do not have the inside muscle against these great big guys from Georgia He plays hard but thats hes just not big and strong enough to play against these guys and hes going to see bigger and stronger guys as he goes throughout the year That was one of the things about Leonard Hamilton teams You seem to have eight sevenfooters hanging out on the bench He had a surplus of big guys Leonard Hamilton is one of the best recruiters Ive ever seen He recruited wherever he went Whether he was here whether he was at Miami whether he was at Oklahoma State wherever he coached he worked and mostly outworked people He recruited year round He hated the rules when they limited recruiting because Leonard said Im gonna work And laughter Leonard would go out every day if might be recruiting right now Well he Well he recruited as good as anybody Was there a particular player too that you were going up against him for We didnt recruit against him a lot cuz he recruited more South Southern guys than we did but Oh there he is Two old guys right there huh How about that It must have been pregame because it wouldnt have been you both wouldnt have been smiling like that post game No I Im sure it was probably wasnt even in a game It was probably a a charity function or something We had a great rivalry but we never lost our friendship Kobe McGee for three See McGee now hes hes one of those transfers Hes from Drexel and that so this coming here to Florida State is really a step up and he shot more than 40 from threepoint range at Drexel and he hadnt been quite that good yet at Florida State Well theyre going to get better Yes as much as theyre getting beat badly here tonight They played Florida tough so you know you have to think theyre going to get better and theyre going to have an opportunity to get better in in the few next few weeks Its early Its just the basketball season is just starting right now Georgia has reached 100 points for the fourth time in nine games this season Theres still three minutes to play Martin Somerville had a tough shooting night Now just two for seven but now with eight points Well when youre using so many new guys and guys who are stepping up to a different level its going to take you a while to get everything straightened out We got two Have you googled Kurt Signetti No Whos he Google him Is he saying something different than me Well hes got an undefeated team too with the Heisman Trophy candidate at quarterback and Fernando Mendoza Well I like I mean Indiana the great coach Now thats something I didnt think we would see tonight is a shot clock violence No I didnt either But I dont see I I love Indiana I love what the coach has done there And maybe Ill be Im wrong on this but I dont see them be playing with Ohio State I hope Im wrong because I like Indiana Id like to see it happen Ohio State is just a monster team I think they played well this past weekend in the Big House But the important thing is to get that playoff over with so we can start concentrating on basketball Yeah we dont need to talk about football Justin Ka just became the 11th different Bulldog to score in this game They are deep They are big They are fierce When Bailey hes a guard who comes off the bench Shes like their third or fourth guard but hes an excellent threepoint shooter And Georgias made 11 more threes tonight Up to 37 for the game 11 for 30 Yeah they started slow too They really come on Well the one of the reasons their offense has really exploded is because theyve made three Yeah they continue to do all the stuff they were doing before but theyve made three Jaden Newell and Brandon Clatsky the 12th and 13th men into the game for Georgia Theyre playing zone too just to kind of slow it down a little bit at the end here and not get crazy McGee skyscraping rebound for Kareem Stag And in transition good block from behind and the dunk rattles in Does that count as a dunk I think it does No Bounced up in the air Another block Boy Wilkins is just I mean he he is so quick and long and runs You know its a shame but hes a guy thats going to be a good player if hes just patient and keeps working Hes going to be good Theres freshman like that arent quite ready but they can be really good And he can be really good if hes just patient By the way the official stats called that a layup not a dunk It was not renewal He was attempting to dunk it though Yes he was I can attempt to dunk right now too But its not mean Im going to do it Well if it goes in and youre attempting to dunk it Dont do that though Jim I dont want you to hurt yourself Oh I would not even attempt it unless I had a chair A big chair Yeah but then youd have to come down Yeah thats true That thats not going to work either Nice pass Free throws coming for Jaden Newell Destin Florida native Was a walkon originally now on scholarship for Mike White at Georgia And one of the things we continue to see from Georgia weve seen it all night long is they really share the basketball well Yeah they do Theyre well coached Theyve got good players and theyve got size Theyve got shooters They got ball handling They get after you defensively They change up their defense Thats going to give some teams problems And cheering they come at you with different guys They got a lot of them I couldnt coach 12 guys but Mike White can And hes doing a great job with it And theyre not far away from being 9 and0 Their only loss came in overtime in the final of the Charleston Classic against the Clemson Tigers Well Clemson has some bigger bodies Yeah And I think that you know as they get into SEC play I think thats a problem that theyre going to have to solve because those guys have big bodies Shot clock is off Mike Dwight slows down the break and it looks like the final margin will be 34 Could have probably been worse So I guess you got got to let that let that go First home loss for Luke LS as the head coach of the Seminals
