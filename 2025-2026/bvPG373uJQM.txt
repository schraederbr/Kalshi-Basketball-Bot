Duke wants to come out aggressive and early and close this out Duke at 141 30 in the ACC SMU winning the opening tip Theyre 12 and three They just popped into the top 25 after a win over North Carolina but then they lost on Wednesday to Clemson by four getting it downstairs for BJ Edwards in a nice start as he knocks down the twopointer cheering So we welcome you here to Cameron Indoor just underway inside the opening half minute of play Duke at number six in the country taking on number 24 SMU They have to play without Poopy Miller Their top scorer their top player He is out with the flu back in the team hotel here in Durham North Carolina We will not see him today Jay will Yeah he was playing at all American level scored or assisted on 57 points versus North Carolina last Saturday Leads the ACC an assist per game an absolutely dominant player who finds a way to impact the game in a variety of situations Also by getting to the free throw line I think this is a huge miss for the Mustangs And a turnover here defensively Duke among the best in the country Thrown away by Camboozer who comes in averaging 23 points number one in the country 10 rebounds a game A quick turnover here for the Blue Devils Well for SMU to have a chance to win this game being shorthanded Don Pierre Jr has to be prolific Same with BJ Edwards Two guys that could really impact the game with their scoring ability and off to a strong start at the start First jumper on the way here by Tombs is going to knock that one down on target from threepoint land And a good start here for the Mustangs You know OB I said the the biggest thing is this first 10minute stretch for Duke When a team is shorthanded hope is the most dangerous thing you can give them And if you allow them to stay in the game early theyre going to believe that they can stay in the game the entire game John Sh the Duke head coach is mixed up his starting lineup Thats interesting When youre 14 one they swing it for the corner jumper but off target here by Foster Theyll get a second look Dame Sar the freshman in the starting lineup and so is Malik Brown He liked the way they closed out their last game defensively SMU with their starting lineup and as Jay Will says they can score Theyre getting about 90 a game On target is Edwards Hes 14 points a game And what a start here for the Mustangs as they lead at 8 to nothing This is exactly what they wanted to do Foster on the baseline Hell swing it for Boozer Got a good look Cant hit it Hes making about 37 beyond the threepoint line Tombs with the touch The turnaround in the lane Gets it TO GO AND FOUL AS WELL SO the big freshman will be headed to the line You talk about this sense of urgency for SMU to come out making their first several shots Obviously John Shy right there his fourth season as Dukes head coach fastest coach to 100 victories We talked initially Obie about the defensive presence and I think thats what John Sh is trying to find with his starting lineups Some lineups are better offensiveminded lineups Other lineups are better defensive lineup lineups This lineup was supposed to be better defensively minded but you dont see the same sense of urgency and everybody being down in the stance SMU taking advantage of it Tombs the freshman from Amarillo Texas off to a very quick start with six and 11 to nothing SMU You would have thought because of the loss of a great player for the Mustangs this score would be reversed And finally on a long bomb Isaiah Evans will knock it down and Duke is on the board Evans last two games averaging 255 points per game just shooting the ball prolifically but also changing it up driving to the rim as well Fumbled out of play by Edwards So a turnover for the Mustangs Andy Anfield here number two successful stops at Florida GF Coast of course famously Dunk City and USC that brought him to Dallas Texas They won 24 games last year Did not make the NCAA tournament They had their eyes on March Madness this year and off to a great start as that will be out of play Roger Ays talking with Enfield here I feel pretty animated It will go the other way So that will be SMU ball Andy Enfield had the opportunity to coach Ronnie James a couple of years ago You think that was a learning experience having a guy like that on your unit at USC Cant imagine what it was like obviously had huge success over at USC as well 11 to five NCAA tournament appearances in 11 seasons including the 2021 Elite Eight of Evan Moble You could take the hit here and the foul will go on Brown on Brown Thats two fast fouls So in some trouble right away and heading for the bench after getting his first start since his Syracuse days today cheering up top here for Pierre He can be a really good scoreer Hes 18 a game He loves to operate in that slot space the extended elbow And when hes isolated if you dont force him to go one way or the other with the ball hes going to have you on the string back and forth one of the best ISO basketball players in college basketball playing for his fourth school at SMU to the midcourt line and Tombs corrals it a 133 start for the Mustangs all five of their starters average in double figures it falls off drastically after that but their starters they can drain it a misfire by Washington whos one of their best threepoint men again little hesitation went to the bank and draws the foul and hell be off to the at 1604 to go here in the first half of Cameron Indoor You think about that hot start that SMU had against North Carolina where they shot 60 from the field Sar one of the best perimeter defenders so impactful their last game against Louisville But if you dont force him to either just go left or right he can dance with the ball And thats how an offensive player who operates in ISO situation thats how he finds his rhythm with that dancing Yeah 246 in the overtime win at Mississippi State So he could fill in some scoring gaps today led by Boopy Miller 18 points five rebounds a game coming into play today Evans at the line where he makes 90 Duke today going for another win over a top 25 opponent Theyve beaten Michigan State number seven Florida number 15 Louisville number 20 number 25 Kansas and number 22 Arkansas Pierre on the wing You get told looking inside Hes 72 Duke not switching anything Theyre fighting through every ball screen Part of the scouting report today The shot clock at three Edwards has to get a shot in the air to his right and hes going to travel with it Exceptional defense by Duke on that stop So 1534 to go SMU with an outstanding start but Duke creeping back in it We talked about the sense of urgency defensively for the Blue Devils SMU has came out pretty strong but Duke trying to pick up the intensity Youll have a chance Cant wait to see you there Heat Heat Booby Miller on the court SMU could not have asked for a better start to this basketball game Jaden Tombs knocking down multiple threes Youre seeing him work down low on the block going against the national player of the year and Cameron Boozer And then coming up a high ball screen Duke is supposed to blitz those ball screens to get the ball out of the hands of guys like Pierre Jr one of the best isolation scorers in the country And SMU with a hot blazing start to this game Duke by the way has yet to take a twopoint shot This is one thing that John Sher talked about after the last game when they rallied to beat Louisville They settled for too many threepointers in the first half They were only five out of 17 one of five from three so far here this afternoon Also talking to John Sh earlier today he said theyve been having one of the poor stretches defensively the last several games at Florida State at Louisville havent really been clamping down on that side of the floor cheering Patrick Dun getting free in the lane at 611 cheering and Duke making their way back in this thing after a great start for the Mustangs BJ Edwards was at Tennessee on a Sweet 16 team a couple of years ago Tombs with another touch The talented freshman up against Boozer Knocks it down He is super poised down low on the block Tombs came in averaging 70 yard He has eight in the first minutes of this one at Cameron Indoor So not intimidated by the surroundings the freshman You think Tombs has something to prove against the Booger Twins considering they lost in the national finals last year of high school basketball I think that is the case and another one of the Boozers on target I really do believe that Kaden Boozer is the missing link for this team His progression and maturity from the point guard spot considering hes a game manager is what could really take Duke to the next level Yeah its a menu in a corner Knocks it down Freshman out of LA on target cheering And dont look now but Duke has pulled within three cheering Pier up top for Edwards He draws the double Duke really active these last several possessions on defense and on the line Pierre will turn it over Thats already five turnovers for SMU You got to love the ability to put the ball down on the ground and make plays and GMA doing a really good job creating the contact and then finishing through contact And then Kaden Boozer we talked about his vision and playmaking ability to kick the ball to a corner for a quick three So Duke with an opportunity to tie this one up after a bit of a nightmarish start but they didnt exactly panic Boozer with a onehander up and in by Gunbo cheering Well call that an assist I dont know what Coach K called it Well he would call it a lot of other things that uh are not rated laughter PG I know you heard a few of those in your day as well Tombs with it Pretty good battle early here with Boozer Duke wins that fight cheering And Manya stumbles and its going to go the other way Those are one of those young plays and Kameha obviously a talented player but thats a oneonree situation and theres really nothing there trying to force that you pull the ball back out and you get a more efficient possession You know hes going to be critical to their team Obviously had an ankle injury against Florida Has been trying to recover from that all the way through and through but his defensive ability his ability to win 5050 balls and extend the floor with his outside shooting is going to be critical to this team as well Trying to get position underneath able to do that Hell slam it down Sami Gutullu 72 from Istanbul coming off a good game against Clemson They lost the game but he went for 14 and 11 Tipped out of play by SMU at 1213 to go in the first half And a game that started on an 11 nothing run for the Mustangs Since then Duke has outscored them 146 You know Yagato you talk about a guy 72 270 lbs takes up so much space but hes mobile coordinated and skilled around the basket You saw that with the multiple head fakes and the patience down low on the block Dungo is going to fire it up there Got an excellent long look but couldnt drain it He had been five for 17 beyond the three Atolo outside long range jumper on the way and off the mark by Germaine ONeal Jr who was coached by his dad in high school the NBA great I tell you how many teams have a big like that that can create off the dribble in transition and have the confidence to create contact and get to the free throw line SMU 1714 against the Duke Blue Devils at Cameron Indoor A family affair More on that when we come back Hes listening to John Sh and Carlos listening to Cece the mother of both Kaden and Cameron and Carmani Boozer You think about some of the top players Germaine ONeal Jr played against his father with Indiana Pacers You know Pippen Scotty Pippen obviously the names go on and on and on about the next level talent that has came from NBA talent in the ACC Remains to be seen if they can grow the same caliber of beard Its a quality and theyre working on it It is Well you know Carlos was supposed to be my roommate freshman year Then he met Cece at the beginning of freshman year and pretty much spent my freshman year alone So thats how that went I didnt realize that Can you tell I hold some kind of animosity towards Jilted a little bit I think Yeah One of the strongest beards in college basketball Carlos national champ with you in 01 and Shane Badier who is here today and hes going to join us after the half as well Of course Coach K cheering Heres Boozer Kane Boozer will draw the foul on his way up to shoot So he is off to the line What a team that was 2001 national champs Won 35 games He was a player of the year and so was my partner They split the player of the year the national player of the year Thats like unheard of Shane was definitely the bonafide leader of that team and uh obviously this is their 25y year reunion of that 2001 national championship team Thats Mike Dunley right there Third pick in NBA draft Also the general manager for the Golden State Warriors And uh you know we were going to coach Kays house last night for a lot of veno And uh its funny we all sat in the same places on the bus that we did as former players And it makes you just very thankful for the time we had and also make make you remember how talented we were as a team Thats amazing stuff that you went to the same spot in the bus as you were as players Little following here by Washington and Duke comes away with it They have their first lead Theyre trying to add to that And thats going to go the other way offensive right in the middle of the championship banners That 2001 team you guys had some wars with Maryland that Coach K Im sure can give you a blowbyblow on every single S Those games were amazing Well we had four games against Maryland that year Uh we lost to Maryland here on Shane Badier senior night We beat them at College Park uh something called the miracle minute which is one of the greatest games to watch We then beat them again in the ACC championship and then we were down 22 points against them in the final four Juan Dixon Steve Blake Chris Wilcox one of the best alltime Maryland teams theyve had and then they won it the following year after he lost it again Rolls for the hook on a back down He cant get it to go Got away with the walk there As I mention likes that around the back move and Cam Boozer held up and fouled Hes 23 points 10 rebounds a game Boozer is Its so impressive Obie when you watch him play He is one of the strongest bases in college basketball Uh he never gets off balance He can play through contacts and also the versatility I mean he has so much power that he can bulldoze his way to the basket but also has the dexterity to put the ball down the ground and with being an elite passer Just an all great package collectively Those legs are tree trunks man Good luck moving him And a turnover SMU trying to get the lead back on a long run Its tipped away from ONeal Jr Get a second chance Tombs on the baseline tiptoeing Edwards caught it You get told back inside batted away from him and a foul on Duke with 958 left in the half Shane Betty what a player and what a career here at Duke over a fouryear period He won more games than anybody who had played at the college level Yeah one of the smartest players Ive ever played with And I think people will get a chance to kind of hear him think through the game and obviously talk about the differences between where the game is now as opposed to where the game was back then But still one of the best defensive players to ever play the game of college basketball and his offensive game met the quality of his defensive game by the time he was done with his career Darren Harris sophomore out of Virginia now into the frey here for Duke Kaden Boozer handing off mentioned that Dame Sar the 68 freshman got the start today Great ball movement underneath and a foul Got it free to Gunga He went for the dunk and hes headed for the line where he makes 65 And once again Cam Boozer able to put the ball down the ground and make a play And then the next pass by Sar And thats the type of finish you want from a guy like Gungba Dont shy away from the contact Go into it and get to the free throw line with his second foul by the way And Gangba the Andor the only one today that features both teams ranked in the top 25 Well Ill tell you OB I I I keep oscillating back and forth between who the number one pick in the NBA draft is going to be when June comes around Watching Darren Pearson play the other day against TCU He was phenomenal at 32 points and watching AJ Debatza while also watching Cameron Boozer Just so much talent at the top of this draft Really some of the most talented freshman weve had in the game of college basketball in a very long time If I force you to make a pick right now number one who is it I would probably take Darren Peterson for his ability to play off the ball Its the most efficient jump shooter there is in college basketball But also youre not going to have two to three guys sit in the paint And the explosiveness that he showed me the other day is very different than any other player in college basketball Now look I could be wrong AJ Debons there too Same with Cameron Boozer Kingston Fleming I think in that conversation coming about How many freshmen do you see play for Kelvin Samson and actually have the luxury of them giving him the ball and making quality decisions So a lot of talent out there in the 26 NBA draft Chamboozer splitting the defense Hell head to the line and count among his many fans Andy Enfield a head coach at SMU is raving about him in the locker room before the game He said the difference maker with him is he is so polished offensively What a game he has offensively It just feels like the game is slowed down for him And a lot of times therell be as freshman the game goes 10000 miles per second Its like watching frames right And I I think for certain players they have the gift of being able to see it frame by frame And thats why hes such an elite passer And hes a multitool player for the season Best laugh I got all week was preparing for this game and writing his name in as a freshman Hes coming off one of those performances that makes you laugh about that 27 points eight rebounds four assists in 39 minutes in a road win at Louisville They they started out 110 SMU but since then Duke has dominated 142 and now they lead it 2117 Mustangs need an answer again Playing without their number one man Boopy Miller out with the flu Edwards with a shot clock at one knocked away by Sar and a shot clock violation More tough D for the Blue Devils So many players think that they have to make an impact just on the offensive end And when you got a chance to watch Sar play in the second half against Louisville he absolutely shut down Conwell who had 16 points in the first half And John Shy and company think that his most impact he can have on the game is his size his length his lateral quickness and his ability to lock in on defenders on the defensive end They played 26 minutes off the bench against Louisville He drew praise from Sh for his outstanding D As you mentioned thats the biggest reason he got the start The slam on great ball movement again And its Malik Brown with the dunk And look out Duke is starting to grab momentum in a big way again cheering KNOCKED AWAY IN MIDCOURT SPRAWLING for it Great play there by Sar Gets it free to Brown Jumping in the lane and draws the foul And Dame Sar lightening it up in his defense and his hustle program has recently expanded patient salute a huge fan cheering After 6 months of chemo and three bone marrow transplants is in remission cheering is a world class cheering cheering We talked a lot about the impact that Damasar can have on the game defensively What great discipline staying down getting the stop and then 5050 balls These are the differences between winning and losing games sacrificing your body And what that does is that provides a pep of energy for your team Look at the body language of a guy locked in on the defensive end And defense translates to offense And thats what John Sh talked a lot about today Hes like Hey sometimes we go back and forth between our lineups defense off offense but when were locked in together defensively thats when were at the best version of who we are Now Duke has already forced 11 SMU turnovers Brian Oonnell over there with the SMU staff as Malik Brown will go to the line And also I as a player I know fans at home you hear us talk about diving on the floor for the loose ball Its a really hard thing to do right Because you have to so many players bend over at the knees for the ball Its natural Its its not its unnatural right Its very uncommon to sacrifice your body and get those 5050 balls that can turn the swing of games Missed the second one And Phil was wondering who that foul was on moments ago 2417 Duke Blue Devils trying to go to 151 and 40 in the ACC Pierre on the drive The banker wont fall Bungo with a nice save just standing practically on the baseline Duke with a chance to add the lead at Sar Cant drill it from the corner Duke coming in ranked in the top 20 in both offensive and defensive efficiency Their defense has led this comeback from an 11 nothing hole today Look how far their offense is extended by Dukes pressure on the perimeter now Now everythings uncomfortable for SMU Thats not the way it was the first three minutes of this game One foot in the paint No that wont go Brown with the save right back to the big Hell hook it up and in Tough save by Malik Brown If anything you dont save the ball under your own basket If anything you throw the ball deep towards your basket Kaden Boozer poked away in midcourt and itll be Duke ball So this falls under dont do this Yeah Well hes trying to throw it off the player but once again if anything throw the ball deep Throw it deep the opposite direction Give your team a chance to do it There were three black jerseys under their own rim Something that the 01 Duke Blue Devils never did once I dont know if I can claim that nationally I made a lot of bonehead plays Thatll be could have been too many Boozer from threepoint land and knocks it down with the shot clock expiring Well when you can do that as well at 69 along with the inside game suddenly he has seven And where is it Who is it going to be going to Its going to be SMU to keep it Shot clock dwindling down being contested showing you that ability to play inside and out just a complete package Tell you one of the most efficient players in all of college basketball His net rating is higher than the past five national player of the year net ratings by five points Edwards up against Sar and thatll rattle home They need a lot more of that out of BJ Edwards He has seven points He came in averaging 14 And youre thinking well without Boopy Miller these guys really have to have huge games out of the back court guys like Edwards as Evans went inside and knocked away from him and just a guy who was close to a sevenfooter I mean look at that release Look at that touch Look at the ball rotation here I think thats why a lot of NBA scouts are salivating over the ability of Cameron Boozer as a complete player Evans Yes sweet touch there Twopointer cheering 2721 Well take a look at that during the timeout Three or two and a reach and a foul here on the freshman SAR with about five and a half to go before halftime We have another tremendous ESPN womens triple header tomorrow afternoon Number 22 North Carolina and Notre Dame Then number 12 LSU hosting Texas And the afternoon wrapping up with Duke and Stanford at Maples Pavilion You think about Isaiah Evans hes made 10 threes over the last two games The rest of Duke has made nine Rainbow jumper That wont go for Edwards Second chance is up and in Good work underneath Able to hang in And it looked like about five minutes ago SMU might be run out after their great start That has not been the case Evans looking to penetrate on the spin The kick for the open shooter start Hell drill it from threepoint distance applause and cheering 3223 And another turnover by SMU Evans in the open floor Sar with the kick Heres Foster off the front iron Ill tell you Sar is just so active defensively His hands are in the cookie jar every possession SMU has to remain strong with the basketball because he is just all over it Getting his hands on everything Deflections with the pass downstairs Tombs will finish it Theyre very impressed with SMU without their best player finding a way to stay in this game And it all started with a strong start Tooth has 10 but a quick answer Saw continues to have a really nice first half here for Duke This is their biggest lead today cheering To get position waits Lost it Taken away by Brown Foster to drive it Leaning in No And a whistle Quickly Its Edwards Pierre and tipped The sevenfooter couldnt get it to go Duke by 10 Way downtown Evans But no one and done And just a rough shot That Thats Sar did the right thing by slowing it down Evans should have slow it down They should have had a set Something that Sh has talked about settling for the three a little bit too much Theres Tombs again who continues to have a big happiest 12 And we have a timeout Just over three minutes to go before halftime or Cameron Indoor Dukes defense waking up They erased that early deficit Theyve been hitting some threes since then You know it Isaiah Evans uh Cameron Boozer You know I you know look I I think the threepoint shooting for Duke is something that they need to continue to improve on Um and also from a playmaker perspective you know Seth and I spent a lot of time talking about this Who makes the game easy for players on the court And obviously that could be done collectively but thats why I keep going back to the point around Kaden Boozer and his progression from just being a game manager on the floor because its very natural to him I think there are some things he needs to continue to improve on defensively which is why you see him in and out of the rotation and also being a freshman with that But you know thats where the upside is for this team Davis Ray knocking down a jumper Hes made an impact off the bench here for Andy Enfield He has four points Ill tell you who really shows up The numbers are better when his brother is on the floor is Camboozer Statistically its almost like a a safety blanket Guna leaning inside follows the miss got two cracks at it Thats knocked out a play off SMU Well the familiarity OB right The continuity of them playing together for all four years of high school and you just see it I I I call it kissy Keep it simple young right A lot of times coaches say you dont need to thread the needle just make the simple pass And I think the more that Kaden Boozer can make the simple passes and then also defensively continue to improve hell spend more time on the court Kaden Boozer a little floater Nice touch there He has six points That has been his season average So theyre getting a little more scoring out of the freshman from Miami Davis Ray up top here for Tombsu can be tough under there when he gets that position at 72 and he is going to turn it over and another one that is 14 turnovers and the travel there Theyve had nine steals the Blue Devils have A lot of the turnovers have just been because they havent been strong with the ball and theyve been making careless passes Young ball off the dribble Approaching the one minute mark here at Cameron Indoor Amena underneath and a slam by Gunpa cheering Nice twoman game And a dramatic finish applause and SMU taking a timeout Its back up to 10 for Duke Familias playing time has decreased over the last several games You said he was coming back from a foot injury but great read great reaction and what an even greater finish by Gunga But when your best players out your next best options have to step up A guy like Geron Pierre Jr was the nations leading returner scorer last year 22 points per game with Jackson Jacksonville State Conference USA player of the year leads the ACC in shots taken but today one of four only four shot attempts for two points tombs has provided good offense and a threepointer for the freshman 15 points for him thats the reason theyve stayed connected here a centerpiece for Andy Enfield the top 40 recruit one of the highest rated freshman classes in program history and he is showing why today out of dynamic prep outside Irving Texas So about 5sec split between a shot and game clock This is where you see Duke invert the ball screen A guard screening for a big but cheering they forgot about number 12 and Camboozer No one picked him up Nine points for him off the slam way downtown and knocked in and plate one Q Thats Pierre Tron Pier the six Maryland four different times and like every one of those games was an alltime classic including the the miracle minute where you guys came back from 10 points down with 54 seconds to win that game They were the most worthy adversary that we had We really respected those guys Didnt like them All right but we knew we had our hands full every single time and we we gave college basketball four epic games for them Sure did Underway here in the second half Shane delighted to have him with us upstairs making the long climb up here to the Catford seat at Duke 4135 SMU actually shot 58 the first half and yet trailing by six because of 14 turnovers Yeah four assists 14 turnovers A lot of ISO basketball They need to find a way to punish Duke with points in the paint But Obie I gota tell you very quickly you know that that miracle minute was such a great game Not only because of the way we came back but also because of what Shane Badier said at the end of that game Because I think deep down he knew we were probably going to have to see Maryland a couple more times Oh yeah And uh you know at the end of that game he said None of you guys celebrate We expect to win this game And thats really the mantra as Isaiah Evans knocks down another three after 25 points over his last two games But that was the mantra that I think Shane really set as a standard for how we had to compete each and every night Boy to have the leadership and the talent you guys had to lean on That didnt keep coach K from throwing you out of practice though right You know we we were at his house last night and he saved every one of his practice plans in the last 40 years Wow And we were searching for all the practice plans where we knew he was going to throw us out of practice cheering We couldnt find them Shot clock violation More outstanding defense here by Duke Coach K on hand here today He was part of the big hug in the middle of the floor here That was wonderful to see but really drove you guys Really drove your team as gifted as you were There was no layup on that team Well yeah I mean we had a a a sheer extension of Coach K on the floor and back and then you know I was able to get hot a couple of times and Shane was able to keep me on the guard rails and this kid is feeling it cheering just from shooting the ball from the perimeter Like I said averaging 255 music points per game and his last two ball games And its overall the versatility of his game actually driving attacking the rim more this year than what he did last year as a freshman But I think hes a major differentiator and shame when you look at this Duke team with the likes of how SAR is putting pressure on the ball and Isaiah Evans knocking down threes and then Cameron Boozer What are your overall thoughts about the ceiling of this Duke basketball team this year Well obviously a very talented team Uh they they have all the pieces They have the best player in the country in Cam Boozer All right When you whenever you have the best player you got a chance its going to come down in conference play and in which game return play is how well they can handle adversity and how well theyre going to make shots and that thats going to be uh what is the determinant for them uh come March I always often wonder about too like you know from a game manager perspective you know the maturity of how you had to help me my freshman year in particular with Kaden Boozer right And making that jump and Caleb also more of a scorer but like who can help them calm things down when things get a little bit hectic Maybe thats maybe it has to be Cam Well look by the end of your freshman year before they had air conditioning and Cameron indoor okay VHS like Yeah we had VHS tape right We watched game film on 8 millimeter film I mean it was laughter I mean this is the stone age The the the cell phones were sizes of loaves of bread I mean this is this is luxury that these guys get to deal with I will tell you luxury OB We cracked open a 2001 bottle of Schaffer last night in Coach Ks wine seller Oh Coach K knows luxury He knows what hes doing Thats luxury Let me tell you about Jay Will though Jay Will was an amazing teammate As talented as he was he was just one of the best teammates that we had Washington great hustle to pluck it free and on the drive he gets hit heading to the line to shoot two and and whenever he had the ball I mean we just knew we had the best guard on the floor every single game and that was from his first game uh at Cameron just you know people talk about his talent but uh the guys who are on that on that huddle at halftime today we all we all know and love Jay will for being an amazing teammate well either I was going to score it or turn it over pretty much so at least you knew one of the outcomes Its a shot from last night I wanted to ask both of you guys You were down 22 in a Final Four game You mentioned Maryland and all those great games you play but it was to the Terrapens again cheering 22 points to them But because it was them did that make a difference You knew you could come back against it because you had done it We were not scared of the 22 Although it didnt feel very good All right And I really credit our other captain Nate James who couldnt be here today is coaching Howard We hit the biggest three of our entire season and just calm the ship cheering And the craziest thing about that game is we cut it to 11 All right Marilyn starts arguing Gary Williams takes off his his his his jacket Hes throwing it around Hes sweating Were down 11 Were saying in our huddle we got them exactly where we want It was the most bizarre thing Down 11 in the final four saying we have these guys exactly where we want Evans not a heater Cant hit this one rebounded away by SMU Theyre still hanging in this thing with 17 minutes to go Those are the type of moments where yes hes on a bender from shooting the ball from deep and I get trying to draw the contact but drive the lane Drive the lane and attack the rim Show that versatility that he continues to improve on yearbyear Getting exactly what he wanted in the lane near the 10 He has six points So 4738 Duke has been trying to break away several times as we visit with the great Shane Badier and Jay Will of course the heart and soul of the national champs in 2001 Swished in by Kaden Boozer Hes had a nice day Well hes been doing it on the defensive end and I think you know two players in which their defense has translated into their offense is Damasar and also Kaden Boozer by applying pressure on the ball and getting themselves engaged in the impact of the game Sar lines up a long one but that clangs away and Washington out of the pack with it trying to cut in Pierre with the drive will lay it in and a timeout with 1558 to go or under 16 Shane thanks so much for joining us Just a great pleasure Its a pleasure Youre lucky to be with the best appreciate my man You two both the best against an AP top two since 2019 So its been a little while So the Badgers with a huge one there Duke on top by 10 and the ball And the Boozer brothers Kaden and Cam playing very well together here We showed you a graphic you with us in the first half about how they click and theyre doing it again today Well four state titles three EBL championships and two gold medals I think when you have those types of experiences together it helps with your rapport on the court Demen will drive it Shot clock inside 10 as he slams on the brakes Kaden Boozer again gets another one So having a good shooting day and he has 12 And Duke works a lot on those repositions drive and kicks And good job by Chameleia to step through in that one and be strong with the ball for a kick to the corner Edwards a little turn around Thatll rattle home They need a lot more of that from BJ Edwards Im going to tell you OB if Booby Miller were playing in this game you know you have a floor manager somebody actually is averaging 21 points seven assists but also gets to the free throw line seven to nine times a game And oh yeah you know it slows down the pace of the ball game SMU is the real deal Kaden again not this time SMU ranked number 24 Theyre in the top 25 for the first time since 2017 And Washingtons on target from threepoint land and they just wont quit And Cory Washington had an absolute donut in their game against Clemson The guy is a 3 and D player to knock down some shots from the outside Foster with an athletic rebound Takes it to the corner and now back inside 5345 And many again tied up on the double Nearly threw it away It did eventually get to Foster Shot clock down to four Amena after the contact No whistle Heres Boozer and too strong and a whistle with 1450 left at Cameron Indor and hell get the big Ilu with a second foul Yeah thats a strong step through I talked about before to firing him in the corner and then Washington and transition something talked about earlier today Transition defense was critical for them and getting back to threepoint shooters Boozer to his right Got it up there and it goes He wanted a foul two but no whistle 11 for him You know two players in the ACC that can play through contact better than anybody Cameron Boo Boozer and then they talk about a guy at UVA Pester and one of the best players we have in this league Its like they can bulldoze their way through a wall and still complete the play Edwards quieting the crowd there as he knocks one down to give him a dozen points Hes starting to heat up a little bit And again SMU without their top player and one of the best players in the conference coming to Cameron Indoor and they got off to an 11 nothing start in this game Down the lane Washington left it short got it back Tough angle draws the foul Emanuel will pick up the personal Yeah we talked earlier before about Cameron Boozer reminding me somewhat of Tim Duncan Not saying hes going to reach that level but the footwork here the patience and and that center of gravity that balance that he has his core and his legs even when he gets hit he never gets thrown off balance And thats what increases his probability OB of getting a ton of and ones Somebody out theres going to say Jay Will just said hes going to be as good as Tim Dun Of course not Yes thats the way it works But if you say well there are some comparable skills and there certainly are Anybody watching him can pick that out Washington at the line and has another one coming Well hes not a high leaper He plays below the rim but hes great at attacking angles below the rim right And and then finishing at the rim And and by the way that is a form of athleticism So a lot of times oh hes not an elite athlete Like what do you mean He has elite hands he has elite passing he has elite shooting I mean ask Jokic if hes elite right Once again not comparing Cameron Boozer to Nicole Joic right But there are certain attributes and skill sets that he brings to the table that make him uniquely different than anybody else in college basketball Approaching 13 MINUTES CAMBOOZER STRAIGHT ON with a triple Thats the other part of the game right He has 14 He can hit that three cheering Duke back on top by eight Don Pierre came in averaging 18 points and that one missed ugly A lot of unassisted baskets for SMU Foster bit of a wild shot there Went oneonone with a misfire Edwards beyond the three Its only 31 out there gets the foul line gets it downstairs to the sevenfooter Gigatola will draw the foul A guards dream is we had one play we ran in college and it was just Shane Badier and I in a high pick and roll As a guard when you come off that PR at the top of the key if that big helps youre big like Cameron Boozer or Shane Badier youre just going to pop And when they pop they have the green light to shoot that thing Talk about a guy shooting over 37 from the threepoint line His ability to play inside and out make him an incredible weapon but also his passing ability And you know he can be utilized You talk about inverting screens He runs pick and rolls The smaller guards set picks for him and then makes reads off those So his versatility is different cheering Leading Duke in scoring rebounding assists and steals First 15 games of Dukes career This is what the numbers prove Youre talking about Zion Williamson and Cooper Flag Two of the most electrifying freshman weve had here at Duke University Oh and by the way playing elite teams you know five or six teams that theyve beaten in the top 25 Meanwhile SMU came here to win this game today even without their point guard And 21 points seven assists a game Back in the hotel because of flul like symptoms in Boopy Miller Thats a tough angle shot by Amena And hes off cheering to the foul line as he banked it in Andy Infield has to admire his teams grit here today Nonetheless Washingtons third foul We chatted with him in the locker room before the game He was very calm He told us Look Boop is sick So by the way Sam Walters not here the 69 junior guy off the bench Very valuable guy Guy played at Alabama a couple years ago then played at Michigan Really extends the floor I mean hes a unique weapon because of his elite threepoint shooting ability that along with Bookie Miller make them a dangerous combination when theyre on the floor together But theres no doubt SMU is one of the top tier teams in the ACC You think about UVA in that category Clemson definitely in that category North Carolina still want to see their guard play make improvement but Caleb Wilson one of the top players in the country as well Boy they got it The tombs right there inside the foul line He knocks it down Hes had a great game with 17 points Its a new careerhigh for the freshman Had a sixpoint game And Washington will pick up another foul trying to guard the freshman So we have 1135 to go Still very much a game that many thought Duke would run away with by this point Cam Boozer starting to show the full range of skills getting underway Wisconsin beating Michigan today Yes huge one for the Badgers out of the timeout Evans that barely nicked the 10 You think Miami has a chance against Indiana I mean they have just been smacking people in the CFP Its unbelievable Yeah Miami so physical but theyre going to have to have a lot of things go right to hang in that game Indiana does everything to perfection Tombs again 19 points for the freshman Well Tomb doing a great job of just really working when the ball is rotated from the weak side and carving out space down low on the block Underneath Gunpaw hell slam that down off the feed from Camboozer SMU keeping this crowd rather quiet so far today with the crazies coming back after the school break Tombs again Edwards shovels it back to the freshman and two more He is the man today cheering 21 points Well they needed Jay somebody to show up with all the talent they lost to the flu He has Well you talk about shooting percentages here and SMU is shooting 55 from the threepoint line and close to 60 from the field Gungba again to his right and he finishes He comes in 11 and six per game Can he be more than that offensively for John Sh Well John Sh wants him to be more than that but that comes with prioritizing him getting touches on the block And sometimes Duke gets into a threepoint shooting frenzy and due to their positionless style of basketball you forget that you have a guy like Gungba or a guy like Cameron Boozer that deserve multiple touches on the block Evans will draw the foul on the penetration 6458 Duke This is what you love right here Look how Tombs cracks into Boozer and he seals and then he gets big for the ball Great pass great post entry pass which is something we dont talk a lot about in college basketball anymore And then the interior passing of Duke Once again Cameron Boozer catching the ball in that short corner with a nice little wraparound pass His ability to see things and react in real time is what makes him elite Evans with a rare miss Shes 90 at the foul line a sophomore Well as of Friday in the NCAA Net rankings 13 ACC teams were among the top 70 Thats the most in college basketball Eight are in the top 40 tied for the most of any conference Weve talked about the league bouncing back in a serious way this season SMU is a big part of that I think youre going to have multiple teams that see the second weekend of the NCAA tournament And and Im willing to say this and I I know every team goes through their edge and blows I I think Duke is the best team in the ACC right now top to bottom I think UVA is the second best team I I I really do Ryan ODM has done an exquisite job with this team Ta Ritter is one of the best bigs in the country And their older their mature guard play is what can make them very dangerous when it comes to March G will knock down another one You got a game man And every time it looks like Duke has an opportunity to make a run one of those patented runs particularly in this building Well here comes SMU again Well what has SMU been able to do Theyve been able to take care of the basketball You know they they have 14 assists 14 turnovers excuse me But the last nine to 10 possessions theyve been strong with the ball Pounding his way little fall away shot draws a foul Just under nine minutes Lets take a look at your top of the ACC coming into play on this Saturday I think about these are the teams I think have a chance to be elite when it comes to March Obviously Louisville still trying to figure out their situation with Muel Brown Jr I do swear OB it feels like that gets more interesting by the second to watch if hes going to play or not Like I said UVA in that conversation Clemson they do it by their collective defensively They just smother you and obviously their inside out play is what makes them a lead And then I think North Carolinas in that conversation as well with SMU Duke by the way tied for the national lead with five quad one wins And Gungba swishes that one in So back up to seven for Duke cheering Gungbo maybe a little message today Did not get the start His 13 points Edwards has it knocked away and a foul on him Taken away by Malik Brown 845 to go And thats a special sauce that you get when this lineup with Sar and Brown are on the court together Theyre exponentially better defensively because Sar is able to apply pressure on the ball Youve seen him get so many deflections thus far in this game but al also that relentless pursuit and then off any screen Browns hands are so active Hes always reaching and blocking shots and communicating Uh it reminds me a lot of how Shane Badier played cuz hes constantly communicating to the guards about where the screens are coming from left to from the right Of course they track deflections He leads Duke with more than 80 of those Duke taking their time on this possession Kaden Boozer played really well with the basketball today Lobs that one out and commits the turnover Picked off by Pierre and right back Thats going to be 18 turnovers for SMU School getting underway here on the Duke campus on Monday So the crazies returning for this weekend game against also a nationally ranked opponent SMU number 24 Gungba Yes 15 points for the 611 sophomore cheering applause cheering Edwards knocked away by the always active Malik Brown He covered a lot of ground to get to that one and knock it into the stands cheering Gungbuda just absolutely taking his time Scream and one His post presence has been nasty in this Duke initially because SMU came out of the gate like a house on fire and cheering took an 11 nothing lead in this thing Lets see who SMU has atto cheering reversing field and well lay that one up and in BJ Edwards with the basket for 16 points today Edwards and Ger Jr here in Washington Theyve been so impressive today without having a floor manager on the floor That young man has been terrific today Jaden Tombs 21 points off the front of the iron That wont fall for Sar So Duke on top 6962 But the Mustangs with the basketball they have been very gritty today Pierre on Kaden Boozer and gave it up A great job by Gungbar meeting him there at that short corner and Pierre Jinger just taking his eyes off the ball being a little bit loose with it Kaden Boozer getting the hand in there Sim with the 19th turnover Sar off a good fake Kaden Boozer Brown zips another pass to Sar trying to wrigle free knocked away and turned it over and a nice save right on the sideline by Edwards Well a lot of this becomes the challenges for Duke is when Cameron Boozer isnt in the game Whos able to initiate the offense and who calms everybody down They go to a lot of dribble penetration but it doesnt seem like they have a dynamic ball handler that can create for others and make the game simplistic SMU by the way really getting tested cheering this part of their schedule in succession Nothing but tough opponents North Carolina Clemson which was a loss the other day Duke and upcoming Virginia Tech and Virginia Doesnt get easier in the ACC Does not Not this season That is for sure And a shove from behind Thatll be on Gumbbo So pick up the personal so for Andy Enfield and company a difficult run including that game of course against Virginia top 25 opponent on January 17 Virginia Tech no picnic either with the hand off Pierre running into traffic down to a knee Edwards looking for space to operate Working on the freshman who reaches in had a whistle and a foul with six on the shot clock So a bit of a bailout there Yeah those are the possessions John Sher talked a lot about earlier today just when the shot clock gets to eight or less just remaining disciplined and not just reaching but then just say force a contested shot cheering Kaden Boozer with the foul Edwards 75 at the line shooting a one and one and makes number one You really have to wonder whats going through the mind of Boopy Miller right now Aside from the fact that hes looking for medication for his flu but you know watching this game realizing the impact a guy like that would have had today in all likelihood Yeah if I were Booby I would be thinking to myself hey look I I I get it Im sick right now with the flu I I dont feel well I couldnt play today but we are competing against the best team on their home court in the ACC We have a chance to be the team in the ACC when Im back in health Well its been impressive A battle at midcourt It comes free and who has it The SMU ball This will challenge that So 550 SMU at a coachs challenge Take a look Yeah thats off Kaden Boozer right here Its from watching so much basketball seeing things in real time That right hand it gets those fingertips on it right there which this call should be reversed and that should be SMU ball So the officials at the monitor new rule this year going to have a timeout in order to call for a coachs challenge right there Yep You see that middle finger and ring finger right on top of the ball right there And also if you look at the ball the rotation of the ball the ball the rotation of the ball changes Youre not going to see it from that angle but right there slightly changes He did right Cuz its going on a 45 degree angle and then it steers out straight Yep Well well see if this crew agrees with you as they take a look with 553 remaining and Duke leading by five Will SMU win this challenge and they do win it They retain a challenge Now Roger and company this is the best the referee crew they have out there So I you know look I Roger tells me all the time he works out Hes music on top of it And I I I believe in them wholeheartedly Theyll come to the right conclusion Duke coming in number six SMU ranked in the top 25 at number 24 Theyve had a big win against North Carolina in conference play and theyve got a decision on this Heres a final after review The challenge is successful Itll be SMU ball in the back court with 30 seconds Thats call I told you Roger would come through So the Mustangs continue to be a very tough out here and with eyes on a upset victory here this afternoon at Cameron Indoor Ed Lashley the SMU head football coach in attendance Everybody wants to get to Cameron at some point BJ Edwards giving it up Yollu through the painted area and a whistle cheering and an offensive foul with 541 to go Yeah youre going to see him just extend that left elbow He gets down here Doesnt need to do that Hes 270 lbs If he just keeps that elbow attached to his body in turns he will naturally move Malik Brown out the way SMU with a season high 20 turnovers with five and a half minutes to go 20 turnovers and eight assists and down five points Evans wide open Cant sink it Boozer battling for the rebound and hit And Boozer yanking down 10 rebounds a game He is the number one scorer in the country at 23 points a game Draws the foul on the sevenfooter Yiguto with number four Well both Tombs and Yugato when that ball was up in the air They were staring at the flight of the ball While they were staring at the ball Cameron Boozer was carving out position to get the offensive rebound Big loss in the middle for the Mustangs Samadayu the 72 sophomore from Istanbul and hes in deep foul trouble Going to be tipped out off the Duke Blue Devils cheering Last time SMU had a lead in the game The score was 17 16 Biggest Duke lead has been 13 today Edwards driven away Back for Pierre Malik Brown is hedging so hard on every ball screen Edwards that wont drop Battle for the rebound Comes free to Kaden Boozer Foster went for the bounce And a good stop there by Tunes whos had a great game Yeah just great job reading the eyes of Caleb Foster who telegraphed that pass to the short corner Edwards almost gave it away bounce feed off the fake and a foul by Boozer Thatll put SMU to the line The last seven or eight minutes its become very much a rock fight Kaden Boozers third foul incidentally Yeah Kaden Boozer just falling asleep defensively Washington with a great back cut Going be hard to see from this angle but Boozer just caught standing up staring at the ball Washington recognizing that and finding a way to get to the free throw line And those are the plays from an endurance conditioning perspective especially as a younger player Staying down in the stands seeing manu ball is something that this team needs to continue to work on Obviously were in January Its a long season but veteran players see players take their eyes off and hit you with back cuts and cheering thats what makes them different Cory Washington at the line 83 SMU is a good foul shooting team 77 Jaden Tums 21 points perfect at the threepoint line He has also added seven rebounds Hes nine of 10 shooting it And this is a freshman who came in averaging seven points a game cheering He chose SMU over Alabama Miami Texas 7 foot three wingspan and him and Germaine ONeal Jr both lost to the Booger Twins in the Chipotle national finals last April And I dont care what anybody says When you lose in national finals games you remember that And that is that is a mark And there is a mark he has for Cameron Boozer and Kaden Boozer He wants to show it Hes been proving it today This is a threepoint game 6966 coming up on four minutes to go Kaden Boozer for Gungbuck into that lane And another whistle So everybody in the painted area is getting hacked on both sides here down the stretch That foul on BJ Edwards number two Well it was the right intention by Edwards When Gungba puts the ball down the ground you need to dig down but you wait for him to actually start the dribble before you go in and just miss the line on timing He makes 65 at the line I tell you the more I watch him play yes Duke has you know a traditional five in Gungba but the touch he has around the rim the patience hes shown you know getting to intentional positions on the court and a back to the basket type of player Theres a lot of upside with 17 points today cheering and applause He was held to four points in a game against Louisville where they had to rally from nine down to half to win Tombs with another touch on Boozer The tip wont go for Washington Its coraled by Duke They lead it 7166 under four left cheering Gamboozer bouncing for Evans deflected away by Edwards Duke will retain possession Three and a half to go Remains a tight game even though the Mustangs are so dreadfully shorthanded Yeah I think it talks a lot about how talented SMU is I mean obviously the likes of Jaden Tombs who is playing incredibly well today like with BJ Edwards and Pierre Jr who hasnt been able to score like he typically has yet they find themselves only down five points And with the ball here approaching three minutes to go Theres Pierre Gollu playing with four fouls Banging with Gungba Shot clock down to five in the lane to his right And a travel Scouting report said for him that he only turns over the left shoulder If youre watching this move he needs to continue to work on his game Look easy over the right shoulder Turn over the right shoulder Bucket Turn over the right shoulder 21 turnovers for the Mustangs Kaden Boozer Foster back to him Gungbo over the top Tried for the lob and Boozer couldnt quite get to it It just wasnt a precise pass Just kind of tossed it up there Heres Edwards Back for Pierre way downtown but short Rebound right back to him Hell drive it scoop it and hes got two Then dont look now with about two minutes to go It is a threepoint game at Cambridge Indoor Did a great job there sealing Dunbar opening in that lane for a drive They go inside to the money man and Camboozer knocks in two 16 points cheering BJ Edwards slip with opposite Its Tombs Those are the plays Thatll rattle in two more for him Says spectacular game 23 points Came in averaging seven Once again Yutoola there able to slip that screen turn face look opposite and found Tombs for he is such a nice soft touch around the minute 25 to play Duke has been unable to break away today SMU as sticky as it gets Heres Evans Got it A money triple 17 for him And Duke with a little breathing room here cheering 7670 and Anfield wants a timeout with a minute seven on the clock The power of inverting the screen Look how he actually hits the defender SMU is forced to help He slips to the weak side And that is what Isaiah Evans does a flamethrower at 66 Great job And and thats the ability of Cameron Boozer to be somebody that can be used as a decoy because of his great passing ability Evans at 28 against FSU and a 23 against Louisville So he came in cooking The Blue Devils highlight our ACC Network Wednesday triple header Pit taking on Georgia Tech at seven and Caleb Wilson number 17 North Carolina up against Stanford Finally the Blue Devils will be at Hos Pavilion in a late one at 11 Eastern against Cal They take their California trip playing two opponents and all three also available on the ESPN app No ACC opponent has gotten out of the West Coast trip winning both games Theyve all came back one and one So well see for both North Carolina and Duke how they handle both Cal and Stanford Well meanwhile Duke trying to make it 25 straight home wins but theyve had a fight today from top 25 SMU And the Mustangs put it in as we approach one minute to play and they trail by six BJ Edwards gives up the dribble Pierre out of the double Edwards off the fake The look away off the window It wont go cheering Foster with the rebound Under 50 seconds to go Were going to have to push up and foul Eventually do with 42 seconds to go to put Duke at the foul line And BJ Edwards knows that he missed a chippy right there Had an open lane tried to lay it high off the glass just couldnt find a way to finish it But him and Tombs have been great carrying the load offensively today for the Mustangs So Cam Boozer four out of five at the line today 77 Well sink the first Lets check in with Kev back in the studio G Thank you And 18 points for Boozer He has earned those points today Damon averaging 23 Well every time you play or when you do a broadcast youre not going to win an Emmy But sometimes you have to win ugly And I think thats what Duke is able to find a way with the Booer Twins and the way they participating this afternoon Cameron Boozer a guy that can do it inside and out And then we talked about the familiarity of the experiences that both Cameron and Kaden have had together being on the floor And youve seen that and the improvement of Cameron Boozers numbers efficiency wise when Kads on the floor I mean Kadens able to knock down against North Carolina had he been able to play today Well they would have had 21 turnovers Ill tell you that if youre in the court Had 27 points and 12 assists in that win Washington lines up a triple He hits it They just wont quit today 7873 Pressure on the ball to Foster Away for Boozer and back to his brother to kill some more clock Got a foul Got a foul Finally due with 20 seconds to go Thats why you know I get that you you try with the first trap to get a pass over the top for a quick steal but if you dont get that steal you have to thats an automatic foul And too much time went up the clock from the time they inbound that ball to the P time Isaiah Evans got fouled Duke getting it to their best foul shooter too Isaiah Evans who hits 90 Sophomore out of Fagville North Carolina drains the first Its his his body type very much reminds me of Brendan Ingram and calling him slim just a you know that shotmaking ability obviously I think Brandon could do more off the bounce which youre starting to see the full level of Isaiah Evans game but the length the sides is a differentiator Yeah the nickname slim lately hes been the slim reaper man piling up points on the drive and missing the stuff was Edwards with 10 seconds to go cheering 96 six and theyll commit the foul BJ Edwards going for the slam Said not to lay it in He missed it 8073 and Duke salting this one away at the foul line 96 on the clock and Evans to shoot again Well Dave I tell you its been a its been an incredible experience coming back to Cameron Indoor Stadium obviously celebrating our 25 year national championship reunion former teammates with Shane Badier and Mike Dunlevy and Carlos Boozer To think about you know watching Carmani and Kaden and Cameron when they were born now to seeing them play in the same jersey their father wore uh is a is a pretty special moment And um I just want to say thank you for the opportunity of you letting me experience this on the broadcast I thought it was great and the affection between you and Shay Batty very very very genuine coming through today Well for the amount of times he yelled at me its finally time he gave me some damn affection Well so we went to the way back machine but looking forward to the Duke Blue Devils as they are now 15 and one
