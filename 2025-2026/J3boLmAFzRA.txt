to get going get in the rotation but hes definitely found his role here for OR You know careerhigh in minutes careerhigh in points the other night as we said in the open Run the team he can do that So its Boston College and Le Moy the Dolphins 5 and seven coming off a loss to St Bonaventure in their last game a week ago on Saturday on the road Jakai Sanders the sophomore whos running the point with some injuries specifically to Amitri Moss the grad student and its taken away by BC There you see the run the team component by Luca right there Took his time let the offense get set made the entry pass Same starting lineup weve seen from the Eagles here recently with Taves being inserted Four games to go And theres Donald Tan right to the basket Thats what theyre looking for number 13 in goals Terrific first possession by the Eagles Good floor balance good spacing good patience Boston College has kept up its defense this year Metrically has been pretty successful Theres an offensive rebound and the put back from Shiloh Jackson Le Moy still in their D1 transition year three So they dont rank specifically in terms of statistical categories but he would be leading the NEC in rebounds offensive rebounds among other things This what the Eagles need to do Take advantage of the low post One of the things youll see from the guys in green theyll double that low post Theyll dig at the low post Theres not going to be many clean low post feeds with continuity passing outside And theres a good look for Donald Tan Jr who knocks down the three He is all of Boston Colleges early five points Crucial for him trying to find that threepoint shot that we know is in there Havent quite seen to this point this year Left hand look for Jacksons no good And Beastings controls the rebound Theyll do that Theyll get Silo Jackson isolated in the middle third of the court and just let him go His ball handling skills are good Retain thought about it Instead goes to the right hand floater which falls Well Eric it doesnt get any better Points per possession on the first three for the Eagles So a real start for them And you know what the analytics folks will tell us Boston College some success on defense you alluded to but has had its challenges at the offensive end Here is a Boston native Trent Mosca the red shirt junior who played down the road at Belmont Hill This kids exciting too with the basketball Dang out of Syracuse Heres Jackson Triple team comes Jackson goes up anyway and hes fouled with three on the timer Same concept Got Silo Jackson in the middle of the floor Middle third of the floor Just let him go oneonone Silo Jackson someone that Nate Champion saw last year when they played against Texas AM Corpus Christie Third D1 season for Nate Champion Is in his fifth year as the head coach of Le Moy made the NEC semifinal game a couple of years ago when they lost to Marramac Hes an Indiana guy you know and came to Le Moine as a player Still has a couple of records which Im sure he reminds of guys from time to time He had a stellar career 1200 points in his career One of the youngest coaches in the country just turned 34 years of age But Eric this guy at the line right now if there is a list nationally of impact portal transfers this guy should be on that list Leoy needed rebounding he gave it to him Leoy needed scoring he gave it to him Leoy needed length in the front court He delivered there as well He misses two at the foul line Again Texas AM Corus Christie for a couple of years averaging 15 points shooting over 64 from the floor Heres Donald blocked Thats Deng Gang the red shirt sophomore native of Syracuse who went to Bishop Grimes Really came on at the end of last year Hes continued that to start this season Its just a good isolation right there for DJ Han They gave him the right hand side of the court Gave him a lot of music space to operate Tried to get to the rim 17 to shoot as the Eagles inbound Fred Payne with the catch ahead of Jakai Sanders And now heres Aiden Shaw driving with burst to speed He waited and then couldnt finish at the rim Saw some nice rim protection there from Silo Jackson Gets down the floor quickly Now theyll set their offense Well this is their game They are an offensive team Threepointer Mascara No Long rebound Hastings eventually finds it after it deflects off Lake Blakeley Those same analytics folks we referenced will tell you Le Moy is better on offense than defense significantly better on offense Paynes three no good Then the rebound bounces around Eventually finds Jakai Sanders a sophomore from Brooklyn New York Played at St Peters last year Was a prolific score in New York City Oh he gave up the layup attempt Finds Gang Then its inside for Moscara Gets his own rebound Still cant hit Third effort No And finally Boston College finds it Scar had to do it by himself There only two guys on the boards One was Sanders All other def all other offensive players for the Dolphins had converted already anticipating the fast break by the Eagles Well better start here for Boston College today That was definitely a point of emphasis for the group Theres that same double team Heres Fred Payne driving Looked to hand off I think for Hastings Thats what you talked about in the post There was not a ton there Now a threepoint look is strong Fred Payne in transition pain right hand floater is good Most consistent player so far this year for the Eagles Theres been four games hes been the best guy on the floor for Boston College Fred Payne He has scored in double figures in nine of his last 10 games Up to 12 points per contest Heres Jackson right to the rim and found an opening there Thats a piece of cake for him He put the ball on the floor to his right hand was in that middle third middle vertical third of the floor that we talked about No matchup to stop him from finding the straight line drive Hes coming off a careerhigh 25 points against St Bon eventry last week and you can see Hastings looking for the double team now before he gets into his move Trying to find something up and under Not quite Gang running out the rebound Garang right to the basket into the double team and he scores Electric at times 12th in the Northeast Conference in scoring right now Double figures in all but the last two games Scored over 10 as you said six in a row Pretty impressive stuff as Luca Taves falling away Little bit short on the jumper Long rebound though Its Fred Payes and he is blocked Good read by Mascara and a possession going to Le Moine when we come back Thats what hes done Hes gotten to the line by going off the dribble and playing to contact He is such an X factor for this team going into ACC play Here is Jackson inside and he traveled You know when when FCU made their run early in that game on Monday ended up taking a 14point lead It was really Donald Tan getting to the line that kept BC afloat until they got their offense going late in the first half He was eight of 10 from the line in the first half and that was really important in those key moments Oh he quite frankly Eric hes a tough cover off the dribble and has versatility with his dribble game too And is not afraid of contact Theres the versatility with the dribble game Gets himself into the post Falling away a little bit strong there might have drawn a foul on that too if he didnt fall away So Le Moine has gotten down the floor quickly Theres a three ball thats no good Theyve done it without the three so far 0 for four from behind the arc That was Mascara You can see on that shot too Only one player in green on the boards And now Fred Payne delivers from deep Thats seven points for Payne five for him The Eagles have doubled up the Dolphins Fight for sore eyes right there The catch and shoot by Fred Payne Rainwater got inside kicks around for Durang whos good First threepointer from Le Moy They answer right back They can do that They can hang around any game as FDU did the other night against the Eagles with the threepoint makes Hes a 36 threepoint shooter this year Odin Captain from Boston College pain Can he do it again Yes Double digits again Theres a nice dish and Jackson throws it down with two How about Jackson going off the trampoline right there Jakai Saunders 16 assist in there last game at Bonaventure Again showing his ability to run the team To read that three times to make sure it wasnt a typo What was the Le Moine alltime single game record 16 assists Hes one of only four guys in the country that have had a 16 or more assist game this season Fred Payne no good that time So BC by four Heres Jackson Got around Payne right to basket No And the rebound bounces down to Fred Payne who runs in transition from Austin College Eagles thought about going instead they set back here Donald Han for three Thats a little bit short Friendly fire on the rebound Its Sanders who secures it That was a good look off the open corner balls Man do they want to use this guy They do And hes showing why Eight points early for Jackson who is four of six from the floor Keeps doing that Youll see him in a spin move later on And a backcourt violation against Boston College Good defense by Trent Mascara who forces is as important as the dribbler Heres Bowden Capy inside turns and cant finish at the rim By the way they changed the call on the floor They had initially ruled a back court violation on Boston College but they ruled that BC did not have possession in the front court so thus cant be back court Thats why they get possession Turn around the other way Tennessee Rainwater has the threepointer and Le Moine leads for the first time Rainwater only his fifth threepoint make of the season Man he was confident on that Couple of years at Utah Tech before coming to Le Moine Hes a native of Washington And a strong rebound there by Eli Greenberg The first year from Centerville Ohio Its in for the first time as is Samuel Incapier And a whistle here goes against Boston College So how about Le Moine here on a seven nothing run Theyve made four of their last five from the floor Well Eric you knew theyd come in loose and confident that they can compete They know their counterparts in the Northeast Conference came here this season and had a chance Central Connecticut won New Haven music played it close FDU you saw the other night And for Le Moine they went to Texas competed went to Bonaventure had a chance to win the other night Went to Xavier got it game to overtime So they got some confidence and momentum clearly Nice design on the inbounds play Rainwater never quite had that secured Caleb Steager with the help defense from behind So on offense right now the Eagles know when the ball does go into the post they can anticipate a double team So one thing were seeing right now for BC something we havent seen a ton of but know that Earl Grant was excited about Kathy and Hastings on the floor together here as Luca Taves came out with two fouls Heres Greenberg kicks Jackson free throw line Yes Boy is he fun to watch I was going to say Eric how good is that kid feeling right now playing at an ACC school Great first 10 minutes of offense Highly energized Capy for three Thats no good Ninth time this year that Jackson has gone to double figures He has 10 points One and done Nobody on the boards that time for the Eagles Gang was too strong rebound nearly was there for Eli Greenberg who snuck between two defenders Still ends up with Boston College though and Fred Payne driving his floater It goes Good job by Fred Payne Lefthanded player with the ball on the floor hard and a very assertive way to get into the painted areas Got Pay against Jackson right now Jackson has 10 Payne has 12 Its a onepoint game Dang off the handoff and Gang wants to go against Hastings Durang boy hes quick to get that up even against a taller defender You see just one of their last seven from the floor Heres Forte for three Thats no good Rebound was long Otherwise Kappy actually had a room to get it And now Rainwater Nice dish but its bobbled by Encompier Shiloh Jackson showing he can face the basket Im not just a dunker I can get there And Fred with the right hand dribble to get into the lane Not much help there Finding a way to score Man this guy number five hes a warrior Iron Man minutes every night out As we saw most of his shots are threepoint attempts He was just one of eight for three last game against FDU but knocked one down early Was whistled before the shot The thing I think thats you know about Payne that really stands out and I I suppose this is more of an eye test but it matches up with the stats is you know when theres been moments when its felt like all right its time to like dig deep and and somebodys got to really be the guy offensively It feels like its fantastic Thats right I was alluding to there warrior mentality There it is Whatever is necessary to get done 32 from behind the threepoint line this year Great assist turnover ratio as well We didnt mention that Fred Payne hes already just three points shy of a careerhigh Hes got 15 points 15 of BCs 20 The other five belong to Dominant who had the first five points of this game for BC Heres Sanders driving Sanders is swatted away and an offensive foul is called at the end of it Fabulous job by 22 Jaden Hastings being a help defender being a protect the rim defender doing a nice job distorting it so the charge can be picked up by Seager Steer just doing whats necessary defensively coming off that bench Yeah he had a really impactful 14 minutes against FDU They needed a spark in the second half He was that foul is on Sanders Thats three fouls in a row on Jakai Sanders And two of them the last two were on rule 1014 Ill give you this Rule 1014 hands on the dribbler what he did in both instances Too bad because hes coming with great momentum Career game the other night at Bonaventure They had a bunch of guys with career games It was everything but the win And as you know from going to school in Syracuse and working in the Syracuse market thats a big game Yes it absolutely is Theres a foul Leo at Bonaventure So that was three fouls in 42 seconds The the energys there Theyre playing hard Last foul going against Greenberg So here is Forte at the line Forte in right now Luca Taves picked up two fouls early for Boston College Forte played a lot of the point guard early Its been more of Taves recently but still feels like its game to game and Earl Grant feeling out who has the hot hand between those two And I think for Forte his efficiency numbers are not what they were a year ago South Dakota both on his twos and on his threes His turnover ratio is great Hes just still feeling his way Three ball in Capier No good That was a long rebound Boy a really good effort by Moscara He nearly got it but DC does find it now in transition Forte will wisely reset Fred Payne deep three Little bit short again No hands by the Eagles on that rebound in tight Thats what Staggers been doing is he get you know the interesting thing with him and and we talked about him sort of being the guy thats kind of when BCs had a moment where they really needed someone to step up Hes been that guy Most of thats been in the second half Had the second half run against FDU Had the second half run against New Haven which was crucial Here its the early start which obviously BC is needed as you see see there All but six of the Eagles points Thats a foul on the threepoint attempt by Donald Tan Jr So Moscara going to the line for three Man the Eagles were in a stance They were working hard They were locating the ball with help positioning And just a foul you dont need that just negates the hustle anytime youre foul in the half court area Gives you an opportunity to talk about this guy at the line though cheering Yeah nice homecoming for him You can kind of hear it in the crowd Its got a lot of fans here today Played at the Belmont Hill School for two seasons Before that he was at Wuset Regional High School which is out in Holden Mass There you see him and Josh Baldman whos playing another Central New York team with Cornell right now cheering In the case of a scarab he went to Le Moine thinking hed be a division 2 player Thats right Matter of fact they played around the corner at Bentley his freshman year in the Northeast 10 playoffs Didnt know he would become a division one player this quickly Biggest thing for him is hes been healthy this year after dealing with some injuries throughout his career and has just taken a massive jump in almost every category so far His fundamentals are outstanding with the basketball in his hands NEC leader threepoint percentage coming in So he makes two at the line Le Moy is within one Asamotto in for Boston College for Jaden Hastings Good work for Hastings Good job by Hastings being patient Thought there might be perimeter help coming down to double Took his time Found out he had some time to go shoot and did a nice job finishing his first two points Heres Moscara from deep That was halfway down But then the rebound Oh its out of bounds Runnovich and Oamoto with some miscommunication So Le Moy will get another possession out of it You know Jaden Hastings in his new role this year in this low post getting more time You can see he had to take his time Anticipated potential double team then realized I can get to my left shoulder right hand Thats my bread and butter move You see top five in the ACC in blocks this year Hes been really efficient from the floor especially recently Godamn And I mean you can look at Yeah Yeah the analytics Theyve been a better team offensively when hes been on the floor Hasnt scored much in the last two games Only four points in the last two games So good to see him get on the scoreboard here right now Contact or something was sure on the floor and Osamoto will come out Shaw You got to be able to see right Yeah Yeah Especially if youre a shooter like him Boy some good looks for Trent Muscera It just has not fallen from three so far Hes 0 for four from deep Donald Han throws it away Yeah Not sure it was there Probably Oh what a pass that is That was outstanding Now it resets around Le Mos got to reset out of it Would have been really effective if theyd gone right to the rim but that was a fulllength court bounce pass leading Greenberg Heres Jackson now working against Shaw Jackson yes just that spin move in the lane You mentioned that earlier Hes got a bag there you know gets him near that rim Got a good bag of finishes Hes efficient too Again if Le Moy were in the rankings again third year of their transition so not ranked yet Hed be 17th in division one in field goal percentage Time onepoint game 542 remaining in this first half Ocara Nice pass Jackson right to the rim and Le Moy with the lead back Not good communication there by the Eagles They switched on the play Excellent job recognizing the switch of the roll Its a fast ball to the corner Rdonovich and the foul before the shot goes up How about this fast You know this kids got funk in his game Eric Theres one of it right there Shows up in a lot of different ways Thats a very narrow window to get that pass through Read the switch brilliantly Saw his roll guy cutting hard We talked about their offense I mean you can see it Theyre doing different things They find ways to get to the basket Its not all the threepoint shot Theyre a team that doesnt run particular set plays They play off of concepts They play through some principles that coach has put together for them Just looking to find advantages That last foul went against Muscara And Shaw got great positioning off the inbounds He sure did just use that reach length girth find that baseline pass So after backto back fouls on Le Moy DC gets the lead back Heres Jackson and that time no good Jackson now already 10 attempts from the floor Hes seven of 10 But Le Moy only three offensive rebounds so far Heres Kapky Left hand Kapy no good Spitting off Jackson Yeah he needed to get that one Still a onepoint game Moscara thought about it from deep Instead drives and theyre going to call a foul defensively against Cap Number 23 Aiden Shaw You know Aiden Shaw with his size his length his reach his strength Just been terrific in tight Thats a great job on a hard cut Hard to defend Sets himself up nicely in the front of the rim Beg your pardon that last foul on Shaw not Capki Heres Jackson spinning Jackson right hand little bit short See up by one Kappy working against Jackson Theres a heave that goes off the foot of Forte out of bounds going to Le Moine I with his elbow So you take a look at Le Moine right now just two of 10 from three But obviously right in this game thats for the lead Its no good on the runner from Greenberg How about theyre winning the rebounding Eric 1815 too Three of those on the offensive boards Theyre just two of their last 10 from the floor Eagles got off to a fast start Fred Payne has 15 for BC but its taken away there It was excellent ball screen defense Another great pass BUT A BLOCK BY SHAW WHO COMES out of nowhere And then Jackson is fouled Boy you could just sit here all day and watch him pass the ball I told you this I told you he got funk He can do a lot of good things with the basketball Some of it So much of it comes from two hands on the ball Watch this two bounce pass Nice and easy layup But at the other end they guarded a ball screen situation extremely well Eli Greenberg getting deflection on the play and creating offense from the defense And the other thing that happened that was a third foul on Aiden Shaw So similar to what we saw from Jakai Sanders earlier who picked up three fouls in a span of a little over 40 seconds similar here for Shaw Hes become big minutes for Jason the Lynn Massachusetts native cheering Right there number 55 This is his opportunity knocking on his door especially in the rebounding game Rashaw is so crucial That was three fouls in exactly 60 seconds there So 25 a piece after one of two at the line Heres Donald Tan driving Han kicks Its knocked away Josiah Lee the freshman Just some time in the middle of the season playing his third game since coming back Nine minutes against St Bonaventure Watch the job there Theres going to be a crowd created by hand Just traffic with green shirts And how about that deflection by Josiah music Lee We saw an earlier one by the other freshman Greenberg Real good job in their recovery stances getting their hands above their letters Have to deflect with a couple balls Theyre checking the clock right now And it looks like everythings squared away 332 to go in the half 17 on the timer as BC inbounds Kanes got 15 to lead the Eagles Heres Kapki open for three No good Mamoto was couldnt quite get positioning Nothing wrong with that shot right there Kavky 35 shooter Right decision by Fred Payne to just swing the basketball Payne will get a breather here Caleb Stager comes back Sharpshooter Eli Greenberg here with the point has done a nice job with Jai Sanders being in foul trouble Good hedge right there by Kapky Good recovery inside Jackson going to work Thats no good Nearly got his own rebound though before Kappy eventually finds it So BC now has not scored in the last 2 minutes and 20 seconds Le Moine doesnt have a field goal in the last 2 and 12 minutes either Tied at 25 Under three minutes to go in the first half Thats thrown away How about Lee Another deflection by the guys in green Fifth turnover for Boston College That was halfway down for Dank Dang but an offensive rebound by Jackson but its taken away by Kempy Both teams have gone a little bit stagnant offensively here This is where we need BC needs to say Run the team swing the ball Its Taves who tries to do that Kapy kicks Donald Tan for three Yes Beautiful job by Kapki recognizing hes got a spot up shooter in the long corner Gets the assist on the play Donald Tan two for three from three today Has eight points and three rebounds in 13 minutes Now Kappys playing some good defense right here but his offensive skills are showing at the other end first year with Boston College after a couple of years at Butler Another good hedge by Kapky and Gang inside and he gets the basket Boy its felt like a couple of times been a lot of gold jerseys there but Gang goes up and its a little bit of a scoreless drought for Lavoy Elusive is the operative word sometimes off the bounce Kentucky here we go in this first half DC has led by as much as seven at 92 Le Moy led by three Its a onepoint game right now Oamoto fakes and driving and its a blocking foul against Leoy Boden Kavky just continues to be a strong strong defensive player There hes going at the star of the game for Le Moy and does a great job and just does an excellent job recognizing Ive got a pass to make to a deep shooter throw it across diagonally Valuable pick and pop guy double figure score in seven games off the bench And to the defensive point as that free throw is good Jackson now has missed his last four shots from the floor And thats directly related to Capi being in the game And Im going to tell you prior to those hes had to guard ball screen situations hedge on the play recover to his man Hes doing a superior job right now defensively the Butler transfer someone that Earl Grant had his eye on coming out of high school that he was recruiting him and Hastings and now hes got them both DC by three You know you got free throws from Greenberg playing the point A little more pressure on him so theyll let Gang bring the ball up against his matchup Hastings got a hand in 15 to shoot Gangs got it back against Taves Jackson now got a size advantage Little bit of an effected play at the rim just at the end and then its out of bounds Good help defense by DC Absolutely They crowded him well forced him into a double hop play to get his hands on the ball Forte comes back in for Taves in this final minute DC by three shot 38 from the floor Theyre five of 13 from three and Steer trying to add to that No good there Thats what he has to do Good awareness to get the ball there Heres Gang driving against Forte and Gang has nine points Well if your transition defense is slow or theyre backpedaling hell just run it right at the pack Gang what a finish Little over a 3second difference here at the end of the first half BC by one Josiah Lee on the basketball now Eli Greenberg off the ball These two freshman have played well Get to the corner for Stiger for three Its no good And got it He still has time Hands three is short And then is there a foul there No its out of bounds with 210 of a second to go in the half So its got to be a lob and could be Asamod Hes got Asimota Hes got Hastings Steager in hand with Forte the music inbound See Asimota at the free throw line Can come up and get him on a back screen and just chuck it right to the rim if he can get a tip in here There it is Got to be just a lob tasting assist Good effort Jackson there defensively That does it for half number one with Eagles holding on to so far and theres been five or six games He was the best Eagle on the court that day Donald Tan for three and that is a little bit short Hastings was fouled Actually Im sorry They called it held ball and possession arrow goes to Le Moy Simple play by the Eagles Clear out a side Let the point guard take it deep into the corner Throw the long corner pass across to DJ Hand Thats taken away GOOD STEAL BY H OH NO HE LOST IT GOING UP BOY he anticipated that steal nicely didnt he Certainly did And then just lost it going up the other way gets him to three for 10 on the day and two of those threepointers 14 to shoot Here is Gang driving Gang up and under No And Shaw has the rebound You know speaking of pain as good as he was he did not score since the 853 mark of that first half Remember he had 15 points in a row So you could say even with 15 they need to get him going a little bit in this second half Heres Donald Tan scoring at the basket Simple play Get into the lane Use your strength Donald Han always has a good post up game Double figures now for Han PC by three Not that first half though Zero zero second chance points for the Eagles Deep three Yes Jakai Sanders Well he spent a lot of time on the bench and I think he realiz because of foul trouble Realized a threepoint shot might make a difference maker here I remember picked up those three fouls in the span of about 45 seconds So game tied again 32 a piece Boston College and Le Moy Luca Taves kicks for hand striving after passing up the three is blocked but a foul Good solid defense by the Eagles Good helping stuff Now you know Jai Sanders was a prolific scorer in New York City Scored a ton of points Thats kind of a logo three huh Pretty close to it Just couldnt find his way at St Peters in the lineup And hes an important portal transfer as well Averaging nearly five assists per game again had the big day 16 assists which was a new program record against St Bonaventure Its something like that you know hes leading them in threepoint shooting 44 So closeouts got to be quick They need to be aggressive You got to recognize where he is Two free throws for Donald Sanders back in the starting lineup today after coming off the bench the last three I just upped his stats too much Hes 31 from behind the threepoint line Sorry about that family So a twopoint lead Gang to the basket He kicks Sanders gives it up Jackson a spin and Jackson throws it down You know we saw this going in with the offensive analytics that they have done a fabulous job sharing the basketball Theres a great illustration right there Spin Hastings kicks for Donald Tan The extra pass is broken up by Sanders but he was out of bounds Thats a really good read by Sanders And just in the first music 2 and 12 minutes you see the impact when he is on the floor after he had to come off for a chunk of that first half Inside out off the bounce but more importantly on that play Jackson relocated to the dead center of the floor the nail as a lot of people call it Great spacing great sharing of the basketball by the guys in green Look at Taves Just four to shoot for BC They got to go Hastings spinning turning No Decent look off the window considering the timer was about to expire So Sanders running the point again in a tie game and got a piece again Diving for it And lets see who they got the bat on They get it on Sanders and thats his fourth foul You know loose ball fouls are difficult and you teach players to dive after loose balls but sometimes you crash into them as they try to retrieve it This is superior job by Donald Han And you can see when the basketball exactly that was his ball again Donald Han finding ways to help this team win and thatll be a teaching moment for Nate Champion right Probably more important Sure to give up one and keep yourself on the floor cuz now hes going to have to sit for a bunch Here is Shaw Got into the paint Kicks for hand Just four to shoot and he lost it out of bounds Possession to Leo There wasnt much room to go much further They had to pick his dribble up there but first to the floor and that loose ball got that possession for Donald H You know both teams are probably going to go this whole game with not a lot of pressing not much zone straight mantoman in the half court areas and just grind it out against each other Blakeley fakes Blakeley in and out Blakey doing a good job over rush of the play by Fred Payne Heres Hastings against Jackson Hastings left hand is good Continues to improve with his finishing skills Nice job going to his nondominant left hand Hastings got a piece of it Fred Payne Quick pass Pan this time scores 14 for Donald Tan Jr Eagles ramping up the defense a little bit Fourpoint game here early in the second half You see theyre trying to just keep the ball away from Jackson here in the high post Eli Greenberg Theyre trying to create something there And Greenberg is fouled Hastings got his leg extended a little bit there Commits the from division two the Northeast 10 to division one Much like former Boston College assistant Pat Dukat had to do at UMass LOL It is not an easy job but its more complicated now for Nate than it was for Pat Duket Theres a lot of teams that have gone up recently Bunch of them in the NEC Stonehill Marramac New Haven enhanced the profile of the school So a steal And heres Fred Payne His first point since the middle of the first half I think he showed Mascara right there I got a quick release when that ball comes to me on a string as that one did Its gone I let it fly Good job Seven nothing run for BC That ties Fred Paynes careerhigh with 18 And a little bit of a trap put on And as you said we havent seen a ton of it Eagles do a good job there Comes around Garang is no good from three and Hastings has the rebound So a seven nothing run as we said over the last minute for Boston College Lob for Hastings and he is fouled as he got in on the undersized Gang there You know this is a lot of reps in the gym Something like this quick catch and shoot See Mascara came with a high hand a single left arm in the air but its not enough Give Fred Payne just a little bit of distance He can go with it Hes got it off the inbounds Yeah they got a different matchup on him now Switch Tennessee Rainwater 66 so hes got a little bit of a size edge there Taves pull up jumper No good that time Nice tap by Hastings in pain with the floater is no good Then a foul on Hastings reaching over on the rebound attempt Well as we said at the half zero second chance points for the Eagles So there was an opportunity right there Good job by Jaden just tipping it back out Little bit of pressure on and it works through to Moscara FOR THREE AND A FLYING REBOUND DANGER Did he find a runway to the rim there Not a good job by the Eagles guarding the dribbler Led to a catch and shoot opportunity from the three Payne for three No good that time but he knew it And he gets his own rebound Nice pass inside for Donald Han Two guys that have played together quite a bit Just knew Hard cut to the ball Payne will get it to me Donald Han scores Eagles over 45 from the floor here in this second half The three ball Mascara and thats the one that goes The Boston native his first threepointer after missing his first six from deep Taz tried a little run inside for Hastings sits out of bounds and possession to Le Moy Just picked his dribble up too soon But how about Donald right here just knowing if I cut to the ball my man was looking for the ball cut get it put it in How about this dunk Wow You said thats pretty clean runway right to the rim Fourpoint game 13 minutes to go here in the second half Final nonconference game for Boston College and Le Moine And thats Taves trying to go around his screen and he commits the foul Thats three fouls on Luca Taves You know when you try to get over the top of dribble handoffs like that you got to change your body Go vertical Just call it skinny up to get over the top You just try to go through normal defensive stance youll run right into the screener whos dribbling the ball Dang Little fake there working against Stagger Can he get positioning He draws the foul Had no intention of passing it Knew that he had an advantage So exciting off the dribble Watch this Hes just going to go Im taking this match up Seager and going right at him So he didnt play as a freshman He red shirted Last year it was really the end of the season From February 1st on he started six of the last eight games Its over 32 minutes a game and and really valuable minutes cheering after not playing much at all early in the season And he has really continued that this season 10 points in seven straight games coming off a game where he tied his career high with 20 points against St Bonaventure But I mean you see the athleticism you can see some of the different things he does And a Syracuse native who stays home and goes to Le Moy That red shirt year truly helped him He needed strength He needed to slow down and he knew they were going to division one So it was a great decision He gained a lot out of it And his momentum continues to elevate in his second year of live play By the way it was backtoback fouls on Luca Taves So he now has four fouls Sanders with four fouls on the other side for Le Moine and keeps possession somehow through all that traffic finds Fred Payne whos too strong but he gets his own rebound Never hit the rim so hes got to go Didnt realize it at first Gets the call now and his floater is no good That never hit the rim either There was only five on the timer when he circled out beyond the threepoint arc Heres Greenberg falling away Greenberg no good Some looks today that have normally gone down for these two teams offensively have not The moy certain 37 Eagles at 36 Payne over the top for Stager driving Stagger inside No And the rebound to Jackson Stagger nearly took it away but they called a foul Such a hard play to make You try to be aggressive but you cant get after the rebounder like that We are under 12 here in the second half and the Le Moy Dion between both of these teams and frankly its been much closer than that most of the way Absolutely Le Moy now still running the points in the paint at 2418 Eagles have shortened that number a little bit here to start the second half Tennessee Rainwater steps back and delivers A tie game here in Chestnut Hill He only came into this game four of five from the threepoint line Rainwater hes made two to two for two in this game and a couple of deep ones in that Stagger to match He did just what the Eagles need You got to match those threes just so separation is not created DC back in front by three Steagers first three after missing his first couple today Wherefores got to do the job on Greenberg Theyre trying to get through this without Sanders Boy Mosca with a tough take to get around Here is Greenberg Nine to shoot Works it back and the drive inside Rainwater scores again Rainwater says I got game He shows the three Puts the ball on the floor with a shot fake Goes right to the rim Twofoot stop Very fundamental Back to a onepoint game Forte is blocked Was going against two defenders there It was Jackson who got the block shot You know the threepoint goal is going to be important going forward Seager getting one for the Eagles right here And Rainwater a little bit out of character You can see Asamod gave him a cushion What a great name Oh yeah Tennessee Rainwater Here are some of the best in college basketball right now Theres Caleb Steager who is fouled by the aforementioned Rainwater Different category but Chandler Ping is pretty good Oh yeah Wiggy ball You dont like that Thats Theyre all good And they all got to do some explaining thats for sure When they walk into a room tough to live in a house with always right So lets see This was a similar time to when Stagger came in the game in the second half against FDU and really gave Boston College a an energy lift I mean he scored and hit some threes but it was really the energy lift more than anything else that was really crucial I think the foul trouble the Sanders one is really problematic He hasnt done a lot in terms of scoring but he hasnt been able to be on the floor right Hes only played 12 minutes Question will be at what point Go at eight go at five George just read the scoreboard Scoreboard says three right now as Jackson kicks Gerang Good pullback dribble He see thinks he can beat Capy off the bounce Capy doing a determined job right there And Jackson gets a nice match up with Oamoto there Nice little switch by Le Moine Theyre back within one Big minutes for Oamoto Hes got to guard that thing better and be more physical 19 points for Jackson teams leading scorer Here is Han driving and its blocked by Muscera And now Gang on the run Gang coming through and hes fouled Speed of the dribble speed of the teammates running the floor Eagles really not doing a good job sprinting themselves You know defensive transition its not backpedaling Its sprinting to get ahead of the play And you can see here see backpedaling by Kowky Im not going to do it cheering And Dan Gerang has once again tied this basketball game break You know you you go through the course of a season and that was something the Nate Champion said to us and he said you know we we actually feel like our defense which was such a conversation last year with this team and even has been early this year He said you know we do think its been better in a lot of ways you know part of the nonconference schedule that weve put cheering together in some ways been forced to put together with a lot of road games a lot of you know a lot of those things It doesnt necessarily show up on the scoreboard because some of the good opponents youre playing at Texas at St Bonaventry here recently but you are seeing it today Oh yeah And some short pressure right here soft pressure right here But theyve got athleticism Gang obviously defensively Jackson as a rim protector And Rainwater oh boy into the front row as he creates the steal That guy there with his energy This is a team that can guard better I think than their team a year ago Here is Jackson against Capi Jackson got to find an outlet He does ITS OUT FOR MOSCARA WHOS GOOD FROM THREE Mascara just stays behind the threepoint line Not cheering even thinking about attacking the boards Not even thinking about cutting to the rim takes that pass nicely when traffic jam got in the way of Jackson scoring Well Moy with their biggest lead of the game Theyre up by four with under nine minutes to go Here is Hastings inside backing down and Hastings scores and the foul Thats work in the gym by Hastings Get in that low post Just work on your post mood But you can see Mascara the savvy player that he is said No no Im not going anywhere find me at the top behind the threepoint line rebound the ball or in this case throw the ball back out to me And thats my best look at the goal And then when BC needed a basket to try to answer after Le Moine had stretched the lead to four you know hes going left shoulder right hand Jackson just kind of played him head up but the strength of 22 Jaden Hastings 69 240 Short on the free throw and Jackson has the rebound Jackson now another double double today 19 points 11 rebounds That is out of bounds Possession going to Boston College They retain their challenge Do not lose a timeout Heres right to the basket and they score Trent Bascara How about the Boston native who struggled early from the floor but he has come to life here in the second half in his hometown Isnt that that bad action Faked handoff and has took it himself as his defender anticipated edging to the handoff Eight of his 10 points have come in this second half Le Moyne by four with 815 to go Hastings and Capy on the floor at the same time That pass was behind Hastings Dolphins continue to get their hands on balls in their helping positions Excellent deflection by Shiloh And a whistle here and Jackson coming out was like he was holding his shoulder maybe Thats something to watch He has obviously been so important for this Le Moy team leading the way with 19 points Double double today 19 and 11 That is a piece of it from Fred Payne but still alive here for Le Moy Heres Gang against Hands Rainwater got Captain up Rainwater still working Three to shoot Rainwater going and he is effective And thats what having those two guys on the floor does Absolutely found a driving lane into his right hand but closed up nicely by the Eagles And going quickly its stripped Possession stays here with 733 remaining in the second half Lamoy leads by four Set them up in the half court area Donalds hand makes the free throw He has 17 points See Jackson who again was off the floor for Le Moine come off was kind of holding his shoulder something to look at and hes about to check back in It was his right shoulder too on that defensive play where he deflected it So a twopoint game Nice kick to the corner for Rainwater who traveled Not so sure there was a travel on that play Rainwater sometimes goes too fast off his catches Shiloh Jackson Not so sure there was a travel So Jackson returns here for Le Moine They have held the lead here for about three minutes over this second half Coming up on seven minutes remaining Le Moy by two His final nonconference game of the year And its Donald Tans working against Gurang Han was hanging in the air and just a really good job by Gang Did not allow any room there Donald Han just really good job getting himself into a location to score in the low post Rainwater hits Moscara Didnt feel like he had the look Rainwater is spin Rainwater coming in and hes fouled again He goes so hard and so quick Rainwater there He got into his spin dribble quickly created a little bit of havoc for his defender How do you guard him Tennessee the transfer from Utah Tech Played 30 games last year About 16 minutes six points a game Hes over those numbers so far this year on his averages About 19 minutes nearly seven points a game And thats what hes done You know hes so aggressive putting the ball on the floor change of direction dribble Sometimes he goes behind his back He gets himself to the free throw line He did this last year the last two years in Utah They throw no good So one of two Mo has made five of their last six shots from the floor Theyre shooting 43 today and they lead by three over Boston College Heres Fred Payne driving A kick for hand His three ball is good Well Donalds had his threepoint shot today and BC has desperately needed it Three for six from deep He ties the game at 55 Oh nice find for Jackson but its stripped by Forte An excellent defensive play Heres Hastings and Jackson This matchups been so fun to watch all day He stinks Keeps his foot and Kay with the throw down It was chaos in that low post So you got double team but he did keep his pivot foot Good cut good pass cheering good finish by the big men I think youre going to see more and more of Hastings and Kathy on the floor together for Boston College as they go into the ACC Up by one Floater right hand No And the rebound is Fortz Looks like they gave Donald Panda two by the way Heres Fred Payne Steps in and delivers cheering Hes always been good at the one pass catch and shoot A new careerh high 21 points for Fred Pay with 21 points So now how does Le Moy respond and they do so with Jakai Sanders back in the game with four fouls Thought about the fiveminute mark Good switching here by the Eagles So BC has made their counter punch Can Le Moine hang in Rainwater for three He got it Tennessee Rainwater Even his teammates just say Where did that come from Just hasnt been there all season But he is feeling good about his threepoint shot As you said only four of five from three all year Heres Ham Thats a two And that is good Donald Hand has found his shot on a Sunday afternoon Sure has And a couple of answer baskets from hand you know put aside what it means in terms of the greater context for someone who has worked as hard as he has whos in the gym as much as he has I mean we all know that is I know that was a two right there We all know thats not a 17 threepoint shooter but not at all At some point as as music the great Phil Parcell said you are what your record is but to his credit he has found it today And and thats got to feel so good for him Eight for 17 from the field three for six on threes to pay That was a little short from deep and Rainwater gets a long rebound Still a fourpoint game here folks 435 to go Bosera was a little bit of a heat check BC can slow things down where Chase Forte is just going to direct this team in the half court area Forte a lob inside Hastings does make the catch well against Rainwater adjusts himself finds Kapki Extra pass for hands Yeah good inside out Extra hand falling away Hand a little short that time Inbound to Jackson with four minutes to go Little handoff Heres the drive Mascara blocked by Hastings Itll stay here with Le Moine when we come back with 349 remaining in the second half So BC has gone on their run Nina and Han have combined for 71 of Boston Colleges points today This Le Moyan team with the basketball shooting 50 in this second half From both the floor and from deep Heres Sanders No good But a rebound Jackson goes right back up affected at the rim by Hastings Got a third chance though and Mascaras no good Same thing Mascaras spotting up at the top of the key Had the look Yeah great compete on that rebound by Jackson versus Hastings Look at those numbers Donalds hand and Fred Payne 44 combined points today New careerhigh for Payne cheering Forts been running the point here down the stretch with Taves with four fouls Heres Hanford for three Thats no good Kathy goes ups Moscara and it ends up going out of bounds Thats a pretty good job not to come over the back of Absolutely enough to keep possession Seven personal fouls for the Eagles Just six personal fouls for Le Moine at this point in the second half Quick inbounds 16 to shoot for Boston College You know they want to try Hastings here Hes got it Going to work Hastings left hand Yes How about that move when he came off the lane he had a face up look at the rim decided not to use it got into the lane used his nondominant left hand and its taken away by Forte against Sanders Sanders cant do anything with four fouls and Forte gets to the timeout Leoy pitch Eagles clearly up in their toes right now defensively Yeah theyve even pushed the pressure out a little bit more in the second half It has worked for them Here is Jackson Le Mo trying to find a way back Nice reach by Hastings and theyll stay here with 11 on the timer See everybody going to pick him up on the team They had great Eagles had great el position on the weak side They loaded up the lane area nicely as they pressured the ball Short clock now with 11 Jackson off the inbounds Hand off for Greenberg Hastings comes out on the switch Greenberg gets rid of it Just five to shoot here Jackson does settle it Got to go here Gorang for three is no good Boy the BC defense has come to life here late big possession there getting a shot clock violation But youre absolutely right Eric Theyre understanding and thats another part of end of game situations that the defense will win the game for us Not going to be an offense This is a Le Moy team His pain got knocked off and cheering its going to be Le Moy basketball How about this This defensive sequence here was really good You can see the positions off the basketball good knowledge and good help of where the ball is and superb job rotating out of a little bit of a scramble getting the shot clock violation as Le Moy tried to spread the floor on him and now they get a turnover Two minutes to go Nice feet for Jackson and Capy got his hand in and is called for the foul Yeah you just got to go with two hands vertically on that rotation Tempting to swipe down at the ball but more often than not thats whats going to happen going to commit a foul on the play Two shots from the Dolphins Shil Jackson Capki with 22 minutes in this ball game Most significant thing though in those 22 minutes 10 rebounds Hasnt scored one field goal but he has boarded well He has done a nice job helping hedging on ball screen situations His position awareness off the ball is very strong cheering and Jackson misses the free throw And again you know weve talked about the defense that hes played against Shiloh Jackson music who was so impactful many different points in this game Now all of a sudden Jackson has not scored in the last eight minutes hasnt had the driving lanes to go to his slash game off the bounce as much and that continues He misses two at the line So Le Moy had a bunch of opportunities there Even off the turnover couldnt score but theyll get a third chance here Onehanded pass just what you dont need into the lane right there going to start to push with some pace here but be efficient Gang for three Thats no good Another Boston College rebound is Fred Pay And hes willing to take some time This is what Fred can do He can play the backup one if he has to If the pressure is too much he can advance the ball He gives it forte here Still a 143 run for Boston College They lead by eight which is their largest lead of the game And there is the foul from Rainwater number one Tennessee Thats his third personal foul Get them to the one and one Eagles 64 today Those champions got to be pleased with how theyre playing here I know not ahead but theyve played well on the road We talked about at Xavier earlier in the year another Jesuit school Got that game into overtime How about BC Another rebound and Payne Smart decision taking some time and he forces Garang to commit the foul 13 foul So again I think you know Kane you can talk about Donald Tan Sure The the thing for the second game in a row that Earl Grants got to really like is in these key moments down the stretch I mean if you look at you know the last five minutes and overtime throw that in The last five minutes BC just take like a plus minus was significantly in the negative all season long even in some of their wins And that has totally flipped these last two games And theres the whistle and a foul called on the rebound attempt So just to finish the point if if the goal here in the nonconference is to take things out of these games and build into conference play even if maybe the games are closer for a while then if youre a Grant you might want thats got to be the biggest thing you you take out of these two games over this holiday break going into ACC play And the Eagles can finish off this last 105 cheering They have not hit their free throws here late but Moy has gone quiet from the floor Point has not scored in over four minutes Thats why BC still retains the lead that they have by nine despite missing some free throws Heres Sanders right to the basket He scores and a foul Just dont want this in one situation Sanders was not going to be denied as he got it into his strong right hand just really does a good job Not a good job by Hastings there leveling off Thats his job right there His man set the screen His job is to level the ball handler off as his teammate recovers Sanders doing a good job gaining advantage off of that Getting to the rim Luca Taves is going to come back in for Hastings Coach is going to go four guards with Capki Hastings just picked up his fourth foul There certainly have been some guys with foul trouble No ones gotten to the five though So the and one for cheering Sanders to make this a two possession game And he does Six for Sanders where he has had to play limited minutes due to foul trouble And a whistle and a foul against Rainwater reaching it Too much of a chance by Rainwater Had him on the sideline And they probably could have backed up just a little bit and got a good trap right here at midcourt He didnt have to reach And this his fourth So Fred Payne will go to the line Fred only at the line twice tonight You know 22 points eight for 17 but five for 10 on his threes Just hasnt been to the line cheering Thats another miss Yeah And in his own way Fred Ping got seven rebounds in this game Second leading rebounder Capkys 11 cheering Wow Well Le Moy has a chance still because the Eagles have made just one free throw Can one of five here down the stretch Can Le Moy take advantage though Time running out on him And a great block by Forte Thats a heave and a prayer AND ITS A FOUL ON THE THREEPOINT SHOOTER Trent Mascara just forcing something from deep And you know sometimes offensive players click kick their feet but this is just a good quality block by Forte the guard position but he doesnt do any of that Just shoots straight up and vertical Al goes against Donalds hand So three free throws here for an 82 free throw shooter You can add a little bit to what you were talking about winning in crunch time Eric is you got to make free throws and then those silly fouls Theres two more things to add to that awareness factor of how to win in end of game situations especially something like this Put a great threepoint shooter at the line Well Grant is going to talk about their music strategy here as he calls timeout do the job here on a free throw block out Scar is an 81 music 82 free throw shooter Cant let Rainwater in there Hes looking to get in there And this is a guy youve got to get They have to pinch him and get him cheering Figure this has to be a must And it is So he makes all three It comes out Greenberg comes in Threepoint game 321 to go and down to hand and immediately a foul by Rainwater and thats five So Tennessee Rainwater will foul out of this game with 313 seconds to go What what a threepoint shooting day it was for Rainwater 12 points three for three from behind the arc after he was just four of five all year from three Tennessee plays so aggressive Hes a tough matchup in the half court because of his versatility of putting the ball on the floor But those are quality minutes for the Utah Tech transfer So its going to come down to the foul line You see 10 of 17 from the line but most of those misses have been late And who has to his credit we talked about finding his threepoint shot today his foul shot has come back after a little bit of a slow start Hes at 79 over the last nine games after just 14 of 27 to start cheering And he missed A one of two for hand Five of six at the line today Fourpoint game DC up on Le Moy Sanders pushing against Tave Sanders goes up Its short Rebound to Hand Big time rebound by Donald Fouled so they went right with Sanders driving the baseline and he couldnt finish at the rim And 184 to go And Hampton going back to the foul line Got the ball in his right hand had lots of room to go Official John Gaffne tell him he had a good look at that play Just goes trying to get a hand on the dribble You can see the official right on the baseline Watched all the way through Thats Luca Taves who was there defensively and Donald Tan hits cheering a key free throw If this one goes it would tie his season high with 26 points Eagles now nine of 16 from the line in the second half 56 and it does cheering So H does his job down the stretch BC by six 15 seconds to go Le Moy got to go here Sanders hits Mascara Three ball No good rebound Stager and he is fouled with 59 to go I thought they might think about a held ball there but the foul is called and BC looks like theyre going to close this out Steager was not going to be denied on that one He knew on how important this 5050 rebound was and really went strong to go retrieve it They set a flare screen from Moscow at the top but look at Seeker Im getting it My hands are on it Nobody else is getting their hands on that Good job by the freshman Well credit to Le Moine for a valiant fight today but in the end just one field goal make in the final five minutes of this game And Boston College though they made it a little hairy there for a second Looks to have things secured now Stagger hits a couple Free ball for Greenberg Late is no good Boston College holds on So the second game in a row the Eagles expand their lead in the final five minutes and they have won
