Five and three Southern Miss tip is Miamis one by Ernest Ud Jr and the Canades have it to start the afternoon 7566 win at Miss on Tuesday night Their biggest win of the season Backtoback victories against Georgetown at Miss and got a kickball violation Southern Miss zone Were going to see this a lot today Yeah And its a 131 which which you know again Miami has seen a lot of zone this year mostly 23 but Southern Miss is going to change it up too like here they come out of this side out of bounds in a manto man Trey Donaldson Miami point guard Michigan and Auburn in his college career down low to Malik Renu fourth leading scoreer in the ACC to the corner for a quick three Thats been part of the struggles for Miami shooting it at 37 from three coming in Games where theyve been good games where they havent Three on the other end for Southern Miss And that rattles home for Curt Lewis Lewis Weeks and Tiveres are the guys who can shoot it Donaldson asks for a screen from Shelton Henderson Three nothing start for Southern Miss Donaldson gets to his spot Couldnt hit that time Hes been the key to the Miami offense early Southern Miss even in their man its going to look like his own I mean they are really loaded up in the gaps Theyre going to force Miami to beat them over the top today And you can live I think if youre Southern Miss with that midrange jump shot Ty Weeks 18 points per game in the post here The post to guard here against Renu Small guy on a big and Renu affected all that Rebound down to Shelton Henderson fourstar off 18 to9 he had it taken its weeks down the right weeks with the stop creates contact couldnt score but Benets there to clean it up and Southern Miss has a five nothing start to this one see the head coach for the Golden Eagles Jay Ladner talked to him this week this is a team is so unbelievably physical and weve seen it here in this first minute and a half yeah I mean they hit a three to start the game from their best threepoint shooter by far But this game is going to be won 15 feet and in Thats where both these teams excel Thats where they both want the basketball is in that paint and to the basket Miami came in at 58 from two top 45 in the country Southern Miss top 100 in twopoint percentage This is where Renu likes to operate from Henderson downhill tried to go through two and he got tied on up Good start to Southern Misss day And theyll switch and that man theyll switch one through five and they got a lot of like parts so you dont really get caught in bad matchups much and a nice job just swarming to the basketball tying it up Theyre tough I mean thats the thing about Southern Miss like theyre not going to be afraid They may be outtalented outskilled but they are not going to be afraid of the physicality of this matchup Slip pass Brumfield low again Weeks fouled by Renew Thats an early test for Jay Lucas who has been pretty happy with his teams growth over the course of the year Losses to Florida and BYU Two top 15 teams Guy celebrated his 37th birthday on Friday Well you know he is the example of of coaching mattering You know this this is a guy whos infused I think an energy into this program He has given new life He has breathed new life into a Malik Renu for example with the start hes had And I think the message from Jay to guys like Trey Donaldson Malik Renu Ernest UDay is look this is your last chance Like this is it Your last run as college players You want to play after this You want to be pros at some level were going to need your best and weve seen that so far this year Offensive rebound off the weeks miss that goes out of play Southern Miss talked about like hey we want to bring fight today We were going to make this a bar brawl in the quote from Jay Ladner Thats what this first two minutes has looked like Sali Altunas in for Miami Theyre back up big Brumfield walks out of there with 10 seconds to shoot for Southern Miss 6 nothing start Late shot clock They get it to the scores Brumfield fall away Thats a tough shot You know and thats the difficulty is theyre all trying to outside of Kurt Lewis all these Southern Miss guys are trying to get closer to the basket but when you cut it off they are all very good in the midrange as well Moments for Miami this year where things have been tough This is the guy three and white that settled them down Trey Donaldson true Washington now attacking down the lane again The Miami fans standing for the first field goal as this goes out of play to Miami Still standing Heres this last bucket on the other end Dylan Brunfield you get a switch Ball screen not played well If youre Alunutis you got to stay with that But thats what these Southern Miss all of these guys all of these players theyre trying to get to the basket Theyre going to try to bully their way there You cut them off though they are okay pulling up for that midrange shot No change of possession there 27 seconds on the shot clock Got to get a quick shot up for Henderson Close to a 5second Bounce it in Follow away Renu And again Miami still without a point as we reach the 17minute mark Dear taken true Washington the other way sets up Henderson He just couldnt hold on Yeah its been sloppy Saturday noon start Miami coming off their biggest win of the year against Miss and look they look a little bit on their heels to start I mean just mishandled and its really been the freshman again coming off of his best game in a Miami uniform Slow start here in the first couple minutes Kurt Lewis got it back A rebound down to Trey Donaldson Five assists per game Top six in the ACC Gets downhill on D creates some contact flips it out wide open Reneu and finally Miami is on the board And thats the big addition to his game that thats now becoming the difficulty with Renu is the ability to step out and hit that face up three and hes got the green light to do it See the most confident version of himself youve seen in his career Yeah I think because Jay Lucas has encouraged him to expand his game You never saw him shoot that three at Indiana cheering And I think a fresh voice which Jay Lucas has been has been a huge help for Renu Benet blocked Miami went zone and it leads to Donaldson in the front court to score their first bucket of the day Donaldson found Renew He was calling for this the whole way and thats why And you love the slow trail from Renu Donaldson does what he does best Gets into that middle of the paint and then that slow trail Nobody matches up with Renew And when hes got his feet set he has shoot about 35 so far this year from three SJ Lucas in such a physical game today you feel like Southern Miss going to take the fight in Good catch and another foul weeks back to the line Who is going to be the guy that would stare to the face of physicality The answer Malik Renew Well if if Cam Boozer wasnt having the year hes having the player of the year right now in the ACC is Malik Renu in the paint and from three He has been money so far this year They got a ton of new guys but you watch Miami at the end of last season certainly after Jim Larenega stepped down they would quit on games They were the harder playing team the other night and their their physicality sort of helps them in that where they are taking the fight to 15 feet and in And then one of the things Jay got the other night is he started putting Shelton Henderson a lot more in ball screens Something that Henderson did a lot in high school but hadnt done yet here So you allow Henderson to play more with the ball and then they got stuff from their bench They got perimeter shooting team Malovich Dovro They came in they gave them four threes off of their bench So you got some shooting that they hadnt really gotten all year They left a very angry Chris beard in Oxford on Tuesday night Malovich is in the game right now Couldnt hit that time Good threepoint shooter as you said 42 Weeks in the front court right the other way and he won a race for Southern Miss Long rebound leading to that run out and Southern Miss showing you I mean they are attacking in transition They want to play fast and they are really good finishing in the open floor Jay Loud said you know we get downhill Teams know were going to get downhill They havent stopped yet Henderson one thing to watch him on TV whole other thing to watch him physically right there cheering Hes more impressive physically man Miami in a in a two3 zone and they just carve up the middle But he is much more Shelton Henderson is much more impressive physically in person I mean hes built like a football linebacker 66 240 Thats not what freshman used to look like back when I played I mean that is ridiculous snorts But you know look he he you have to play him as a screaming driver Hes only taken nine three attempts all year And his free throw shooting has been abysmal Hes only shooting 47 from the foul line And I was asking Jay Lewis the other day I or Jay Lucas the other day I said What was he like as a foul shooter in high school And he said No its always been a problem So thats where if youre a driver and youre a physical player in a paint like he is thats the one problem area the area of concern that hes going to have to continue to work because teams are just going to put him to the line Meanwhile Southern Miss has gone to the line now six times Weeks has taken all six of those free throws and hes got them up 138 on the back of six early points playing Henderson as a driver here Little space gets in Walled off Kick to the corner Drew Washington now Threepoint shooter at 44 Best of his career by far Back to Donaldson Late shot clock Got to go Donaldson they forced the late shot clock Altunas with the rebound Kick it out Henderson gets inside to the corner Malowitz Thats what he does You got to be able to rebound the basketball Defensive rebound if youre Southern Miss Good first shot defense They are gapped up You can live with a midrange shot but you give a second shot and you find the threepoint shooter after the rotation Thats what Miamis bench does They knock down threes Malowitz 37 in Europe last year out of Slovakia suburbs of Bratislava Brumfield against his own Got to find somebody Its weeks Hes just gotten downhill BTB stops and gets his own miss Boy you see Weeks puts his head down just gets inside against Donaldson He jumped it out Thats the hands for Shelton Henderson Uhoh Shelton Henderson right to Washington And Miamis tied it And thats where those turnovers you cant leave your feet if youre Wheats in the middle of the paint Nice defensive play Thats a few times now weve seen Miami be able to get out on those live ball turnovers and convert back in weeks He lost it Henderson took it He finds out Tutas two on four Washington can pull up and shoot it but backs it up to go five on five for Henderson who draws a blocking foul on Isaac Tiveres Again Shelton Henderson is used to having a ball in his hands And a good find there after the offensive board And and like you said Teim Omalovich gave them two threes the other night in that game against Miss Dove not playing today but those two guys off of their bench Give a different look You You have to guard those guys Theres a different gravity to Malovich and Dove than these other guys have See the Southern Miss changes Faloo Diagnetic player on Southern Miss into the game Seven in black Jay Ladder felt like he was the kind of guy in this game that could matter Its the Southern Miss team that you know Miami is without three guys Marcus Allen Noom Dumprat and Dante Allen on their bench Theyre going to go like seven maybe eight deep Southern Miss is going to go 12 13 14 deep Yeah And look theres a big difference in terms of what youre bringing off your bench at Southern Miss Uh but all the fact of the matter is Miami is playing shorthanded and that thats been part of for Jay Lucas We got to get healthy because Dante Allens had a great start to the year The freshman Marcus Allen the transfer from Missouri has had a really good start to the year They need those guys you know in their lineup They were taking a look at something with Tiver Here we go Renu in the game as well once again for Miami Henderson gets it in and renews back in the game and hes got it and one really good find under out of bounds You can see emphasis for Jay Lucas under out of bounds as we are going to our guy Screen to screener He ends up he screens and then kind of comes down the middle of that paint Good find throwing it high And one of the things Renew really does well especially if he can go over his right shoulder is keeps the ball high One of those guys listed at 69 You see him in person He looks bigger and longer than that Miami leads 1613 first lead of the day Keonte tremble to the wing three in the air And that is good for Kurt Lewis 39 shooter former Jo player of the year at East Tennessee State Its hard to believe he already has two threes in this game I mean he is a catch and shoot sniper Hes the only one on Southern Misss team who can shoot threes So whether youre in a manto man or a zone you have got to find where Kurt Lewis is and defend him 33 of his 37 shots coming in are threes Thats what he does Hes wide open for a shooter of that level Southern Miss is almost last in the country in the number of threes that they take Thats the only guy who takes threes And there he is again He thought about it Now he drives and kicks it out for Tiveres Second leading scoreer in the Sunb Belt Isaac Thats a rebound for Ernest Ud Jr Donaldson watched by Diagnosed him Got inside Donaldson two shots Its been an adjustment to run a team His shot selection even so far this year can get weird at times He needs to run their team and be responsible for their team And I think sometimes thats understanding that your shots carry massive weight And so if hes on the attack which got him to the foul line here on this possession when hes on the attack playing inside out taking open threes and then taking responsibility for getting some of these other guys off thats when hes at his best What did you think on of him on Tuesday at Miss I thought he was I thought he was really good Uh and again he deferred to Shelton Henderson in the second half of that game when Henderson became the best player on the floor Anderson in the middle of it there I think they dinged him for foul They did Hes had his hands in everything early That kind of a grab and his foot got caught up a little bit Southern Miss started this game up eight to nothing Miami came back and tied it They have a onepoint lead their second lead of the early afternoon from Coral Gables Five and three Southern Miss Theyve won four in a row Diagnosis and now true Washington Miami on the break Donaldson couldnt hit that time Another fight in there Thats a big rebound from Tegra Eay Big time rebound And again Miami having a little trouble finishing on the break Good job going vertical on Donaldsons attack Quick three Curt Lewis hit two of them before that shot Rebound out a true Washington Well you made him take a deeper one that time Donaldson three We got a foul on the box out Uday getting or attempting to get around Tigra Well Miami has been steady diet of zone on the other end defensively and Southern Miss is used to that You know Radford zoned them the entire second half in their last game Hes talking to Wayne Casease Jay Ladners associate head coach He was saying that they they see about 70 zone this year And to your point you know the point youve made just you know the inability to consistently shoot it and not enough of those guys who can shoot it Its really been the defensive choice Both these teams are in the upper half of the country in terms of twopoint attempts taken in the universe of 2025 where everybodys taking threes Washington three is online but long Malovitz tapped it twice Thats a guard rebound Strong one from Isaac Tiveres the other way Tiveres couldnt finish Benet threw in back to Miami You know outside of a couple possessions weve seen Southern Miss the reason theyre only down one is their ability to rebound And they have been a good rebounding team on the year Theyre plus nine in terms of rebounding margin coming in A lot of it has having to do with their athleticism their physicality but they have held their own so far in this game Tough post catch for Renu Sets up bullies in Malik Renu He came up short and thats what happens when you make him play over his left shoulder You have got to make him play with his right hand Driving offense of Southern Miss Good kick Toiver got a fly by It was rejected by Malavis Thats the Miami length Thats a little different than what Southern Miss has seen so far this year Shot clock down under 10 Kate Tramble dancing with Malowitz Tough spot Gets it away Two seconds to get it up Thats a spin and a score for Kurt Lewis It was a heck of a cut It was an unselfish cut to bail his teammate out and a nice job keeping that pivot foot Nice soft touch off the glass Boy Kurt Lewis comes out Hes screaming at Malovitz as he got the ball on the wing here got a foul right in front of Jay Ladner You know this guy recruited a ton of guys from junior college He has six Jo transfers and he said it these are guys that play with an edge Heres that cut and this is what I call an unselfish cut When you see a teammate whos in trouble rather than just watching him stay in trouble nice cut from the opposite side and you get a basket out of it Donaldson saved that from going out of bounds Seven seconds Jump it up and again short Ty Weeks Six rebounds a game for the guard for Southern Miss with the rebound Tiveres He bounced that through the legs I think of Malovitz but its taken by Donaldson Easiest bucket A Miami night was on the table and he missed the dunk Other way Wow Didnt miss that dunk Di Benet How about that turnaround I mean Trey Donaldson overestimating the ability there on the easy wide open dunk And what conversion by Southern Miss to get an alleyoop on the other end Rud going to the line This kind of typifies what this first half has been A lazy Sunday afternoon Noon start Miami sluggish And then how about this conversion Playing behind the defense you get a lob on the other end Its a microcosm of how this first half has gone Renu knocks down the first Folks these are next weeks ACC Network featured mens matchup NC State and Liberty on Wednesday night Kayen Anthony and Syracuse against St Joes on Thursday Both games available on the ESPN app Two for two Malik Renu 78 shooter And Miami back within one as Shelton Henderson checks back in Part of Tuesday night was what happened when Renew went out with after he twisted an ankle Miami down by one Going to play without him here at least for a few minutes Yeah And they shift into a manto man Theyve been consistent zone for the bulk of this first half so far They go back into man Try to change things up Change the tenor of this game Tiveres try to turn on Henderson Benet shot fake Spins on Elutas I think he traveled Yep You surprised that Southern Miss was able to drive as well as they did against the Miami zone No Again they have seen a lot of zone and these guys are really good man Like that initial thrust you stop them they are coming back again and theyre physically built Washington back door Henderson end up tied up with everybody Thats off a leg a Southern Miss leg Itll stay with Miami to take us to a timeout Southern Miss jumped out eight nothing in this game with eight to go in the first music half Theyre up one in Miami I think Weeks is not only you know a Jo guy but hes from Brooklyn And as JayZ used to tell us Brooklyn they go hard I mean these guys right Isaac Diver from the Dominican Republic No argument here They go hard man Theyre not afraid Well Jay Ladder put it this way Its D1 catered you know dinners after games versus JO for guys that you know had to get box lunches for the cafeteria to eat after a game and they play like it Forced to 5 second Isaac another Jo guy scores it Theyre up three on the road in Miami And if youre going to be in this manto man youve got to be able to guard your yard Again this game is going to be won 15 ft and in And it starts with your ability to guard your matchup Benet against Henderson He guards Henderson forces another Miami turnover And theyre a physical defensive team And that was one of the things Jay Lucas was telling us in his scout Theyre going to be tough on the ball Theyre very handsy Like theyre going to get in there and and be physical with the ball handler And theyre just kind of manhandling the freshman into the turnover And back in the zone into Weeks they made this pass against the zone Set the corner Izzy Hart off the bench Couldnt hit Weeks in there Hes fouled from behind by Henderson I mean thats Tyick Weeks at 6 foot7 whos been in that area all day Had 37 points in a game earlier this year a few games ago had 37 points on 23 shots I mean incredible efficiency conversion Hes got a muscle game Like hes relentless you know and you know I was joking about the Brooklyn piece but also partly not joking Yeah Like there there is a grime to his game and he is constantly attacking the basket and on the offensive glass Well and it embodies what this whole team is like Again Hart right in there off the inbound Southern Miss leaves 2419 and Miami needs a timeout Fivepoint game You want to be in Theres no life to their defense Theres no talk in their defense And frankly theyre being out toughed Two programs that are built on twopoint shots and really owning the paint as he got a foul down low Off ball I think on Rumfield Two programs built on that word You just use toughness and youre right Southern Miss has won that battle early and theyre getting clean looks you know especially against the zone like that last basket Just a cut from the opposite side into the middle of the paint wide open So one and one for Ernest Uday Jr Free throws have been a Miami issue 66 as a team U at 55 Yeah that foul line has been a real fly in the ointment for Miami You know they missed 10 free throws in that loss to BYU They ended up losing the game by 10 One for two 2420 Southern Miss Izzy Hart D2 transfer from Central Oklahoma to Dylan Brumfield Kid from Hattisburg Hart This is a deep one Rebound hit the ground Good box out by Malovitz Weeks is not giving up on the offensive board Donaldson thought about a step back Finds Drew Washington Hasnt been involved a lot offensively Just got involved Yeah quiet start for him I like him though What a great pickup in a portal Transfer from New Mexico Jack of all trades Kind of a glue guy really good defensively and much improved on the offensive end Hes been talking low for Bonet Hes stuffed it over Malovitz Look at Southern Miss Donaldson yet to hit a field goal Off to Washington He drives he stops and he scores Thats true Washington He asked Jay Lucas Whos the guy down for a fight the most in a physical game Thats his answer Thats a takeaway Henderson hes got a couple of steals early gets downhill finds a corner Its Malovitz Thats another guard rebound Isaac in there You know its the right basketball play Kicking to the threepoint shooter In this game though youd love to see Henderson go for a rim collision you know test the basket especially because Miamis got two field goals in the last seven minutes as Southern Miss turns it over You know turnovers have been really the only issue for Southern Miss You know a couple live ball turnovers an air male pass there Its really been the only issue Southern Miss has had 2624 Miami two for their last 10 Washington backtoback buckets gets inside That was another tough shot Thatll go Southern Misss way I mean how does Miami score Well part of the issue is you know normally when youre guarding somebody youre guarding the ball You give them an arms distance What Southern Miss is doing in this first half theyre giving about an arm and a half Theyre they are daring these Miami perimeter players to shoot it and then theyre not giving up second chances second opportunities Bedet nice pass in the zone and Weeks finishes They got the guys to finish over the length in the middle of that zone for Miami has been really soft like marshmallow soft and Southern Miss is just playing through the middle Malovitz is the best threepoint shooter on the floor right now Again lot of standing Donaldson downhill Ripped a pass to the wing Washington finds Renu 4 seconds Malik Renu jumped it out Malivits got to get it up They missed another U offensive rebound leaves it off And thats a third buck in the last three minutes for True Washington Miamiys conversion off of second chances has been really good You know again the Southern Miss first shot defense has done its job Got that pass in there to Weeks He jumps to his left That was halfway down Benet in there out to Tiveres He couldnt hit Thats a rare miss from the paint Thats going Miamiys way Well step aside twopoint game the first half defensively theyve guarded they have and again I think its its scouting its look we dont have were not going to guard these guys if theyre going to make 10 threes well tip our hat were going to give them an arm and a half well guard our yard and then everybody else is loaded up we are forcing the ball to be kicked out to the perimeter And the other part of it too is for Miami theyre out with three bench guys right now So as Renew falls down I mean its been kind of the story of the day Washington has it The guys that are on the floor right now are the guys who are going to have to figure it out because theyre shorthanded Washingtons given them a burst the last few minutes Danced on Weeks Hes got two men around him He threw it to nobody except for Curt Lewis Its a southern miss run out And thats a great job by Donaldson to get back and it actually slipped off of a Southern Miss player Jay Lander didnt like it Of course has the opportunity to challenge if he would like Decides against it You and I are laughing cuz we just saw the look on his face like nah UNDERSTAND IT RENEW RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE And every once in a while this first half its opened up like that for Miami Two3 zone for Miami for most of this first half Theyve found this pass in a weeks quite a bit Step back on Malovitz Crosscourted to Lewis Hes the threepoint shooter Now Brumfield bounce it down Benet to the corner Tiveres on the spin Slipped one and two Off to Benet It was a beautiful pass It was an easy finish Tell you what Southern Misss execution against a two3 zone has been outstanding in this first half And theyre making the zone work You know these arent quick shots They are working the possession until that middle opens up Donaldson twisting and turning to tie the game On this end if you were coaching by Emmy would you be in zone right now Well clearly Jay Lucas does not have confidence in his mans ability to keep them out of the paint Southern Miss to keep the ball in front But look at this I mean I mean thats Weeks against 610 Altunas and Weeks not just won the match up Annihilated it Quick three other end Washington fouled on the close out by Ty Weeks But I think if youre Jay Lucas the best way to challenge your team is to say were going man and we are putting it on the shoulders I mean thats just really nice basketball Get a baseline drive kick to the middle and then you know just playing through the contact which is what Southern Miss does and again playing through the middle of that two3 zone I think manto man challenges your team Cooper like at this point I think if youre Jay Lucas you go into halftime say were coming out in manto man you have to guard your matchup you have to block out as true Washington knocks down the first ACC womens basketball Sunday afternoon tomorrow double header number 11 North Carolina against Boston University at noon Duke and Virginia Tech start conference play tomorrow at Castle Coliseum in Blackburg Both also available on the ESPN app Two down for True Washington Shelton Henderson checks back in for Teeo Malovitz Two out of three Thats an offensive rebound Job by Altas to reset it Renu on the rim forever Southern Miss wanted a goalend Thats out of bounds off of Southern Miss Its one of the those where Nice job by Renew flashing to the ball but hes got to finish that man I mean again just a little bit soft in every facet of the game in this first half for Miami Lets see what happens now Renu over his left shoulder Not even close And then Weeks just lost it out of bounds as he tried to start a Southern Miss break But its the reality of you know when you measure up whos been you know soft and whos been the the tougher team in this game the answer has been unequivocally Southern Miss Of course a good point for Miami is as bad as its been Its 3232 with 115 to go in the first half Yeah at 3232 I think youre looking at habits Like if youre Miami and youre hoping to be a tournament team compete in the ACC the the way that this first half has gone theres a lot of holes that have been exposed by Southern Miss a team thats five and three on the year Foul offensive against Miami on the far side And again Renu is open for a three wiped off the board And by the way Southern Miss is a well coached team I mean Jay Ladners been doing this a long time and hes been been doing it Hattisburg native doing it a long time now at Southern Miss and has always done more with less Hes an outstanding coach guy who coached at Junior College has a roster full of them Theyve taken it to Miami early in this game Weeks has broken down the zone a lot Spin left and right out for Brunfield He thought about a three He got inside Four to shoot Passed it down And how many late shot clock buckets do they have from that spot Its like a football team that runs the wishbone the triple option where theyre just going to run it run it down your throat until they get it to the middle and they get it closer to the basket Timeout Southern Mitch for Miami I I think one of these guys theyre very inward A lot of quiet Nobodys talking to one another Nobodys got any sort of emotional leadership showing This has to come from a player This is not about the coach lighting a fire I think no shot clock And even this for Southern Miss Miami just look uncomfortable in these spots Donaldson three around him Escape to Malovitz Bounced to the corner Washington Donaldson got a fly by sets an open three Theres another miss Three seconds Foul on the rebounding action and its against the Golden Eagles Dylan Brunfield That was a second show They showed it on the first possession Southern Miss the 131 That was the second time weve seen it out of a timeout Good job by Jay Ladner prepping for something that Lucas may have drawn up The one problem with the 131 it is a very hard zone to music rebound out of So nice job getting to the offensive glass and Renu trying to tie this thing going into halftime By the way thats a fourth Southern Miss player at two fouls As we go to the second half Malik Renu 78 shooter front end of a one and one Thats another Miami miss from the line and the clock never moved We got something behind the play as well Weeks Weeks on a foul I think he extended his arm as he was coming down court I think they want to look at it too This was behind the play Was it a rebound battle No No It was as he was dribbling it up the court He just kind of extended that arm and I think hit True Washington in the face Its a big foul though Yeah its his third foul I mean thats a big play and I dont know if we necessarily needed to go to the monitor on this but its absolutely music an offensive foul I mean that is the third you just said it Its the third foul on Southern Misss leading score Hes been the guy when Miamis gone zone theyve just put the ball in his hands and hes made their offense happen They just looked at it Theyre going to say no flagrant foul I dont think that was excessive or unnecessary in any capacity But its his third foul Yeah its a big foul Its kind of how he plays though man My man there is no back down Brooklyn they go hard Its been really fun to watch him like bear his teeth Yeah In this first half Hows your JayZ knowledge Hows your JayZ game Cooper I wouldnt I wouldnt say its like my number one thing but you know you say Brooklyn we go hard I can handle that They like a little numb encore going on pregame Yeah there you go Its JayZ 101 is where youre youre living Hey 26 seconds for Miami Theyre down Henderson in Reno Back to Henderson He got fouled What a play Thats Brumfield And thats Brumfields third So Southern Miss was three seconds away from going to halftime with both those guys with two fouls Now they have three What a great design And when Renu could play with his left hand look at the touch And again I mean you get the foul but you got to finish that Youre Shelton Henderson trying to tie the game And after all that were tied 910en of a second to go in the first half Southern Miss gets it in Blumfield Wild first half Ladner in year number six is tied on the road in Miami Their zone has worked for a lot of the day against this Miami offense They come out out in it once again Shelton Henderson and Trey Donaldson on the outside Bounced it in That was knocked away I mean that is the carbon copy of the first half Well and they they have shown different zones They havent shown a lot of that 131 They showed it at the end of the half and then right there and just a sloppy pass out of halftime Big block Ernest Uday Jr Uday played just nine minutes in that first half in a physical game This is up for grabs 5050s have been Southern Miss weeks downhill Kick it down Brumfield two in the air and he draws a foul But again you have a floated pass on the under out of bounds towards half court and Kurt Lewis is the only one on the spot Nice little tap from him to Weeks and you get downhill and that is where Southern Miss has lived Be it against manto man or against zone it has been death by downhill Thats one of those man like you how is a team come out a after halftime You have a pass floated to half court Youve got two Miami players around it and the Southern Miss guys able to tap it to a teammate You ask the question is it going to be different First 35 seconds Answers been no Both of them good from Dylan Brumfield Remember hes playing as you said with three fouls for Southern Miss Two of their best guys in foul trouble Shelton Henderson downhill to Malik Renu led the Canes in scoring in the first half Southern Miss knew it He kicks it out Washington now again just not a lot in there Renu three He made two in the first half He misses the first three of the second Thats a Dylan Brumfield rebound Isaac Tiveres the second leading scorer in the Sunb Belt Their second best score behind his teammate Weeks had two in the first half and he turns it over That was the one area and why the game was tied at halftime where Southern Miss struggled They turned the ball over 11 turnovers in that first half So thats now 12 And Miami did an okay job converting but those are possessions where Southern Miss shot 50 in the first half Youre just kind of giving away Henderson downhill Again he left it short Those 5050s inside Miami is just not contested as that goes out of bounds to Ferris Thought that was Southern Miss basketball Sort of the Southern Miss Ben Well see if they challenge Jay Ladner They dont have the iPad guy You know that the the high majors theyve got the iPad guy Jay Ladners got to go ask the player on the bench closest to the play Izzy Harts the iPad guy and its his eyes right now All right Now Miami against the zone still have not scored in this second half on their third possession with Henderson again downhill and he has two shots coming and its hard to tell if that was a zone or not because its theyve been playing a sagging man It wasnt the 131 So again Jay Ladner doing a nice job changing up their defenses and Southern Miss even in their man like they are really sagged off and gapped up and theyre switching one through five 48 free throw shooter Shelton Henderson Easy stroke there I mean this guy Henderson right who had a careerhigh 18 and nine on Tuesday at Miss basket in the first half Its been a struggle for him today I think the matched physicality of Southern Miss has bothered him and it started from the jump You know he had a couple turnovers to start the game Just didnt look into it again There you go I mean theyre scoring 85 a game Theyre top 70 offensive efficiency team in the country They just were not comfortable offensively in the first half Dylan Brumfield down the lane into Henderson Henderson wasnt going to let him go by Its Donaldson the other way Couldnt hit again Southern Miss back in transition I think Benet was standing on the end line Nice job by Southern Miss getting back and forcing a tough shot from Donaldson who has had a rough day offensively One for nine from the field Yeah struggle struggle bus for for Trey Donaldson Officials coming over to the monitor Not sure I assume Jay Ladder challenged it Unless were checking a clock situation There they are Referees Bill Cington Jr Bart Lennox and Trey Stions Yeah they were checking the shot clock because I think it reset on them ISO ball for Renu Washington game with Spark Double figures in the first half Gets downhill Spun away His man fell down He cut through again Couldnt hit Renu tried to get the rebound and he was fouled fighting for it by Isaac How many shots around the basket right at the basket has Miami not been able to finish today I mean theres another one Washington hes got a layup and they just cant finish Third foul on Tivera So thats another key guy Three Southern Miss players with three fouls too Almost 5 seconds for the second time today Same feed to Renu went over and barreled through Its a charge taken by Brumfield who took that charge with three fouls on his name Thats three on Renu Yeah I I dont know if thats the right call there I I I I dont like that call Hes kind of you know Brnes got the angle and Brumfields sliding his feet but I I thats got to be a block Looks like Jay Lucas agrees with you And again its a huge call Its a difference between four fouls on the Southern Miss point guard or three on the best player for Miami Now its Brumfield inside Nice pass to the corner He bounced it out for Weeks behind the back and he was fouled falling down Thats against Donaldson You can see how frustrated Miami is Yeah you can Bounce it in Thats a bucket Cloudy had a quiet first half but scores score other way U its way down Benet thought he blocked it from behind Its a rare block off the back of the rim Benets had a nice day today He really has Hes played hard Yeah no question thats a goalend But hes had a he had a good first half Transferred from Alorn State Averaged nine and seven there le last year Led the swack in rebounding This is Benet with it out of Nice France Weeks had Alutas in his grill and backs it out Hes gotten downhill a lot Weeks on Washington Got by him inside and thats a foul on true Washington Couldnt believe it in his eyes They are the definition Southern Miss when when especially Weeks and Tover have the ball in their hands But a lot of these guys if at first you dont succeed on the drive try try again I mean Miami makes their stand you think you have them and theyre just going to keep coming at you keep coming at you until you have to foul them I mean shoot if at first you cant succeed try try again Is the story of this roster right I mean all these guys that were underrecruited that went to junior college I mean Tyler Weekes was playing at Southwest Missouri Community College last year and hes been maybe the best player on the floor in this game They call him bully weeks Hes been talking I mean we were 9 seconds into into this game on the first possession He is yapping at Washington He just made that free throw He said something to him He steps up and does what hes done all day Score 4038 Southern Miss So Ill ask you now for the first time as Henderson comes down kick to Malivitz and he drills it Thats an allelujah for Miami Well and thats the vulnerability of the 131 especially with how extended Southern Miss is in that 131 That corner is open and thats the one guy for Miami that can knock that perimeter shot down First Miami lead since the 1146 mark of the first half Wow Tiveres got through Bet the offensive rebound He split two faked it up stepped through and traveled Yeah in this zone Look how this 131 is coming up and youve got really three guys above that threepoint line And thats what that 131 is going to give up against Miami And thats what Malovich does I was going to ask you I mean how do you find a way to score against this The drives have been so tough Not for that man Shelton Henderson had a mission Well he traveled before he took that A Miami team that has not been good at the foul line this year Miami for its might just to be fair is 11 for 15 from the line today This guy Henderson who struggled all year long is four for four I apologize to Miami fans That goes out of bounds Well I mean hes shooting 47 from the foul line Dont take it too hard on yourself All right Cooper That was not your fault Trust me And Miami gets possession out of it Donaldson in fast to Altunas 4340 Miami just took its first lead since right around the 12minute mark Quick three and Malovitz couldnt hit Rebound out to Dylan Brumfield One thing tonight Southern Miss has not played down a lot of the day Weeks just off his hand out of bounds and Jay Lavs not happy He wanted that to be a bounce pass and hes right on those back door cuts Its just hard timing Its like a quarterback trying to hit an in route You Its much better and easier with a bounce pass Donaldson feed the post in for Henderson Thats the biggest man in the room And thats the game the muscle game from Shelton Henderson And you love him where he caught it Starts where he catches it and hes able to go middle Couple bumps into his shot Seven nothing Miami run First run of any kind for them today Brumfield breaking down on Malivitz That was kicked by Miami And Jay Lucas talks about it a lot They start from practice early in the year We want to go through chests That move from Hendersons one of the first ones weve seen Bounce it in Benet I mean its a great a great seal by Benet I mean this is too easy Again like weve weve the theme throughout this game has been Southern Miss musling Miami That right there is an illustration of that I mean just inside position and he does his work early before the referee hands the inbounder the ball Benet is already working for that position Good pass and a nice play through contact By the way if youre a Miami fan youre wondering where Malik Renu is right now They have him listed at four fouls in the box score We had a different count at halftime so were working on that as Malovitz gets in Thats a lovely little move from Elitz but it feels like at least if thats true these are the five guys on the floor that are going to have to figure it out Tiver all the way home and Jay Ladner calls timeout after the Southern Miss score Miami took its largest lead Were back to a threepoint game guy whos their anchor on the glass you know doing a great job Hes got two offensive rebounds today So not having him you lose a lot Its a Southern Miss timeout They just scored to make it a threepoint game again And most of the possessions have started with Henderson for Miami against the zone Donaldson three in the air Thats a big one for Miami Its a big one And its a two3 zone You know thats the shot You know theyre going to Southern Miss is willing to give up And Trey Donaldson has not been his best day but thatll thatll get you in a different defense Ty Weeks spun and Washington saves it out to Malovitz 5050 starting to go the Kanes way now Washington danced by and thats taken Brumfield the other way against Washington He scores it Hes had a really good day outside of the foul trouble Dylan Brumfield I I really like him 65 point guard doesnt turn it over Really good player Henderson head of steam Bodied it down Passed away Hey it was knocked back up to Malovitz Two threes in a row for Miami Malovitz is big for them on a team that doesnt shoot threes He hit two in that Old Miss game the other night off of their bench Its that one dimension he really gives them They had made four all night until those two possessions Isaac downhill again Put it up Thats a big rebound for U starts the break Shelton Henderson steamroll two more Thats the one thing you know Uday fights for that defensive board in traffic and because Southern Miss is crashing its affecting their defensive balance Nice job getting out and finishing on the break by Miami Their largest lead nine Wow taken Donaldson threeon ONE AHEAD MALIVITZ fouled hard by Benet Benets getting a little loose here and Jay Landers not happy about it You know Benet on that elbow that pinch post Hes catching having to sort of initiate offense and just really soft with it there And then again their defensive balance really in this second half getting back keeping Miami out of transition has not been good Theyre going to look at this foul So well take a timeout Theyre going to take a look to see if this rises to a flagrant level Either way itll be free throws Miami with its largest lead of the afternoon And he catches it He actually catches the block He catches his head with his elbow which is I guess why we went to look at it These are the reviews that we have to take out of the game of mens college basketball That is everybody who has played this game knows that that was a basketball play And fortunately we were able to wrap the review around the TV timeout so we dont Anyway I like it Youre good on the soap box there Well and I think too you know you read it contact with an opponent thats not a legitimate attempt to play the ball as Hart misses it Long rebound Donaldson ran through fouled Isaac It you know no question Its been that kind of game too When you talk about physicality and intensity there have been a lot of plays like that Well look again in the history of the game one of the rules of thumb for a lot of coaches is no layups And theres a way to exercise that that rule that strategic game plan without you know obviously being overaggressive with it And thats what Benet did He was not going to give up a layup but he went after the basketball See the turnovers too in this second half This was completely flipped in the first half Southern Miss down by its largest margin of the day 11point game with 12 to go Valu diagnatively speaking for Southern Miss is in the game right here Tiveres got to go Late shot clock got around Malowitz and stepped on the baseline Miamis done a nice job in their mantoman especially on those baseline drives How many times in the first half it was usually in the zone but even in the man where you get a baseline drive a cut middle and thats where that basket was coming from off of the the baseline pass for seven turnovers Now Henderson went up with it Thats great hands to Henderson saved it try to find his point guard and does Trey Donaldson just made a three Miami is hitting two in the SECOND HALF FLOATED UP O DAY Nice job Rim running hard And he actually had his shirt pulled They were grabbing his shirt as he was rolling Heart open as Southern Miss does not have a second half three Washington good threepoint shooter got inside couldnt hit off the contact And that rebound taken by Fu Diagn for the ball Hes wide open A foul on Malivitz as he fought Benet Heres this rim run And look at this Get a shirt pulled as hes rolling But a nice job hitting that that screen that that pocket of the defender back pocket of the defender then rolling right to the front of the rim And thats what he does you know a guy that Ernest U has played a lot of basketball you know and I I think he is embracing now what hes good at And he didnt do that as a young player Like he was trying to be something he wasnt good at Rebounding rim running physicality around the basket Its who hes been for Jay Lucas so far this year AJ Zuma misses 5946 10 and a half to go U goes out Altunas comes in Donaldson gets downhill again Stop Pop Score Trey Donaldson Two buckets in this second half Now he gave his defender the two short motion after that Trey Donaldsons telling you youre too too short laughter I was going to say how many times in his life has he given that Sometime sometimes we chunk the shark on some of these after made bucket celebrations Oh hell take it 11 nothing run Another foul Low on Miami get Isaac back to the line Well with 63 se 62 you got you have like one advant one opportunity in the world Fair enough Another free throw miss A foul on the rebound again Oh lane violation So it was a lane violation against Altunas Me they signaled 11 I think Yeah it was on 10 True Washington and Southern Miss cant cash in They have missed six free throws in the game Malovitz open Got another just a pick and pop using Malovitz as a screener and confusion by Southern Miss You got to switch that Diver slipped it off low and Isuma got it over the cliff My bad Cooper The threepoint shooting from Malovich has really been a differencemaker in this second half Its amazing You know Miami cant shoot make a three in that first half and now all of a sudden they make a few game changes completely WHAT A SPIN WHAT A FIND Alas from Donaldson And really this run for Miami has started with their defense their mantoman defense getting out of the zone going man Theyve taken up the the challenge and these you know stringing some stops together As Zuma into Aluta step by him Hart jumps it out tramples open He dropped it That meant that this was contested He still hit it Timeout Southern Miss 15point game with a 59 to go Miami on a 165 run after this And thats where when hes at his best Trey Donaldson thats where hes living Knew he had the matchup Really beautiful spin in the paint And then a good job by Al Tutas playing off Folks tomorrow night Huddle Crew going to have Miami needs a Texas Tech win in that one Thats halftime in the Big 12 championship game 137 Texas Tech Thats good Miami news in the last few minutes on both basketball and football Got a foul against a Zumba off the ball 6651 846 to go Henderson had it knocked Southern Miss gets the turnover Izzy Hart split two Found a way through but not in the end Down it to Varis Blocked away by Alutas And here comes Miami Henderson to the corner Donaldson thought of a three Got inside Jump it out Mallet Its open Almost in his fifth three Big rebound Henderson Washington on the refeed And a reset with Donaldson with under eight and a half to go Donaldson against Isuma danced them scored So clean Really clean Miami looks so much more comfortable offensively in this second half You know even the early break there the secondary break you get a good shot offensive rebound and here they are back in the zone And the zone Im telling you has not been the answer today I Im Im a little bit curious why after how good your man has been it changed his game You go back into a two3 zone Off the Diagn Washington three Thats out of bounds off of Miami 15point lead for the Cades for the first time 100 of donations go directly to cancer research V Foundation is as run a well as wellrun a nonprofit as there is nationally And in a world where you can trust less these days the work that these doctors are doing you can have such faith and believe in believe in Vary is blocked by Ernest Ud Excited for the Jimmy V classic next week No question at the Garden Always are Seller misses a man down behind the play as Washington dives in finds Henderson Big second half for Miami You just saw the numbers shooting 59 from the field 50 from three They have not been late shot clock a lot Here they are with 5 seconds in Donaldson needs help 3 seconds Malovitz has hit four threes at the buzzer They get ripped Saw that look on Jay Lucass face a lot in the first half A lot less over the last five minutes Yeah his team is kind of settled in here and back in the manto man I you know I think that the defense you know we were wondering what they would come out here in this second half Its been a steady diet of mantoman And even when they went to one possession a zone Southern Miss was able to get a bucket Their defense has been much more engaged in this second half Saw 12 come in for Southern Miss Felipe Patino Hes one of their best threepoint shooters This is their best threepoint shooting lineup for a team It doesnt shoot it great from beyond the arc Hart can make it Hes got a man in his grill He steps back and finds Diagn 8 seconds Malovitz defending Hart in Kick it out Off the skip Find Patino First shot of the game The rebound to true Washington 34 second half points for Miami Washington could hit right down for Ernest Uday You know this separation has been created with Malik Renu on the bench They have they have played well without him Their bench has come in and given them production today and theyre playing you know down both of the Allens Theyre playing without Nom Dolvat I mean Renu whos coming into the game literally as we speak is coming in for the first time in 13 and 12 minutes Well they built this lead to that point You know I think the game was tied or they you know one possession game and they have built this lead with him on the bench Diagn Thats another Southern Miss free throw miss Under six to go This was you know a tie game for most of this game And Miamis open up a 17point lead Donaldson floated in Renu off the bench Passed it down to U Just had a dunk and has two shots coming on another dunk attempt Hes been good too Hes been really active and thats you know thats his game Carve position work around around the rim You know John Wooden used to have a an expression dont let what you cant do impact what you can do And I think thats the difference between Ernest Uday as a senior versus who he was at his two stops prior to Miami And you look at him physically its 611 266 The bigs that hes going to have to go up against in the ACC size especially if a team like Duke is almost got his own miss You look at those guys I mean he matches up physically with with anybody in this conference No question No question 611 you know almost 270 lbs Really good athlete Those are welldeserved high fives Now Malik Renu and one you know he is coming back to his left hand He he you know Jay Lucas a lot of times will post him on the right block so that when he goes middle he can go to that jump hook there He starts on the left block because thats where the under out of bounds started They love going to him on under out of bounds but he is coming back to that left hand Youve got to jump on that make him stay middle there and finish right 16 points for Malik Renu Thats another guy too Talk about matching up physically and teams in the ACC are going to have to be thinking about which hand hes using and all this But you look at the size and the length of Miami Those two guys the four and five positions as physical as long as strong as any team in the conference It it wasnt as physical to start this game and thats where you know thats where size how does it manifest like it its nice to have 611 69 on your front line but how physical can it be and we have seen moments this year where it has been but in this first half of this game against a a smaller team they got punched in the mouth Tigra Yeay barely played in that first half at the line You think this is the kind of game we could look back on and say its probably good that Miami you know long term played in this kind of game on this day Absolutely And look I say this this is not taking anything away from Southern Miss but when a team like Miami comes off of their best win of the year on the road at Old Miss the game time was at noon and youre playing a team no matter how much a coach no no matter how much Jaylucas says look this team is good were playing theyre physical You could say it till youre blue in the face the psychology of a player is such that they will show up for a game like today not ready to play And I thought a lot of the way they started was the psychology of an athlete doing it without three guys that are key contributors on their bench Washington scores Miami won seven games all of last year They look on their way to winning their eighth here on December 6th And its the kind of game its a completely different roster and coach and all these things Its the kind of game that they probably would not have won last year Thats a take New man true Washington gave them some big minutes to start the second half and hes the guy that makes it a 22point game Tramble that was maybe above the cylinder They do count it for Tegra Eay who got out of dodge quick after that But a game that was so tight for most of the time that weve actually played the game is now 20 for Miami True Washington Three seconds Donaldson the rebound down to Tegra Eay again for Southern Miss Diagn who thought it was maybe a shot that goes out of play Take us to our final timeout 7757 Miami finding a way today And that shooting production would be big for them You can feel it at points in this game Up top it was Renu trying the dunk attempt and Zuma got it Eay that is got in there You can see at the points that you know there probably were minutes where Jayl Lucas would have gone to do rat or Marcus Allen or Dante Allen to change the game He just didnt have those guys available today and they give him like a boost of energy you know like Allen freshman comes in plays hard gives him a boost Marcus Allen same deal Renu how many and ones today for him Well hes going to hit his numbers here today And there he is on that left block But he is again he wants that left hand Hes tough though man cuz hes got a really good touch good feel good footwork and hes big 80 57 Miami Three minutes to go If youre just joining us th this was tight for a lot of the day Southern Miss had a lead for most of the first half led into the second half Theres an air ball from Coward Thatll go Miamis way 252 to go But Miami in this second half has shot it at 58 Theyve made four threes Thats been all the difference for Jay Lucas Renu fouled Couldnt hit that time Hes got shots coming And you look at the schedule you know Miami comes in at 72 Theyre going to be 82 in 2 minutes and 42 seconds Lightens up for these next few games And youre at home They have a chance here to be sitting there at 11 and two before they head into New Years against Pittsburgh You know I think theres a group right now in the ACC of Miami Clemson you know that sort of grouping there that you know like could thats where the ACC in the NCA tournament Wake could they climb into that group Virginia could they climb into that group NC State I think would be in there Thats where the narrative on the ACC in the NCA tournament will develop and they got to close out the nonconference Well started with some key things in the ACC SEC challenge Syracuse for example scored that big win over Tennessee on Tuesday night Miami beats Miss in Oxford Yeah Syracuse another good one Notre Dame you know a big win in overtime last night over TCU Like thats where you say okay is the ACC better I dont think theres any doubt about that And I think its the depth in this league becomes established with that handful of teams that were talking about I mean you think about the next few days Louisville Indiana Florida State Houston thats today Tomorrow SMU Texas AM 5 Eastern on ESPN 2 Georgetown and North Carolina 5 Eastern on ESPN And then we were talking Jimmy V Classic earlier Thats Clemson BYU Huge chance for the lead Huge Thatll be Tuesday night 630 and then avoiding the missteps This was a a landmine waiting to happen today for Miami and they have found a way and in the end were going to sit here look at the score and say they found a way convincingly Trey Donaldsons had a nice second half 10 points 10 assists down to Altunas and hell add another assist Five in double figures for Miami Ernest Uday Jr just got his ninth rebound Donaldson Oh blocked big time U blocked again Southern Miss playing hard They have from every instant today A noon game I think some of these officials might have flights Couple fouls were letting go Your boys got one too So Im okay with it as laughter no one here has that experience Donaldson scores it and Miami is going to get you out of dodge laughter 8659 Dalon Brandon whistle down low Miami is going to get to 8 and2 for the first time since the 2022 2023 season the Final Four season Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller theyre going to join Duke at 9 and0 and SMU whos 8 and one quietly as the first in the ACC to eight wins for a completely different Miami team Yeah how about that I mean you could say well thats the landscape but its not that brutal at a lot of spots And you know the roster that Jay Lucas put together for this to be a bonafide tournament level type team has done a great job and I think it informs whats happened today right I mean this is a group thats playing together and in this kind of physical test for one of the first times and so it took some time to know who they were in that foxhole and then they found the answer in the second half Patino of the shot clock Offensive rebound Brandon and one A big fan of your use of foxhole there Cooper Nicely done by you Im looking at you laughter Catering to your audience your partner West Point alum They just put a bald eagle on the scoreboard Literally as you said there you go There you go They know youre here Its been now uh quite some time since we fought wars in foxholes but I I wont be Mr Ashley laughter on you I feel like you just were Miami try to finish off their eighth win of the season Be their third in a row Donaldson on a string Oh floated up O day put his face on the rim Literally he missed all those layups and dunks in the first half and theyve only made their layups and dunks in the second Donaldson got in there put it in the air Final 45 seconds Jordan Key red shirt freshman off the bench Got the steel Georgia transfer Key it blocked away 227 seconds to go Heres a dunk Starts with Donaldsons penetration Nice little cross and then Oh he almost did or maybe did hit his his head I think the ball maybe as it came through struck him Is that a a problem Is that a problem you had in your playing career Your ball struck my head as I elevated Ke lost it Southern missed the other way Run out for Coward One last bucket to finish the day 7 seconds for Keith It wasnt pretty but that scoreboards pretty Miami wins its eighth game Jay Lucas 8864 over Southern Miss
