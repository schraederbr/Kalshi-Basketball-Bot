State can overcome that with some shooting and some quickness Georgia Tech in white Mississippi State in black The Yellow Jackets win the opening tip Were underway here in Atlanta Yellow Jackets setting up in the front court against one of the stingiest defenses over the last few years Chris Jans and that Mississippi State squad I like that entry pass inside trying to bang away inside of the Bulldogs interior You see the starting five for Mississippi State Jaden EPS is a guy thats going to be called upon to take some pressure off of Josh Hubard Need somebody else to be an offensive weapon for this Mississippi State squad which has started off a little bit slow out of the gate You see the three and four record They have challenged themselves quite a bit in the nonconference This will be a great test as well off a curl That is Kaci Reeves Kesi Reeves one of the top shooters on this Georgia Tech squad Well thats what they got to do They got to share that basketball Just six turnovers and 20 assists in the last ball game And the offense is humming good Theyre really making each other better by sharing the basketball trying to move that ball from one side of the floor to the other You have to try to count how many times they can get from one side to the other Just a defender lost that time a little shimmy like he was going to go along the baseline Came back over the top Is free to fire Reeves whos been banged up a little bit this year He is healthy Shooting 35 from downtown Hubard defers Hubard again one of the top scorers in the country number one scorer in the SEC This is McGee and McGee coughs it up and almost a turnover Itll be Mississippi State basketball with seven on the shot clock Well look one of the things we got a chance to watch this morning at the Georgia Tech shooter out really trying to keep Mississippi State on one side of the floor They dont want them to try to get that ball from you know two times from right to left and back left to right They understand that thats where their defense really struggles to recover Ball comes into McGee racing in the cheering front court Under five to shoot McGee rise and fire Rims out tapped around and hauled in by Reeves and the Yellow Jackets Fleming has really stepped up his play of late Back to Reeves on the return And two for two from downtown is Kasi Reeds Yeah I like that one by Fleming You mentioned he was in the all tournament team when they were down in it down there in uh Florida So nice to see him sharing that basketball recognizing the hot shooter early on Or hes got behind that off with two quick threes Walker musling his way inside takes it in the trees Rejected That is a tough place to get a spot off against this incredible front court for Tech in particularly Moila the talented freshman whos been a shot blocking machine Yeah I really like this kid I wish I had those muscles when I was a freshman 40 years ago playing for coach Dean Smith but he just gets up quick off the floor And I know he got whistled for the goalending on that one but you want your young big to be aggressive to go after anything inside Reeves misses but there for the following and and one is Dongo The other part of that dynamic duo in the front court Bay Dongo with an and one Yeah cleaning up the offensive glass getting those second chance opportunities really one of these teams particularly great shooters in the early part of this season but when you got bigs that are hungry to get on that offensive glass uh getting those second chance points those points in the paint will go a long way for coach squad Dongo who had such an impressive year last year for Georgia Tech All ACC third team performer drills the free throw to make it a threepoint play to make it a sevenpoint lead for the Yellow Jackets Yeah that was a pretty good looking stroke there for the 61 shooter right Sometimes its just confidence You got to have that confidence you uh basketball players out there when you step to that line well remember that you put in that work in practice and on your driveway or in the park step to that line and shoot shoot it with a confidence stroke Ev trying to show some confidence there Too strong Offensive rebound Rims out A point blank shot for Brandon Walker Just could not get it to go Well some of that is intimidation down there with Ca Dongo as well you realize hey I got to try to get this thing up quick but uh before those shot blockers can come over and get it And you rush it just a hair Steal quick hands right there by Shawn Jones Jones out of Houston Texas the senior Hubard fires up his first shot It rims off Another offensive rebound and a great job knifing in Thats Jamaran Davis Fleming a very talented 610 freshman Yeah true freshman and and hes not afraid to go down there and mix it up with the two bigs from the Jello Jackets Look at him run the floor as well Yeah Bulldogs now in transition Quick three on the way straight away from downtown Its Jaden EPS on the triple Thatll put a smile on Coach Chans face right You get a offensive rebound for a bucket You get yourself a quick three in transition Mustaf and Hubard were banging bodies there Georgia Tech working to the round on the perimeter now driving Tough shot by Fleming on a fade and fire Hubard comes in for the board Huard feeling it He check three Missed it Tapped around Another offensive rebound for State And a beautiful foul for Brandon Walker Well stealing a page out of Georgia textbooks Uh getting on that glass They got backto back offensive rebounds in there and got some points in the face himself Now were knotted up at nine Thats a 70 run for Mississippi State And the run will stop with a foul sending Georgia Tech to the free throw line EPS called on the foul Yeah you want to come back and get yourself back into a game early You got to have some guys that are grilling to pull up in transition EPS knocking that triple down and then off the off long offensive rebound I like that not shying away from the shot blocker take it right into the chest of the shot blockers You talked about confidence at the free throw line Thats something CIA still needs to find Just 39 from the stripe As you look at Chris Jans hes part of a very distinguished group Four years now at Mississippi State his first three all trips to the NCAA tournament That hadnt been done in Starkville for nearly 20 years You got to go back to the Rick Stansbury era Hes done a remarkable job at state and at New Mexico State before that Yeah did a good job Wins everywhere he goes National championship down level 66 wins in his first four years at Mississippi State Second only behind Todd Gold All he did last year was win the national championship Not bad Walker cant connect Long rebound to the Yellow Jackets into the hands of Fleming Law pass down low Cila they work it around Great ball movement Fleming Little shake and bake Drive dish and quick hands otherwise Dongo was about to bring the rim down on a twohand slam 1528 to go Pretty frenetic appearances for Chris Jans as Georgia Tech retakes the lead Plan out gets it done Nice little baseline draw uh drive there and a little pull up there by Fleming along that that baseline Beautiful play design by that Georgia Tech coaching staff Theyve been waiting for one of these guards to step up and Fleming doing so is a big addition Followup slam dropping the hammer as Shawn Jones right off his pogo stick Wow Five offensive rebounds eight second chance points in the early going of this basketball game has fueled this Bulldogs attack They can crash with the best of them even though theyre giving up a lot of size Tech in the front court Shot clock winding down Crack with a runner blocked That is not necessarily the best part of his game No hes more of a catch and shoot guy Hes Hes struggling a little bit right now but hes just got like you say got to have the confidence You know youre a shooter You got to play to your strength Theres a clean rebound They go right inside Pass to Washington Weaving Missed the bunny Everything but the finish Now Hubard full throttle and hell set it up in the half court Cant weave Hubard Hes got a mismatch with two picks here in this in this pick and roll Decided to give it up Mississippi State this year still trying to kind of find their identity on offense They lost a couple of key players Theres Hubard on the pull up Silky smooth and nothing but the bottom of the net Well its nice when you know you can give it up and youre going to get it back and you still got the big 611 dongo on you You can put it down on the floor Stop on a dime And do you see the elevation on his jump shot Its quite impressive as as coach Jans points out I mean Hover is below six feet but when you look at the pinnacle of his jump on the shot its almost like hes about 65 Thats exactly what Coach Jan said And here he looks at tack again on this left wing Hubard crosses over scissor dribble back out to EPS We can hear Chris Jans an earshot howing move Great pass down low along the baseline inside Three to shoot Shot goes off the bottom of the backboard and into the hands of Georgia Tech Yeah much better job getting Fleming that time on Hubard He was able to stay with them The whole entire offense for Mississippi State broke down after that Payton Marshall in the game for the first time The sevenfooter Craft sets up Fleming Baker that is that is Lamar Washington who came off the bench Lamar Washingtons going to be a key player for them Remember they lost their great point guard for a number of years to Syracuse and now its going to be Washington and Fleming and Chatfield trying to fill the void Yeah you got to do it by committee right Like neither one of them is a huge score the way Hubard is Look at the high hand off Great pass That is Ballard finding Davis Fleming on the deuce and its Mississippi State back up by a deuce Well being a former big I love when the bigs share the basketball with one another Putting Mississippi State on top for the first time tonight Marshall the sevenfooter with a little spin move How about that Payton Marshall the former Missouri Tiger tries to put the defender in the spin cycle I love that I was commenting you prior to the game that I never had a spin move in laughter my 19 years of playing but that was always a good one right there The high hand off there And then look at this Just just spinning off that pivot getting the defense at a disadvantage and take taking that contact You didnt have that in your bag I did not have that my bag Uh even if I did I dont know if I was going to be able to get up high enough on the day to score to score a bucket Anyway they called me tank I was more of a ground guy move people around for Michael music Jordan and Scotty B That was my strength Well in college something tells me if you tried that move for Dean Smith and it didnt work thered be a conversation Oh definitely probably find myself having that conversation on the bench too Marshall unable to connect at the free throw line Aore a chore is in the game for the first time Number 99 in black from Mississippi State Hes bounced around a while but hell give them some size at 69 And there he gets it down low and it had it stripped out of bounds And it will remain Mississippi State basketball as we step aside for the second media timeout 11 The hunger right the determination all those things that I hate to flash back to this guy the worm Dennis Rodman but he was an undersized player at 67 but was constantly one of the top rebounders if not the top rebounder in the NBA for a stretch of about 10 years States trying to do this season losing Keshan Murphy one of their top bigs Huard has to defer last second and Hore Hore misfires on a three Well weve seen Georgia Tech once offensively coming out of the timeout running a great baseline out of bounds play that time defensively They had a nice job really shutting down the inside but another turnover Live ball turnover Quick hands by Jones And then they get it to him in the front court Draws a foul Shawn Jones extremely active here in the first 8 minutes plus of this game I gotta like the way Coach Jans ball club has come out of that locker room You know after kind of getting punched in the mouth for the first few minutes of the game they have settled down and now theyre the more aggressive team taking this fight to the Yellow Jackets Foul is on Chaz Kelly Just the second team foul for Georgia Tech Back and forth we go A twopoint game Two teams that really would love to get a statement win here tonight Not just for the challenge but to kind of figure out who they are and where they are going this season Its kind of the theme from both coaches today at shootaround Hubard cant connect on the pull up Yeah Do you think that the coach starter has not committed to to his team that we got to start doing a better job on our defensive glass Reeves he had the hot hand early Not that time And a good box out for Mississippi State And Quincy Ballard the transfer from Witchah State These two teams met in the first ACC SEC challenge a couple years ago Great drive there by McGee And in that game it was Georgia Tech pulling off the upset against a top 25 Mississippi State team And look at that We are now tied at six Alabama just knocked off Clemson 90 84 So this thing is coming down to the wire and we are in the late window Great feed and a full slam by Quincy Ballard who drops the hammer and a timeout called by Georgia Tech as the lead swells to a half dozen for the Bulldogs A 6 run Yeah taking it inside Right We mentioned the points in the paint and theyre just a better job of really attacking inside getting that ball off the rim and I love what a big man uses wheels and the guard rerails him Just a hard hard two hand jam music Hey Its the third annual ACC SEC womens basketball challenge wrapping up tomorrow night as SMU hosting Arkansas at 700 Eastern time right here on the ACC Network with threetime NBA champion Scott Williams I am Mike Workin Great to be with you The night cap for this ACC SEC challenge which will be coming down to the wire You see Georgia Tech mired in a scoreless drought approaching 3 minutes in length What do you think the message was The message was at the timeout He was not happy with the squad for not sharing a basketball not attacking inside when they get a nice little back cut along the baseline and a high quality finish to finally get him off of 13 They were stuck in mud as you mentioned there offensively for a moment Reeves gets him out of the quagmire He leads all Yellow Jackets with eight points Another three launched that is in his range Hore Hore although he has really struggled from downtown so far this season just shooting just 14 Reeves on a baseline drive just flips it up there Blind squirrel does not get the nut on that attempt Well I like the aggressiveness I just didnt like the finish the backhand finish on the other side of the rim I thought he should have powered through the basket But again another defensive rebound They just cant get any fast break points This Mississippi State team does a really nice job getting back in transition State is now 1 for 11 from behind the arc Otherwise theyd be dominating this game Thats a major rejection by Ballard Takes some air out of the basketball Frenetic action here on the Georgia Tech side leads to a three ball no good And theyre flying in for the rebound as Hor Yeah thats a couple off or excuse me threepoint shots early in his basketball game Georgia Tech really banging away from the outside and not being able to hit find the range Hore again And that time the big man delivers the 69 Aussie who transferred from Kansas State He was part of Bucky Ball at Sanford before that Bucky McMillan now the coach at Texas AM Yeah just two of 14 from behind the arc coming into this game You can see how excited he was to get that three to go When youre shooting 15 or below any three that goes in is so good for your psyche to visualize that basketball going through the net Its a great sign if they can get him going stretch the defense out a little bit at 69 Mississippi State lost two of their key players Cameron Matthews who for years was the ultimate Swiss Army knife for them and Keshan Murphy took his talents to Auburn still in the SEC but playing in another jersey So theyre trying to fill that void as Reeds pulls the trigger too strong offensive rebound Mustaf might have gotten away with a little bit of a walk Jaden Mustaf you know you you youd mentioned that this team by coach Jans they lost three of their last four basketball games behind under 500 for the first time on the season but you couldnt tell by their energy in which they came to this mornings shoot around actually this afternoon 130 Now they they were a high energy bunch and it has translated over to the first half of this basketball game Evan Road Warriors so far today Taking it to Georgia Tech Mustaf knifing in banging bodies muscles his way home A beautiful move that time by the sophomore Mustaf Yeah nice quick little drive like a little SUV coming out of the right side of this floor Took it right into the heart of that Bulldog defense And he drew a lot of contact but I like the way these officials are let another three One for four now as HR Yet another offensive rebound for the Bulldogs EPS the former Georgetown Hoya coughs it up Loose basketball pinball action EPS again somehow kisses it off the window and in And its the largest lead for Mississippi State Now seven Mike fair to say that Georgia Techs just getting out hustled out worked and that was a a ball that they should have had They should have got a stop on a couple different drives there and just State had a little bit more walk to Yeah And their guards are getting a lot of the offensive rebounds The smallest guys on the floor have been the difference makers so far 10 second chance points for Mississippi State EPS on a stop and go draws the foul as he accelerates Yeah And then like you say right down the heart of that Georgia Tech defense Nobody getting in front stopping them from getting all the way to the rim Nothing you can do at that point but foul and send them to the free throw line 715 to go in the first half Kind of what we expected Two teams trading blows here in the first half music Mississippi State on top and victory Fantastic freshman Caleb Wilson was great in that game You also had Syracuse winning against Tennessee in a game that also went down to the wire Tonight its more of the same I mean we got games coming down to the final minutes Weve already had an overtime affair You see some of the fantastic finishes in day number one And right now this challenge is tied at six 18 games overall between the SEC and the ACC And you see Arkansas defeating Louisville Alabama had all they could handle from Clemson And LSU does win it in overtime 7869 LSU off to a great start under Coach McMahon See who can take home this game here tonight Yellow Jackets and Bulldogs here from Atlanta Great ball movement but a three is too strong And grabbing the rebound is Jaden Eps Yeah another good possession coming out of the uh timeout for Georgia Tech Really moved that basketball well And you can see theyre getting good looks from behind that arc Open look They just cant find the range A 9point lead for Mississippi State Shot clock winding down close to 10 seconds now EPS in trouble Bottled up near midcourt Oh looked like he stepped over and back He sure did Oh good call partner I did not see that Good pressure by Georgia Tech forcing that turnover They really swarmed EPS out there at that half court line Look at that ball gets a little loose and they just stormed out at him and then that right foot Good call stepped into the back court Officials all over This has been a good crew And thats why you have three officials and one one official didnt see it Hes looking up top Another official looking down low and he spots it Great job Great teamwork by the man in black and white Under seven minutes to go first half Mamesh Pavilion Georgia Tech needs to go inside They got 16 to six disadvantage points on the paint They got to get something going inside Missouri in the game for Mississippi State to add a little size And the foul is drawn by Georgia Tech That is Mustaf That is Jane Mustaf You might remember his father Jared Played four seasons in the NBA with the Knicks and the Phoenix Suns I remember me Hes a weird wear me out in the NBA All I could do to stay with Mustaf and before that when he was up at Maryland doing his thing up there as well So Ws really a two They got him playing a little bit more point guard but you could see his ability to slash to the basket on that one and get that foul call 62 on the free throw line this season for Jaden Mustaf As you see wholesale substitutions for both squads Georgia Tech now two of six from the line Cant get the bounce on the second though and Walker comes in for the board Hubard little euro step sets up a wideopen three Got it A line drive triple for Brandon Walker The transfer from Montana State Im old enough to remember when that Euro step was just a travel but he finds his partner on the left side regardless And theyll call there and theyre the largest lead in the game And they got double figures Theyre up 11 Post up down low They have kept CEL quiet so far in this game Five double doubles coming in to lead the ACC Great ball movement Mustaf fouled No call Well I said theyre letting them play Theyre embodies and bodies These big young men being big strong young men playing a mans game tonight Inside and that will be a foul as Brandon Walker draws the contact A lot of physicality in this first half Well listen I like the way Mustaf went to the basket on this last play He tried to go up and jam it but you can just see that that long arm gets to the ball before the body gets contact and they say Hey play on Well I am sitting next to formerly the alltime fouls leader at North Carolina If it wasnt for the extra years with CO you would still hold that distinction partner I told you that in confidence this afternoon when we were grabbing lunch Thats something to be told Did I need to buy Did I need to buy your sandwich today That would have helped Im not going to lie I can be bought You should know that stuff Well listen And of those 400 plus fouls that I had in the ACC for four years at North Carolina I dont think I committed but about three or four The officials just had it in Clearly it was personal I think weve weve documented that Wheres Paparo at I like to catch him in a dark alley Walker too strong on the free throw Its a 12point lead though however for Mississippi State What do you want to see from from Georgia Tech to get this offense in high gear Yeah theyre Well this first of all theyre getting out worked right Even when they go inside theyre coming up in snake eyes and they cant make anything from the outside but they got to go inside They got to try to go to the foul line and they got to make the free throws when they get to the foul line Mississippi State had a couple of open looks cant connect And Damon starter now in his third year with this Georgia Tech program Its always fun catching up with him because when youre talking with an NBA great a guy whos a former NBA rookie of the year an allAmerican in college he expects so much out of his players especially the guards because he was such a good player in his own right Youre 100 right He again get another stop on the defensive end Uh and in talking with Damon you know hes got Bonsi Wells on that bench as well another two guard and slasher score but hes just not quite get consistent play from the guys uh in that back court And they get another stop but they just cant score on this end Great block by Reeves Tech has missed 10 of its last 11 from the field Reeves that puts an end to that chilly streak as he delivers his third triple of the night First time when he started to pull up and Craft kicked it over to him I was like Oh no dont tell me this kids going to fire up another three Hes missed his last four But shooters got to shoot And he had the confidence to let it fly and he knocked it in Well thats an easy call Brandon Walker gave the old chicken wing trying to carve out some space Kaci Reeves singlehandedly keeping Georgia Tech in this game Well I like Kesi Reeves Im thinking no Oh no no dont shoot it And in this kid pulls up the paint So a very scrappy very hungry determined Mississippi State What weve been watching heres Georgia Tech remains chilly from outside Yeah just three for 111 behind the arc Theyre shooting 26 overall in this first half but hey a little run here in the last 330 Uh theyre going to feel real good about themselves going into the locker room Reeds beautiful move spins out of there though and cradling the rebound is Davis Fleming And then he stepped out of bounds right in front of our broadcast position Just stepped right on the sideline And coach Hubbert cant believe it Hes like We do a great job We get the stop I got the ball in my top players hand sliding down that left side but he he just got those Adidas on that sideline You know partner we highlighted that the two great bigs that Georgia Tech has in Dongo and Sila they have been almost a complete nonfactor so far in this game and you have to wonder when theyre going to step it up Yeah they I I thought they would be dominant right from the getgo uh on this one And youre right they got a little bit early blocked some shots and then in about the first three minutes but you know after the last 15 minutes we hadnt heard much from these guys I think coach starter maybe sending them a little bit of a lesson putting Dongo down there on that pine and hoping he can bounce back and recover here in the second half Dongo and CE have combined for just three points and then an and one right down Broadway on the drive is Davis Fleming and hell have a chance at three the hard way Well Davis Fleming I love this one here When you talk pick and roll you want your bigs to open up to the basketball opens to the basketball sees nobody between him and the rim and just takes it hard to the rack There are straight line drives and then theres the parting of the red sea on that play Yeah Will not make coach starter happy because he worked extensively this morning on pick and roll situations and making sure guys were rotating out of the corner leaving shooters out of the corner so they could stop the penetration into the middle Jello Jackets down 12 for the basketball here trying to find any type of flow on offense inside to Reeds and thats a beautifully designed play on the alleyoop to Cila to get him in the scoring lost sila along that baseline partner and thats the high hand off they worked on that with their coaching staff with pads and and all kinds of of padded sticks to deter the shots and uh so its good to see him play pay off here during in the game Upwards been quiet one for five Reeves has not been quiet but a great recovery by a chore to block it after he got blown by by Reeves Yeah Reeves was on his way to the basket thinking hes got an easy two I love this right here And shared in that basketball player youre shooting under 30 You got to make sure you get one down and just a good way to throw it up Let the big man thunder through the basket Quincy Bower checks in for Mississippi State Hes a transfer from Witchah State He led the American in field goal percentage last year at 76 Offensive rebound Craft sets up a wide open shooter at the top That might not be Silas range Definitely not his strength Craft trying to find daylight Huard has got him shadowed Shot clock is down to two Mustaf sees fires missed it and a rebound coralled by Ballard Well Hubards doing a good job on Craft and he cant get going Nobody else can find their shot outside uh of Reed so really dont know where Georgia Tech is going to find any offense They got to do it on the defensive end get some more stops A lot of contact and finally a whistle The foul will go against CEO Georgia Tech from behind the arc is now three for 15 Started by like I I got to have a seat there He got my big 28 ft away from the basket Pressuring a guard Uh when he really didnt need to right He kind of had him under control at that point You just got to say Ive done my job Let me get myself back here below the threepoint line Dongo back in the game for Georgia Tech So they go big for big Usually Georgia Tech likes to have both of those weapons on the floor at the same time but Starttomire right now is trying to find some magic elsewhere Yeah didnt want to see Thea get another foul here in this half Got him on that bench Bringing Dongo back Maybe Dongo can show Style something here in this last minute and a half Ballard backing in Gets the friendly bounce and the lead is back to 12 Shot clock at 10 Baseline jumper is true for Mustaf Well the ball got stuck on that left side Mustaf with a nice looking jump from kind of bell Georgia Tech out of an empty possession Hover crazy offbalance shot The kiss off the window and in Hes got four Yeah the juniors just got such good body control right You can put that shoulder into you take that bump Its got the concentration to finish after the contact Stage doing all this damage But the fourth leading scoreer having a quiet hat and making some noise on that possession is Dongo from downtown I didnt know Dongo the big guy 240 lb 6 11 could stretch it all the way out to the threepoint line Bill Jackson used to find bigs if we shot threepointers Not that not in todays college basketball They let him fire How many checks did you have to write is my question Hey I was making a minimal I didnt take them in that shot First of all Jordan wasnt going to allow it anyway But I like that right there Confidence to sit out there Yeah weve we up only 14 of 15 threes but let me try my hand at it Dongo making him A nice little bucket there from that left side of the floor Now next weeks mens basketball lineup on the ACC Network it begins on Wednesday night The Liberty music Flames travel to Raleigh North Carolina to take on Will Wade and his NC State squad Thatll be at 700 And then on Thursday St Joes takes on Cayenne Anthony and the Syracuse Orange at 900 Eastern right here on the ACC Network Hes the former Tarheel Scott Williams Zia Mike Morgan appreciate you stopping by on a Wednesday night here in the ATL Mississippi State has led throughout this half 3728 despite the fact that the nations fourth leading scorer Josh Huard only has four points up to this point Little fullcourt pressure and then Georgia Tech will peel back Mississippi State in play for the final shot of the half spread the floor 10 seconds Leps get a ball screen He will from Hubard Now probes the baseline Tries to dish it and instead throws it out of bounds with 18 on the clock I think he was trying to hit a chore Chore never saw it coming All right What do you like here partner 18 Whats your play A lot of time with 18 You get at least two possibly three dribbles in get that ball within about four or 5 ft of the threepoint line but you got to get something moving to the front court in this situation Cant try to over pass but throw it down into the heart of the defense and not get a shot at all Always got to look out for the inbounder on a play like this It is Fleming thats going to trigger it in for Georgia Tech Throws it in Caught at the top Marshall with a heave And that is how the half will come to a close was a first half primarily dominated by Mississippi State The visiting Bulldogs up by nine 37 cushion on paint points turnovers have actually been pretty mild for both of these teams What do you want to see out of Georgia Tech differently in the second half I got to see Donga and Salah do a better job playing inside Just eight points and four uh rebounds for two bigs that average 22 and 17 So they got to get after it here to start this second half Meanwhile Mississippi State great extra pass leads to the two hand flush for Boward A beautiful opening possession for the Bulldogs Great interior passing Weve seen it all uh night long by State in that first half Sharing that basketball pushing that lead back up to double digits Seven points for the former Witchah State Shocker Quincy Ballard the 7 foot senior I love the action right here Just this drive creates the mismatch The bigs got to come over and help And he does a nice job sharing the ball with him Yellow Jackets If his name isnt Kasaci Reeves everybody else in white has struggled from behind the arc tonight EPS on the drive THE FORMER HOYA WITH THE HOOP AND THE harm and a chance and a threepoint play Its almost like Georgia Tech has rolled out a red carpet and is welcoming a lot of these Mississippi State players to drive right down the heart of their defense You can see again just nobody stepping up Everybody inside that restricted area And once theres contact down there thats an automatic easy call for the officials Thats a blow by and no help from your cheering bigs Yeah No no help Got to get up higher closer to those letters I dont know if you got to be all the way out to the free throw line but you got to be up closer to those ACC letters down that paint area to try to be a deterrent or a shot block 10 points now for Jaden EPS We talked about the importance of the addition of EPS to help Hubard in the back court this year Hes doing it Hes been averaging about 15 points a game So well above his uh target for tonight And again one and done Nice job snatching that defensive rebounder off and running with Hubard Huard slow roll euro step and a teardrop floater Yeah Hubard he had a slow first half for a guy thats third in the nation in in scoring Just four points in that first half but he made no time getting in the scoring column here in this second half Largest lead for Mississippi State music every threepointer he hits and hes hit 238 threes Hes got fans that have partnered up with him to donate to the MakeaWish Foundation in Mississippi to help out patients Just a truly great story in the spirit of what people like Dick Vitell have been able to to launch Of course the late Jimmy Valvano and the B Foundation and Josh Huard who has been such a mainstay for this Mississippi State program now in his third year In fact Chris Jan said you know he was obviously concerned You know people nowadays are hunting shooters in the portal but Josh Hubard put everything to rest in this off season He said quote It never crossed my mind I wanted to stay with the Bulldogs Hes from Madison Mississippi and hes making a difference in the community in Mississippi Yeah I really love that That was the best part about the shoot around on both sides this morning hearing what this young man is doing with this platform to help out Mississippi State almost had an easy bucket down low but Davis Fleming had it stripped Georgia Tech needs something to get going on offense Chatfield is in the game and so too is that man Kaci Reeves He has been the one constant shooting threat Number 14 in white Kesi Reeves Yeah without Reeves they would be lost And he hasnt shot a great percentage but hes knocking in points kind of when Georgia Tech needs a bucket Theres that man right there we were just spotlighting there Huard Hes just so strong when he gets in that painted area He can absorb that contact Doesnt get knocked off his shot Reeves again Reeves heating up for Georgia Tech at the right time and its down to a 12point game Well one thing Coach Stomire talked about like know your personnel He kept saying that over and over again referring to Hubard Right now Mississippi State has got to realize they better know their personnel cuz Reeves is hot as fish grease and hes knocking in threes from all over the floor Reeves on the breakaway Reeves missed the layup Tapped out of bounds and itll be Mississippi State basketball I was just about to add to the point total of 17 for Reeves but he could not finger roll it in Im not 100 sure there wasnt some contact on here just to try to bail him out I love this right here The way he gets himself back on balance after the ball comes together And lets see if theres any contact No he he just ran out of a little power outage and didnt power that thing over the top of the front of the rim Little flat tire there right before contact and liftoff for the rim So now its still a 12point game Reeds has kept him in it You dont want this guy to heat up if youre Georgia Tech Thats Hubard Hubard missing on the midrange Exciting opening stance out of this second half Drive and kick Baseline drive by Washington whos been quiet in this game Lobs it down low Turn around Silky smooth hook shot for Dongo Thats what Dongo needed right He just needed a basket He had a couple six points there in that first half but he kind of needed something to get himself going here early in this second half I love that left shoulder turn right hand jump hook Something hes done 10000 times probably over the course of his young career Dango the leading returning scorer in rebounding for Georgia Tech They hope to get more out of him Right now his team trails 4636 in Atlanta Georgia started his career in Gainesville and Georgia Tech was very fortunate to grab him in the portal and certainly a guy theyre going to lean on quite a bit this season Yeah were talking to coach Stomire He spent a lot of time with us after the shoot around and he realizes hey I got this team and still trying to figure out what I got and Reed showing up big time showing showing him quite a bit Walker with some happy feet and turns it over with the shot clock winding down So great defense there by Georgia Tech Seventh turnover on the Bulldogs Well you can see that coach starter when hes got a chance to talk to his uh troops coming out of timeout situations or free throw situations He really coaches them up well Whether on both sides of the floor they got a defensive stance uh or theyre trying to get a bucket Hes got them well prepared Leaving the hook Cila feathery touchdown low for Mo Cila I think these bigs Mike are starting to flex their muscles a little bit We had Donga with that little right hand hook and now Cila down there the young freshman doing his darn thing inside and a bucket on the other end by Hubard big time How did he get that off over the long armed dongo who I thought was going to come over and send that thing into the second row and the crafty hubard just found a way to squirt that thing high up off the back We talked about hes hes sub six feet but hes got hydraulics for legs always reaches up and rises as Reeves hits yet another shot I mean Kesi Reeves if Georgia Tech comes back and wins this game 20 points now for the senior Reeves has been integral in everything theyve done on offensive Yeah I think he gets the game ball at this point right now unless somebody else hits a game winner Reeves definitely and they get another stop Georgia Tech doing it on the defense The steal by the freshman Chatfield Chatfield missed it and a rebound coral by EPS trying to go inside Might have forced that one a little bit Mike stayed on the attack and a block foul called and Mississippi State will go to the free throw line Yeah its going to be on Ree down there Tried to draw the charge but I think his heels were on that restricted area And thats a a rule I like to its its really changed more so with secondary defenders Its a lot harder to draw a charge now in college basketball than it used to be Oh Yeah Those Duke players used to stay underneath the net If you slam the ball down there they would take that charge which you can see clearly inside that restricted area and it makes it a lot easier for the officials right Like it gives them a clear line for all three officials to be on the same page as to where those uh feet have to be planted to be able to take that charge When you talk to officials I I think they like the change in the rule because it it takes a little bit of the pressure off them I mean you when you ask them about it theyre like Look if its in doubt its going to be a block You got to really make sure primary defender set before the offensive player gets in there and makes the contact Reeves tears away the rebound Its an eightpoint game Mississippi State has led throughout but Georgia Tech starting to cut into the lead Dongo on a triple Bat of the round out of bounds and it will remain Yellow Jacket basketball Well it was Dongo to have one in that first half He had knocked down a triple decided to try his hand for another one in the second half here I kind of like that shot when youre up by eight rather than when youre trying to mount a comeback and you got all of a sudden you you got some good mojo you got some momentum working Dont necessarily want to see your near sevenfooter shooting it from out there And just a tough turnover a travel on Washington Let me ask you as a former post player Weve talked so much about Georgia Techs their dynamic duo of great big men two of the best in the ACC but you have to demand the basketball The the guards bring it up the floor They control Do you want to see more paint touches for those two Yeah definitely Id like to see him play more inside out Even if it wasnt the fact that they were trying to score down there thats going to shrink the defense Get them up off some of those shooters cuz theyre going to have to help inside If the bigs are down there close to the basket with the ball you can throw it outside try to get a cleaner look for either three or a midrange jumper Great move inside and Brandon Walker willing his way to an and one What a nice move down low because he took his time right like theres no no sense of urgency I got a oneonone situation here Im going to do two dribbles middle Im going to come back baseline Thats something these guys work on over and over again in practice with the big coach He was all big sky at Montana State The 68 255 big Brandon Walker now taking his talents to Mississippi State Hes got 11 points to lead all Bulldogs Thats what Mississippi State needed right there too Right Weve seen that 16point lead Shrink down to single digits They needed a bucket But here goes Dono Thats where I want to see him play Mike pick little roll right down to the middle of the ring Didnt have to take it all the way to the rim Shows his little float game Nice soft touch for the big man Strong float game Man who added 25 lbs to his 69 frame in the offse Yeah we were talking earlier how coach really uh coach Dmmy really challenged his team after practice with a 10minute talk about do you want it and theyre showing some want second half here Ill tell you who wants it right now is Mississippi State and Shawn Jones finding that triple late clock situation I love the precision of the passing A good pass will lead to a good quality shot Jones Jr knocks down Crafted on a fade and fire Dont look now We got a little flow to this basketball game Hey guys are making some shots This is fun basketball now partner We wonder when Craft was going to join the party The Rock fight is over Washington rebound ahead of the pack Sets up the big mans dongo and a rejection Follow no good Mississippi State and Brandon Walker getting back on D Tough shot off balance by McGee I think Dongo would want that uh attempt back I dont know if it was fatigue or what but a big man like that should be finishing overhand at the rim Yeah hes hes uh out of gas This game getting awfully physical down low as a whistle finally called Thats going to be Payton Marshall who starter says reminds him of one Carolina then followed 15ear careers in the NBA um a good player and just a better guy better person So uh gone too soon at 57 Um Easy E was is going to be missed and it was a hard blow for the U NBA family Such a a great talent and like you said anybody who knew Elden Campbell knew him as a great person as well that that 1990 season where he was the first team all ACC That was that year Georgia Tech actually won the regular season ACC championship The player of the year these are all guys you know all too well The player of the year in the ACC was Dennis Scott The rookie of the year was Kenny Anderson So two guys very familiar with this building right here on the campus of Georgia Tech Yeah And we saw a clip of me trying to ineffectively guard Elden Campbell on that first play I dont think coach Mil Smith was real happy I was sliding my biscuits down cutting off that baseline as he went by me like a turn style He was a tough guard cover He he was a big man but he had a quick first step and he was explosive uh off the ground as well So quite a good player and yeah I took some lumps down here in Georgia Tech over my career by Daryl Remole and Tommy Hammonds and and you mentioned Dennis Scott hitting a he a buzzer beater three at 89 to win one for the Yellow Jackets after Kevin Madden tried to hit you with an inbound pass like why are you throwing it to me I dont want it a 60 shooter theres so many great players that have come through this Georgia Tech program over the years going back in particular to that Bobby Kremans era time you looked up he had a fivestar point guard I almost came to Georgia Tech they were my high finalists as coming out of Southern California I just love Perry Clark and Bobby Kremens and took an official visit here to Georgia Tech So I was close to being wearing the Yellow Jacket jersey myself at one point Theres a theres Dennis Scotts retired jersey number Our colleague now at ESPN Yeah that could have been a great inside outside game You and Dennis Scott saying I I would have liked that Yeah laughter Not that you would trade in your Tarheel years for anything Let me make that clear Tar Hill Nation I I am very much still bleeding blue and very happy with my decision to go to North Carolina But uh Im just trying to put together my fantasy team match mix and match here That would have been great But we had Yeah we had some battles against these ACC guys and u Im Im glad to be back calling the action here in this ACC SEC challenge which is really starting to get tight here Well SEC dominated day one but its the SEC uh coming back with a little revenge Thats right Its 66 as we speak and the night session here thats going on is going to determine it By the way the five out of the seven games today are on the home floors of SEC school So theres an advantage from the Southeastern Conference standpoint Last year of course the SEC dominated 142 but this year a different story The ACC showed itself very well in some close clashes last night We might have another close clash here Talk about close clashes That 16point advantage has uh shrunk down now to six and theyre struggling to find a bucket here Shot clock down to seven Up top Hubard got it from downtown A clutch three by Josh Huard Hey just such a good player to be able to throw the ball to in a short clock situation I think Hubbert uses his vertical lead uh his time in the air to get back on balance back on target to get a good clean look at the front of the rim Fleming lost it picked it up Chris Jans wants a double dribble Not going to get it You can always pick up a loose ball and he as long as you dont redribble after youve lost the basketball So Coach Jans as much as he wanted that travel situation he going to get it Officials arent buying what Coach Jans is selling Big shot by Fleming Back to a sevenpoint game Hubard HE CHECK THREE FROM THE WING Josh Hubard starting to ignite and the lead swells to 10 Craft on the response No offensive rebound for the Yellow Jackets Oh Reed has done a little bit of everything tonight right Hes scored the ball Gets a big offensive rebound there Craft floater short Hovered on the board Hovered on the attack and draws a reach in foul on Mustaf And thats going to be the fifth foul on Georgia Tech We still got 9 and 12 minutes to play this one But how good is the third leading score of the nation Just a little catch and shoot Shot clock down to five seconds And I love this one right here Just a little inside out snap back dribble to the left had the defender going on one way as hes going up for his jump shot the other way to create that distance for a clean look So if hes not rising up above the defenders hes got that ability to shoot the step back off the bounce Its funny having covered Hubard for three years now and hes probably about 510 I dont I cant remember his shot being blocked He has an amazing ability to get it off against bigger opponents Well I asked Chris Jans about it He was like Have you not seen him play You see how high he gets on the floor He looked at me incredulously like what have you been doing with this in the month of November Williams is only lead the third leading scorer in the country Walker back iron tipped around Georgia Tech carousing Here comes Washington the other way up top Fleming all the way rejected I mean an absolute swat by Ballard Turn to center Here comes Hubard the other way Oh he stuck his leg out and got the foul call Crafty move by the junior Hubard did a full out split with his legs drawing the contact Yeah hard to think that the officials would think this was a natural shooting motion but I love this one right here I love when the big guys patrol that painted area swatting that one away says you shall not pass And then Hubbert hes realizing hes got it going right now Hes got it stuck on automatic He comes right down kind of in the wash of a bunch of players getting back on defense is able to get that contact and hes going to go to the line I dont know Is he shooting one two here or three here I I thought it was three Yeah hes well behind that line I I dont see much contact there but thats one of those plays that you kind of you know kind of wish you could review I guess Hard a 76 free throw shooter Yeah just four points in the first half And now what is Hubard up to now It seems like hes gotten 10 points here in the last few minutes 17 points Working on that Make it 18 Hes also extended his streak now to 55 consecutive games with a threepointer Its a school record He was a scoring dynamo back at Madison Ridgland High in Madison Mississippi You know we make we mentioned his make One other thing I want to talk about is he does a showcase for top players back at his hometown in Madison So I think what hes doing with his NIL what hes doing with his platform just just so nice and refreshing to see Hes got mom and dad in the seats here tonight at the Camish Pavilion They were telling us his parents travel to every game and away to watch Josh Hubard play There you see the hovers They got to be so proud Mom and dad right there Teams in a dog fight here in this second half and they look like cool as they are They no stress at all in their in their uh faces They are calm as can be right now Mississippi State enjoying a 13point cushion Jones will check in for the Bulldogs Chatfield Eric Chatfield the freshman out of Pace Academy Pace Academy here in Atlanta will come in for the Yellow Jackets He was a threetime allstate performer in high school You mentioned Silo struggled from a line under 40 Missed the first we got the second to go A 12point lead Plenty of time if youre Georgia Tech And theyll try to heat up some pressure here Well one thing they better recognize when he talked about your personnel they know Hubards gotten he wasnt having a good first half but hes got it going now They got to run that get that basketball out of his hands Hover feeling it Tech boarding it Here comes Washington Thats been the man all night long Kaci Reeves but that one rattles out Yeah halfway down but sped back out just into his shooting motion real little too quickly Second effort bounces in for Quincy Ballard Ballards had some nice minutes on the floor for this Mississippi State team I love that one That rolled down the basket and the uh the ability to stay with his own miss again Second chance points been big for the Bulldogs 30 points in the paint tonight for Mississippi State They have taken it to the bigger Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket squad And thatll be more Thats two more in the paint An athletic floater from Jabori McGee off the window and in Yeah they have not been afraid of these shot blockers by Georgia Tech at all Constantly And its not always the bigs taking it in there A lot of times its the smaller guys slashing inside Timeout here in Atlanta 6852 the Bulldogs up big music All agree we want to see it every year for eternity The ACC the SEC two of the best conferences around Last year of course it was dominated by the SEC Its going to be a different looking final tally this year as you see the updated scores Auburn right now leading Will Wades NC State Wolfpack squad And Vanderbilt one of the biggest surprises in all of college basketball Coach Bington has done outstanding work Theyre up big against SMU Virginia blowing out the Longhorns That game is in Boston So its going to come down to these final four games whos going to win this event But Scott kudos to both conferences and all the coaches saying Lets challenge ourselves in December and have these great matchups Theres always going to be room for some quote unquote mid major matchups green puffs if you will in many cases but these games challenge you and get you ready for conference play Yeah I really like that I mean Matt Vandy SMU two undefeateds going at each other In fact I was talking to uh coach coach Jans He wanted to schedule an exhibition game with Georgia Tech and all a sudden the schedule came out So wait we got to pump the brakes because were going to be facing off against each other in early December So uh I like the fact that you know they are scheduling games that matter early in December Uh and we get a chance as hoop heads right to just soak up all this good action Oh this is great ahead of the pack Jones Jones cut off at the baseline and now Mississippi State will do the wise thing and set it up in the half court Huard Hubard with those midair scissor kicks draws another foul And a good shot of mom and dad Mom getting a little chuckle out of out of that one out of her young young man there as he he like he say hes got that rise right like he he hangs in the air and it causes the defender to you know while hes going straight up theyre still moving side to side they move right into it Sunday night the huddle crew will have the annual selection Sunday special a 2hour show that includes full breakdowns of the ACCs bowl and playoffbound teams cover starting at 6 Eastern right here on the ACC network and the ESPN app Im Scott Williams Im Mike Morgan Glad to be with you on a Wednesday night in the ATL Mississippi State trying to pull off what might be considered a mild upset on the road Two teams really trying to find themselves as we inch closer and closer to conference play Hubard had it stripped and this should be an easy deuce Washington on the other end Lamar Washington They needed a bucket badly there and a good live ball turnover They got something going the other way and trying to cut into that large deficit Got it down now to a 14point game Theres plenty of time left in this game for Georgia Tech to make a good little run here See if they can put some pressure on State that ball see if that basket can shrink down a little bit Right now Hubards got stuck on automatic with 17 second half points Can they get some stops Shot clock at five down to three And thatll be another stop So Georgia Tech continue to try and slice this deficit down from 14 Reeds cheering buries the triple and its down to 11 I love that one Hover got caught going for the steel and he did come up with the ball and left Reeds wide open down in that left corner that lead Thats the easiest three to make And Reeves made him pay What is that now Yeah Seven threes 23 total points for Kaci Reeves Hes at times one of a oneman wrecking crew for Tech And then the float game The strong for Shawn Jones Yeah nice interior passing Really moving that ball Does not stick in any of those stink players hands And then came up with an easy bucket inside Points in the paint 91 consecutive games played for Jones out of Houston Texas And then coughing it up down low Thats a tough break for Dongo It just has not been Dongos night Yeah Dongo Hes got the Hes got the 12 points but it just its a quiet 12 Right Right It hasnt been the impressive get the crowd out of the seat with some monster jams or offensive putbacks And uh theyre going to need some of that I just say 5 minutes to go ton of time What he did last year for this Yellow Jacket squad it wasnt just the points He let him in rebounding steals blocks more good interior passing by Mississippi State Just couldnt Ballard couldnt get that little lefty off glass to go But Im really impressed the way this coach Chance team shares the ball Washington couple of jabs passed up an open three and then hits a tough two Look at the pressure picking up Reeves now pressuring Ballard all up down the floor Oh my goodness Hover slicing dicing and dishing to Davis Fleming Not just a score right Good court vision A wellbalanced basketball player finds his big along the baseline And then Hover flying in for the rebound Coming up on the 4minute mark of this basketball game Mississippi State trying to pick up what would be its biggest win of the year a road victory against an ACC foe Yeah And then look at this one more time here by Hubard Right When you get that ball below the free throw line especially if you got it below the free throw line in the paint good things are going to happen for you And you can see right there Hubbert just finding his big ballot along that baseline for the easy twohand jam When youre coming off a loss when youve lost three of your last four this is this is exactly the way Coach Chance needed his team to respond Hes he see that four minutes to go Hes still sparking out orders to his squad He he was still when he talked to us today fired up about that SMU game He said We were up nine 7 minutes to go We commit a foul on a threepoint shot a fourpoint play for SMU then give it right back to SMU They hit another three So before you know it its a 70 run They wind up losing the game at overtime and frustration levels starting to mount One thing you know if you follow Chris Jans enough never count out a Chris Jans coached basketball team You know I was like I said I did charge on Grand Canyon basketball and they the same conference there with New Mexico State and he just ran rough shot over the the Wack Conference for years before he got this kid A timeout on the floor with 358 to go Mississippi State up by 15 over Georgia Tech ACC SEC mens challenge coming at you from Atlanta music and McCamish Pavilion music six feet You see what he did in his first two years Allan Houston at Tennessee Bernard King Couple of these guys you played against Scott The six degrees of Scott Williams is a real thing folks And then Josh Huard of course he is lighting it up in his first couple years Did light it up in Starkville and now in his junior campaign Continues to impress Really really impressive My first time getting a good up front and close look at this young man And I like the way he was content to kind of let his his teammates kind of control that first half Again going to that double digit lead going to the going to the locker room And then the second half he said Okay its winning time It is Hover Offensive rebound time for Mississippi State They have put together an array of offensive boards and dominated points in the paint tonight Hubard look at that move right there Are you kidding me Josh Huard He had a defender on him 35 ft away from the basket Never lost his dribble Kept himself on balance and finished inside The fourth career game for Hubard with 25 points and five assists He has taken over this game tonight The number one scorer in the SEC One of the top scorers in the country They cough it up here though Did a nice job following him up Theyre just on the other side of half court Three ball No Again Mississippi State doing a great job boxing out How many times have I heard you say three ball No When it comes to Georgia Tech they have not been able to to put it in the basket outside of Reeves Just two other players have made threepoint shots Yeah theyve missed 20 of their 28 threes And other than Kesi Reeves nobody has been strong from distance tonight for the Yellow Jack as well Mississippi State trying to close out Georgia Tech up by 15 here The final two and a half to go from the Pavilion cheering Shot clock at five EPS in traffic NO FOLLOW UP OF SLAM and dropping the hammer is Davis Fleming Thats what that penetration does right Like everybodys got to come to the ball to either defend or try to block the shot Its always going to leave a big on the weak side available to be able to attack that rim And Davis Fleming did not disappoint with this ball There is SA He has been quiet but a little bully ball down low on that move Seven points for the talented freshman Well its unlikely now with under two minutes to play here Georgia Techs going to get this victory Uh but coach Stamire he he I got this one Hes coming out to big guy Thats an entry pass You were ready right Coach saved me there I was going to get up a little jumper on the right side but uh he can see that hes his team still got a little fight in them even though when they were down by 16 they cut it to six Got down by 16 again and still battled back with some I know its early on in the season and they scuffling around now here Theyre going to suffer their third loss in a row but theres things to build on if youre coach starter here with this squad See threepoint opportunity here for CEO might be a little too little too late You know you brought up a great point our time at shoot around today and always enjoy talking with Damon Starttomire but had a long talk with his team and you and I were kind of eavesdropping a little bit It wasnt a talk about strategy It wasnt breaking down film It was a a a test of want to and might He was challenging his team I thought it was very interesting to see the way he was trying to get his squad motivated and he might have some more discussions after this one Sure theyll have some chalk talk and I you know this I think that like I said earlier they did so show some fight here in the second half They didnt perform the way they wanted to It wasnt like they werent trying in the first half They didnt make shots Right Right Let shoot under 30 Its hard hard to stay close to your opponent But they did make some shots for a stretch here in this second half and they chipped him to that like I say 16point disadvantage Got it down to six But then Hubard and what are you going to do with this kid This kids absolutely fantastic He decided at that point it was time for him to flip the switch and he took over this basketball game Hes been able to light up a lot of good defenses around the SEC over the years Tonight doing it against an ACC opponent The future is still bright for Damon Stonemire in Georgia Tech Backto back top 25 classes Talking to Paul B party our national recruiting analyst He says Look out for next years freshman class another top 25 class for Georgia Tech So the talent is coming into Atlanta which youre going to need to have to compete in the ACC this year and beyond Back to the basket for Fleming 12 points for the freshman Now you see the current count right now Nine clinches it for somebody SEC is up seven to six And it looks like Auburn is going to win over NC State as theyre up 10 with 13 seconds left So it looks like the SEC might defend its crown if things continue to go the way they are here in the night session They definitely came roaring back with a vengeance here on day number two And hey but if youre the ACC you showed well right Like after getting smacked pretty good last year 142 Um and a lot of those games werent cheering even close I think they really showed a much stronger ACC this year uh than weve seen in a while I know you like Duke with Cam Boozer Whats not to like Well I dont like I dont like Duke I like Cam Boozer Im a Carolina guy I cant laughter say that I cant ever say they wont let me back in Chapel Hill if I say I like Duke Fair point You respect the talent of Duke 100 I know you love Caleb Wilson Yes Of of the Tarheelss I want to get some of the other teams youre looking for this year in the ACC in just a few moments as Washington misfires Hubard Who else Top floor for the rebound Under a minute to go and State holding on to a 12point lead Thats going to do it obviously for this one as theyre going to try to work on some things that theyll need in close ball games by committing that foul So why you foul because you might need this later on in a close game And with this win the SEC will clinch the third annual ACC SEC mens challenge Uh but I I want to get your thoughts again on the rest of the ACC Give me some other teams that folks out there can look for this year Well SMU I know they didnt they didnt get the victory this evening but I think that they got a solid squad there Uh we talked to the Cal is not in the tournament Cals doing good things out there They lost to Yakovic but they got Scotty Pippen one of my former teammates Uh kids out there on on their squad Uh so they theyre theyre going to be something to be reckoned with as as well Talked about Duke talked about Carolina Um Brad Brownell and Clemson Yeah No Clemson I had them earlier this year Those guys fight hard I like the way he coaches his squad up Came up a little short after a furious comeback today but uh you know Louisville obviously has got themselves a squad as well Its the teams that are you know like the Duke uh Louisville the teams that are top 20 in scoring top 30 in defense and theyve won 20 of the last 20 n of the last 20 national championships So you got to be able to do it on both ends Both Duke Louisville get that done Now the ACC always has a team seemingly in the final four and competing for the national championship I think the fans around this league want to see the depth get back and maybe this is the year that happens I I I believe it is And I wasnt too high on the ACC coming in before game one but uh after having seen the way the these these coaches and these young players and how the transform portal um how well they have them clicking early in the season I have high hopes for the ACC this year Lamar Washington who is all West Coast Conference at Pacific someone they needed to come in to Atlanta to help fill the void at the point guard spot Tap in just kind of slithering in there that time with Cila I mean theyre still within reach You got 227 on the clock 12point game if you can get some turnovers here And thats one right there How about a three This will make it interesting A miss though And Mississippi State boards it There was your slight crack of the window Scott Well you were a little more optimistic than I than I was but uh uh I was wondering where you were going to keep people tuned in for the final 20 seconds I totally understand Hey I got to tip my hat to this Mississippi State squad These guys are strapping
