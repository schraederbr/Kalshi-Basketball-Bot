You know its not like they got a lot of practice going to the offensive glass All right here we go Two of the hottest teams in a conference And Trey Donaldson what a role he has been on for Miami Three straight 20point games five straight games of 19 or more The Hurricanes average nearly 88 points per game And both these teams play really good defense especially Clemson cheering Renew tied up Shot clock down to five Drew Washingtons going to have to put it up And thats exact Thats a great snapshot of Clemsons defense right there They want to really grind you in late into the clock force you into a tough shot For Clemson offensively its been a different guy every night They have three players averaging in double figures Very balanced team Seven different players have led them in scoring in games this year Youd think theyd have a a goto guy or two in the scoring column but really their highest score averages 12 a game Lenu just lost the handle He bumped cheering and applause into Godfrey and lost it out of bounds Well youve got the leagues newest coach and Jay Lucas taking over at Miami 37 years young was an assistant in Texas Kentucky the last four years at Duke and then the longest tenure coach in the Atlantic Coast Conference in Brad Brownell 307 wins the most all time in Clemson basketball history Yes sir That is Carter Welling and a guy who doesnt really shoot the three very well 29 but he got a great look I mean Miami is going to test him out there See if he continues Donaldson great box out there by Welding in company And thats what they have to do Clemson has to get the first miss every time Heres Godfrey He started his career here at Clemson left for a season to go to Georgia came back to Clemson for his senior year Thats a freshman body right there Henderson lost a handle underneath Boy that Shelton Henderson goes 66 240 lbs 18 years old Surprised hes not playing Monday night Well they may he may get a call depending on the injury report Of course talking about Monday night the Hurricanes out of the Atlantic Coast Conference will play in the College Football Playoff National Championship Theyve already taken down number two Ohio Net rankings are built up Different story this year Much better result and much better heading into league play All right they got the U shot clock situation ironed out He was sitting on 29 should have been 18 So Clemson with a ball Tough shot Not going to go And Miami with a rebound Still looking for its first cheering point of the game 0 for three so far from the field This is what Clemson does to you They force you to get deep in the shot clock And theres a takeaway And that will go with down by Justin Porter Well and you know Im thinking well youre oneon two you may want to wait for some friends but he put his head down and went right to the rim Well Porter a thousand point score over the last two years at Middle Tennessee State Brad Brownell told us yesterday he likes putting it up He plays with a He plays with a motor thats revving always at 8500 RPM Another miss for Miami Still scoreless and were 330 into this game Oh what a move that was Wide open Jake Wall with a three Hurricanes 0 for four Theyve turned it over three times already Donaldson will try and quiet things down a little for Miami Well and if you have to get in and grind it half court against Clemson youre going to be in for a long afternoon No easy breaks so far for the Hurricanes Wide open look from the corner and there we go The first time Dante Allen the freshman out of Miami buries a three Yeah its an interesting team A mix of portal guys and then some really good freshman underneath Godfrey W Yeah you look at the overhaul of both of these rosters and well talk more about that when we come back Good start for the T You know were talking about both of these teams Clemson lost seven players to graduation six in the portal Miami lost every player it had Zero returning players from a year ago Donaldson cant get it to fall And thats where Miami is going to score most of their points in the pain area working on Renu That just muscle against muscle there No double team coming inside Good deflection cheering Porter with very active wide open and Porter missed it Had a much needed rebound for Ude who is third in the conference in that category averaging 10 a game Well his importance is he allows Renu to play the power forward position rather than the center Thats tough shot off the glass from a southpaw renew Thing for both teams Tom theres no real shot blocking out there So if you get into the lane you dont have to be looking around for rim protectors Yeah Like we saw at UVA last week man Sevenfooter after sevenfooter Yep And averaging about 8 10 blocks a game Second three for Carter Welling You know what what did Brad Brown tell us yesterday is I dont know Someones going to step up for us in each game And this may be Wellings afternoon Well he has two threes He came in shooting just 29 from threepoint land on the year They do can shoot it but too strong And thatll be a foul Five white jerseys back and uh Henderson chases it down hustles it and gets the foul as well and line change No kidding Well thats the one thing about this Clemson team Most people feel like this is the deepest team in the Atlanta Coast Conference Oh no question And its you know theyve got those nine guys that score between six and 12 points Goes back to you know you cant lock in on one guy in the scattering court Davidson defending here He had 21 in a row In a row Yep Last game out against BC Nice drive to the bucket by the freshman You know Chuck Daly coach of the Pistons back then When a guy was hot like that he kept going to him until he missed two shots in a row Then he went somewhere else but he he rode that hot hand Back door cut and a rare rejection right there by Altus And then at the other end cheering offensive foul against Raidu And what caused that was he lowered the shoulder down as he went into the body Its one of the few times theyve got it right there Just a little bit just enough to get that call Really nice play by Davidson A brave play to stand in against Rayu Well heres a young man youre going to hear a lot about Number 21 Ace Buckner He is a son of Clemson legend Greg Buckner back in the mid 1990s And man Ace is a player now Very competitive very aggressive Jumper doesnt go for Davidson Second three rattled in by Dante Allen Boy he has really given them a big lift for a team that was struggling offensively Fourstar recruit out of Miamis Mont Verde Academy Hes coming off an 11point game against Notre Dame So maybe hes starting to feel a little bit rhythm uh offensively This game feels like its been thoroughly dominated by the Tigers Shot clock down to three Davidson along the baseline And they dont mind that offensively either Grinding the shot clock down and using up a bunch making Miami defend cheering Late double team on Renu Theyre coming on the dribble when he puts it on the floor and then Allen penetrates Good feed to Renu under the basket and he kisses it home His second basket of the game You know I I told Jay Lucas watching them play offensively it looks like this group has been together a long time with you know blind the fact that theyre all new Great ball movement and then an air ball So Miami now with a chance to get within one or even tie the game Theyre creeping back in Renew a couple of baskets He averages my age who are way too young to be suffering that fate Well you said you were what You were the lone remaining center from the 1980s with the 76ers Yeah Yeah Scary stuff And uh you know Elvin I I competed against him a little bit and we got a quick Well I tell you what Porter has been fabulous in the back court the deflection early and then the conversion there But no I you know I I competed against him a little bit toward the end of my career the beginning of his career and then he came and played for the Hornets so you know got to know him He loved to fish I mean that was his thing He he really enjoyed being out on the water Donaldson has still not scored again Hes had three straight games of 20 or more and five in a row of 19 or more And here we are 9 minutes into the game today and Clemson defense pitching a shut out Great entry pass from Godfrey down underneath the Well Well and he got the switch off and he had actually had Donaldson on him He had a good seal in the lane and a good high low pass A threepoint game Swells to a sevenpoint lead for the Tigers which in a game like this is a lot Allen has been the guy so far And a rebound And here comes the other way Justin Porter Welling has hit a couple of threes already and just turned it over I may I may have thought about shooting that one the way Ive been going Kick it out to Allen offensive rebound and another miss So Miami started 0 for five then made five of its last six now 0 for its last three Weve almost built the house Oh a good opportunity And then Welling the soft spot in that zone is right along the free throw line maybe just below it And he got a great look And man did they work on that yesterday in practice over and over and over again And against that zone youre not going to get a better look than he had that time Good box out on U by Welling Welling is having an excellent game He has eight of Clemsons 19 And then a reach in underneath by the native of Slovakia Teemo Malovitz His nickname is Three Mo because thats how thats what hes in there for is to put it up from the perimeter Hes taken eight twopoint shots on the year But Johnson checks in Godfrey will get his first breather and Porter will get a breather And a travel there on Wii Buckner right back in And this will be Clemsons story all day long Guys in guys out And thatll go down And you mentioned the strength of the freshman Henderson And thats what they really need to do And you know theyve had some threes and they theyve been you know bailed out a little bit but this is where they need to go No shot blocking You can look for an easy basket draw the contact play inside out Wave with two fouls But one thing that you know Brad Brownell told us yesterday we have three big guys So even if one of them gets in foul trouble were not necessarily behind the eightball Yeah I mean if if you can get that threeman rotation on those two spots on the four five youre in pretty good shape Henderson cannot complete the threepoint play It is a fivepoint lead for Clemson Great feed and the tip in Theres our guy Mr Welling He averages 10 He has 10 And were 11 minutes into the game I wonder how long Miami is going to stay with this zone because Clemson is scoring against it very easily Henderson a rare three and again very few offensive rebounds and thats the name of the game for Miami especially with them shooting a low percentage in this game Tom but uh also I mean my its been very tough for them I talked about getting into the paint its been toughs built a wall out there and when you watch that guy coach practice and if you werent with us a couple of minutes ago Mike talking yesterday we were here And conservatively 70 of the time spent on defense And Brown L said Look thats a deal We bring guys in We tell them you might be a great offensive player but if youre not playing at both ends you aint playing Yep And uh you know the thing I loved about yesterday is that he um balls stay here During practice on the bench he would have guys come over and sit there and he would talk to him in practice as if it were a game communicating information situations Yeah I thought it was great Yep Wide open Buckner that is a 43 already in this game for the Clemson Tigers a team that shoots just 33 on the year and Buckner 18 So a guy that youre definitely going to challenge How about that defense Goodness gracious by Hunter And then he dribbled the ball out of bounds I think hes saying the ball was tipped out of bounds but I dont think hes going to win that argument Turn those into points And the point you made we were in the timeout We came in you mentioned it Miami shoots 50 The 50 they miss they get 40 of the offensive rebounds That numbers way down early on today Well so far in the game 33 shooting only 25 of the offensive rebound Those are great trends for the Tigers Renew I tell you what then if you can get him to sell for that shot thats thats a win defensively Donaldson has still not scored in the game and a rebound to Clemson after a offensive rebound during that set Closing in on 711 to go here in the opening half and Miami back to a manto man Godfrey lost his footing nearly turned it over able to get it to his buddy Hunter And thats a bump by Washington coming back I mean hes hes front and center in everything theyre trying to do And a quick takeaway Donaldson one on two and had it rejected by Davidson but Henderson cleans up the mess Well you could see it Donaldsons starting to get a little hungry to score and get into this game offensively They go back to that zone Yep And then Washington picks up his second foul here in the last two minutes Fourth on Miami Welling was the one who really hurt them you know against that zone You know we havent talked much about Jay Lucas Youre familiar with him Hes been an assistant under John Shire the last four years at Duke Was with coach Caliperry at Kentucky Rick Barnes and Shaka Smart at Texas Really you know just a a high quality guy I knew his dad I know his dad really well John texted back and forth with him last night Oh my And you were talking about the size of Mr God There he was right there No but Jay a really good pedigree is really trained under some good coaches and known as one of the premier recruiters in the country Heres the look Get inside the the look and you can see nobody along the baseline Everybody spread out Dooride has to or Altunis had to come into the drive and that just left a wide open lane inside Lead back to 10 Were just under six minutes to go in the opening half Sold out here at Little John Coliseum in Clemson Thats a force three it looked like there But another offensive rebound this one by Renu and he sticks it back in He has six One of three players Only three have scored Each of the three has six Well and now all of a sudden theyre starting to get on the offensive glass get second chance opportunities You have Renew has six Henderson has six Allen with a couple of threes with six Six different players have scored for the Tigers Godfrey in traffic and Henderson has his hands in the air saying Are you kidding But I think they got Renew for the foul And if it is thats number two on Renew Yep And I would imagine hes coming out of the game for the final 522 of the half Well its interesting that that Jay Lucas will play with two personal fouls more than a lot of coaches in the league Hes got a little higher percentage in that You know some Brad Brownell its an automatic You get two youre out applause News Nation Tuesday Katie Pavlet sits down with President Donald J Trump one year into his second term Prime time exclusive interview Dont miss it Katie Pavitz tonight Tuesday 10 Eastern 9 Central NewsNation To find it go to news nowcom Renew did get substituted four out during that dead ball Godfrey has six Two of two at the line You got a physical Miami team out there but not a very tall one on the floor especially with Renew out of the game Outside of Washington the rest of these guys here are built like linebackers Another takeaway Twoon one Aliufo tried to get a little cute but look what happened He got it back and missed a layup Thats been a problem for Clemson all year long missing easy layups And then Henderson off the glass and will go to the line You know there are points when you you cant go for style points and you just have to be good with the basketball And uh that just really unselfish play by Washington to give that up He might have gotten a call on that if he had tried to make the the attempt but you know youre out on the break Get the two You know I understand about getting the crowd into it throwing a lob And cheering um nice start to this one for the freshman Shelton Henderson He has nine to lead All scorers in the game are on the Miami side Welling has 10 for Clemson Yeah Porter was the one who tried that alioop and then he committed a foul at the other end Wide open three for Hawkford out there cheering Thats five of them Buddy Johnson and you know what And and both coaches said you know what if were hitting threes you know so be it in five of nine 56 Boy a really nice defense that time by God Alfred against a Sometimes its good to be a senior going against a freshman You remember those days Oh yeah In this building guy named Tree Rollins Tree just got out of coaching He was in the league of course for a long long time had a triple double at my expense He did for my freshman year Yeah 10 blocks How many were you About seven I was up in the Raptors here at Clemson in a tree with a picture with tree I felt very honored and and it was not they took it down Knowing you were coming back here today Im surprised that they just didnt photoshop me out of it How about that defense by Dylan Hunter Ninth turnover already for Miami Couple of strong individuals right there And Godfrey comes up short banging with Henderson And Henderson coming back the other way cheering And then Henderson turns it over got caught up He went up in the air as a passer and didnt have any outlet Johnson hit a three a minute ago Not this time Were down to 315 and counting until halftime Its been all Clemson Tigers so far Washington cant find the basket now 0 of five in the game And Miami just two out of 12 from downtown so far in the game Theyre not a great threepoint shooting team to begin with Well and if you know for Clemson yeah its been a huge part of their offense in the first half but they cant fall in love with the three Theyre not that good of a shooting team Bill the native of Israel checks into the game for the first time Henderson Nice jump shot Henderson has 12 in the game Hes singlehandedly keeping Miami in this thing These members of his team and and Jay told us that he felt like being a coach with no track record thats what he had to offer He talked about coach Shier his attention to detail another young you know relatively young head coach But great offensive set coming out of the timeout but a rejection And the shot clock and then what do you have 39 something like that against Carolina Yep Clemson has not scored in the last 2 minutes and 40 seconds You made the point in the timeout It feels like Clemsons dominated the game but Miamiys hanging in there Yeah if you just watch if youre just watching the action out there you know it looks like the Tigers are have dominated this Shots got to go up Shot clock down to two And here comes Donaldson who still has not scored and hes the Kanes leading scorer Take away cheering How about that move Oh my goodness Itll count That is goending How about that spin move by Justin Porter Oh my And this has been you know there have been a lot of unforced errors for Miami but right in the right place at the right time Porter just so very fast with the ball And Lucas rolling the dice a little bit here bringing Renew back for the final minute 40 He looked statistically you look at pretty two foul participation and hell hell roll with it a little bit Especially you know you got Rayu whos an older player guy a little more experienced The freshman you may not trust with that Renu two years at Indiana played for Mike Woodson there Woodson was fired by the Hooers and Renew here Great feed into Davidson Boy what a game its been for Carter Welling And how about that unselfishness Had a great look at a three but saw better two 45 ticks remain cheering until halftime Renewed double team That was very close to being an offensive foul Clemson ball cheering Theres a look Good high low action It was interesting that uh Davidson was the guy out on the perimeter of the last game against BC Now its Welling outside Davidson inside You know you talked about that threeman rotation they have and those two guys out there playing very well together And thats after Wallen had to leave with a couple of fouls Yep Seven different Tigers have scored in this game Only three different hurricanes have scored About a 9second differential Shot clock game clock Oh they left him alone and a rare miss 11 seconds to go Miami with a ball and Washington finally got one to go down and thats the way the first half will come to an end Crew Washington averages 13 while Lean starts the second half for Clemson He has two There were only a total of eight fouls called in the second half They go right down to the red hot man from the opening half Carter Welling And Renu gets his third personal foul with less than 12 seconds gone in the half Heres the look And uh he just you know got caught on the backside with two feet in the paint So all of a sudden now Jay Lucas is hes pacing around Hes taking a poll of his assistant coaches on what to do here Tomorrow CW womens basketball North Carolina going to Florida State Thatll get underway at 2 Eastern 11 Pacific only on CW You know a lot of times we talk about coaches what they do at end of games but recognizing right away the first 12 seconds of the half to go right after Renew Yep And uh you know you got a guy whos playing well offensively so you feel good about giving him that chance That is just excellent coaching by Brad Brownell Thats not a surprise The lefthander short Pretty good defense by Hunter that time getting a hand up on the shot Porter lays it off for God for you know its going up and in Yeah hes come back with that hook a couple times inside Its going to be interesting Tom You talk about the lack of fouling No team got into the bonus in that first half See if free throw shooting becomes more of a factor in the second half That might have gone either way too But its an aggressive play by Renu with three personal fouls What are you watching And you could see he looked around quickly to see where that whistle was going to as well Godfrey cant believe it Uday did not score in the first half He did have eight rebounds Heres Washington for three And thats backto back off the iron Had good looks Yeah And that was uh the first one a little you know had it was contested but that is as good a look as hes gotten this afternoon Going to work on Renew trying to get his fourth Well and you know its interesting I mean no double team help coming down for Renu with that foul issue letting him play oneonone Lets see if Donaldson puts it up here Nope Going to lay it off Henderson Lenu for three Well hes got a nice stroke And you know its funny Its not a a huge part of his game Lets go Tigers He shoots about 35 Thats better than their team But you know this for most of those guys I mean they they do their work We talked about it inside the ark Godfrey had it blocked And thats a a jump ball And possession error will give it to Miami Theyre really trying to isolate down around the basket here the first couple of minutes of this first half second half Yeah but that time youve got a guy whos not in foul trouble in UD who can who can be of more physical a presence inside Here you have Donaldson who averages 17 a game and true Washington who averages 13 Washington scored at the end of the opening half and Henderson has been the guy for Miami today He has 14 He has really stepped up and I you know love the fact he shoots a little floater there Doesnt bring the uh charge into play Good hands by Renew but hes telling his head coach hey you know lets lets maybe take a look at this Well and you know its a little different from when I played Tom that the coaches in the back can look at a video to see if thats something they should be challenged or not And you know with with I mean look theres 17 minutes left in the game Yeah You dont youre not going and thats what with the change in the rule and you know thats what they found that youre going to sit on youre going to sit on those especially in a game like this until the end Hunter left all alone and makes him pay Thats his first basket of the game He averages nine Boy balanced scoring to say the least Eight different players have scored in this game for Clemson Only four different players have scored for Miami Renu into the paint In and out He was looking for a whistle Three quarter He did picking up the foul that time and uh you know but really Godfrey did a nice job crossing the lane being active and forcing the hold But Johnson will come in for Wall Was played the first four minutes nearly of this half with two fouls and not picked up a third And you you know you keep waiting in this game I do for Clemson to stretch that lead out Um theres theres been an opportunity the last couple minutes to get it to 1516 Heres a man of the day so far Got his own rebound Well there was nothing that Renu could do He was just standing there He didnt pick up He didnt want to pick up his fourth Carter Welling has 14 points He averages 10 Hes uh hes one rebound away from a double double too Good patience under the basket that time from Renu Ridiculous Boy talk about some heartbreak though up in Virginia Tech for some of the losses that theyve suffered this year Unbelievable The other night yeah Poopy Miller did the three Renu now with 10 He averages cheering double that and 11 Hes going to come out of the game So this an opportunity right now if youre Clemson maybe try to stretch that lead out a little bit and Miami counters with the press for the first time So well mark that down He leaves at the 535 mark with Clemson in front by 10 Renu headed to the bench with three fouls Left hand and wouldnt go and Henderson had it gets it to Allen who will throw it down at the other end Boy is that the first real breakout basket that weve seen from Miami 5 minutes into the second half But like you said Mike Jinsky they just continue to hang around just when you think you know maybe the knockout blow is coming They get a couple of quick baskets They got two free throws now a takeaway and theyre down by eight with a 20point scorer on the bench Its going to be a foul on Allen Thatll be his first Here we finally take a look at the speed and actually it was the tip out That was the first pass Good look ahead right there And just quick transition offense Boy Henderson is going to be really Well him and Allen theyre both freshman from the Miami area How about that Inbounds and then missing a dunk is Davidson Allen for three Very fortunate that there was just a miscommunication on underneath out of bounds Bodies got locked up there and no foul Turnover by Clemson And it looks like Welling may have rolled over on his ankle or maybe has a cramp Not sure which Looks like a cramp I dont know Heres the look He got He got sealed and just good It was a just U was a release that time on the front and Welling trying to walk it off over at the end of the Clemson bench to our right Well that could be a huge blow for the Tigers If hes unable to get back out there Donaldson is back out there Checked out of bounds by Miami Turnover Another unforced error for Miami 13 turnovers on the game now but a bunch of them have just been miscues unforced Well for those old school ACC basketball fans and there are many of you out there how good was Jay Lucas dad at Maryland back when the Turks of course were charter members of the Atlanta Coast Conference in Lefty Brazil And John Al lefty himself but such a dynamic guard Um you know you call him the point guard but back then guards were guards and an allAmerican in two sports as a tennis player as well And now just down in Houston doing great work in the recovery Oh you know all about it Mike Youve been through it yourself Yeah And uh you are going through it yourself Yeah And hes been fabulous with me and uh texted John last night Hes hes just thrilled about his son getting this opportunity Gosh what a player he was Man Oh man Oh man Tom McMillan Yep Some there were some great battles back into Lenny Elmore and some of those Maryland teams And how about that cheering falls in Yeah that hit the flange and died But thats definitely a Clemson bounce right there or lack or a lack of bounce Yeah you go back to that epic 74 ACC tournament final NC State Maryland one team was going to the tournament Its what a lot of the you know younger generation they forget Uh there wasnt you know six seven eight teams from a conference If you won the tournament you got in And you know there are a lot of people tell you those were the two best teams in the country that year NC State wound up winning the national championship and Maryland didnt even go to the tournament No And Carolina was one of the top 10 teams in the country as well So you got three of those and and two of them were going to go home There are a lot of things about you know college sports now you can say arent as good I think this is much better now where multiple teams get a chance to go Henderson gosh is he strong 1240 to play and Clemson in command trying to add to this 11point lead Renault is going to come back into the game Whistle against Miami So he left They were down 10 He comes back Theyre down 11 roughly three minutes later So they survive if anything that stretch with him on the bench Tell you I think you know we talked about Clemsons bigs They are really good passers Uh you know especially when theyre out on the floor feeding the post or looking for each other You know the other thing you brought up last week and and you and I were talking about it quite a bit How about that move right there by the youngster Ace cheering ace in the hole Well we were talking about the bounce pass you know and Clemson really focuses on using utilizing the bounce pass more than a lot of other teams Ive seen Yeah Fewer hands in the way much softer when it comes up easier to catch A offensive foul And thats number four on Renew cheering Well at this point Mike I mean you have 12 minutes left to go Youre down 13 Hes going to come out But you know what Heres the thing And boy that he he really sold that call You know for for Reno you youve got to youve got to know what your situation is He brought the charge into play there You know maybe be a little less aggressive Look for jump shots How about that A transfer from Utah W applause Well we saw Welling go out We got a second guy stepping up Am Clemson is taking it to Miami And the thing that Miami I think has to do is really slow the game down cheering attack the basket see if they can stop the clock get to the free throw line 15point lead with 1130 to go Henderson he is singlehandedly kept him in the game Literally almost half their points 17 of their 38 One problem Miami has is theyve got six team fouls So one more Clemson shooting free throws Well theyve had had two guys step up in this game but so far cheering its happened Well and a dunk a moment ago now nails a three And Donaldson has still not scored for Miami I mean until Nope still hadnt scored cheering And this will be a media timeout cheering 1038 to go Talked about Miami coming in with a 10 and be best of friends Great stuff Congratulations my friend I know youre so excited So excited Two days ago just born So uh yeah just its great being a grandfather Im really really happy for you We were just talking during the timeout the trio of Renew Donaldson and Washington average 51 points combined per game 51 That trio has 13 through 30 minutes of this game You know you might think one of them would have a really off game but to have all three of your primary scorers be underperforming like that its almost impossible to overcome handy has just when hes decided hes going to the hole hes not been stopped Donaldson and theres his first basket of the game Transfer senior started his career at Auburn Played a couple of years there Then last season started every game for the Big 10 champion Michigan Wolverines been around winning programs A little extra there by Henderson Im surprised that he didnt maybe get teed up They had already whistled him for a foul and he basically draped that body in his arm all over Davidson Theres the look The foul was right there Yeah its I dont know They It didnt look as bad the second go around Well Henderson has certainly shown up to play today Freshman out of Houston Texas In fact went to Bair High School the same high school where Jay Lucas went Reneu coming back into the game down by 15 Yeah I mean really no other choice for Jay Lucas at this point to you know he picks up fifth He picks up the fifth Miss free throw there by Davidson and the lead stays at 15 Missing on the front end of the oneonone doesnt help the cause Renault in now You know you were starting to talk about how you know all three of those guys have been off Uh I imagine a tremendous amount of credit has to go to this great Clemson defense Absolutely And and the fact that theyve kept this team in the half court and made virtually every shot difficult Miami averages 87 points per game and sitting on 40 with 842 to go Had two in the first half He just now picks up his third And you know and what did Brad Brownell talk about yesterday Defend without fouling And uh Tigers have done that in this game The attention to defense defense defense by head coach Brad Brownell and a three coming off the bench by Noom Draat Yeah And just uh Jay Lucas looking for somebody to generate some offense and Doat a very good threepoint shooter And then Dorra gets his hand in there and takes it away Yep Good dig in U getting the offensive rebound and hell go to the free throw line Thats a way you can try to get back in this thing Yeah And again you know just Miami not going away Showing some life on the bench So theyre down 12 but UD the last couple of seasons at TCU for the Horn Frogs Came out as a fivestar recruit did O day when he went to Kansas Your favorite board games Now your favorite TV show Catch all new episodes Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson Thursday 8 Eastern 7 central right here on the CW You know its its a little early and he makes both of them Um but its a little early to go offense for defense with a guy Yeah I mean thats what youre going to see at the end of the game with him because of his free throw shooting Steps up and knocks down a couple there Renew on the floor He has four fouls for the Hurricanes Were under eight minutes to go and a 10point lead for Clemson And a turnover How about do second steal hes had in the game and all of a sudden its getting a little interesting Sure is Donaldson his second basket lead down to eight 727 to go Miami on a nine nothing run They were on the verge of the knockout punch by the Tigers but not so not yet Thats a strong drive to the basket But there will be better days ahead He is a talented player Welling three of three from the free throw line Came in just a 65 shooter His third school in three years Started at UC Irvine Played at Utah Valley last year for the WAC regular season champions And hell have this year and next year to play here at Clemson Well good to see him back too Was I dont know if there was a cramp or what the issue was with him where he had to leave the game for a while but gets a big lift back for the Tigers Henderson just bulls his way to the basket Hell go to the free throw line And thats what thats what Miami has got to do Thats got to be their mindset Its his fourth 16 four on Wallapple screaming Well and Tom you know the thing you talked about too I mean with the foul issues for Clemson theres not a lot of drop off at all when they substitute parts in for one another Yeah theyre just so deep and You know how many teams can do what we brought up earlier in case you missed it what Brad Brownell told us yesterday where you know I got three big guys I dont have a sevenfooter I dont have a guy rejecting seven eight 10 shots a game but I do have a situation where theyre all three good players If one gets in foul trouble or has a bad game we are not necessarily in trouble Well and thats the philosophy too defensively is to real that first line of defense is really tough Um you know they they really make you work if youre going to try to get into the lane area All right Eightpoint lead Were down to 630 left Godfrey walked and now Miami a chance to get closer pick up his foot 11 turnover the game Yeah Miami doing a better job taking care of the ball in the second half Clemson a little careless Yeah Clemson really takes care of the ball Averaging just nine turnovers per game cheering Big trip here for the Hurricanes And Im not sure thats a shot they wanted They get to the offensive glass and off the mark and looking for the foul right there was Dock Yeah youre going to have to play through that But uh Udy again getting the uh getting the recycle on you know Miami not able to take advantage of the second chance opportunity U 13 rebounds in the game He has averaged 13 rebounds a game his last five And he doesnt have to do a ton of scoring to have a big impact for this team Little fade away Rattling it in is Justin Porter Transfer from Middle Tennessee State Two time allconerence USA performer Third Tiger in double figures in the game You just want to see Porter even things out a little bit Tom You look at the last five games coming in 9 21 7 26 five Yep You know if you can just if you can level that out right around the 11 12 13 mark um coaches like consistency Tell you one thing he has done and he talked about it during the Christmas break is he has really bought in on this defense cheering His last two games he had five steals four steals and you know defense wasnt necessarily his mo but Brownell told him over Christmas break said Look we need you on the floor and youre only going to be on the floor if youre going to guard people He seems to get his hands on everything Well that was talk about buying in That was sort of a nonnegotiable point by Brad Brownell Im sure it wasnt a you know wed prefer you to play some defense the the blame violation Yeah theres not a whole lot of uh suggestion things for Brad Brownell And thats the thing too that people dont realize when you get upper classmen who are transferring you you transfer into a program from a program where youre scoring and dont have to worry so much about that to this program where it is and its a transition regardless of how young or old you are Miami has really picked up the defensive pressure certainly here in this second half but were down to the fiveminute mark and its a 9point Clemson leading for its ninth win in a row And here come the Hurricanes Going to pull this one up Its going to be against Welling and that is the 18 foul So Uday who we told you was 18 for 40 from a line on the year coming into the game He just did two in a row a moment ago Haken Uday Well if he starts making them Yeah well see Can he make three in a row Sure Yeah thats the front end of that one and one This is you know with with Renew out of the ball game they have to have him on the floor Tigers Tigers trying to get it downstairs Back door cut Little pull up fadeaway jumper cheering and it goes down for Dylan Hunter You know theres been nothing forced about his game at all I mean hes very much the leader of this team Brother Chase a great player here cheering Just been an off night for Trey Donaldson Its all there is to it And give the Clemson defense much of the credit Theyre that good on defense This Clemson team a year ago went 27 and seven Now nobody is playing that saw much playing time last year Hunter thats the one guy that did get broke his hand You may remember ACC tournament and man they are feeling and Miami says stop the very tough to beat Yeah Well theyre tough to beat anyway Yep Off to a great start so far this season at 15 and three In their losses you look to who theyve lost to early on against Georgetown on the road They knock off Virginia in an overtime thriller They lost against ranked teams in Alabama and then BYU Threepoint game And Henderson has really been the only bright spot Youre talking about a team that scores 90 points a game Yep And had to struggle to get barely halfway there or half over halfway there And now looking to trap at every turn and a foul cant believe it Going to go against I think Goatra Do I beg your pardon And so Justin Porter will go to the free throw line Porter has 11 in the game He is an 82 free throw shooter Tell you what was impressive to me too is they its alumni weekend here for for Clemson and to see the number of guys who came back was fabulous I mean amazing from every decade back to the cheering 50s Yeah I mean they just kept parading out and I was wondering when that line was ever going to end I mean think about that They have players here from a decade still alive and still cruising along from a decade of the 1950s Dale Davis was here today Probably the biggest name of the group here today Well and you know bittersweet for him with his uh teammate Elvin Campbell being honored Yeah for those of you perhaps not old enough to remember when Campbell and Davis played on that 8990 team it was the only time in Clemson history where they had two allameans on the same team and that was a team that went to the Sweet 16 All new episodes Trivial Pursuit are coming to CW this Thursday To celebrate we have some trivia for you Which former University of Miami basketball star was also a fivetime NFL Pro Bowler Jimmy Graham Trivial pursuit Thursday 9 Eastern 8 Central cheering You know this is a its an easy game when you have the answer right in front of you on the card Very easy Thats what I try to do Well you talk about that team going to you know 36 and then Yukon showed up with that heartbreaking loss up in the Medallands And of course it was Yukon who got him a couple of years ago Well got Miami a couple of years ago under Jim Largo when he got to the final four And how about David took a bump and still kissed it home Really like this trio big guys for Clemson Tell you this kids had a nice game Allen hes had a real nice game Well he had the one three early that almost lit a spark He has two threes in a game Hes got eight points He averages six But another freshman with just a great body Very strong physically A lot like not quite as big as Henderson obviously I dont know who he is Shot clock at three What a feed Are you kidding me Porter to Carter Welling and another timeout on the floor A minute 40 left and a 13 receivers Great hands inside I mean you look at all the numbers We brought up before the game ever started Seven different players have led Clemson in scoring this year in the game Six different players have led him in rebounding Ace Buckner is the only player on the team and he doesnt play all that much to lead him in scoring and rebounding in the same game And thats a you know Brad Brownell saw this and in preseason publications he said our strength is the team I mean this is you know is is there going to be one guy They they may not have they probably wont have one guy whos going to be all league on this team but as a union of Virginia used to be like that with Tony Bennett Who do you select Well theres nobody cheering with eyepopping numbers Same thing with this group All they do is win U meanwhile three of four at the free throw line Godfrey will head to the bench Uday by the way has 15 rebounds That matches his season high We told you hes averaged almost 14 rebounds per game the last five games Actually was uh was in the portal thinking about Duke and decided Jay Lucas took him down to Miami with him Coral Gables not all that hard to sell No you no cell Just just show up Thats all we want you to do Just show up on campus Well take care of the rest We are down to the final minute Shot clock at seven Not going to fall And here come the Hurricanes the other way 50 seconds to go and scooped up and in by Washington And Miami calling a timeout down by nine 46 seconds left Im not They had an opportunity against Vanderbilt earlier this year that they didnt take advantage of Final 45 seconds Fullourt pressure Foul on Henderson will send Davidson to the line And Im thinking that Jay Lucas just uh situationally looking at things Although Clemson not a great free throw shooting team Well solid at 73 But Davidson missed the front end of a one and one a moment ago He shoots it at 75 Back in Godfrey will come in for Davidson The one team with the 18 games in the conference that Clemson does not play this year is Virginia Theres a take away and I would imagine they will not foul now Yep Paul off Good result for the home team on alumni day in Clemson Yep I mean this is a very very impressive win for the Tigers Miami came in redhot scoring at 87 plus per game Clemson rock solid defense under the tenure of Brownell and they deliver the goods on defense today Yeah And you hold this Miami team under 60 points You played a little defense for 40 minutes Well theyre going to say that that was a shot clock violation And thats where this one will come to an end Final count a 10point victory for the Clemson Tigers Their ninth win in a row This is
