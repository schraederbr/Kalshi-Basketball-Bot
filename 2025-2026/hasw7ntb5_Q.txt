his son Braden and also a freshman Jaylen Harelson to provide some scores Thats their big three Its going to sound easy The more shots they make early theyre in the ball game to control tempo If they miss early it could be very interesting Tout and Fu get us started This is Brady Kaylor another freshman in the lineup for Notre Dame Carson Tout doesnt score much but does a lot of the dirty work And theres a foul off the ball against Michael Brown Itll be his first First on Louisville Weve got a terrific crew on the whistle tonight Doug Sh Many Final Fours under his belt Don Daly and also Jeb Hartness Normally youd be mad at a foul like that West but after watching shoot around this morning hearing Pat Kelsey say be disruptive early in this ball game early Here is Serta off the screen out front Five to shoot Now Harelson Two to shoot Looking Jaylen Long two is good spins around and drops in for the freshman from Anderson Indiana Yeah he gets the roll Teammates remind him shot clock violation in play Knocks it down Louisvilles crew gave up an easy layup Heres Conwell slashing to the bucket on his first try of the night And Kaylor the rebound for Notre Dame This is an Irish lineup theyve employed for the fifth time this year Hard drive by Harelson F pulls away the rebound Its a lineups gone just one and three for Micah Shrewberry Got a win against Boston College And we told you about the loss at Carolina the double overtime set back to Virginia And the Cards have missed a couple of point blank shots Heres Braden Shrewberry Tout slips the screen Skips to the corner Sertas first shot of the night is good Cole Certas 47th three of the year and its 5 nothing Notre Dame I like Touts patient though See where the double teams coming You find that shooter in the corner ready Locked and load knocks it down Irish open in the man Heres a lob and a catch by Fu Sandanda Fu the junior from Berlin in Germany has the cards first points I like how he kept the ball high for young men at home Dont bring that ball down low to the little guys to scrap at it Keep a high strong finish Harelson against Hadley who poked it away Heres Serta from deep Early early heat check Yes indeed Im not mad at you young fell Im not mad at you Yeah the least angry guy in the building is you F McNeely Hadley again And heres the dangerous Ryan Conwell McNeely a three from the front Oh that spins right out Isaac McNeely averaging less than 10 in his last three games but his sixth in the in conference play in the ACC Dennis at 35 from behind the line That got kicked away and Jeff Hartness will hit the whistle Well thats the fun part about Louisville They know who they are Theyre going to take a lot of threes but I thought it was very interesting Coach Kelson said we still got to take smart threes The last couple games theyve been taking some bad threes early 23 24se second shot on the shot clock Early sub here for Pat Kelsey and Kenny Roose who has really been a nice spark for the Cards And Harelson to travel against Kai Roose And there is the sophomore from our nations capital So you know he had a double double on Saturday against uh SMU You know where Im going right Hes a DMV guy You know the DMV guy Somethings in the water baby Yeah every laughter Thank you Kevin Durant But you dont let the DMV guys get a breath Got to give my guys love Yeah I understand all of you Brown and turns it over He had four quick turnovers on Saturday against SMU and finished with five in the ball game Heres Serna Lost it on the dribble for Harelson Louisville switching everywhere arent they Thats an offensive foul and thats on Carson First on Tal first on the Irish Yeah you got to get there and little dribble hand off and hes kind of Oh yeah His hands are leaving his body Thats easy call Like Tal was pass blocking for Marcus Freeman laughter McNeel And here comes Garrett Sundra Sundraes into the lineup 611 sophomore Ashman Virginia Another one Hes into the lineup He played in that terrific Paul the 6th program out of high school Boy that program solid Mhm Want a state title should have had Patrick Gungba Darren Harris of Duke along with Sundra Here is Adrien Woolly He lost the handle on it Recovers goes right back to the basket against Kaylor And then Roose had it blocked on the backside I think that was Kaylor again Four to shoot A three from Conwell Kept alive by Kaylor Young freshman fighting inside Oh yeah its a big time defensive possession by Notre Dame fighting rebounding being scrappy Irish still with an early threepoint lead here Shrewberry Sundra thought about it Five to shoot Heres Serta in a double team Back for Shrewberry Hell attack Floater Yes Oh danced around and dropped in First bucket for Braden Shrewberry He had a little butter on that one He got the roll baby Feels like Louisvilles trying to turn up Notre Dame though Three from the front Well I said earlier Coach Kelsey talked about being disruptive So far Notre Dame getting what they want Ali Khalifa on the floor He replaced Pru Heres Shrewberry back for Sundras three How about Garrett Sundra and the Irish off to a terrific start We asked Coach Shrewsbury Are you any concerned about uptempo He goes No if were making shots were defending Lets play basketball So far its exactly what he told us Be a foul on the deck as we go to the timeout but Notre Dame couldnt have asked for a better start No theyre making shots early Theyre defending Theyre attacking the paint Shbury with the roll and youre sharing the basket would consider practice by any stretch of the imagination And thats a storyline for Micah Shrewsbury because number one Burtons his best player Js his most experienced guy 3D There it is J knows the culture So you have your culture guy out and a guy that brings it every night to kind of get you ignited Now different guys have to step up McNeely and Notre Dame in a bit of a zone here out of the timeout Kobe Rogers on the floor That ball got kicked with five to shoot And so with those two gone here are your three principles Thats your big three right there I dont care if its 17 13 or 12 13 whatever that is All three guys must play well and have an impact on the game if Notre Dame wants to be competitive the rest of the season New 20 after the kick on the Irish So Kobe Rogers McNeely Adrien Woolly Kai Roose Ali Khalifa on the floor for the Cards here McNeely launches and hits Foul the rebound Yep After the bucket and a foul called on Sundra McNeely took one of these shots earlier West the second one says yes It goes down So the foul on Sundra his first Notre Dame quickly has three team fouls Got to be careful there Heres a lobbing catch by Roose up in a double team and one Kai Roose and thats another foul on Sundra Im going use that word disruptive again Thats one of the plays they worked on a shoot around this morning But look how the picks were set properly and perfect pass in traffic Look how open is pump fake Get two guys off their feet Hear the whistle Get to the free throw line Three the oldfashioned way Can I Roose returned to the lineup on Saturday He had a double double against SMU He had missed the previous four games due to an illness Free throw rattles out They asked Roose after the game hows he getting his strength back He said I get to eat all the hamburgers I want laughter which is funny because thats kind of what 3D and I subscribe to a little bit when were on the road to keep our strength Yes indeed Nothing like a good burger laughter Yeah I think were a little old for that I know right in the corner A three ball away Harrelson Sundra had a crack at it Roose knocked it out Heres Serta fires right away Cole Certas got six on a pair of threes and Dennis Scott is very interested Well Cole Im going have to add you to my list of you have ice water in your veins Thats the kind of three that breaks your back after a long rebound You step right into it and shoot it That hurts Pushes the Irish lead back to six Khalifa And now McNeely whips it across for Willie And that is off the rim And Sundra playing with two fouls now has the rebound For a team thats lost two straight in seven of eight Notre Dame looks fairly comfortable here in the first 6 and 12 minutes Add confident to that as well Comfortable and confident playing the right way like coach Fbury talked about a shoot around this morning Make shots Be competitive on the defensive end So far there you go Turns it over to Brady Kaylor Look ahead for Shrewberry Hell love that pass Love that pass People dont understand the advancement of the pass early Defense on their heels Shooters are ready to shoot Knock it down Ninepoint lead for Notre Dame Bounce in the house Here goes Khalifa Yeah sorry Paul I know you can shoot it but Khalifa is too big for you down there Ask for help First field goal for Khalifa who averages almost six against the ACC Look at Kobe Rogers Chase Shrewsbury Serta against Woolly And Roose almost stole it Picks it up and hell flush it applause Canai Roose cheering Listen to the crowd Hes an energy guy Theyre awake now Theyre awake now applause cheering Cards trail five Serta hanging two Two strong and Louisville wants to run Woolly A three Back rim and Harelson clears And thats the one that coach Kelsey talked about You look at the shot clock theres still 25 seconds on the clock when you take that three Heres Kaylor from deep Barely got to the iron And a third foul on Garrett Sundra Gets us to the timeout Sometimes you got to get in the pass lane get some cookies and can s ice cream on top of it to get the crowd involved mention this He went through about a fiveminute kind of monologue with us today about good shot bad shot great shot Yes And as much as you think hes geared offensively they spent a lot more time on defense today in the shoot as Fu gets the dump I find their approach and all their culture very impressive And its going to get interesting cuz Louisville still got some meat on the bone with their ACC schedule Yes they do And Tal just traveling And thats why I was so impressed this morning with coach Kelsey seeing him up close hearing all the stuff from here taking a lot of threes But he did put a lot of emphasis on defense to shoot around and being disruptive I thought that was a key word to get the guys to understand that Notre Dame schedule or should I say records not great but they compete and thats what you have to be careful early in this ball game Yep Heres Mike El Brown to work against the freshman Kaylor And now Kase Prior off Kelseys bench here in the first half And out of bounds goes Conwell on the drive So a turnover by Ryan Conwell Now in the case of Prior he did not play the last three games Last time Cardinal fans saw him was a fiveminute run at Pit Pat Kelsey said after the SMU game he said players determine who plays I just coach the players that are on the floor Those are called earned minutes Prior earned some minutes there Thats it Heres Tal Good pass Logan IMS the catch Caleb hard drive Left hand fall away wont go And here is Conwell We talked about Ryan Conwell at the top He is scoreless so far in almost the first 10 minutes of play Looking for the bucket and has it Thats the one right there Great ball movement You attack the paint You kick it to the wing You make the extra pass You give up a good shot for a great shot Nine nothing run has tied the game at 16 Conwell leads the ACC and made threes per game at almost three and three4ers Come on people at home Look at this Few doesnt travel Swing Swing Comes right back to the guy who had initiated the offense Splash Second foul on Mike Brown a moment ago It is the second on Louisville and Browns going to stay on the floor with 957 to play Heres Sir Mohamd Young man from Charlotte out front Was that the finger roll Yep Ice man Gervins home smiling said go ahead young fella That looked nice Sir Muhammad whose dad played 23 NBA seasons

rebound Tried to get it back to Fu and did Hell skip McNeely over Mohamd The back breaker First lead of the night on the second triple of the evening for Isaac McNeely Offensive rebounding fighting for the loose ball to find McNeely wide open Sa cheering missed everything Close the window Wes heres Brown and he lost it out of bounds We always talk about it Wes Offensive rebound is key Good fight by F and McNeely You step right into it That is a back breaker off of offensive rebound Now on the flip side I was ready to give Cole some more love but someone left the window open on that air ball Coach said Come have a seat for a minute Gather yourself He quickly He quickly forgets the what The misses Remembers the makes There you go Is that the way it works for you guys Yeah Yeah I dont

Mohamed Back door to tal Heres Frost out of the corner Yes sir Ryder Frost 14th triple of the year He had 10 at Carolina Is on the board here tonight in Louisville And I tried to box out Rogers but Louisville got enough of it to give Conwell a second chance Heres Kobe Rogers cheering Prior Thats what he does well Keep it alive at the offensive end inside Zugurus had it blocked and a hell ball called that will give it to Louisville Nazi Mohamd and Vellis Zugurus from Greece end up under the hoop Louisville ball when we come back Barnum I thought this was flatbread month for you laughter right Sean Seans raising all that money in the Pacific Northwest for flatbreads I got a better one for what you put on that burger What kind of cheese did you use Okay Yeah Now here we go See I knew

in front of Zugarus who draws the foul Coming up after were done here tonight the Bill were going to go about 65 miles east on I64 and Tom Hart and Dane Bradshaw await you at Rup Arena for Oklahoma and Kentucky Thats game two of our double header tonight at 900 Little fullourt trap here by Louisville IMS attack it perfectly Yeah Logan IMS Heres Frost who knocked down the three a moment ago Mohamd will skip it back to him on the wing Four to shoot Sir Mohamd driving against McNeely too strong cheering Theville trailing two and Vellis Subarus is fouled And if thats on tout thats his third or his second Beg your pardon It is six on Notre Dame Its the second on the Northern Arizona lumberjack transfer Carson Tout Yeah tough play That angle Oh no So here is Velis Zugurus 68 junior from Paris Terry in Greece whos now nine of 14 at the line this year He is a 21yearold junior who did not play basketball Zugurus until he was 15 and then played in the Greek basketball league And they list him at 68240 And if Vigellis does not like basketball Im sure Jeff Braum the football coach here in Louisville would like a word I was wondering if he was coming play football Was there a gun show going around Well the way hes built he and Tout look like they ought to be up the road in Indianapolis in the combine Look at the size of those two cats And knocked out of bounds by Kobe Rogers Notre Dame leading a point here Harelson cheering double team on Mohamd Harrelson tried to get by Kai Roose Now heres Sir Mohamd a three Thats too strong Jaylen Harelson the rebound right back at

Shrewsbury the runner slapped out and last touched by Louisville Back to Conwells basket here Yeah I love my jump shoes but this time Conwell does not settle for the jump shot Gets to the rim Tout doesnt want to foul Hes got to drive Tout every time Every time Touts guarding somebody attack him Hes in foul zone Yep Sunder on the bench with three Touts got two And theres Brady Kaylor who does not play inside Thats the only kind of Notre Dame big left if you will Thats why the injury to Jai is so impactful And Jeff Hartness has ticketed Ruth with a reach Thats his first third on Louisville in this first half Lets see Crossover Oh I see a few cookies on that one Wes And I think the I think the fans may have this one right but coach does not challenge it Its fourth on the cards not the third cheering applause Yeah good That was good defense by him Theyre replaying the player on the go and every time it just gets a little bit louder Heres IMS tout the catch layup Good Carson touts first points Best play about that West The perfect bounce pass when your big guy can catch him and finish it Yeah Logan Ims Nicely done Irish back in front of point Woolly for Rogers And now heres Khalifa Nice bounce pass Adrien Willie Unselfish by Khalifa Had the mouse on him but saw the cutter to the basket Perfect pass again Serta back on the floor Thought about it Harelson lining up Conwell Shrewberry Tout rolled off the screen Back door pass Catch layup Harrelson I love what Im seeing by the Irish right here Coach Shbury called it this morning Run your stuff execute Make perfect passes So far theyre getting easy shots And back in front And heres Conwell shooting Louisville for the lead and couldnt hit it Inside five to go in the first half Heres Tal in traffic Had it knocked away Carson thought he was getting a foul No whistle Roose will spin and couldnt finish with the left hand Yeah good idea He saw he had a small guy on him attacking quick Just missed the layup Yep Shrewberry to the foul line Too strong And last touched by Tal It will belong to Louisville here Dennis Yeah move well without the basketball Perfect bounce pass for Tal to gather and finish And just good movement by the Irish once again Another back door cut perfect pass good finish I got to give Strawberry a lot of credit His offense has a lot of NBA feel to it You have staggers on the weak side of the floor Then you come out of it to a pick and roll to ISO and share the basketball and movement Yeah But are they giving up shots Are they bypassing looks A couple Okay But theyre giving up good shots for better shots Thats whats so impressive so far in this first half Willie Notre Dame still holding to the onepoint lead Fuse returned along with Mikel Brown whos got the rock intend to shoot Sizing up Harrelson for three and Sandanda Fu will grab the rebound and a hell ball will go to Notre Dame Crowd doesnt like that but theyre going to get a timeout to stew about it Notre been an interesting game Notre Dame ran off to an early 5 nothing lead Harelson Shrewsbury Serta have 15 of Notre Dames 25 All the box no checks so far Yeah And Sir Mohamd giving him some premium minutes off the bench Backing down Mike Brown And along the baseline goes Harelson Could not finish it Another great possession of moving without the ball He just missed the layup that time Brown digging in on Shrewberry here and Micah thinks that is a offensive foul on Brown the head coach Shrewberry Instead his son is called for his first and the seventh on the Irish Mike Brown And I must admit Im impressed that Mike El Brown was down there trying to post out Scoreless is the freshman from Orlando Fourth game back after missing about five weeks with a back issue And he was seven of 21 from three in the last three games coming in averaging 15 and a half points 14 assists 12 turnovers Its about a one to one here And theres no doubt theres an acclamation to coming back after a month and change right Well its coming back getting back in basketball shape But also too there were three or four of those turnovers where little lack of days the one hand left hand hook passes but sometimes you want to keep those cheering a good defense there by Louisville Hell ball going to send it right back to the cards And who was it Roots once again Yeah But back to Brown but we played first Good trap here Fullourt trap by Louisville High hands Dont foul Get in there Get your hand on it Thats just music perfect press right there But for Brown sometimes he gets a little careless with the basketball when he makes some of those passes I think thats where some people are a little hesitant on his passing skills Brown Heres Fu Oh gave up the short jumper for the three out of the corner Woolly inside Oh and Adrien Willie going to give Louisville a third crack at this SLIPS IT BACK DOOR AND ROOSE STUFFS it cheering through Kana Roose has got six in the first half Serta quickly to answer and theyre going to get a Louisville foul as Mohamad went down below the basket after the triple was off the mark Sometimes its the fourth effort to get the rebound and great pass and now Roose with the strong finish But now the Irish take the ball out of bounds and push it right away as you see the extra replay But I got to say it again Coach Spruberry has really coached a great first half here to these last couple minutes and now you know Louisville put that press they got the steal and got the score So heres Mohamd after the foul on McNeely and Sir misses the first one Dont forget Saturday its an afternoon and evening of NBA action on ABC Starts with NBA Countdown at 330 followed by Kevin Durant and the Rockets in Oklahoma City to take on the Thunder And then at night Luca Lebron and the Lakers host the Warriors at 830 presented by Lily on ABC and the ESPN app Sir Muhammad missed them both Just a 52 free throw shooter And there is Brady Kaylors second foul Thatll be the eighth on Notre Dame So that time Brown was perfect He drew the double team perfect pass for Fud to catch and now hes at the free throw line Perfect pass And heres Sandanda Fu 22yearold junior from Germany whos 63 at the line and the first one good Hes got five here in the first half He had 13 points and 10 rebounds against Virginia Tech but in his last two is only averaging about three and a half points and three and a half rebounds Well I love the big fellas shot preparation at the free throw line That looks smooth Fourpoint lead for Louisville Notre Dame in a danger zone here even though its only four points Yes cuz Louisville has mixed it up Manto man to fourpoint trap Harelson Oh what a pass Heres Mohamed Hard drive into the lane and scores Just as we say that they continue to tack move without the basketball and get a good shot Sir Mohamd cuts it to two Louisville with the ball and two minutes to go in this first half at the Yum Center tonight Terrific crowd as always in Derby City Good pass and through the catch and flush off the delivery from Mike El Brown See the difference One hand passes versus two hand passes Attacking and letting his big fellas get perfectly Back to a fourpoint lead Shrewberry thought about the three Blocked by Fu He recovered it Heres Serta Deep three and Woolly gathers it for the Cards Look at Woolly all the way through The Kennesaw State transfer applause And we get a stop here as Kase Prior and Ryan Conwell get into the lineup on the Woolly breakaway layup Did you get a sub I think the ball got knocked loose and before they put it in play they allowed him to go ahead and get the sub in So inside of 90 seconds left Half court trap Boy Pat Kelseys really mixed up coverages here Jason Prior back on the floor for a second time in this half Mohamd against Fu trying to drive it all the way through It got blocked Heres Prior ahead for McNeely Catch and shoot three cheering Isaac McNeelys got nine on three triples And Micah Shrewsbury wants a timeout He wants a timeout Hes not Browns got a couple of free throws You got a half dozen from Kana Roose whos also brought the defense with him tonight And thats what I like your point earlier Fullcourt trap half court trap Hes mixed it up to kind of get his guys going And thats how theyre getting transition buckets playing good half court defense and now holding uh the Irish to one of the eight to your point And Doug Sha has gone to the table here across the way So Matthew Mlen number 34 has checked in for Notre Dame I dont know that thats why theyre visiting the table Jeff Hartness will come here and so Matthew Mlen its a technical foul because Matthew Mlen was not in the scores book So Notre Dame will get the ball Its a procedure technical foul McNeely knocks down the free throw Hes got 10 in the first half Wait a minute partner Yes No it happens No no no no Wait no This is not AU No no it happens This is not high school I understand but it happen This is high

Louisville Final shot in this first half Conwell a three and the long rebound for Serta You know what hell do with it Hes going to drive it I like it The left hand Good finish Cole Sas got eight And from the midcourt line Conwell off the mark but Louisvilles going to take a sixpoint lead to the locker room D Youre taking this lead You get off to a slow here in this first half So thats why your defense saved you in that first half knowing that you take a lot of threes which they did 17 in the first half but your defense got you a sixpoint lead Heres Harelson with Tal Serta Shrewberry and Brady Kaylor a lefty three from the corner is clean Oh quick attack That trap was too soft that time by Louisville First points of the ball game for the freshman from Fisers Indiana Brown back out front Heres McNeely to work Baseline drive Many finds that alleyway for Brown to find him Fourth three of the night for Isaac McNeely Almost like he heard us talking about it Sixpoint lead for the Bill again So they trade threes Heres Tal to the basket Left it on the front of the rim Ruth starts this second half Good contest by Ruth that time at the basket Yeah Javon Hadley by the way left the game early and he is now out for the rest of the night for the Cardinals with a back issue He was kind of a game time decision when we started here tonight And down the lane goes Sernando Fruit 10 for Fruit Big fellas got his second double figure game in league play Dennis I like the way he rolls to the basket every time Theres Braden Shrewsbury Russ another rebound And Louisville has put together buckets in their first two trips And Fu going for the third They turned it over Oh nice look Harelson to Brady Kaylor Good job by the Irish making good defense into great offense Yeah keeping within

Notre Dame forces the steal Boy Jaylen Harlson got taken down on the dunk attempt And weve got a little post basket uh verbiage going on here but everybodys trying to get separated Yes as hes taking

Sernandanda Fu in the lineup for Pat Kelsey cheering Kelsey by the way is 236 against the ACC in the regular season Dennis Harelson misses the second one Tal battling inside with Khalifa and last touch by Ali Khalifa So it will stay with Notre Dame The interesting thing about Pat Kelsey hes 12 and three in his young career in home ACC games Two of the three losses this year Virginia and Duke really good And Brady Taylor how many times do we see that Not too often Catch in the corner and stepped out of bounds on the near side He started dancing before he dribbled Micah Shrewsbury Kind of

delivered on their own accord Theres Brown on a hard drive to the SC uh to the back basket Couldnt get that kind of reversed layup to go and now Sir Mohamd right back it through and had it rejected and recovered Terrific play by the big man from Germany through the catch on Mohamd Skip out front for Conwell High dribble scoop Couldnt score it Knocked away Nai Roose inside for Brown and a three and Fruit took it away from Garrett Sundra whos playing for the first time in the second half with three fouls Heres Roose and a foul on the Irish and I think its Logan IMS thatll be called for his first and the fourth on Notre Dame You give the Cards a lot of credit Theyre just beating the Irish up that last possession on the glass getting second and third opportunities And seemingly Notre Dame is at the number having a hard time sizing up if you will when Louisville sends one extra to the glass And heres Kai Roose to the stripe He had six in the first half and misses Hes 71 on the year Last year he averaged 14 15 minutes a game against the conference four points and three rebounds as a rotational piece If Javon Hadleys back situation cannot be resolved I feel like its Rooses job to fill that in Pat Kelseys order Another maybe even as soon as Saturday and Winston Salem theres a three out of the corner by Serge followed by Mohhamd is good Pat Kelseys dies two bullets there First time in the half court trap cold missed That time he had a wideopen three and he missed Yep But serve with the big time finish Brown up front for Conwell Halfway home in half two and Louisville leading by six And Brown has a three rattle out See Im not mad at the ISO but you let the big fell off the hook by shooting a jumper Attack him Attack the paint Create something easy for your teammates Serta gets Sander through here Very similar Take him into the now Get Kaylor a three And Sundra and Mohamd battle for it And Sir Mohamd dropped it right to Brady Kaylor Seven all in the second half for the freshman Took the page out of the card book that time You beat them up on the glass to get the second and third opportunity Yep Conwell for Fu and a block on Kaylor I believe on the whistle from Doug Sha Third on Kaylor five on Notre Dame Dennis well big time rebound here for the Irish Second and third effort You get the finish But one thing Ive liked about you hes very nimble with his feet as he rolls to the basket without walking and then getting fouled getting back to the free throw line Yep Well as weve traveled through the ACC this year the international influence is real Sander Fu just one of a couple dozen almost three dozen guys with international addresses who are contributing to the ACC this year Thats 11 for Fu after the first Very impressed Once again Big F has a soft touch from the free throw line So now hes not going to be a liability late in the game when things are tight You still can feed him rolling to the basket cuz hes making his free throws right on Q Four for four Come on You got to love that Now a little pressure in the back court again Tals got to get rid of it Heres quickly for Caleb and numbers Hell spot for three and miss strong Tapped out and out of bounds Itll belong to Louisville applause Yeah coach Screwsbury said No that time go ahead and drive that one Make the defensive commit We got another shooter over in the corner So Louisville would get it back and a sixpoint advantage Cards here in the second half shooting 47 Notre Dame shooting 40 from the floor Conwell off the screen Barely got it to the rim Roose in traffic Rejected Kaylor and stepped out of bounds Good job Kaylor being competitive that time Just assuming that Can make that shot Couple bounces Big time block right there You can see where 20 lbs wouldnt hurt Brady Kaylor Heres Fu on Tal and Carson Tout matched him every bounce See if the Irish can take advantage here Shrewberry runner right hand wouldnt go Tout the rebound Saved it to Sir Mohamd and a fresh 20 Right back into traffic Hell draw the Kobe Rogers foul Second on Kobe Rogers Six now on the free throws coming for the Irish And if youre an Irish fan youre okay The last three possessions youve gotten good looks you just missed them Yeah if you can make some free throws another stop youre right in the ball game How concerned are you if youre Pat Kelsey Youre throwing everything you got and Notre Dame wont back off here Theyre not backing off at all Theyre competing And Ser gets one of the free throws back So I say it again Iris keep attacking keep doing what youre doing but you got to make some of these open shots Now to your question Pat has to mix it up again defensively to take the Irish out of the rhythm Mohamd is 0 for three at the line or one for three tonight and now make him two for four So hes got eight in the ball game He had 15 against Miami Hes had three double figure games in conference play Fivepoint lead and the ball McNeely fire for Conwell Five to shoot here cheering And with one on the shot clock Khalifa and Doug Sh is going to call a foul here as we get to a break with 742 to go And its on Kase Prior Timeout the Yump Center Irish ball when we come back 3Ds got Jasper Johnson on Mark Popes bench Whoa You like Jasper dont you Oh yes sir Little energy guy Energy plays with confidence You see where we are here tonight The Yum Center before we send you to Tom Hart and Dane Bradshaw at Rup Arena Fivepoint lead for the Bill Seven and a half to go The foul by the way going to the break Oh my goodness Eight in the second half for Kase Prior Sometimes good to be lucky the ball to bounce right to you Only thing you have to do is lay it in And Carson Tout couldnt challenge it because he was ticketed with his third foul a moment ago going to the timeout Heres Harelson in traffic with the right hand Tout the rebound sevenpoint lead at 6154 Now heres Serta with a lot of white shirts around him Harrelson tried to get it to Kaylor and it belongs to the Irish Don Daly got some help from Jeb Hartness and theyre going to take a look at this I think Louisville has asked for the challenge the previous out of bounds Its being reviewed screaming And first look for the partisans here at the Yum Center 3D Yeah this one Yeah its pretty easy It shouldnt take long So you see a couple looks at it here and Marcus Shrewsbury is going to huddle up the Irish here and probably talk defense Get your defense set up Figure out what the what the clock situation is Lets get back to basketball Yeah Heres Doug Shir After further review the challenge has been upheld Its going to be beautiful So the Cards will have the ball I may be mistaken but it looked like Doug paused to talk to some of the partisans before he uh spoke into the microphone And Micah Shrewsbury seems okay with it to a certain degree All right So on we go Brown Priors got eight Hes had one double figure game this year 13 against Memphis in early December That featured three threes by the way Dennis And heres a three I thought he heard you He heard you Yeah laughter he knew you were sitting over here All right Iris can you get a couple buckets here and a couple stops to feel good about yourself here before we get under the threeminute mark Boy Shrewberrys been quiet Five first half points Very quiet Yep Haroldson with 10 to shoot away by Prior Heres Conwell with Shrewsbury to beat and one Terrific play by Ryan Conwell Well I love that play Youre playing good defense Prior to get the deflection Conwell being a lefthanded guy Prior with the deflection watch how he keeps the ball in his right hand the whole time down the floor and finish with his right That is big time basketball in transition right there folks Good deflection by Prior Give me those cookies Right hand dribble right hand drive get fouled keep the ball in the right hand the whole time as a lefthand player Thats phenomenal Seven for Conwell on his third field goal Not nearly the night from a scoring perspective cheering but he takes advantage of the great deflection by Casem Brown Now listen to the crowd 10point lead and under six to go and Zugris out to defend Tout in Louisvilles manto man Leaner by Serta rolled around and fell off Tout will try to make the save cheering Did to Kaylor He had to save it And this is Prior Look out and he turned it over to Shrewsbury Braden will drive and had a block by Cwell and then he threw it off of Shrewberry out of bounds Notre Dame has thought about challenging this Just a big time defensive play by Conway Conwell excuse me Oh Oh he threw the ball off Thats out of bounds Yep So Michael Shrewsbury does not challenge cheering and Prior has done his job tonight from an energy perspective You see the last half dozen games eight points Tonight eight points He had five DMPS in there too Like we said in the first half Pat Kelsey said players determine who plays Thats it Earn your minutes Serta all the way through and cannot buy the layup Yeah hes been cold here the last four or five minutes Just two wide open threes now Two little layups Woolly Zugurus and hell screen for Conwell cheering Skip it to Roose tonight Roose cheering has got nine and Louisvilles got their biggest lead of the night Youre aware of that Youve been driving around here the last couple days You Holy smokes I had to bring my snow boots Absolutely We We wouldnt have known if they have blueg grass or not laughter Weve seen all the grass weve seens covered in snow Yeah And we get a foul off the ball Don Daly the whistle Oh hes trying to shake hand by Zukurus just tried to shake Don Dys hand after the foul was called Sorry Mr F Great call Mr Ref Sorry sir Zugurus from Greece Now watch this Here we go Now what Good call Let me shake shake your hand Thank you very much sir Im sorry about laughter that That was a good call Town at the line Oh I told you Whoa Wait a minute cheering Carson Tout did not hit the rim Now Mr Tout I want to be nice to you but I dont think Ive ever seen that type of shot from the free throw line That was a break Ive seen the air ball but remember Michael Shrewsbury told you today were just going to resort to him banking it in It gives us a chance to get the rebound He sure did Thank you But its got to hit the rim There you go By the way that makes T on the year 17 of 39 at the line 3D Yeah send him to Atlanta Ill help him out Send him to Atlanta Heres Roose Oh good move with the left hand Oh he said hes too small with the left hand 11 for Canai Roose Hes got another double double tonight A dozen points and now 11 rebounds for the sophomore from Washington And one and one coming up here after a foul on Louisville will get us to a timeout Well coach Kelsey talked about shoot around He was proud of Kai Roose working hard being music ready to play The left hands alive You too small Can Roose another double double had one on Saturday against SMU As we said earlier if Javon Hadleys back situation cannot be sorted out between now and Saturday boy it feels like a big piece in number nine in the lineup at Winston Salem to see Wake Forest Well thats why this morning was pretty cheering key Another miss free throw by the Irish Jump ball Itll go to Louisville So we have not seen Javon Hadley since early in this ball game tonight by the way He is sitting behind the Louisville bench in the corner Hes not on the primary bench with the back issue that flared up And theres a foul on Serta as Conwell broke the timeline Thatll be the second on Serta Thats eight on Notre Dame So free throws coming for Louisville Dont forget well send you directly to Rup Arena when were done here tonight at the KFC Young Center By the way Saturday in Winston Salem its a 1200 noon game on ACC Network Its a bit of a homecoming for Pat Kelsey who was on Skip Proers staff in Winston Salem at Wake Forest Of course he played for Proer at Xavier He is a Cincinnati guy And the 49yearold will return to the Twin Cities on Saturday to bring his Louisville team to Winston Salem and see if they cant uh stack another win Theyre on the way tonight it looks like to their 16th overall in their sixth in 10 conference games Well thats why we said in the beginning of the game for the Irish Its going to sound simple but you made shots early you executed early you stayed in the ball game and as soon as you hit that cold spell the Cardinals started making shots They started pressing you and thats where the game is now And one thing we saw at Louisville tonight thatll send Forbes and his staff and for that matter Will Wade and his staff who were here Monday night next Monday night a lot of changing defenses tonight and a lot of different ways they played those defenses Heres Conwell on a turnover by the Irish Layup is good Seven and a half A dozen now for Conwell 14 nothing run by Louisville And off the ball whistle and a foul Number three Conwell And its the first of the night on Conwell That time ball just

Dallas Thats a big time performance right there Dimes and no turnovers None Not once in league play Yeah Thats special Sure is Its on the chart too Now I mean its like in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference Its on the list Its not at the top of the list Your man Chris Ciani Come on Yeah Fire Yeah Fire Nice He stacked them up Rodney Monroe one night Theres the drive by Brown and a foul 33 Well we told you at the top tonight that Notre Dame in order to have a chance here was going to have to get a performance from Harelson Shrewberry and Serta together And you see coming into the ball game averaging about 40 a game if you round up And you see 27 is the number right now And the free throw by Brown bounds away Yeah The Atlantic Coast Conference record after Copeland had 16 assists last night Chris Ciani had 20 in February of 1991 against Maryland in an ACC game Thats the most in an ACC game The ACC record is 20 Grayson Marshall the terrific guard at Clemson in the mid 80s who he also had 20 for the Tigers in a game against Maryland Eastern Shore in November of 1985 You know where hes from right Im sure the DMV Yes sir baby Gracious Marshall baby Another DMV guy Heres Serta

straight Theyre a game of below 500 and 2 and8 in conference play applause Cards kind of answered the bell a couple different times here tonight Dennis they have And once again Coach Kelsey mixing the
