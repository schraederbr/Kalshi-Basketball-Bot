If youre NC State you got to attack the offensive glass If there is a weakness for this NC State team it is on the offensive glass and youve got to create extra possessions being on the road Kind of a big underdog You got to give yourself more chances to score and win this game The opening tip controlled by NC State and Quadier Copeland The Pack 17 and six on the season 82 in conference play And theyve got the first bucket inside for McNeel cheering Great offensive set using McNeils threepoint prowess to get back door thinking that hes going to go out for the three ball Virginia Tech has not played in a week They played last Saturday at home against number four Duke and lost 7258 cheering Shot just 27 from beyond the ark Looking for an early three and they get it Bedford knocks it down for the Hookies Looks like theyre going to come with a late double for Hansbury when he gets to the rim That shot could be there all day Virginia Techs going to have to knock those down See the starting lineup for the NC State Wolfpack Van Allen Luben on the interior Darian Williams the preseason player of the year in the ACC with the basketball now Formidable shot blocker and Lwal as well Defended it well and got the rebound Toby Lwal is the leading rebounder for the Hokes in that starting lineup Neo Abdales tremendous player for Virginia Tech will certainly be a factor today as they preserve the possession to Hammond Extra possession right there Theyve been listening for my keys of the game clearly Virginia Tech five and five in conference play and the shot clock is down to four Hanssbury lets it fly cheering and it hits the side of the rim Luben comes away with it Hollowan baseline kick into the corner for Williams Halfway down and out Williams shooting 43 from beyond the arc Hes made 54 this season and made six in the win at SMU this week He has been on what we call a heater these last three games Low pounds it into the court here at Lenovo Center Sold out crowd for this matchup Hookies and pack It bounces out of bounds and cheering it will go to NC State applause First year head coach is Will Wade on that NC State bench His 12th season overall Spent two years prior as the head coach at McNiss State And McNise pulled off a victory in the NCAA tournament Last year of the first round they eliminated Clemson out of the ACC Love his demeanor and perspective One of my favorite coaches in the country Hollerman into the paint He hits the jumper savvy veteran guard We can say that nowadays with college basketball hes been doing it a long time at a high level A long time This is his 128th career game John listen college Thats a long time The senior from Minneapolis Minnesota who had 11 points in the win at SMU on Tuesday That was a onepoint win against the Mustangs Out of bounds off the Hokes Mike Young across the way is the seventh year head coach for Virginia Tech after incredible success 17 years at Wford in the Southern Conference third most wins in school history Hes got 121 on that Virginia Tech bench This would be an enormous one on the road at NC State And theyre switching on the Williams pick and rolls which seems to be more effective than playing coverage at the four spot So well see if they continue that Virginia Tech Tough luck for the first couple shots from Williams as that bounces off and he grabs the rebound He missed the three that was halfway down and that one appeared to be on its way through the net Holman bouncing Couple of bounces and a foul called on the Hokes underneath the basket Little slow start Its early you know so well see if teams get going Its always tough when you play these noon games Breakfast you got to get earlier Theres not really a shoot around Theres no time to really warm up get right into the game So these teams will settle in I love it Getting right into the game This is the first of a triple header today CW courtside Saturday as that pass bounces to Copeland Cladier Copeland the senior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania with a spin into a double Copeland gets THE SHOT AWAY and makes it for the pass Too little side right there Listen he scores that I think you can live with that You do not want him creating for his teammates and getting everybody going Thats a tougher shot Virginia Tech has to live with that Dont let him get everybody else going Copeland is the third leading scorer for the back Almost 14 points per game at shoots 53 from the floor That bounces out Run down by Shammond cheering against Hollowman Nowhere to go Road block Shot clock pocket 10 cheering INTO THE CORNER FOR THREE AND its Jaden Shoot 40 threepoint shooter Tech is getting the looks they want from three Just got to keep getting into the lane I like how theyre playing so far And he has struggled John in his last five games for shoot Just 28 on threepoint tries as that one gets tipped out of bounds Itll go back to the Hokes Action from the first half on CW Courtside music Saturday Virginia Tech and NC State was agreed originally The call was to music Virginia Tech After reviewed the out of bounds is overturned white ball Thats Tim Clockardy confirming the success of the challenge by NC State Hes joined by Rick Crawford and Justin Porterfield our officials this afternoon inside Lenovo Center A place where Virginia Tech has won three in a row in the series Luben tried to get it back couldnt do it Cleaning it up was Copelan Love the energy Copelan is bringing to this NC State team especially early on trying to get people to come with him is chirping at the Virginia Tech bench Sometimes you have to bring everyone along especially this early game where you may start off a little slow Besides all the numbers you just saw in the last couple of buckets hes made he leads a team in assists He had 16 assists in the win on the road at SMU An incredible statline for Copeland in that game against the Mustangs Seven points 10 rebounds a season high and the 16 assists THATS WILLIAMS ON TARGET FOR a three ball cannot let him line it up like that A 40 threepoint shooter Got to put a little bit more resistance on the perimeter for Hansberry cheering So the first made three of the game for NC State Told you theyre the best by percentage in the ACC from long distance and they average 11 made per game Thats second best in the conference cheering Virginia Tech in a congested area turns it over to Copeland his pass shoveled up ahead and saved by Hollowan on the sideline Luben cuts to the basket and beats everybody to the rim Beautiful pass by Copeland He led him to that layup right there to prevent a challenge by the defense Just a savvy high level IQ high IQ play Guardier Copeland over 400 career assists closing in on 150 career steals The numbers piling up for this veteran NC State team Hanssbury in traffic There was a whistle and foul This assist by Copelan right here just leaves Vinolubin right to the bucket for the easy layup As a big man I dont take those for granted I wasnt a great free throw shooter so that would have been a nice pass Files it just to give me an easy bucket And the part of this line that Will Wade pointed out to us was the turnovers Did not turn it over 16 assists a careerhigh program record as well Most seasons without a turnover cheering for Virginia Tech It looks like theyre going to NC States going to double late send Hansbury baseline Virginia Techs going to have to have to hit that corner three or the big is going to have to observe the middle and get that short shot Thats going to be the story of this game until they make NC State adjust Copeland gets the miss from Hensbury at the free throw line 71 of the season as Copeland races it up looking FOR LUBEN AGAIN cheering AND THEY collaborate once again for the Packman And as we said we do not want Copeland to get his team going Hes chirping Hes he listen if Im his coach Im happy about that Get these guys rolling Weve got a game to win Copeland able to get around Antonio Dorne who is into the lineup as well And now Copeland coming out applause Looks like coach said Hey look calm down We need you No texts Just simmer things down a little bit Listen I like what hes doing man Get your guys rolling Theyre up eight right now primarily because of him Just a moment ago John we were tied at six and all of a sudden NC State out to the 157 lead here in the first half cheering Pack trailed at SMU by eight at halftime He came back to win it by a point 8483 They produced the turnover Williams steps into a high arcing three Dorne the onehanded rebound He got tangled up with Luben whos a little bit behind the play RIGHT NOW ALIOOPA WOW HARD TO GO HIGH TO JAM it and couldnt complete the play How many times you see someone jump too high on that He probably should have jumped a little lower He would have made that He was too high in the air I dont think Ive ever said that Hammond went to the floor to try TO SAVE IT ARSENAL PICKS IT UP AND lays it in for NC State applause Virginia Techs got to start playing with a little bit of a sense of urgency Dallas didnt move on that loose ball Theyve got to cheering move the ball make it pop a little more Right now theyre very easy for NC State to guard Shot clock goes inside of 10 for the Hokes Dorne on the entry double team and coming over the top is Matt Ael Theyre going to give the foul to Arsenal His first Matt Ael consistent contributor coming off the bench for NC State Had 13 points at SMU went five of nine in 22 minutes So NBA scouts in the building Im sure theyre here to see him out of Dallas as well Those are two kind of young prospects that first round potential this year in the draft Hanssbury sends it out to shoot around the edge Launching the three too strong from Hammond Arsenal weak side board for NC State Traveling violation gives it back to the Hokes Now if youre NC State right now Virginia Tech kind of struggling not hitting shots Signs of a good team are putting teams out when they get a chance Do not let them have life Well see the next couple minutes if Virginia Tech can figure it out on the offensive side If NC State can kind of smother them while theyre down teams have met 24 times as ACC opponents They are split right down the middle 12 wins applause a piece The Hookies turn it over So John they give it right back after getting the traveling violation Now Hollowman Hollowman applause cheering and applause So were going to do a count today Thats three number two I believe when NC State hits over 12 well 12 or more they do not lose So Virginia Techs got to be aware of that and understand what this team wants to do cheering Shot clock again inside of 10 for Hammond Hanssbury straight away scrapes the ceiling with that one and misses wide left The NC State bench is telling Hollerman to go Able against shoot steps around him Left hand soft touch not enough Low the clearance Low with an awkward fall Sier was in the neighborhood and Lw hit the deck right here This threepointer look physicality of this Virginia Tech team but looks like NC State is taking the fight to cheering Virginia Tech So far not really targeting the threepoint ball but more so inside NC State as a team shooting 56 for the floor so far Virginia Tech just 20 two of 10 in the wall at the free throw line cheering And Im looking kind of at Dallas hasnt been the best 16 from the field and 13 from three in the last cheering three games Seems like his confidence is down a little bit Hes just got to keep fighting through that that freshman wall Look came out had some 30point games early in the season Teams have kind of keyed in on him Hes got to adjust His team needs him Copeland back into the game for NC State on the drive against Shoot Little follow never gets there Speedy Hammond A Dallas freshman from Athens Greece Foul is called Seems like NC State is content with kind of mismatching and and switching and and making the Virginia Tech bigs finish over them or finish in the paint or kick out for the three Virginia Tech has to accept that and play through that if they want to be successful here tonight Two of eight so far on threepointers for the Hokes Abdales lines it up and knocks it down Thats going to be the story of the game Can they hit the threes when the defense collapses John you mentioned just 28 from beyond the arc for him coming into the game and attempting 114 threes to start the afternoon Arsenals in a good spot after the miss by Ael Im going call that a nice pass by Ael to crosscourt McNeel Shot clocks at four McNeel put it on the floor and lost it Good D by Hammond and physical One of the top thieves for steals in the ACC Hes nice rugged guard Physical as well Shoot driving attacking the pack and scoring Good seal by Hanssbury to get his guy an open layup Thats not going to show up in the stat stat sheet but nice seal Virginia Tech kind of figured it out a little bit offensively Jaden shooting his second year in the Virginia Tech program after transferring from Duke Looks like that balls going back to the Hokes cheering Nice drop And look at this seal right here getting his teammate a layup cheering Credit to shoot on the other end using Copelands kind of aggression against him for the offensive foul Smart play by him First foul on Copelan Looks like Andalas got a little spark Little little music spark to a step down now that hes hit a three So well see if that continues Hanssbury Wicked spin into the corner for shoot Good looking design on the play for the Hokes They come up empty It goes out of bounds and will be NC State basketball So it appears John that we may have our second challenge of the game You recall just a few minutes ago th now those two coaches know each other really well by the way Coached against each other in the Southern Conference review Mike Young was at Wford Will Wade was at Chattanooga in the SoCon So a challenge Youve got Copeland Youve got Hanssbury Looks like that will be Virginia Tech ball NC State won its challenge a few minutes ago on an out of bounds play Being a ref man I I do not envy those guys I uh had to step in for a high

have indisputable video evidence to overturn the call Okay So we will see Again its Clockardy Crawford and Porterfield putting their heads together on this one Tim Clockardy thought he was going to

has to keep going to him He is the top dog for this team 68 240 Ammani Hansbury Arsenal flying in from the wing Cut off on the baseline by Lwal Copeland has an angle and an alley and an easy lefty layup Beautiful kind of drive He switches to the right hand to split that switch right there Hes playing with a lot of confidence and I think its bleeding onto his other teammates onto the court and the bench He played at McNe last year and has the steel the spin Played for coach WAY A SEASON AGO HE WAS GOING IN for the highflying jam and contact in midair applause Now Dallas challenging the jam attempt by Guadir Copeland who is playing at another level at this moment John another level Looks like right here hes going to just go for the nice layup and he kind of tricks Abdales into thinking

alive inside Gerdak Hammond let the defender go on by He drives and scores past two defenders Beautiful drive Him hitting that first three kind of looks like its put a little confidence in him A little little more energy offensively from him Highlevel move from Abdales who fought about putting his name in the NBA draft and then withdrew and signed with Virginia Tech and Mike Young Hammonds McNeel got back maybe got a piece of that one Theyre letting these guys play I love it Williams the miss Williams almost knocked it away from Hansbury cheering Hanssbury driving again Two defenders

John Henson our outstanding CW courtside Saturday production crew with you How sold out house John How nice is it to have your 69 forward be able to bring the ball up and initiate the offense creating shots for others as he has done right here Threepointer for Jaylen Bedford Ive noticed that Virginia Tech runs the offense through Abdales trusting him as a freshman to make the right decisions which he has done the last couple possessions offensively Fedford who missed all five of his threepoint attempts last Saturday at home against Duke still had 12 points in 33 minutes of action Copeland turns and fires Miscommunication but got lucky right there Dont want to do that against anyone else on this squad Hsbury backing down musling his way Tough angle Couldnt manage to find that angle off the square and he is frustrated Dribble hand off here Ver rolls Nice find on time on target that those usually go in Second three of the game for Bedford Hes got two of the four makes on 11 tries from threepoint real estate in the first half for the Hokes NC State so far just two of eight on threes Aliuven left hand couldnt tip it up on the rim Bedford cheering Hanssbury has a size advantage on Hollowman and he travels Hanssbury has just got to take his time The double team is coming Hes got to accept that collapse the defense and make the right play Little sped up right there cheering Im sure hell adjust especially at halftime when they can watch him on the film NC State working on a fivegame winning streak Theyve won seven of their last eight and 11 of their last 13 The only losses both at home Virginia and Georgia Tech That was the last loss Theyve grilled off five straight since Williams piouetses and misses A lot of close misses for the Pack in this first half John And Virginia Tech is switching on that not playing in coverage which usually he kills that type of defense Williams smother that shot by Hsbury coming down the lane Might have held on a little too long

best shooter in the ACC knew he was going to come out looking to shoot and and and make some shots 74 made threes now for McNeel That leaves the team and he almost created a steal Might have stepped on the baseline but it was McNeel ripping the ropes for a three John right here Hammer a little late a little too short Bang State up six 52 teams in that tournament in 83 John And they beat Houston in that championship So memorable 5452 Late in the shot clock for the Hokes And thats going to be a shot clock violation cheering and applause That run by the way for NC State back in 1983 Almost

Dame and Vanderbilt and playing in his 115th career game this afternoon The senior then Allen Luben screaming This is Lwal tried to get it back over top of Williams Ball goes out of bounds and will stay with the Hokes Just over three minutes to go in our first half of play Virginia Tech Bigs are getting good shots for the most part They just got to finish and they get close to the rim take their time a little bit and focus Hammond on the inbounds Bedford leads the way in scoring with a couple of threes Gets closer to the rim this time and it bounces out Tough That was halfway down Comes out Copeland has eight points Leading scoreer in the first half NC State Hollerman Deflected to Copelan Right back to Luben And it bounces a ball Does so much for them gets his big easy layup right there Turns a difficult shot potentially to a layup Hes been great for them Hammond driving against Hollowman Luben gets the rebound Back up the other way Able does not have the numerical advantage Waiting for reinforcements as we close in on two minutes to go in the first half Able comes flying out of the corner again Shoot Scores applause cheering Freshman from Baltimore Maryland Matt Ael And the lead is 11 for NC State 205 to go in the first half All new episodes of Trivial Pursuit air every Thursday music right here on the CW So lets test your college basketball trivia music knowledge right now What year did NC State win its first NCAA mens basketball championship 20 points in the paint for NC State music So come in worried about the three ball and theyve kind of dominated the interior And that first national championship for NC State John back in 1974 I look at your card I didnt see anything You saw the answer It was in bright red They they did they made it too easy By the way NC State cheering is 60 on the road in the ACC That is the best record since 1974 That national championship team went 30 and one overall on the way to the title Hanssbury Long rebound Hollowman racing downshifting poked away surrounded by five defenders Arsenal weaving his way cheering Right back with Bedford Break neck pace up and down the court in the final moments of this first half Bedford ran it to Copeland an attempted steel and picks up the fouls Just a little late for Bedford You know Virginia Techs trying to be aggressive trying to close the gap just not having the shots fall Saw it a little late Credit to Copeland for coming to that pass and attacking the ball Virginia Tech needs to get a stop and maybe a couple buckets Keep this thing in single digits Its already tough enough to beat this NC State team when they do have the lead Even tougher when theyre up double digits NC State John looking for its first sixgame ACC winning streak Also since 1974 they would do that with a win today We are far from the verdict in this one Although NC State has the first half lead Got a feeling theyre going to have a lot of 1974 records broke with Coach Wade at the helm Copley hesitation Shot clock at seven Off of the screen for Hollowman trying to beat that clock Got the shot away It did not hit the rim So that is a shot clock violation as NC State took it all the way down and back to the Hokes Dallas for kind of running him off the threepoint line He was he was looking at that rim trying to get the threepoint shot off great game plan as they are one of the best threepoint defending teams in the ACC Yeah theyre tied for first in the ACC in that category NC State three of nine so far on threepointers They average 11 made per game That is second best We told you that will be a deciding factor this afternoon Now Dallas into a triple team Hell ball in the arrow favors NC State Its a little bit of a quick jump ball I dont know didnt seem like he was tied up enough for a jump ball but credit to NC State with the active hands to slow him down Looked like he had to live You know on the other side John for Mike Young and Virginia Tech yes theyre five and five in conference play but theyve been beaten basically at the horn three times this season including a half court shot at SMU by Boopy Miller McNeel curls and hits cheering and applause Mcneel in rhythm catch and release Yeah that is what he does 43 threepoint shooter averaging two and a half threes a game right here coming off the screen Theres no help Hansburys got to get up there If if hes going to be in the lane all night McNeel is going to be able to line it up 77 of his shots are threes You got to understand that and know they can do something different John mid December against Texas Southern he had 47 points in one game and made 11 threes a school record and he tied an ACC record as well for McNeil Hanssbury shifty move over the top offensive glass and he was also fouled That was a tough physical rebound helped up by his teammates Look at this between three three two three guys and finishes Hes an athlete that I like to call hes in the 1 of the 1 His leaping ability second to none Toby Lal senior from London England 68 215 at the free throw line 72 for the body of work this season ACC media that he has a chain that actually says wow Wow So I thought that was kind of cool Thats how you say it Low like wow Look at that leaping ability Old school threepoint play Toby Lewis double digit scorer on the season John Almost nine rebounds per game as well He did miss nine games with a left foot injury but certainly back into the lineup and an impact player for the Hokes and Mike Young Final seconds of the first half What happened John Where did it go Copeland youll earn a trip to the free throw line Savvy savvy move right there He plays at a kind of a weird pace where kind of messes up the defender on that drive there Kind of slowed down like he was going to pump fake Second foul on Bedford John Really good player Some NBA scouts in the building might be looking at him I mean hes got that kind of skill set at 66 leading the league in assist I could see him playing somewhere next year at the next level for sure NC State as a team good from the free throw line John Fifth in the conference 76 as a squad One of two from Copeland So Luben was going over towards the bench and now Copeland goes over toward the bench and comes out of the lineup Final seconds 53 coping with nine points Team throw in these this stuff every day Look at Hammond accelerate to the rim and had it blocked Luben and Hollowman were waiting Hey that was the combination that blocked the last second shot at SMU to preserve victory Was you dont want the guard to get full length of the court for a layup but size and length nullify that layup NC State going into the half feeling good up 12 points 3624 at the half NC State on its home floor 161 with the halftime lead into the locker room CW Courtside Saturday continues We got 20 minutes to decide things here in Raleigh North Carolina All things considered shooting under 30 from the field and the three To be 12 Virginia Tech has to be thinking theyre fortunate I think the ball will roll this way their way in the second half at least from the interior Virginia Tech made eight field goals in the first half Four of those were from threepoint distance Hanssbury puts the shoulder into Luben holds his ground gets the ball back takes a tumble Might have been a foul in the aftermath And looks like NC State has said Okay were going to stay solid here and come on to help late from the point guard instead of coming from the baseline Switching it up on Harsburg making him think I love that strategy by Coach Wade Keep him guessing keep him out of rhythm Seems to be working so far And Hansbury just one of nine from the floor in the first half and three points Theyre looking for the alleyoop curl from Copeland Ball got deflected away Abdales picks it up for the Hookies Gsbury on the entry Right back out Abdales a few feet behind THE LINE AND IT doesnt matter Great defense by Luben Abdales has got to be more aggressive right now Hes kind of the only guy offensively thats got things going in a rhythm He is the leading scorer for the Hokes with eight points This is McNeel looking for another three and fouled in the active shooting the threepointer as McNeel hits the floor right here Just good defense by Venat Luben Freddy Copeland a little bit behind A Dallas has been struggling lately from three You knew he would break out of it Today seems like the day Now Dallas has made both of his threepoint attempts McNeel Jr who was fouled on the threepointer to the free throw line Told you about his 47point game in mid December on this floor against Texas Southern He also had 10 rebounds in that game John A careerhigh Coach Wade raves about his work ethic I think early in the year when everybody went to a concert he was in the gym shooting It Its showing itself during ACC play 80 free throw shooter Won more for McNeel who last year averaged 42 points per game and made a total of 16 threes for the entire season Nice find by coach W This year hes got 75 made threes Now hes played a lot more certainly Sophomore from Rockingham North Carolina Pressure from Hollowman in the back court Hammond cheering By the way the 12point deficit at halftime for Virginia Tech It is their largest halftime deficit of the season Theyll have to overcome that if they can score a road victory They are one and three on the road to the ACC Entry Lwal Shot clock at three Makes his move and the balloons up into the air and a foul called Give credit NC State is playing physical defense right tonight Making it tough Every finish every play in that paint is contested and physical Luben picked up the foul for NC State See Coach Young pacing his sideline You dont see that much anymore A coach with a suit and tie Now hes ejected the jacket He He stressed how I look we have I have an NCAA tournament team Weve just got to get some road wins And today theres an opportunity for a road win a quad one road win which could go a long way towards their resume cheering Hes taken this program to the NCAA tournament twice in 21 and 22 for the Hokes NIT appearances in 23 and 24 And last year they were 13 and 19 and lost in the first round of the ACC tournament Well take a timeout You are watching CW Courtside music Saturday Game one of three from Raleigh State did not qualify last year with a 129 record and five and 15 in the ACC Only the top 15 teams get to make a trip to Charlotte for the tournament Won last year by Duke against Louisville in the championship game cheering Thats one point Bill did not get set on that back screen right there Offensive foul Virginia Tech is three and three cheering in its last six games So strong at home in Blackburg 122 and that includes a triple OT win against Virginia in late December Lal forces his way to the rim He would not be denied John looks like they have an emphasis on going at Williams as hes probably not the best defender A little unders sized and theyve decided to get Hsbury moving on the pick and roll as going against Venadal Loopa down there oneonone hasnt been working Nine points for La McNeel Jr standing on the sideline right in front of his coach cheering right here Just physical just I want it more than you right there Nice finish Theyre going to continue to go to that get Hanssbury and Dallas into an action and let them create for each other Well while is a double digit scoreer averages just over 11 points per game Only had four a week ago against Duke and missed all three of his threepoint tries in 31 minutes Production today against the double team off the glass And again they switched Ben out of Luben on Lauo and credit to Virginia Tech now going back at Williams on Hansbury It seems to be working They figured something out Copeland applause off balance off the glass and good Guadier Copeland has 11 Nice pace from him right there making that move cheering Copeland now just three points shy of a thousand for his career Hanssbury on the cut A Dallas found him for the onehanded jam And now they had Williams on AD Dallas and another play was made So Williams is going to have to figure it out Theyre going at him clearly every possession defensively making him work and defend And now Copeland going to work in the paint Got bumped by Bedford and the shot will fall for Copeland applause Just kind of a high IQ move right here Look just Befords being physical Let me just accept that contact Make the ref call the foul Kind of a professional move right there You see that the NBA kind of drawing that foul like that So Im not sure if hes aware or not as Mike Young has a chat with Bedford Leaves with three personal fouls This will be for 1000 points right here at the line Copeland and hell do it applause in old school fashion with a threepoint play Cadir Copeland 14 points on the afternoon for NC State Diego again putting Williams in He switches out Dallas guarded closely by Williams Shot clocks inside of 10 while misses Luben grabs him Great pointer at the other end Hollan Hollowman Just bad communication right there for Virginia Tech cheering Let Hollerman line it up He had all the time in the world to hit that three Hes going to hit that every time Eight points now for the senior Trey Hollowman 40 threepoint shooter Thats a layup Low slashing on the baseline and he ran into Williams

it to him Coin again through the defense Gerak grabbed it Smart play by Shrew just getting behind L on the weak side to shoot FOR THREE AND HE HELD THAT FINISH FOR AN EXTRA BEAT cheering Great play on the defensive end by him stealing that pass from Copeland knowing that Copeland is going to look to pass and hes rewarded Virginia Tech nine of 12 from the floor in the second half and Hanssbury has come alive in the second 20 minutes John credit to his team for keep giving him the ball and and making sure that hes involved because they know hes their best player Just a well coached squad understanding where their bread is buttered They shot 26 as a team in the first half So far in the second half 75 and a foul coming up Four on Bedford music Hes going to have to come out of the game Comes Hanssbury first team Hes got at least three dunks in the second half Playing up around the rim Williams Cable deflected it Abdollis came away with it Good challenge by Lau on that shoot again Same spot Listen that shot looked good from the release I I had no doubt about that He was in rhythm on time Dont look now but its a threepoint game NC States got to figure it out in the offensive end quickly And shoots got 11 points A spinning Copeland kicks it out Hollowman Holan with the response for the pass NC State has been responding all night to Virginia Techs runs Sier in the neighborhood

attacking Now Dallas at the free throw line Shoot has made threepointers in the game We documented his struggles coming into this game John Last five games hed only been 28 from long distance yet still shooting at 40 That should tell you something Hes a really really good shooter One of two Abdales Yeah Shoot leads a team in threepoint shooting Nobody takes more or makes more from distance Copeland takes matters into his own hands Overshoot Could not calculate the angle Moal had the rebound Things are getting tense inside the Lenovo Center Definitely Hammond somewhat out of control Able

freshman Kind of a first round guy in the draft Hes looking the part right here with that finish and the three earlier cheering Copeland was driving ran into Hammond applause against Ben Sold it a little bit He could have stayed there actually maybe and and made it a little more physical He had a little bit of a position to where maybe if it hadnt fall so fallen so easily maybe the ref would have gave him the call Third foul on Hammond Luben has gone to the NC State bench I think thats big defensively They need him out there I wonder how long theyre going to be able to last without him out there This is McNeel Paul McNeel and the lead is 10 14 points Paul McNeel cheering cheering cheering Pinballs around to able applause McNeel Bump by Hammond Thats a couple of quick fouls for Hammond One of the best shooters in the country right here You cant give him that much space Whats even more impressive is coming off the bench sitting down cold and then hitting a three right when you come in That is so tough Most coaches say warm up a little bit before you shoot one Not McNeil Jr he is hot from everywhere Doesnt need to cool down or warm up Hes made 76 threes on the season now And that leads the team 80 free throw shooter applause Double figures 15 times this season for McNeel And remember last season yes he played less but he averaged four points per game Looking at that threepoint number and creeping up its eight right now Usually when NC State gets to 12 they win the game 16 points for McNeel leads the way for the pack at Dallas trying to make his move around Ael and a foul against Matt Ael the freshman And thats how Virginia Techs going to come back They have to attack get to the line stop the clock and score the ball So Virginia Tech as a team is nine of 11 from the free throw line Last Saturday John they only attempted six free throws against Duke in the 7258 loss to the Blue Devils at Castle Coliseum A Dallas three for three two two from three 10 points Hes going to have to be more aggressive down the stretch if he wants to get this game closer within striking distance for the Honkies Bird after the miss Shoot Let the defender go on by Thats the hot spot Not this time Hanssbury offensive glass to preserve the possession Looking for a safety now Five to shoot Hammond behind the back dribble and jumper Hanssbury again ON THE OFFENSIVE GLASS ALL THAT WORK FROM Hanssbury pays off and hell flex it on the way up the court What a physical possession by Hanssbury Just outworking NC State and and thats why I asked how long has been Alubin going

looks like theyre going to go on a run cheering Hookies have gotten as close as three points in this second half Handsree battling his way through traffic against Sier He tied him up Thats a lot of physicality I hope that was a foul right here Another three from McNeel Jr Theyre creeping closer to that 123 mark NC State up 12 and hes gone over 1000 points in his career The free throw on the old school threepoint play secured it Hes got 16 in the game for Cuadier Copeland currently getting a rest on the NC State bench Hsbury at the free throw line for Virginia Tech using all of the rim on that first free throw I was going to say they got some nice soft rims here Shooters rims as we would call it At Carolina we like layup rims Just inside of eight minutes to go in regulation By the way Virginia Tech cheering has four overtime wins this season Not surprisingly a school record They have had so many close games A little pressed to slow down this NC State offense Not giving them as much time to run their offense on the other end Wins against Virginia Elon South Carolina and Providence in overtime for the Hokes And the Virginia game is a triple overtime victory against one of the five

on the court when youre in the bonus kind of just got to fight through that fatigue and not put your team in a position music down 12 now maybe 14 with the best free throw shooter on the line 17 points for Hsbury Second foul to the bench McNeel at the free throw line Might have been my fault on that He had made all five of his free throw attempts prior to that Still despite the miss 19 points for McNeel leads the way Holman has 13 Copen has 16 Adonis has got to get aggressive right here Hes got to make a play for his teammate or himself Hes the only guy out there that can do that Gak tough catch deflected away able pass in tight quarters McNeel on baseline and shoot bumped applause and shoot has to play Mcneel Jr close like that knowing that hes a shooter and that allows him to get the lane to drive music back to the free throw line McNeel had nine points in the win on Tuesday at SMU A onepoint win on the road Body English from McNeel as he arched his back And now he has scored 20 points or more six times this season Paul McNeel Jr sophomore from Rockingham North Carolina and the second leading scoreer on the team behind Daren Williams applause This is with Copeland and Williams on the bench and Luben that theyre holding this lead together Just shows the depth of this Wolfpack squad Seven made threes in the game for the Hokes Might need a few more to chip into this lead At one point they trail by just three 5451 Abdales high degree of difficulty falling away and maintaining his shooting form I think thats why some of the pro scots are here That was an NBA move But hes got to be more aggressive going downhill Hes got to make plays for his team Its its winning time and theyve got to get this lead down before its too late Hes got 12 points double figures 15 times this season of Dallas Challenging McNeel trying not to foul McNeel misses Looks good every time I leave his hand got the defender in the air Arsenal and lays it in Virginia Tech John refuses to
