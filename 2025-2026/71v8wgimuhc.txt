Huffstead has some great memories here in this building He went for 22 points and 10 rebounds a couple years ago while playing for Maryland Eastern Shore Vin Allen Luben wins the tip and away we go NC State in the home white uniforms the throwback uniforms and we get a whistle just 7 seconds in and a foul on LJ Andrews the freshman for Texas Southern One thing that were seeing from that first play early is Wolfpack are doing a lot of movement on the offensive end Allan Breed into the starting lineup for the first time this season You mentioned opportunity with Williams being out Its Breed who has it here on the right wing with the starting opportunity Copeland on Zoom action Musa Sag for a three against the front rim and Breed with the offensive rebound Reed and Copeland turn down threes Copeland penetrates back out to Paul McNeel Big shot by Paul McNeel applause shooting in rhythm If he can hit that then Wolfpack would be very hard to guard NC State immediately into its pressure in a 10second violation And thats what that press does that NC State the main purpose of it is to slow you down and reduce as many as much time on the shot clock as possible on the offensive end Mentioned Breed in the starting lineup and Sier and Luben playing together in the front court along with McNeel who just hit the three and Copeland late shot clock cheering A long two for Quadier Copelan And if youre North Carolina Central you got to be comfortable giving that up Thought it might have been a three And Cuadia Copelan is shooting the threepointer tremendously well so far this season 10 for 19 Sier gets a tip Texas Southern works in their shoot around quite a bit about breaking NC States pressure Now the 10second violation struggling here Skip pass for an open three He cant answer Bryce Roberts off the mark playing in his fourth game of the year Dealing with early injuries but since hes been back in the lineup hes been an impact player Hes gone for double digits in all three previous games McNeel again but he had been in a slump after the Texas game cheering but he is not shy And part of it is just technique right Hes shooting in a rhythm and that is what makes the Wolfpack very hard to guard Able to break the pressure here Hubstead picked up his dribble in a bad spot Now McNeel gets a tip and NC State has started off very active on the defensive end and a steal by Vin Allen Luben Already off to an eight nothing start They leave Copeland wide open We told you hes been shooting the three really well this year Better than 50 And thats a huge addition to his game being able to stretch the floor out Upstead had it poked away by Copeland Another look at the three from the senior from Philly And for Copeland it it starts on the defensive end When you look at NC State just watch their hands Watch how active they are in terms of trying to get deflections and push in transition First basket for TSU belongs to Zire Hayes who is preseason second team all swack grad student from Houston in his third year at Texas Southern McNeel open buried Paul McNeel made that shot but Van Aloop did an excellent job on hitting his man on that screen clearing up an easy opportunity for a catch and shoot for Paul McNeel Roberts able to hit Hubstead who hits him back for a driving layup Tough and the first time weve really seen TSU have success breaking that pressure and it leads to a layup A 10point lead early for NC State Then Allan Luben swatted by the center Jordan Gerki McNeel from the corner cheering Wow applause Thats a big time shot of your opponent fly on all ends of the court Casey hes got four threes within the first four minutes An answer Zire Hayes counter punching for TSU Copeland tried to reverse jam Think the roof would have came off this place if that had gone down But Paul McDthro line seen it going in a couple times Thatll help you find your rhythm He is already very much in rhythm You played in this building Ive been told from players before that they feel like its a shooters gym Paul McNeel definitely a shooter This gym is great for a shooter The depth possession The depth possession um it makes a big difference especially for the home team McNeel with a steal and hes fouled by Roberts And look were going to talk about four made threes by one player in the first four minutes But the defense has maybe been just as impressive as Texas Southern when theyre getting it across half court Theyre shooting it well so far but they have really struggled with this press And thats where it started for NC State NC States press has slowed Texas Southern down and theyre taking advantage on the opp on the other end Great straight up defense from Hayes that Trey Hollowman at the rim And if youre Texas Southern its important to hold NC State to one shot and done NC State NC States a much larger team so you can attack you can expect multiple people to attack the glass on all shot attempts Jerry Deng to the rim and theres the offensive rebound The tip out TO GUESS WHO MCNEEL FOR THREE 17 points in the first five minutes and Hayes just took his eye off the ball Just talking about offensive rebounding once again Wolfpack took full advantage of it leading to another opportunity for Paul McNeil music Thats the key for this Texas Southern team is to finish possessions by rebounding the basketball Casey I cannot ever remember talking about a careerhigh in the first five minutes of a game but just in case youre wondering its 27 He did it earlier this year against UNCCG Okay so hes got a ways to go but he is all right Certainly on pace How about another so HE CANT MISS Sier driving and kick find him another corner three And Matt Ael rips down a rebound Finds Hollowman for a three A fourth chance for the Wolfpack Dang will try and finally a stop Johnny Jones head coach three NCAA tournament appearances Hes done a great job at Texas Southern This is kind of the end of their road trip They played all over the country Well talk about that Tested their team Just one and seven so far Feels like they have really good depth Yeah Multiple guys that can score the ball Balance scoring We havent had much of a chance to talk about them because they have not been able to really get into their offense to this point He has made a number of subs as Matt Ael is called for a foul on Dwayne Posey grad student from Memphis Lets talk about the journey of the Tigers nonconference games These are the the three furthest Theyve also played in Nashville against Vanderbilt but started this season in Spokane Gonzaga coming off a loss at Minnesota And theres another turnover on the sideline That is five Tigers turnovers And thats a tough stretch for Texas Southern Theyre being theyve been challenged a lot this season on all parts on both ends of the floor They got another good one tonight McNeel has checked out So nobody on the floor for NC State has scored yet Hollerman trying to change that and does McNeel with 17 Copelan with five Yeah if youre just tuning in you heard me correctly Paul McNeel Jr has 17 points Texas Southern calls another tal together although they lost a couple players for the season that did play for him last year And so thats why they feel like they have a lot of depth They had a lot more at this start of preseason practice than they currently do but still this should be a solid team in the swack once they get through the gauntlet of this nonconference schedule Three attempt by Terrence Arsenal a little short Arsenal from Bowmont Texas coming over to NC State Three years at the ball and forced the ball handler to release it Ace has played well so far offensively Alex Anderson turns it over No they call the foul on Abel I thought the foul was after he had picked up the steel Instead it is on Matt Able And thats his second I think thats a tough one Matt Ael jumped the gap for the transition opportunity So two here early on the star freshman for NC State First recruit in the Will Wade era and Matt Ael applause Hey they trust you Freshman with two fouls Makes a defensive play NC State has a lot of size and Matt Abel did a great job rotating and being active on the ball Late shot clock Hayes driving dish Alex Andersons three Doesnt bank in Good offensive rebound and Posey gets the roll Little familiarity in these matchups Theres certainly familiarity with the coaching staffs LSU ties but also amongst some of the players assistant coaches Hayes popped it up in the air and tight rope the sideline to find Anderson for a layup One of those tieins Alex Anderson He was the third leading scoreer at Incarnate Word a couple of years ago in the Southland Ben Allen Luben fouled on the way up by Umar Cares before Barn Reynolds Coliseum So much history here and then the beautiful renovation in 2016 And this arena is a huge staple for NC State athletics Located right in the heart of campus this is a huge part of NC States history We used to camp out for tickets Did you No no no I did not Okay Okay laughter Its been a fast start for NC State here in the first nine minutes Nearly another turnover deflected by Ben Allen Luben Only three on the shot clock for the Tigers NC State active defensively Paul McNeel 17 points already If youre Texas Southern you got to get a quick one up here Well you get the inbounds right underneath and Hubstead scores Too easy First points for Troy Hubstead again He had 22 here a couple years ago at Maryland Eastern Shore Ball was deflected The ball pressure from Jaylen Weisinger Extra pass Arsenal moving from one side to the other Deng put back by Terren Arsenal Once again those opportunities are going to be there if youre the Wolfpack Texas Southern is very undersized So its important to crash the glass get second and third opportunities Upstead a miss and now a run out for Hollerman and fouled on the way up Didnt get a chance to talk to Terrence Arsenov before the game Theres so many guys from Houston and when youre playing elite basketball I wonder how much how well does he know some of these guys you play in the summertime and you know get some pickup in Its a small world The basketball worlds very small You know I think a lot of a lot of these guys started early with AU and then you just kind of work your way up the ranks So these relationships last for over a decade Grow up playing with and against guys and then when youre in college I dont know I dont know how much you really played off season with guys from other colleges Thats big Yeah those open runs and you know a lot of people arent invited to those games laughter They are Theyre very exclusive Halman sinks the free throw Comes in or comes out Got to hear Copeland come back in Texas Southern wants to play up tempo Its been NC States pace Another turnover trying to beat that press down the sideline And that press is going to cause problems not only for Texas Southern but for a good amount of opponents that NC State will face this season Its something that I asked Coach Wade about in shootound today is Vinn Allen Luben pulls in the rebound McNeel back in turns down a three Unselfish couple extra passes Dang cant pay it off But after the Kansas loss coach Wade thanked the fans because the atmosphere he said was tremendous He said you know hes just really disappointed Its a missed opportunity but he felt like his team was doing a lot of things And that press in particular it comes down to details One wrong move from anybody on the line can lead to easy baskets for the opposing team outside Weisinger too strong Hopstead on the weak side Missed an easy one But the hustle from Hopstead And if youre Texas Southern you got to find a way to come up to those easy baskets at the rim especially on the road playing a team like NC State in the historic Reynolds Coliseum That motor from Hubstead McNeel fouled on the three I mean look hes already made five You got to get a hand up I know youre supposed to never foul a threepoint shooter but when a guys made five I mean youre probably more worried about getting a great contest in Youre right And Paul McNeils his elevation on his shot I mean its its what its like you cant block it His elevation is so high especially with his size as a defender essentially theres nothing you can really do to kind of affect it Listed at 65 Gets good rise on his jump shot Shoots it pretty up high too Exactly Yeah its a very high arcing shot A high aring shot Former North Carolina Gatorade player of the year out of Rockingham North Carolina Paul McNeel with 20 points five threes five free throws Anderson good pass to Hubstead Its goalending call And thats what youre going to get sometimes with that press But NC State essentially looking to kind of bait you into a trap That means someones going to be open And if youre Texas Southern you have to take full advantage of it That ends a seven nothing run for NC State Ben Aluba does a great job of setting screens He always finds contact and hits the defender which is rare in college basketball Breed and the foul going to go against NC States Ven Allen Luben who kind of pleads his case teams just standing there And to your point of thats what youre going to get sometimes against the press when theyve broken it Texas Southern shoot 54 Theyre getting some good looks Its just how many times can they generate those and not turn it over which theyve done seven times in the first 12 minutes And then when youre Texas Southern you beat the front line Its like you have shot blockers waiting for you on the back end and thats what makes it tough to complete the possession in terms of scoring the ball These two teams played in 2021 It was a lowscoring game Have not gotten that tonight Multiple Pack players got a hand up to block Breed swatted the other way Well done by Anderson Now Weisinger will try the corner three It lips out and last touch by NC State ECC huddle final score postgame show Well have a complete breakdown and reactions from coaches and players Looking forward to that game That will be very cool Troy Hubstead has been having a career year in terms of shooting the threepoint shot but that one an airball and he hears about it from the Reynolds Coliseum crowd Back with Casey Morcel Im Andrew Sanders A redot start for NC States Paul McNeel is Alan Breed who drew his first start of the season tonight with no Darien Williams He is out for just tonight says NC State So and when your star player is out theres going to be a little bit of panic a little bit of uh commotion but it is expected to just be one game miss They expect him back in the lineup against Miss on Sunday the 21st And there hasnt been much of a drop off from this NC State team I mean especially on the defensive end with how active they are with their hands How about that tough take from Alex Anderson Strong take by Alex but once again its a tough basket and thats all NC State is giving up right now Take another look at it and the foul on Musa Sier who also drew the start tonight for NC State His first start of the season both Sier and Vin Allen moving So I touched on the familiarity a little bit earlier in Anderson incarnate word 11 points per game couple years ago and thats when of course coach Wade was at MC in the Southland And its been Paul McNeels night 23 points in the first half That basket is huge for Paul McNeel tonight Its not really much that Texas Southern can do to throw him off at this point I mentioned his career high earlier 27 points against UNCCG Thats his college career high Hes on pace for about his high school career high which was 71 That broke a North Carolina state record I dont know if anybody will break that I dont know I dont know Second effort and it goes for Dwayne Posey Casey Im sure you had some big games in high school I dont know Do you ever drop 70 Oh yeah Im not 70 Not nowhere near 70 Ill tell you that It all started with the dribble penetration of Quadier Copeland there And thats what he likes to do draw multiple defenders to the ball If youre Paul McNeel and Allan Breed guys who are off the ball you should thrive off of the attention that Cardier Copeland draws when he has the ball in his hands Posey another transfer from the Southland the grad student from Memphis was at Northwestern State a couple of years ago And this is off the back rim And McNeel grabs the rebound Hes got 23 of NC States 37 Bereed rises up takes contact and is fouled Still sporting the the black eye The controversial play was ruled uh on the court not as a flagrant They did review I think the 19000 in Lenovo Center wanted it to be a flagrant against uh Kansas Not the case And the officials definitely heard it after that play Allen Allen Breed hes a very scrappy guard and weve heard Will Wade say it before he trusts Allen Breed in terms of making the right play and getting this NC State team into a consistent positive fluff Scotty Abu senior center checks in and thats the key word right Trust That word means a lot coach to player When a coach trusts you that means you have a very long leash Alan Breed was with coach Wade at McNees last year last two years but sat out his first year and then he was injured just two games into the season was still working back from that injury in preeason Minutes were restricted So when you miss some of that time it takes a little while to get going But when he has come in and played he has just been really steady and you could see that trust factor as Abubet erases that shot You talked about opportunity and I know they dont play the same position but when those minutes are gone you might get a little more opportunity Coach Wade with a 20point lead here in the first half Mixing it up a little bit And that was expected That was expected tonight from this NC State team Trying to figure out which lineups work best together without the star player 26 and counting for Paul McNeel in the first half Guadir Copelands wide open but you got to find the hot hand You have to especially Paul McNeil who is super hot And again Qs made a three tonight Hes shooting over 50 on the season He says You know what Let me go find a better shot McNeel is on fire Jerry Deng can step out and hit that shot Hes I dont think hes done I think he has a lot more in the tank It sure seems like it He is on the floor along with Abel Hollowman Deng and Abubet Break the pressure Hubstead layup Once again if youre Texas Southern youre going to need to try to hold this Wolfpack team to one shot and done Its going to be tough Theyre going to be tough to guard They get second and third and four opportunities Anderson sticking with Neil there Some of those threepoint opportunities have come to your point off of those offensive rebounds NC State already has 11 Nothing offensive rebound there as Hollowman makes a tough shot Hes a tough shot taker and a tough shot maker Abubet with another big block Got Posey this time and the jump ball Possession arrow going the jump ball but foul assessed One and one Foul on Aub his first but the teams seventh cheering Got his own miss did Posie and fouled again by Abubet And thats what you need to do with all shot blockers Posie what Posie did on that play was textbook Youre supposed to get them up in the air cuz you know theyre seeking the shot blocks Thats all you know thats what theyre seeking Thats what theyre looking for if youre a Bubet So what Posey did getting them air drawing contact its textbook cheering It is two shots here It went in for opposing Were looking ahead at our final womens basketball double header at 2025 on ACC Network Monday the 29th Hannah Halgo and number 20 Notre Dame host Pitt and South Bend at 6 Eastern Then Indie Navar leads number 18 North Carolinas balanced attack against BC at the Conte Forum Both games are also available on the ESPN app Some pressure from the Tigers and this should be 10 seconds It is So Bubs pass blocked up by Anderson And now Texas Southern giving NC State a little taste of its own medicine You see Coach Wades reaction to the turnover Has been an area NC State has been good in this year Taking care of the basketball top 30 in the country Just under 10 turnovers per game Thats the way of the game Taking care of the ball and not beating yourself Able sticking with Anderson Spins baseline shot fake reverse layup with the left That was a good move Once again Anderson trying to get a Bubet up in the air Yeah you know hes seeking to meet the ball at the rim Shot fake Its bound to work Anderson now with six points to go along with a couple assists Wolfpack lead 23 Able float game Strong move by Matt Ael getting to his spot One dribble into the floater Very hard to guard Anderson throws back Roberts Swinging to the corner Hopstead Good ball movement Posies three strong and again he crashes the boards gets his own miss and carries it all the way to the rim kept alive Hayes comes out with it Can go two for one here Well get a one and one free throw And credit to Texas Southern for finishing the possession there I mean with this NC State lineup on the floor it is extremely hard to finish a possession right with Abu um a dane crashing the glass it its its super difficult So even though they might be getting the lucky bounce in terms of finishing the possession its still a huge accomplish able to hit the front end of the one and one balance scoring so far for the Tigers Posey has seven Anderson Hubstead and Hayes all with six Make it seven for number seven Switch off Posie on Hollowman 10 to shoot and a foul late in the shot clock The next part of her job is finishing the possession rebounding the ball NC State had an explosive offense this year Third best in the ACC Better than 87 points per game Already cracked 50 here in the first half Mostly thanks to Paul McNeels career night Already six made threepointers Hes got 26 in the first half Final possession of the half belongs to Roberts and the Tigers Three ball off to the right and thatll end the first 20 minutes Its been the Paul McNeel show Paul McNeil has sent a strong message to really since Maui since the trip to Maui So he is out this game but expected to be back in the lineup Sundays game against Miss is a neutral sight game in Greensboro Anderson to the corner Hayes short getting after the offensive board Both Hubstead and Posey capable offensive rebounders Copeland goes spin cycle Cant finish but Vin Allen Luben can He gets the first basket for NC State in the second half And thats probably appropriate because as well as hes been playing overall his second half numbers have been incredible this year and van out a little bit Especially tonight hes going to have those opportunities to get second and third chances at the rim Texas Southern does a tough struggles in terms of finishing possessions Hayes darts to the rim met by Sier First time that he has played in the front court as a starter with Vin Allen Luben And heres the numbers Yeah first half look hes shooting it well But in the second half 78 He had a streak of 24 made field goals in the second half of games that spanned five game stretch Just simply didnt miss Humpstead doesnt miss An acrobatic shot to beat the shot clock buzzer He does lead the ACC by the way 67 overall 6 two3 of his shots going in Good find Copeland And how do you shoot 67 You got to be good at basketball but you get a lot of looks like that That helps Cardier Copeland hes definitely the straw that steers the drink for this NC State team especially on the offensive end Guys like Van Luben thrive off of those opportunities that Quadira Copeland opens up Upstead blocked by Vin Allen Luben but again he and Posey both getting after it crashing the glass NC State plus 10 on the boards right now but Texas Southern is quite capable again Copeland finds Luben Same spot this time in and one Van Alubin does a great job of rolling to the basket of Quadir screen As you seen there the defender tried to ice it so he did so that he cant go off and Van Alubin does a great job of putting himself in position to catch a great pass from Guardier Copeland Thats excellent pick and roll action on that play And something you complimented again leading the league just above Henry Vasar of North Carolina You complimented his screens in the first half We saw in that replay hes getting to the correct spot but not rushing it Its easy to to kind of not really set a good screen Youre not fully slipping it Youre just in such a rush to get to your spot in your offense But he really as a veteran kind of understands how to do both Exactly And thats what leads to the opportunities Its a technique Bryce Roberts with the three ball The grad student from Bojer City Seems like theres been a point of emphasis and Allen Luben Quiet first half offensively They are getting him a touch every time down Get a piece of the paint Corner three Good offense from the Tigers McNeel first three of the second half He picked up right where he left off Eight threepointers One shy of tying the NC State single game record Oh teardrop Alex Anderson with a tough make Anderson does a great job of driving the basketball Reed taps in his own miss So a new careerh high for Paul McNeel Jr now 29 points Roberts starting to find his rhythm from downtown Hes got eight points backto back threes Again hes been a double figure scorer every game this year Breed spotted up and shot ready And once again Van Alubin doing a great job of setting up his man and hitting him with a screen which led to the easy threepoint opportunity for the Wolfpack Cupstead boy both teams shooting the lights out here to start the second half Upstead now with the team best 11 points MCNEEL HATE CHECK COUNTED AND ONE HES ON FIRE A career night for Paul McNeil Paul McNeel Jr A record tying night so far Casey you were a good threepoint shooter Youve played with some really good threepoint shooters Have you ever seen anything like this Nothing like this Paul McNeel has got going early and the atmosphere is feeding into it Hes embracing it and this is a shooters gym for sure Ben Allen Luben got the rejection initially and a foul I think its on Yes it is on 22 And this is what NC State was hoping to get from Paul McNeel this year Hes really matured Hes grown a lot into his sophomore year You got a glimpse when he went for 24 against Wake Forest late in the year last year and hes had some big games like the 27 against UNCCG had 20 against Texas but have been pretty quiet since then He has been in the zone tonight Turnover here Pauls going to have the shots that hes made tonight Hes going to have those opportunities in games coming up right This is not a game where Texas Southern is the only is the only team thats going to give up those looks He stepped up into this game confident and he has to keep that same energy going for the rest of the season So two quick fouls in the second half for Ben Allen Luben I believe thats four on him cheering And so he got off to a quick start with a few layups here to start the second half And theyll go to the bench with the four fouls And NC State Sier we saw Bouet for a good bit five minutes in the first half fight We see him for some extended minutes in a second Made free throw allows the Tigers to set up their pressure Sier eventually fouled scrambling against the press Texas Southern is very scrappy Very scrappy And one thing that theyre testing tonight is NC States ball security trying to get them to make quick decisions And NC State has been very solid at that part of the game We just saw a turnover in the corner from Abel Hollowman turns it over here Houston after this one They get Abene Christian on Monday Played him last year Theyll play him again this year Nice soft bounce Dwayne Posey Dang Hits the underside of the backboard I think it just got up in the air and didnt have any passing option Just tried to throw it up Hayes attacks baseline Roberts has already hit two this half Cant hit this time and tapped out by Posey The middle of the pack in the swag Picked fifth 12 team league The Cookman preseason favorites They forgot all about Sier and it is a goend He was in the dunker spot Elected to lay it One more remaining Officials Oh Able with a steal and a layup applause and cheering Great job by Matt Ael reading the defenders eyes He does a great job of playing the gaps Officials Bert Smith Tommy Moresy and Ryan Cisano 3 2 1 applause Deng for three Thats a big shot for Deng A pullup three in transition If a guy his size is making that shot thats huge for the Wolfpack And again when you talk about opportunity Deng did not play against Kansas but hes gotten in the flow of this game and hit a couple of triples Sier over the back with the foul So bring us to another timeout in day break Some people here brought their ugly Christmas sweater and some just Christmas sweaters Some of them their ugly Christmas sweater Casey youre far too fashionable to have an ugly Christmas sweater You got to have at least one You got to have one Got to have at least one Hayes forced into a tough two able in transition for three Couple threes hes taking a little flat tonight Yeah hes been trying to get in the rhythm and it started for him on the defensive end but like you said hes been flat in terms of his shot Well theyre tough on him They coach him up because he has game But wait let him play it through his mistakes and thats big for him and his growth as a player Thats partly what the nonconference is is for You you you said uh the Kansas game was a lesson for this team a lesson learned a chance to grow Touch pass initial find and then Sier almost like a volleyball So you know Reynolds Coliseum is the home of NC State volleyball As Copeland found him he kind of set this up almost like a setter setting up Jerry Deng Quick tap applause Home of NC State volleyball wrestling womens basketball They have their ACC home opener on this floor tomorrow night against Georgia Tech Gymnastics 2 was honored here at midc court during one of the timeouts And Andrew this atmosphere for all the sports is its electric You got to see that uh during the halftime break if you didnt get up to to get a snack and the the history of course of Reynolds Coliseum and then you combine that with the renovation Kesi off on the three and they did the renovation in 2016 and added the Hall of Fame and and the Grand Hall and they really got it right to keep some of the the history and the aesthetic and also make it nice and new And this is a place that is very tough to play And we showed you the graphic early on uh when the mens team comes and plays here but also the womens team here since the renovation they win about 90 of their home games And thats big and that that is huge Talk about a homec court advantage In case you were wondering when is Paul McNeel going to get back in this game Hes at the scorers table now Jerry Deng hes been making plenty of threes with McNeel out Hes picked right up And NC State has knocked down 14 threepointers tonight And Im a huge fan of Jerry Deng I mean the way he stretches the floor his versatility to play under the basket or out its very valuable And I would expect to see more of him as the season advances Deng now with three triples tonight Roberts trying to answer a little short in game one of the Will Wade era The red reckoning Deng cues it up Splash NC State made 19 threepointers Dang right there Number 15 Still almost 10 minutes left Breed a steel COPELAND REVERSE FLUSH applause and Hollerman a foul on Hubstead That is I believe the seventh and itll be one and one So the Tigers in the bonus the rest of the way No pardon me sixth Man they put that up on the board fast I thought I looked up quick enough Good Holland able to save it behind his back after Jordan Hamilton who just subbed in Senior from Memphis missed the baseline jumper So McNeel back in the game Dang continues to let it rip That one no good again If youre just joining us yeah NC State averages about 87 points per game They have that with 9 minutes left Paul McNeel Jr has tied the program record with nine made threepointers Hes nine for 11 Hes made six free throws as well a career best 33 points Hollowin the lob And theres the hustle again Hubstead has a motor and it is not stopped Able able to keep that pivot foot I would not be surprised if they look for Paul McNeel as this game approaches the end Im Im Im sure theyre going to draw up something for him You got to find him one or two more shots at least You got to run something You have to Yeah Theres plenty of time left for him to do it 33 points You know just the other day your old teammate Dennis Parker Jr scored 53 for Radford Yeah Which was the most by any D1 player I think I saw since 2019 Yeah And he made it look easy That was a phenomenal performance by Dennis Parker Jr I mean yeah in the NBA youre playing 48 minutes but in college 30 is a big deal Yeah And McNeel has 33 here with 8 minutes plus left The Wolfpack press takes it away ABLE RISES UP AND THROWS IT DOWN applause cheering Nearly another steal reachin foul Be one and one here for Hayes When we come back cheering they shoot it well as a team Its been mostly McNeel tonight Deng has connected for four Cuadier Copeland Allen Breed both chipped in with one Theres Deng cheering The last three we saw from McNeel was a heat check It was NBA range He was fouled on it and still made it Here it is for the record Almost got the bounce Abubet another offensive rebound and he was fouled And as we seen from NC State theyre looking for Paul McNeel Paul McNeel to shoot and make one more three I think this place will go electric especially the bench There were a couple oos and as in the crowd as a bubet who has a unique free throw hit nothing but the bottom of the net right there I dont know if thats the crowd knowing I mean now with social media there could be a buzz at halftime You check your phone Hey he could get the record You know I wonder how many people in the building are aware of it McNeel again in and out Well that looked like it might be a clean block from Weisinger but McNeel look to add to his careerhigh from the free throw line here Hes been doing it all shooting snorts running his lanes getting attempts at the rim Such a complete game for Paul McNeil tonight You talk about being in the zone I I think this is that amplified I dont know what how to even to describe big time a night like that You talking about nine made threes It started as soon as the ball was tipped He made it four and four minutes to start the game He made it clear he was going to be the aggressor tonight Henderson with a good find and Hayes connects Abubet lays it in NC State breaks down the pressure Theres the uptempo from the Tigers SHOWTIME applause Strong finish by Blue Bay with the emphasis That was a power dunk Posey goes up to save a turnover Then Aubé skies for the block cheering Hes making his case for some more minutes Hes fun to watch Hes doing it all Thats big time man Nothing but ball And Arsenal fouls Hayes on the three trying to get around that screen Again NC State with 15 made threes had 19 in the opener against NC Central cheering Unforgettable first game for Coach Wade They scored 114 points I dont know if well get that tonight but if this continues with this pace both teams are are happy to run playoff tempo Its possible It is possible especially if they end up you know making 19 or more threes How about that 22 games in the league in a 100 or more second most ever And before McNeel can take the three got an offensive foul on the screen Once again NC State trying to get a look for Paul McNeel Tigers playing two bigs right now Gerki who got the start and has the ball outside Caresi also 610 and 611 respectively as Gerki goes into McNeel and commits the foul Well when youre having a career night thats I mean it it was some contact but you get knocked down but take free throws out of it and a chance to add to the career best Its just been one of those nights for Paul McNeel finding a way to get easy baskets and whether its threes layups or even at the free throw line finding a way applause Up to 36 37 Perfect 10 of 10 from the line to go along with the nine threes So if he does break the record hell have 40 McNeel with his easiest points of the night 39 for Paul McNeel Jr And Pauls been getting whatever he wanted tonight against this Texas Southern team cheering And credit to his teammates for finding them In transition MCNEEL program record HIS 10TH MADE THREE OF THE NIGHT 42 POINTS applause cheering THATS A huge accomplishment for Paul McNeel cheering Many here in Reynolds Coliseum on their feet witnessing history cheering And NC State looking to be one of those NCAA tournament teams That is obviously the goal Coach Wade felt like hes got the squad to be able to get to the NCAA tournament in year one Heres part of the reason it takes talent good coaching but
