three 17th alltime meeting between Pit and Clemson The opening tip controlled by the Tigers who played here in mid January last year one on this court 7875 in overtime Theyve won 13 in a row in the series Pit has not defeated Clemson since 2014 A lot of history between the programs Opening possession for the Panthers Godfrey working it on the inside and hes got two And this is the matchup we highlighted at the top Corhs got a deal with Godfrey inside Hes got a couple of inches on him but Godfrey is wide He loves angles and like I said Pittsburgh cannot afford to have Corin in foul trouble Godfrey had 14 points a team high in the win at the dome this week against Syracuse for the Tigers team that theyve defeated five times in a row Out of the corner its a three and its good Caleppa for Pit Heres the big Aussie freshman from down under He was five for six from three in that win over Penn State Dont want to see him get hot cuz he is a bull inside Yeah only one of four though from threepoint distance in the loss at Miami this week to the Panthers for CPA Godfrey on the block Twisting shot High degree of difficulty Able to get separation again Not a super tall player but he is old and he is wy The senior 67 240 and a transfer from Georgia after spending his first two years in college basketball in Tiger Town as a member of the Clemson Tigers Classic transfer portal story in Godfrey Like you said two years at Clemson went away to Athens and found out that the grass is actually greener in Clemson Came back See Aleppa spinning in the lane Hes got the bucket at the other end for Pit Yeah if youre Clemson you dont want to see him get confident See Aleppo the freshman that made three was his 10th of the season Follows it up with a conventional basket 54 pit early going right down the lane off the glass and good from Porter Pretty hot on the offensive end These two teams not necessarily their DNA Could be fun if they keep it up You were talking about Georgia Thats the team that Clemson defeated in the championship game of the Charleston Classic And Justin Porter was the MVP of that tournament Charleston South Carolina Coren Andrew Situs Lot of dribbling and the shot clock dwindling Down to five Hand with a size advantage Cant exploit it Dylan Hunter Carter Welling lost it out of bounds A foul was called Brad Brown L 16th year as the head coach of the Clemson Tigers Recently had his 300th win as the Tigers headman on December 13th against Mercer And I dont care where you are or what level youre coaching at to stay at one place for 16 years talks about integrity Talks about high level quality control in the program and thats what Brad Brownell has done Yeah its pretty amazing Seemed like every year he was on that coaches on the hot seat list I think he set a record for the streak and now hes the longest tenure coach in the ACC Just got his 300th win at Clemson Hes won everywhere hes been Different type of season though for him Theyve had a lot of consistency with their roster but Dylan Hunter is the only guy who came back He brought in six transfers cheering So hes having coached a little differently than hes been used to Wallain runs it up Godfrey will shoot that Welling Godfrey and Coran fighting for the loose ball and its won by Coran Clemsons bigs can stretch it Thats going to be a challenge for Pittsburgh Didnt go down that time but if Wellings going to be that open hell let it fly Hes gone nine for 26 this season from three Panthers six and three on their home court so far this year as the shot clock goes down to eight is what Pittsburgh does They love to go deep in that clock Out of bounds and well take a timeout with the visiting Tigers out in front of the Panthers and Jeff Cable here on CW Courtside Saturday And thats made them very very thin in the front court Been kind of an up and down season for Pittsburgh Great win here over Ohio State on a buzzer beater by DeMarco Miner but then they also lost it home to Quinnipic and Hustra So a little bit uneven but pretty high ceiling if they can get everybody on the same page Tigers took the ball back momentarily and now play stops with 1550 on the clock Quick adjustment to the shot clock You know people forget the year before Jeff Cable came to Pittsburgh they were 0 and8 in the ACC so nowhere to go but up Hes done a solid job here over the years Not not an easy place to win in this environment in college athletics Tigers are 11 and three on the season Theyve won four in a row The win at the dome wins against Cincinnati South Carolina and Mercer Well got away with a bump there Porter misses on the twisting shot of the paint Thats what Pittsburgh really needs is to keep the action on the defensive glass This is Miner who hit that gamewinner from about 30 ft away against Ohio State to beat the buzzer on this floor Got to send it back out Caleeppa driving Had that ball on his hip Couldnt calculate the angle It spins off Hunter slams on the brakes Spins and misses Caleppa waiting for reinforcements Witherspoon has come into the game for Pit He wears number eight in white This is Miner behind the line Long rebound still available all the way back to Miner So far Pittsburgh doing a good job on the glass Clemson one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country Miner straight away for three for the Panthers Minerss had a major impact here partner Wellraveled One year in junior college two years at SIU Edwardsville last year at Oregon State They knew hed be good Im not sure they knew hed be quite this good and thats big to get him going early on Averages close to 11 points per game four rebounds shoots 46 from the floor and hes a 91 free throw shooter Just made his 28th three of the season to lead the team in a congested area Whistle stops play Selea defending first on Cppa Tigers came into this building last year mid January Won a thriller in overtime Chase Hunter older brother of Dylan had 20 points and made five threepointers Theyll also play later this month January 31st and thatll be in Clemson South Carolina That team went 182 in the ACC Got bounced in the first round by McNiss the fastest growing cable news network in all of television is News Nation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom Clemsons gone almost three minutes without scoring with Gotfrey at the free throw line One of the reasons for that is because they have yet to have an offensive rebound only three misses so far But Pittsburgh been dominated on the glass at times this season especially down at Miami So that was priority number one for Jeff Cable Talked to him before the game is getting on the defensive glass prevents the other team from scoring but it also ignites your transition game which gives you some open threepointers in transition as opposed to having to play against the half court defense Lee Cassell all over that call to award the ball to Pit which got out rebounded by Miami 4328 The loss on Tuesday 7669 in Coral Gables Florida Pit went on a 20 to nothing run in the first half and lost that game You say How does that happen Well Clemson did them one better 21 nothing on a run against BYU in the Garden and ended up losing that game Shot clock is down to five for Coran Delense scores He loves to go to that left shoulder on the baseline Nick Davidson couldnt handle him down there Nice start for the Panthers here at home Corhenss played a lot of minutes Hes fifth in the conference 34 minutes per game playing in his 107th career game And all of that in the ACC two years at Florida State in his second year in the program and the Tigers throw it away Love the energy on defense for Pittsburgh as well They have got to get down and guard because theyre limited on the offensive end This guys been good though He loves to make some space with his body and then turn over that left shoulder No help coming on a double team Thats going to be a high percentage shot for Cameron Coran four double doubles this season including the win that we referenced against Ohio State where he had 18 points and 10 boards See Aleppa inside He got fouled Couple of defenders crowding him inside Fouled against the Tigers Terrific drive by Witherspoon to set it up Nothing like getting into that paint and getting downhill Attack the rim Get the help rotation Dish it off to the Aussie Up of course was the top rugby prospect amongst high school ranks I assume they have some type of rivalscom or 247 sports or Seth Davis rugby rankings Whatever the rankings are that would be maybe an enterprise I could get into the high school rugby rankings in Australia But Jeff Cable loves his physicality First time in his life hes only playing one sport by the way So hes f he did play basketball back home brought him over with his physicality and he has shown skills as well You know Seth you mentioned that win against Penn State which by the way was in Hershey Pennsylvania Caleppa had 28 points in that game a season high and made five threepointers Hed only made three all season Something about playing in Hershey Maybe the smell of the chocolate got him going Well you know it worked for well Will Chamberlain a long time ago It did He put up a Hondao Siluppa didnt quite do that but now that was Hershey Park Arena Its since been renovated and renamed the Giant Center but right there next to the park and all the rides and everything There you go Going to score 28 and going the super duper looper Thats a day But a Johnson out of the corner right in front of the pit bench for three Thats now 132 made threes in his career for Butter Johnson three years in the UAB program prior to joining Clemson Foul coming up against the Tigers Teams are a combined nine for 15 from the floor We got some offensive efficiency here man Look at Butter getting across the lane Very slow rotation coming over wide open Senior from Huntsville Alabama His uncle nicknamed him when he was just a young boy Hes hes only a 29 threepoint shooter as well So theres a reason hes open Might be that kind of day Out of bounds Tiger basketball So the freshman for Pittsburgh Kieran Mullen is in the game Jeff Cable told me the the intention was to potentially red shirt him coming into the season but because of the uh medical issue with Deshawn Jackson and now Papa Amadu Kante two bigs not available Mullens been pressed into action Nick Davidson lost it Hit on the run See Aleppo trying to get to the rim and he got bumped underneath Chase Thompson for the Tigers was in the neighborhood Thats why you want to get the transition game going Like I said you dont have to go up against the half court offense Nice find there topppa on the baseline by Andraitis Freshman Chase Thompson from Minnesota committing the foul underneath that one just bounces out for Witherspoon Unlucky bounce is a huge asset to music have Nice piece for the Panthers Last three games hes averaged 17 points per game above his season average just under nine per game Hes getting a breather right now on the cable bench Witherspoon had nowhere to go Born to the back court scooped up Porter off the glass and good He went chest to chest with Cummings By the way I was correct as we were going to break Brad Brownell did a line change like a hockey coach Subbed in five for five Thats what you have when you have quality depth If you dont have guys on the bench who can play you can get as mad as you want Youre not putting them in the game Coach Brownell told us doesnt really necessarily have a star player but a lot of solid guys who can compete in the ACC Coran gobbled up the loose ball He lost it on the way up and its back to the Tigers It was on the defensive end that Brad Brownell was unhappy Lets see if the second line can do any better welling off the mark Clemson still does not have an offensive rebound That one just comes off the front edge of the rim The Tigers want to run Porter steps across and off the glass Beautiful Love the euro Hes been a nice find after three years at Middle Tennessee two years junior college before that Actually scored 41 points for Middle Tennessee in a game at UTEP last year Made 84 threepointers last year as the Tigers are on a 70 run And Pit has missed its last five shots See Justin Porter here If you want to score go get the ball on defense finishing through contact with the left and then the Euro on the other side These teams play slow but they will try to score in transition Early clock late clock Grad student from Houston Texas Justin Porter second leading scoreer on the team behind RJ Godfrey Porter well on his way to his average of 104 points per game forehand the handoff and Cummings Porter doing it on the defensive end as well against Cummings He wants to stay on the court Shot clocks at five Cummings weaving his way Drops it off to Gorehead Beautiful play by Brandon Cummings Clemson having a really tough time today stopping dribble penetration Twopoint Tiger lead Just past midway through this first half of action at CW Courtside Saturday Tom Wormy Seth Davis our outstanding production crew with you from Peterson Event Center with the shot clock at seven and a whistle cheering I think were going to get a foul on Corand in the post Musting down there with Godfrey Just too bad Just a really good defensive possession You see Cummings getting inside the paint putting Carter Welling into help Hes got to make a decision Do you stay with your man or do you go to the ball Guard makes the right read cheering Easy deuce but now we got a foul on the other end Only his first Cummings the under younger brother of Nelly Cummings who was a part of that 2023 NCAA tournament team here at Pit Look at Marco Miner guarding the ball I love Pittsburghs defensive energy here this first half Godfrey put the shoulder down and to see Aleppo who absorbed that contact Shot clocks down to one on the baseline and its Porter Justin Porter show right now for Clemson Hes been their only offense these last few minutes Feel like Pittsburghs been playing well but here they are down four Porter who had nine points on the road at Syracuse this week was four of eight from the floor Hes been impressive so far for the Tigers Cummings is a oneonone with Porter Too much dribbling Try to go back door Corre with the pass Trying to connect with Dunning Jr in a whistle stops play Right now the Justin Porter show hes been doing it inside hes been doing it outside Now this is a tough fadeaway baseline and especially killer coming at the end of the shot clock Thats the worst for a defensive team You play good defense for 28 seconds and they still score Very dispiriting Eight points in the game for Porter Four of five from the floor Leading scoreer right now Caleppa has six for Pit to lead the way for the Panthers in the first half Tries to lob it into Corhan Tough catch Double team doesnt stop him Double fisted rim rocker from Corhan Pittsburgh loves to get Coran on the move They bring him out for a ball screen and then he rolls in and steals his man Grown man play Strong underneath Corang He and Godfrey are really mixing it up on the interior Entry pass Godfrey with a jam at the other end And a technical foul has been called He might may have said something I dont know if there was a taunting involved You know you cant say anything And that was a beautiful delivery by the big fella Nick Davidson Jamal Spearman was right on top of it and called the technical on Godfrey You see the delivery dunk hung on the rim Said a little something to the other fella Cannot do that RJ cannot do that And by the way the reason why theyre emphasizing this is not because that act itself was so bad but they dont want that to be the first domino and have it escalate over the game RJs still trying to make his case Demarco Min on appeal I dont know Probably not So Miner took the technical free throws A career 86 free throw shooter As Seth mentioned he is well traveled as he walks it up for the Panthers Bigger issues is now 146 points in the paint for Clemson So they are asserting their physicality inside which of course is the game plan A driving Cummings gets fouled How about Cam Corhen inside Seth grown man Jim You see him on the move Gets the freshman seals him shows him the hand gets the orange Youre watching CW Courtside music Saturday only on the CW Fourth leading scoreer in the ACC Boopy Miller almost 20 points per game He and his teammates trying to defend the home court against North Carolina one of the four ranked teams out of the ACC Theyve been strong early season Yeah really important game for SMU You got to start building up that NCAA tournament resume You got a chance to get a music quad one win at home You got to take advantage It will not be easy How good is Caleb Wilson Like someday I want to visit the planet where he is from North Carolina 12th in the nation 131 is the overall record for the Tar Hills And they will be on the road against SMU 215 Eastern Game two CW court Saturday Cummings at the free throw line for Pit We are one of six games on the schedule today applause Twopoint Tiger lead We dont have anyone in this game whos got more than one foul So its been a very cleanly played game Both teams shooting the ball pretty well 59 and 43 Godfrey against Core What a matchup Has to kick it back out to Porter Looks at the shot clock Tries to drive it Cummings reached in deflected it away And now Miner a stumble and a foul Much of Pits offense starts with Cameron Corin in that high ball screen They got some guys who can drive and create but Pittsburgh is much better offensively when the ball is moving and everybodys cutting and theyre playing five as one They have a tendency to get into a little bit of a hero ball situation and it doesnt work out as well for him But they got some guys who can cook I can tell you that So Godfrey is on the bench as is Porter who just picked up his second personal foul of the first half 91 this season for DeMarco Miner One of the really neat stories in college basketball By the way I mentioned your junior college two at SIU Edwardsville last year Oregon State talked to him a little bit before the game and he talked about how much he appreciates this coaching staff and particularly Jeff Cable kind of being emotionally available that it is a struggle at times and an adjustment when you come to this level and this role Its not easy and when things dont go well instead of crushing the kid sort of let him know that you empathize and you understand what hes going through and youre here to help Its a very effective way of communicating and he he made a point to tell me how much he appreciates that Nick Davidson with a three Rocking the rim for the Tigers Well thats something that Clemson really wants Nick Davidson was a really good player at Nevada last year Average 166 and a half rebounds 37 from three Hes had difficulty with the transition to this level cheering So nice to see him get going early on for Clemson Going to get Welling for the foul on the Cam Corhend drive Davidson can step out All these Clemson bigs not Godfrey hes your inside guy but the other three bigs 610 and higher can step out Corhan forcing the issue as well Pittsburghs been on the attack About the kind of game we expected not real highscoring game slow tempo physical well played well coached And youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Cam Coran at the free throw line for the Panthers Thats one of two for the 64 free throw shooter and the senior from Allen Texas Cummings goes to the bench for Pit to get a breather Witherspoon off of that Jeff Cable bench Dylan Hunter A lot of fancy dribbling Buckner drops it off Welling put it on the floor Lost it Active hands cheering Active hands And it starts with Miners pressure on the basketball Look at that pass Oh you got to catch that Caleppa couldnt handle the hot potato and its out of bounds And back to the Tigers Thought maybe it was a rugby pass Demarco Miners pressure on the basketball is elite He is locked in Dylan Hunter is a senior point guard Lots of experience Knows what hes doing Wien got inside and then missed from close range applause A foul going against the Tigers 202 Welling picked up his second personal Thats Wallen 10 in orange He gave the foul to Welling with that foul pitting the double bonus here with 610 to go in the first half I saw one official with the 11 indication which would have been Nick Davidson Well get it cleared up Dunning junior at the free throw line for Pit here again Looked like it was that push off Yeah Carter Welling there Got caught with the hands on the back Foul shooting has been a big time problem for Pittsburgh this season 303rd in the country but now 8 for 12 early on Clemson has not made a free throw 0 for two So thats plus eight for Pittsburgh from the line and we are tied Crossing the sixminute threshold of the first half Witherspoon defending and picking up the foul Yeah its a chippy You dont want to play with your hands out there Stay in position Tigers working on a fourame winning streak after the win Wednesday at Syracuse 6461 They struggled from threepoint distance in that game just four of 16 Johnson lets it fly Coren got a piece of it Hunter runs it down Thats their first offensive rebound comes off of a long miss and they had a mismatch inside with DeMarco Miner going trying to deal with Nick Davidson inside and good recognition to throw him the basketball You got to recognize you see Miner trying to front him and all you can do is try to beat him up Hes talking to forehand about not leaving him and not putting him position on that switch This is Hunter comes up a little bit short Ball bounces around Davidson grabs it and cleans up the mess Ill tell you what this is exactly what Brad Brownell asked Santa Claus for An elevation from Nick Davidson Hes had a really good first half Five points two rebounds and an assist Over three minutes without a made field goal for Pit Coran trying to end that and he will Straight away with a three Big fella stroking it home Seventh made three of the season There is a Tiger player shaking up with the baseline That is Godfrey for the Tigers So the training staff attending to Godfrey on that baseline Matter of fact coach Brownell will walk over as well Told you about RJ Godfrey who spent the first two years of his collegiate career with the Tigers being helped up by his head coach Went to Georgia decided to come back to Tiger Town father played football at Georgia and he was a an important player on Clemsons Elite 8 team and hes got a feeling he wanted to check out things elsewhere And by the way its a great story and a great lesson not only if youre a coach and also just in life You know Brad Brownell could have been angry and could have said some nasty things as RJ went out the door hugged him said Ill help you however I can the rest of your life Good feelings And even though Godfrey started every game at Georgia didnt didnt go like he thought not only on the court but at the university the culture has to come back and it was all good cheering Davidson trying to save it and he gets helped up by Jason Cable assistant to his brother Jeff Its good to see Godfrey get up leave under his own power I dont know if he took a blow to the gut It looked like he was kind of doubled over like he had gotten hit Wasnt favoring anything legwise So hopefully hell refresh and get back in the game He is the Tigers leading scoreer this season right now on their bench and trailing by one of the Pit Panthers Pit six and three on its home floor this season First home ACC game for Pit Shot clock is at eight Miner elevates and hits for three for Pit Really good defensive possession for Clemson Better offense from Miner Pit now four for five from three Miners got two of those Hes got nine points in the game for the Panthers Davidson attacking the glass backing his way in on the smaller player Barry Dunning at 66 going to have a hard time dealing with that Clemson doing a good job with your interior ball screens getting that switch and then taking advantage of the size mismatches Pit averages about nine made threes per game That is right in the middle of the conference rankings You can see the energy picking up for Clemson on the defensive end as well Inside of three and a half minutes to go in the first half Shot clock is down to three Gorehead over Davidson Ace Buckner brings it up Nick Davidson doing it at both ends Heres the strip Lean lost it Dunning tries to run it up Pass is broken up Beautiful strip by Buckner Thats how you stay on the play Red shirt freshman from Dallas Texas Father Greg played for the Tigers in the mid 90s Current assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks Davidson is open for three Wallen over the top Committed the foul for the Tigers cheering We got buckets here music in the P Look at the big fella Cameron Corhan Dont leave me open Dont leave me open What kind of disrespect music is that Demarco Miner slash Panthers by game on the season and theyve only shot two today and have not made one So its eight to nothing on the foul line And in a low possession game lowscoring game that foul line is going to be determinative Jeff Cable would say were doing a great job defending without fouling Brad Brownell might have a couple of conversations with the three officials Were Switzerland over here Im just giving you numbers All right Im not saying Im just saying its 8 nothing on the foul laughter Now 9 nothing on the foul Pit this season 68 is a team that is 16th in the ACC Yeah but that is history Thats the irony They havent been able to cash in 10 for 14 now Pit also four for five from three Only up four but theyll take it Tigers have two made threes from Butter Johnson and Nick Davidson And by the way state the semiobvious Not only is it the points differential but youre not getting your guys in foul trouble And when you dont have much of a bench thats absolutely huge Corin set the big screen for Witherspoon Ball bounces around and Buckers able to get back to it after he ran the Cororehand Got his cage rattled on that screen That three is a miss Offensive glass Godfrey back into the game and an immediate impact after the miss by Johnson from threepoint distance Good to see Godfrey back into the lineup for the Tigers He was shaken up a moment ago Yeah he sure was You want to talk about a Clemson type player Little undersized at the five Johnson with the miss just beat Corin to the ball and then the strong finish inside Witherspoons got to just wall up there You walk into him youre going to get called every time 67 240 lbs at the free throw line RJ Godfrey cheering So hes missed all of his free throws and all of them been short so far Looking for the old school threepoint play twopoint game inside of two minutes to go in our first half Cummings got tied up by Hunter The arrow favors Pit I dont know Isnt that against the rule That must be against some rule If its not against the rule its going to be his 114th game in a Tiger uniform He is their leading threepoint shooter by percentage as well They may need him second half action Witherspoon Fancy dribble Coran another screen to free up Witherspoon Really good job boxing out Butter Johnson on Corhan Didnt get the rebound but provided Oh Godfrey and Cummings contact midair and both fell awkwardly Cummings trying to make an aggressive defensive play He is up Godfrey being helped up by his team And I think theyre going to look at this and see if its a flagrant It didnt look like it in real time They make I think I think theyre going to call that You know why Because he brought his hands down And if you go up in the air like that with an airborne player if he keeps his hands up hes all right Even though hes going for the ball the common foul is under further review My guess is they elevate I think you have to I really think you have to Right So flagrant one excessive andor unnecessary Flagrant two extreme andor unnecessary So well see if we get the elevation on the defensive play by Cummings Yeah that should not be a two in my opinion Tom Theyre looking at it Obviously a one is two in the ball A flare two is an automatic ejection Lee Cassell Tony Chiaza Jamal Spearman at the monitor from Stansion Cam And you can see in midair It was an awkward fall for both players Luckily both escaped the aftermath Although Godfrey whos already been down once in this game with an awkward fall and that really is the indicator Seth once a player youre youre entitled to your column right going straight up Once those arms come down right now the play comes into question right And when theres any type of contact above the shoulders the offending player is basically guilty until proven innocent you know if youre not sure whether its a flagrant it probably is a flagrant And they do that you know to protect the safety Thats why they changed the uh the charge rule and they make they made it more difficult to take a charge Common fouls confirmed So they didnt elevate it Interesting Ill have to ask that question He did go for the ball so maybe thats the distinguisher So the foul on Brandon Cummings and Godfrey is at the free throw line Im surprised at that frankly obviously But I think maybe what decides it is they decide hes going for the ball and it becomes a legitimate basketball play First made free throw of the game for Godfrey who had been 0 for three Kickoff 2026 with NXT New Years Evil on the CW The superstars of NXT collide in a night built for action shocks and mushy moments One night no limits pure evil NXT New Years Evil Tuesday right here on the CW So Godfrey has tied us up at 30 Its been physical entertaining and exciting so far in the first quarter Not the game that we expected Both teams came to play This is conference play now Were in January Things are getting real Both these teams trying to build an NCA tournament resume The Tigers won their first ACC game on the road as Cummings may have committed yet another foul Hes whistled on the foul as Buckner was trying to bring it up Thats going to be his second Nice trip by Buckner And that thats one where you just got to go back and play I think you get a little bit of frustrated because you lose the ball and you let your emotions get away from you and you commit a foul 77 on the season for Ace Buckner Red shirt freshman Dallas Texas His father Greg played 10 years in the NBA Dallas Philadelphia Denver Minnesota Memphis and as you can see a current assistant in the NBA Yeah Im long past the point of being surprised shocked disappointed flumxed by seeing the the progeny of players that Ive covered and Im still covering their kids Buckner had his best game against the Palmetto State rival South Carolina with 19 points Also seven rebounds Both of the those season highs for Buckner Im getting more minutes after the loss of a freshman point guard Zack Foster three games ago to an ACL Inside of a minute to play and its Cummings attacking the rack Hes been attacking all day Dribble penetration continues to be an issue for Clemson He is the third leading scoreer on the team Over 12 points per game for Brandon Cummings a sophomore Midland Pennsylvania Entry Davidson Quick turnaround foul Once again they get to switch Demarco DeMarco Miner with a big height advantage on the interior Thats step one And step two is the recognition Nick A good job by Butter Johnson with the find So Demarco Miner 6 feet Nick Davidson 610 And but you got Davidson and you also have RJ Godfrey whos a little bit shorter but hes a great post player And Cameron Coran cant guard them both So if you do enough switching and screening eventually youll get the mismatch 71 Had a great halfway Yeah 71 free throw shooter Three years in the Nevada program before coming to the Tigers experienced players In fact a lot of experienced players on this Clemson team Now nine points and three rebounds here in the first half for Nick Davidson Only averages eight on the season So the Tigers have gone in front Gotten some points from the free throw line late in this half About a 9second difference game and shot for Cummings Stop and start finds Miner Elevates and hits the three ball from Miner Miner can play the point You can move him off the ball for a catch and shoot What a big time fall away threepoint shot Hunter in the final seconds trying to match it with a three front rim Panthers five of six from threepoint distance including the way for the Tigers with 10 Porter had eight Nick Davidson had nine points Porter trying to add to his total and he cant do it Miner had it for a moment Caleppa comes away with it Good job defending in the post and then getting the defensive rebounds Kind of a quiet first half for Caleppa Maybe they get him going here in the second 20 Not for DeMarco Miner Three made threes on four attempts and 12 points He led him in scoring in the first 20 minutes Caleppa on the entry against Welling with position Strong bucket for 13 White He is not intimidated by going up against taller defenders I got a feeling hes used to it Eight points for Caleppa after that bucket early in the second half So glad that youre with us on CW Courtside Saturday North Carolina and SMU to follow us Thats Hunter in rhythm with the jumper which was contested I hope RJ Goffrey never sends a ball sets a ball screen on me Thats like running into a brick wall Stay here at the table Seth Well keep you safe Yeah please Corhead Dunning tried a little twoman game Might have been a kick there Wallen defending for the Tigers And again see giving up a good five in to Carter Welling but he might not be as tall but he is wide You can see Demarco Miner stumbling after getting screened away by Godfrey Seven Hunter makes him pay First basket of the game for Hunter for the Tigers Shot clock is at 10 for Pit Godfrey on Caleppa Miner Not this time Welling over the top of the board Welling second on the team in rebounding Five and a half per game Deep three is in and out Halfway down for Wine Wallen has yet to score Only a second shot Marlene spent two years at Utah before coming to the Clemson program This is Miner in the corner Creates a little distance Weak side seea tried to bounce it off the Tigers Couldnt do it Pittsburghs offense looks a little stagnant right now Tom They need to move that ball Get the defense moving from side to side Then you drive Godfrey against Corhan Godfrey over Corhan Nothing you can do there but foul him And Corh didnt want to do that RJ Godfrey with 12 points You can tell hes a son of a football player Hasnt missed a shot either Seth Hes five for five Godfrey got back defensively Injuritus tried to make a move for the Panthers Couldnt convert He is also yet to score and went 0 for six against Miami See Aleppa got a piece of it and bounced it into the second row RJ Godfrey is the guy Hes going to show up at the playground when hes like 40 and no ones going to think he can do anything Hes going to have short shorts and goggles and knee pads and hes going to bust all the young punks on the playground cuz he is a grown man and he knows how to use his leverage He can finish with both hands Stays within his game Just a pleasure to watch Like Buckner committed the foul on Miner Talking about Godfrey Hes in the double digits for the 11th time this season for the Tigers as their leading scorer Yeah hes their leading scoreer But you know theyve had seven different seven different guys lead them in scoring in games this year Five different athlets got six guys who average between nine and 12 a game So they have balance and they have depth The downside of that is that when you really need a bucket you dont necessarily have a goto guy Thats why they blew you know they blew a 21point lead against BYU and lost They were up 27 on Cincinnati and had to fight it out down the stretch to win by three cuz when things go the other way they dont have that one guy to bail him out But the balance is impressive Pass was behind Wallen Cummings tried the layup Welling got back Miner was there to finish it up And now Pit out in front Coach Brownell wants a timeout with 1632 on the clock in the second half Having a conversation with Ace Buckner trailing by one to the Panthers on CW courtside Saturday 20 points in the win on this floor last year in overtime in the game between the teams This is Porter Hes got it And you were highlighting Brad Brownell He is one of the truly elite coaches on the after timeout play Drew up in the huddle got the open shot able to knock it down Brilliant His team goes in front That was only Clemsons third made three of the game Caleppo against Godfrey Well defended baseline fight Welling came away with it Clemson was two of nine on threepointers in the first half Another miscommunication and coach Brownell wants him to slow it down Yeah that was a miscommunication that was aided by the effort And Miami ultimately winning 7669 in the 50th alltime meeting between the programs Yeah music Jay Lucas went zone for much of the second half hadnt played much zone on the season I asked Jeff Cable before the game were you ready for it He said Yeah we expected it Its kind of what you do against Pit They love to drive the ball and the zone takes away a lot of dribble penetration But the other thing that Jeff mentioned that was interested and this is a common lament with coaches is getting all of your guys to play well at the same time You look at Pittsburgh right now three players have combined for 32 of their 39 points theyve only got three bench points whereas Clemson has 14 bench points and a lot more balance So as the game goes on you just become easier to guard when its only three guys responsible for the offense and thats one of them End of the clock See Aleppoa Welling rips it out of the air Hunter was stunned for a moment as he brings it up Pittsburgh also does not have a made three here in the second half after making five in the first on six tries This is another three cheering for the Tigers But a Johnson has three for Clemson You start to feel Clemson controlling the game now bringing some fullcourt pressure trying to exploit the suspect ball handling and especially the depth Try to wear the Panthers down here and win the last four minutes And in this game Seth a fivepoint lead might as well be a 10point lead Godfrey takes it off the backboard for the Tigers Little bit of a danger zone right now for Pittsburgh Welling looking for the jam and the block Selea cheering palms to the sky in disbelief Nice recovery effort by Caleb of Welling cannot be that You cant have Carter Welling beating everybody down the court like that to the rim He was all alone Nice twoman game with Hunter flipping it out to Ba rattling it home Carter Welling in transition should not be that open at the end Theres looking like a pretty good block Oh thats Well you know he got the arm at the end but a lot of pumpkin a lot of skin on leather Now we certainly have the benefit of replay Yes we do Just want to just want to mention that And I had I had yet to miss a call by looking at a replay Welling at the free throw line Season three of the CWs hit series returns this month Hes a cop shes a con but together theyre unstoppable Season 3 of Wild Cards premieres Monday January 26th 87 central right here on the CW Catch up on seasons 1 and two now on the CW app Lets see if Brad Brownell sticks with the fullcourt pressure off this make Its not a trapping press All of a sudden Seth this is a sevenpoint lead for the Tigers And it really started with the timeout by coach Brownell just a couple of minutes ago Yeah timeout in the AT3 Pittsburghs got to get some of their other guys involved in the offense It is a 122 Clemson run See Aleppo fouled by Davidson Thats his second So Caleppa who got the fans out of their seats here at the peak with that attempted block on the jam by Welling And now Caleppas at the free throw line Eight points in the game on three of six shooting for Roman CPA One of two teams will play again in Clemson South Carolina late January Porter straight away Caleppa Miner with the box out on Hunter as well I dont love that shot Theyre starting to assert control of the game Go inside with a spoon Bad shot is the first pass on your opponents offense That was a big time cheering three Pittsburgh really needed it First one of the second half Witherspoon with his 14th made three of the season Points that the Panthers desperately needed Welling wants the ball but hes got Coran on his back Davis is feeling it Got two defenders in the air Uncontested rebound Witherspoon who just hit that three for the Panthers Two shaky offensive possessions for Clemson You got to give your big a touch Dunning now six of 10 from long distance for Pit Theyre a decent threepoint shooting team 36 of the season seventh in the ACC Davidson backing it in operating in the paint He got the soft bounce He loves the mismatch Had Cummings on his back the whole way and he has really asserted himself offensively Something he can really build on with back door action A DUNNING WITH A monster jam over Davidson Thats how you answer Thats how you answer Hes looking at him too cheering Dont get teed up The lead is down to three How fun is this Porter hesitation Welling down the lane attacking the rim Caleppa there again to commit the foul He wanted to put Caleppa on the poster All dunks all the time Here we go Well you get beat on one end and then thats two points Thats pretty good right there There was good defense by Davidson Dunning just elevated over him and he is a big time energy player And and Seth how about the pass by Corhead Yeah thread the needle They love to move him away from the basket He can pass it can shoot a little bit but even more so they get him on the move as opposed to just parking him in the post One more for Welling Jr Draper Utah 611 240 lbs a year at UC Irvine and a transfer from Utah Valley a season ago And now Godfrey in for Welling after the free throw attempts I talked about getting some of the other Panthers involved so maybe Donning is taking it upon himself to be that guy 196 bench points Not a huge surprise cheering and applause And a 5second call I like the decision by Brad to go full court on the defensive pressure Coach Cable the coach of the year back in 2023 in the ACC when they won 24 games Now they get to run a blob play Clemson last year won 27 games the most in school history Godfrey on the spin move not high enough on the square Punched around Foul called Little bit of a late call there on Cororehand by Tony Chiaza Once Godfrey gets that ball in the post Little bit of a black hole Hes not a big assist guy Great job wheeling dealing away And you get him up in the air but it was on the rebound that Corhan got called for the shot Two of five in the game from the line for RJ Godfrey No my mistake It was on the shot It was just late cheering and applause Late doesnt mean wrong By the way told you the Panthers won 27 games last year Made the NCAA tournament Won 18 games in the ACC Most wins in school history for a season And Godfreyys numbers Another free throw for Godfrey We knew he and Coran cheering would be factors Highlighted those players at the top of the broadcast Heres more fullcourt pressure That was Porter at the head of the pressure This fullcourt press is really causing problems for Pittsburgh Even when they break it theyre having to work so hard It means they have less time to run their offense and its taking gas out of their tank Swallen pressuring the inbounds Porters lucky he didnt get called for the foul Tigers also went nine and one on the road in the ACC last year Not surprisingly school record for conference road victories Poked away cheering into the back court for it Buckners looking at the official Witherspoon is Thats a 10second violation Theres 20 on the shot clock Thats a 10second violation I dont think it went over half court Buckner on the poke was saying that he went over half court and then it got poked back before the 10second violation But either way you dont want with a spoon bringing the ball up against pressure All right so the official will discuss it Well update you when we time out Justin Porter for three started an 80 run for the Tigers See the ball the flare screen out there by Godfrey just as designed Quarter run on the baseline Free him up for a threepoint shot Clemson holding a sixpoint lead Now Im a ner Im a rule nerd Im a nerd in a lot of ways but especially about the rules I just learned a new rule So the reason why there was not a 10second violation even though theres only 20 on the shot clock right now is the Pittsburgh defender feet were in the front court Even though the ball was in the back court he tapped it while he was in the front court Therefore in that situation Pittsburgh gets a fresh 10 excuse me the Clemson defender If the defenders in the back court and deflects it but doesnt possess it then you still have to get it past midcourt within 10 seconds So always happy to learn a new rule Dunning on the drive My head hurts just a little bit So yeah but get getting what we Well thats good Alleviate Cables headache is is seeing Dunning get going because and Lee Cassell came over and gave us the explanation Topnotch official along with the rest of this crew Godfrey Miner cheering Thought I heard Miner say I got it on the way up Going up for the rebound Love seeing the small guard hitting the defensive glass Godfrey gets it in there Now its going up Everybody knows it Look at the the Demarco Miner chasing the ball Wallen on the foul for the Tigers up 5147 Led by as many as seven just a moment ago showed you that Porter three Hes now on the bench Hes got 11 points double figures seven times this season for Porter on the Tiger bench right now A lot of fancy dribbling from Miner Count it And the foul on the contest He loves to work in that area that midrange area driving it and pulling it back out Thats how he creates space cuz hes not real tall Got a feeling hes done this about a million times over the course of his life Right Step back You cant jump at the shooter like that Thats not great defense there by Mr Wall 16 points and a chance at the threepoint play from Miner at the free throw line Looked like this game was starting to get away from Pit And here we are back within one Its conference play people Were through playing around cheering Miner hardly ever misses from the free throw line as he completes the old school threepoint play 91 of the season What a weapon when your primary ball handler is a 91 free cheering throw shooter Remember that for the last few minutes Great delivery Oh Davidson What a pass from Butter Johnson Great delivery Corhan got caught on a switch Tigers by three Closing in on the midway point of the second half So glad that youre with us CW courtside Saturday Wormy Davis and our outstanding production crew And Miner might have been fouled again on the fall away Lets go into the money move the last two times down the court for number seven in white He is so crafty in there Look at Johnson The nice shot fake So he puts Caleppa in position where hes either got to stay with his man or help Comes to help Double team Deliver and finish Welling almost got it Witherspoon Witherspoon Onepoint game Hes saying to Marco You can do it I can do it too cheering Rolling was there Got it to him late Sends it back Offensive foul Yeah he was open If they had got it to him a hair sooner he would have had an easy pass to the basket Nice job by Corhan recovering and walling up Really good job by Cameron Coran Love big guys who can move their feet Watch Gets to him late and he just moves right along with him Good call Third personal foul on Welling Six of 10 on threepoint attempts in the game for the Panthers Wither Spoon with a spin and it drops Another bench point for Pittsburgh cheering Anthers in front by one Tigers try to answer Knocked away On the run Dunning Dropping the hammer for pit Look out below cheering Andrew Situs ran it up Found Dunning for the monster rim rocker put a stopwatch on Barry Dunning Great find by Indraitis in the open court There it is Perfect delivery Carter Welling with the three fouls Doesnt want to challenge Barry Dunning is Mr Energy He and Brandon Cummings and Amari Witherspoon have stepped up here in the second half Huge reason why Pittsburgh is up by three now Six nothing run Doning the transfer from South Alabama Played at UAB also Arkansas Last year was first team all sunb belt He is their leading threepoint shooter on the season but that was just a monster jam from Dunning Part of whats also happened is that Clemsons gone a little bit cold in their half court offense So if youre not making buckets you cant set up your fullourt pressure and Dunning is into double digits in scoring for the 10th time this season Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Brad Brownells team one and two away from Clemson South Carolina The victory was at Syracuse on Wednesday 6461 In fact three of their first four ACC games will be away from Tiger Town So this is part of what we talked about having balance and depth but not a defined goto guy Johnson from the corner Hes saying You can go to me coach Go to me Nice delivery by Hunter He and Miner exchanging glances and not in the Frank Sinatra way Miner crafty patience Shot clock at seven for Witherspoon Steps back for three for Witherspoon Welling pulls it in Solid defense Ball never got into the paint Lot of dribbling Six rebounds now for Welling for the Tigers Johnson looking for a safety valve Its Hunter Crossing the eightminute mark What a game between Clemson and Pit Godfrey into the paint Set it back out He should swing that ball earlier Shot clock to two for Porter Welling offensive glass He got tied up on the way up and it will be pit ball Andrew Situs tied up welling and the Panthers have the ball and were tied Eight minutes to play They only averaged nine on the season 18th in the country on Ken Palm in turnover percentage And thats created some transition opportunities which has not only allowed Pittsburgh to score but has given them great energy You know when a guy like Barry Dunning comes in and puts guys on the poster everybody gets excited Now you get a little deeper in your stance defensively they want to end the streak Yeah Coren misses from close range Theyre tired of hearing about the streak from Tom Wormy Theyre saying they want to they want to put it in your face Tom Stop talking about it It is such a rarity these days that one team would have that sort of domination However Porter for three He was wide open Thats what happens when you get the ball deep in the paint Its not just about scoring around the rim The defense collapses and now you have threepoint opportunities January of 2014 was the last home win for Pit against Clemson 7643 In fact they beat him twice that season and havent since Well let the final seven minutes unfold See Aleppa from Miner just doing it all Drive it to the paint Defense collapse delivery the assist from Miner Hes got 17 points He leads all scorers with that number Three Tigers in double digits Johnson down low Godfrey couldnt convert Selea in the neighborhood with a spoon Thats a terrible shot Theres no one there to rebound the ball Onepoint Tiger lead Three from the corner Porter See Godfrey now is looking to pass out of the post instead of just scoring it all the time The defense has to help so much And Porters got the hot hand Couple of recent threes from Porter Hes now three of six on threepoint attempts and 17 points Seven of 11 from the floor Number one in Orange Miner was cut off by the defending of Hunter Shot clock down to four Fumbled away and picked up Butter Johnson Godfrey who put it on the floor to whistle So much awareness when Godfrey gets the ball in the post Witherspoon gets caught looking the wrong way and Porter makes him pay Porters had a really nice few minutes here for the Tigers 17 points on the day Three for six from three Pitts is only one for six from three in the second half after going five for six in the first Welling Dunning defending shot clock at seven Too much dribbling Hunter missed out of the corner Inside of five minutes to go Swing that ball from side to side Get the defense moving and then you drive onep possession game Witherspoons been doing a lot of the ball handling in the half court with Miner off the ball in this lineup Selea tough drive I mean that was a straight up rug rugby move into the paint Definitely a rugby move Most of his moves are rugby moves It does translate muscle and force Sometimes just sheer effort is enough Godfrey and Welling or close to see Aleppa You can see him breathing pretty hard Hes played 34 minutes Corans played 32 and Miners played 31 Dunnings played 31 Theyre going to have some tired Panthers here these last few minutes and set tomorrow CW Womens Hoops returns as Cal heads to Raleigh to take on ACC Heavyweight NC State CW Womens Hoops Cal versus NC State tomorrow 200 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific Its only on the CW from Reynolds Coliseum Wonderful building which hosted both the mens and womens ACC tournaments in its history Makes me think of Jimmy V when you say that Closing in on four minutes Welling trying to back his way down against Corhen and then rolls in And Corhens in disbelief Thats just mono Amano down there Two big strong guys The only difference is Well hes got a couple of inches on him Thats all That was just a rock fight in there goes out So we will take a breather Step aside for just a moment 415 to go music in regulation Youre watching CW Courtzside Saturday presented by All State Game North Carolina 1 and0 in Conference Game feels very similar to Clemsons win at Syracuse earlier this week They led for 34 and a2 minutes in that game but it was a close one Ended up winning by three And Donnie Freeman from Syracuse had a pretty good look at a threepoint shot that would have sent it into overtime Brad Brownell chose not to foul up three But Clemson is comfortable playing this type of game where theyre not getting a ton of separation but you do feel like Clemsons been in control for much of the game now leading by six and it is officially winning time With that win at the dome the Tigers have won four in a row eight of their last 10 the only losses to Alabama and BYU Alabama was in the ACC SEC challenge in the game against BYU was neutral court Madison Square Garden Thats three losses by a total of 14 points by the way So even when they lose its close Witherspoon off the glass cheering He now has nine points Miner leads the way with 17 for Pit 17 for Justin Porter whos captured a couple of threepointers in recent minutes for the Tigers Welling tried to send it back out Johnson got bumped Warhen next to Johnson picks up the foul Welling had the size mismatch inside against Caleppa So they had to come with the double team and thats what created the rotation Thats the fourth foul on Corhen We mentioned Witherspoon in his nine points All of it coming in the second half Still not in the bonus Entry pass to Davidson Now that was Coren defending Thats five Hes done He picked up two fouls in about 6 seconds Derek Queen devastating Worst case scenario for Pittsburgh in the last three and a half 10 points four rebounds and to the bench for Cam Coran leading scoreer on the season for the Panthers Thats clearly I mean thats not even close 10 out of 10 Youre going to get called for that Especially knowing you got four screaming Its so hard Youre in there competing Youre fighting Youve been fighting all day to have that discipline You basically got you got to let a guy score at that point because they need you on the court the last 328 more than they need you to stop that bucket You can see the dejected look on the face of Gorean having to leave this game with 328 to go and Davidson at the free throw line for Clemson And remember Pittsburgh does not have two big men they thought they would have coming into the season Deshawn Jackson transfer from Iowa State heart issue pretty much done for the year They just announced that Papa Amadu Kante 610 sophomore from Senagal also done for the year knee surgery So their backup biggest Kieran Mullen whos an inexperienced freshman and Jeff Cable would much rather go with a smaller lineup And so you know what Clemsons going to do to counter that Punch it inside all day long Pit led by one at halftime Witherspoon crossover Cummings out of the corner Shot clocks at five Cummings needs to let it fly Welling comes in for the rebound And you see what not having the big fella in there does to the offense You know being smaller can be an advantage Youre quicker Not on that possession though Its nine rebounds for Welling That is a game high Little back door cut Porter and Davidson found him And that is play number one in the old school playbook Danger zone Cables not going to call a timeout Got to get him going downhill and try to create some opportunities for the threepoint shot Tigers have matched their largest lead of the game Witherspoon Tough shot He got it to fall Big bucket from Witherspoon Hes had a really nice second half Welling is slow to get up Helped up by his teammates now Fivepoint game with 216 to go on the clock in the second half All 11 of Witherspoons points have come in the second half Corin not in there to seal off the inside A nice job on the back door taking on the big fell Amari Witherspoon with that basket for the Panthers Hes got 11 points Hes into double digits Seventh time this season Dont forget right after us number 12 North Carolina on the road against SMU Tom and Gman with the call Been a pleasure this afternoon Seth What a great performance by these guys Great game That is ACC basketball Pittsburgh came here to play Both these teams trying to build their NCAA tournament resumes Protects home court break a streak and now the big fella Corhans going to have to be a spectator these last few minutes Pittsburgh has everything it needs to win this game Being smaller and quicker can be a big time advantage And right now youre going to see them bringing some fullcourt pressure I believe for the first time today Witherspoon just made a basket to cut the lead to five I love this move by Jeff Cable Something different If youre Clemson you dont want to be overly conservative right now Still want to be in attack mode Final two minutes roll well into the basket and try to feed him down there There he is Tigers looking for their 12th win of the season Shooting late in the clock Hunter got it away to Cummings What a great possession Seal up sealed them up inside Thats what created it Dunning halfway down and out and Wellings over the top of the board Got the great look You got to take that shot Foul committed by Miner whos had a tremendous game 17 points for Miner Hunters at the free throw line Has not been there today Quiet game offensively for him Two points one for six from the floor 86 free throw shooter Just enough to get over that front rim Big exhale by Hunter after that free throw Well thats why you have him in the game Your primary ball handler and your best table setter is an 86 free throw shooter Thats how you salt the way the winds at the strike Dylan Hunter the 63 senior from Atlanta Georgia Had double digits in the win at the dome Made a couple of threes Foul line was a big advantage for Pit in the first half but now Clemson is plus one from the stripe on the gate plus two all the way around the rim twice How about those two free throws from Hunter 120 and rolling Witherspoon off the screen defended by Welling Got it to fall Chance at a threepoint play Looking for three the oldfashioned way Thats what I mean by being smaller and quicker Spread them and drive them Really nice finish by Witherspoon All 13 of his points now in the second half Had Welling on skates Soft rims here in the Pete man Not quite the Lahina Civic Center rim softness but theyre getting some nice humbles Fourth foul on Welling Puts Witherspoon at the free throw line And this is his first free throw of the game And if you make it you can set up your fullourt press We are far from over here Seth Fourpoint game cheering Johnson racing it up Sheds Dunning Exactly one minute to go Pittsburgh you do not want to foul Defend without fouling clock is at six Welling misses Dunning comes over the top of the board There was contact down there I like the no call Been doing that all game Miner for three Welling stepped to it and blocked it He wanted it too badly I know how badly you wanted it DeMarco Not a good one He had made three threes in the game Welling the anticipation The foul by Cummings in the back court Sometimes players decide what theyre going to do a little bit too early and that was an example and hes played a fantastic basketball game Has had a fantastic season How about the Tigers from the floor in this game Seth 53 for the game Pitt at 46 Thats way above the season average for Clemson Big miss Witherspoon trying to catch that pass from Cummings I think it was Porter on the deflection Was a huge play there Active hands on defense It is Tiger basketball I wonder if it was a challenge I thought it was I guess not 326 seconds Dangerous pass to Welling Hes got 10 rebounds in the game and a foul by Witherspoon Well take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance Progressive offers 247 protection when you bundle auto home and motorcycles Learn more at progressivecom Well Justin Porter gave Clemson its offense when it needed it most early to midse allowed him to get a little bit of separation Pittsburgh has never really gone away but Clemsons been in control for most of the game Led for about 25 and a half minutes If they can make their free throws here then they are going to extend the winning streak over Pittsburgh to 14 games dating back to 2014 So Porter with his 19 points thats a season high not near his careerhigh which is 41 in his days at Middle Tennessee State bounces out for Dunning and Porter grabs it fittingly 171 seconds on the clock And that is a great defensive rebound in traffic Chasing the ball grabbing the ball being strong with it And thats going to be a wrap partner Dont forget coming up North Carolina SMU after us game two CW courtside Saturday This afternoon courtside at the Peterson Event Center And it appears that the Tigers are 171 seconds away from another victory for Brad Brownell It would be win number 304 as the Tigers coach and 471 career victories as a head coach for Brad Brownell Amazing numbers 16th season class all around class guy Terrific basketball coach Knows what he wants for his identity for his teams And this is a classic Clemson win Just hang in there Be a little tougher a little smarter Their depth was huge Getting Coran to foul out for the last four minutes Cummings got fouled on the drive So Pit looking for the quick two or threepoint play Little bit of a pulse with 116 Six to go Clemson did a really to me top of the story of the game was Clemsons improvement in terms of their threepoint defense in the second half Theyve been one of the best teams in the country eighth in the country in threepoint defense on the season Pit was five for six in the first half but they turned their water off in the second cheering And nobody defends the threepoint shot better in the ACC than the Clemson Tigers One for 10 Pittsburgh from three in the second half So Jeff Cables got to find a way to regroup his guys They certainly fought They got Syrac They got one week to prepare for Syracuse coming in here at home Try to get some wins Fivepoint game for Coach Cable and the Panthers Coach Cable was looking for his first win against the Tigers The fullourt pressure produces the turnover Miner couldnt get it away Threepointer was short Thats what I mean by threepoint defense Fitting way to end the game Andrew Sidus couldnt
