Seven at the helm of the Hatter So game number 475 on one bench Game number three for the first year head coach Jay Lucas and we are underway in South Florida Miami starts with the basketball change in the starting lineup Trey Donaldson the senior guard not in the lineup to start Instead its Teemo Malovitz the freshman from Slovakia We are told Donaldson was a game time decision While hes not starting he is available to come off the bench tonight And this is the type of game too for Merlo with Melovic He can come in freshman 68 Get off the ball a little bit The advantage of having one of those fivestar freshman and Shelton Henderson playing point guard for you This is a big lineup here Kind of had his rebound Yeah Henderson at 66 handling the ball and he turns it over on the opening possession This is a Stson team that made the bus trip 4 and 12 miles down south You look at their starting five preseason a son player of the year Phillips number zero lost the handle there and Miami turns it over backto back possessions gives the ball right back to the Hatters and you expect Stson to slow it down and really grind this clock against a Miami team that wants to run Yeah you can see Miami is trying to push the pace here early but the Hatters got to control tempo and pace They got to control the tempo timing No quick shots unless theyre open Got to take open shots Shot selection is going to be so big for these guys You dont want to get into a track beat with Miami They have averaged 94 points per game through their opening two Stson letting the shot clock tick down to five Now Surmans off the screen Pull up pop off the mark This is what Miami likes to do who play with tempo get a miss try and immediately cash in on the other end Swaned out of bounds Itll stay Kanes basketball underneath their own hoop Miami wants to get into the paint either off the dribble or post up Theyre trying to control the lane I think one thing early well find out and youll see throughout the year for this team is how well they shoot the basketball from three will dictate how long this team goes into March playing basketball And another turnover Three of them early in the opening 90 seconds for Miami A team that was in great flow offensively Quick shot for Stson goes begging Both of these teams looking for an offensive rhythm early Were already seeing Miami without their true leader and Trey Donson not being in the starting lineup Youll see things change significantly when he gets in And another turnover Credit Stson They are dialed in on the defensive end to start this game Theyre going to pack in that zone Theyre not going to sit in the zone They going to try to keep everything in front And its Matar Chop who opens the scoring with a triple With his first three on the season Yeah that was not on the scouting report No no its not at all But games like this you got to let it hang out Theyre not saving anything They know theyre outgunned Theyre coming to compete And Miami the size advantage They attack inside to no avail and steps steps on the end line out of bounds You take a look at these two teams and just Miami has a huge size advantage but theyre struggling to convert Great job by Miami They want to get the ball there in the middle of that zone against Renew with Renew and let him be a playmaker He had five assists in the last game even though he had a turnover there But theyre going to pack it in and force Miami to make shots That rolls off the rim No good from Henderson Applause Magic number from the threepoint line for Stson is about 15 to 16 threes They already have one Make it two What a start for the Hatters And first year head coach Jay Lucas says Give me a timeout Ethan Copeland makes it six nothing Starting lineup It was a surprise to us He looked good at shootound but game time decision They say he is available You see him there in uniform but they are struggling without him on the floor in the opening three minutes I think Jay Lucas wanted to get a feel for what his team will look like without Trey Don I I dont think hes pleased with that Four turnovers here early Going back door and Miami gets their first bucket through Washington Thats Malik Renew in a high post again being a playmaker really Hes adopted a larger role for this group Hes playing like a first team all ACC guy right now And can he continue that when they get into league play Copeland good finds to joke He goes up with it through contact and draws the foul Spacing is really good with the Hatters Theyre driving into the paint Theyre driving the pass here and renew there with the vision on the back door cut I mean theyll flash him in the middle and just play a lot of playmakers with the Miami Hurricanes lineup and put out their true leader right now Everyone needs to have all hands on deck You have to give a lot of credit to StSon in the early moments of this game as Donaldson checks in His team trailing 62 They are huge underdogs tonight talentwise You said it they are outgunned but they are not playing like it Theyve come in with confidence Donnie Jones is well coached Hes well traveled and again they have an all league guy themselves Jamie Phillips Jr here is averaging 21 a game and hes a matchup nightmare Hes the one player physically that can match up against the Hurricanes Yeah Because you look at you know position by position and Miami has just so much positional size a few inches at every position but also just built so broad Yes And Jay Lucas was telling us thats done by design Not just in nonconference play but in ACC play to win games in conference Youve got to be strong and physical and have positional size not just at your big man spots but at the guard spots as well And we talked about that too is thats the what Duke did a year ago I think to the league And I think youve seen this year a lot of the teams in the league have emulated that that just positional size You know the its like were transitioning out of the small ball era and back to a traditional four and five Floater does not fall Offensive rebound that rolls off the rim and finally Henderson tips it in Third times the charm Thats the way thats the best offense sometimes for this Miami group Theyre not a great shooting team Some nights their best offense is going to be throw it up on the rim and go get it And thats what you saw there in that possession And a team that would much prefer to run on you than get into this halfcourt game that Stson has forced them to play in the opening four and a half minutes Heres Donaldson spinning into the lane Wave off the basket He traveled before he put it up Five Miami turnovers at the was kind of his niche name of the game and trying to do that at Miami in year number one off to a good start so far this season although getting tested early by Stson The turnovers have been an issue Now Miami gets a turnover of their own and they cash in through true Washington J Lucas has a way of being demanding but not demeaning his players and these guys respond to that And as we talked about how he wants to build his team getting after you defensively thats what he want Everyone gets the ball they want difficult catches up into the basketball more importantly one shot and rebound Stson answers with a three Thats Calvin Surmans the third Florida native And Stsons knocked down three triples in the opening five minutes Miamis look sped up and too aggressive on both ends of the floor Defensively they really aggressive just unnecessarily gambling giving up three threes here just like Trey Donaldson there Just just a drive by there Applause Stson goes into the post They dont want to live there much of this game Kick it outside now Phillips all league player into the lane Draws contact and well get two at the line Phillips is the guy Hes versatile Hes the one guy that physicality will not bother him He actually embraces it Hes looking for contact there as he initiates it and gets to the free throw line His ability to play in ball springs is one thing but itll also get in the post when the offense gets stagnant for the hat for the haters Its a really slow start for Miami It is and and surprising considering this is a team thats been averaging more than 90 points per game under Jay Lucas You know they just had six turnovers the entire game at a 40point win against Bthun Cookman a team in Bthun Cookman that took Auburn to overtime earlier in the week So thats a good basketball team They beat him by 40 Big part is they kept took care of the basketball Only six turnovers They already have five tonight You could tell theyre trying to beat the zone down before they set up Fson sets up their zone Theyre trying to beat it down the floor Theyre playing so much faster than they need to settle down I think some of that had to do with Trey Donaldson not in the starting lineup Lets see if now he can settle down and then settle down to you Donaldson out there has it here Flies to the rim Count it Plus the foul and one opportunity for Trey Donaldson Hes the guy They have a closer you know and now hes a pass for a sky but he definitely put this team on his back when they need to There drives the baseline in the zone initiates the contact goes to the line here for an opportunity to end one Hes the leader of this group You said right before tip off this starting five for Miami can go toetotoe with any starting five in the ACC Well you said that and then Miami tips the game off They dont have Donaldson out there and you can see they were affected by it And thats not on any one person but hes the emotional leader of this group and a guy with his level of experience You want him out there to start games and they just didnt respond well to start here tonight But you can see now theyre back Theyre defending Theyre communicating Surmans with three seconds to shoot Step back Contested three Johnson cant connect Donaldson pushing the tempo Trail three No good Applause A fresh 20 for Miami Music That last defensive possession is what Jay Lucas wants his team to play like Dante Allen lines up a three Miamis just getting good looks but they cant knock him down Music This isnt abnormal to this group Theyre not a great threepoint shooting team They have to take the open threes when theyre there Theyre 0 for four here to start And when you look at this group thats the one concern you have with Miami If they making threes they can beat anybody But this is not a as a as a collective group Theyre not a great shooting three Their team is built to control the paint on both ends of the floor Pull up pop off the front rim Falls right back to Jamie Phillips Kick out three Almost banked in from Johnson but put too much on it Donaldson in attack mode right to the rim for two Thats what you want to see Theres not a shot blocker on the floor right now So no need to settle for threes Youve missed four of them Trey Don was experienced just attacks the rim wide open look and Yanuvski the Texas AM transfer makes Miami pay Magic number coach Jones set was 15 15 to 16 threes Now they already got four and theyve gotten four and its why theyre leading this ball game right now Miami still looking for their first made three Good pass Everything but the finish Marcus Allen tried to go onehanded to no avail transition three and it bounces in Its good Alex Doyle reigns in another Stsons knocked down five threes and theyre back up by six Its a lot of good shooters for the Hatters And right now Miamis inability to knock down a shot creating problems because Stson is getting in the paint Theyre forcing rotation and theyre finding their threepoint shooters and theyre playing with confidence on the road on a Monday night Unafraid of a Miami team that had two dominant victories to start this season Coming off a 40point one win this ones going to be harder earned tonight Shot clock down to two Surmans has to hoist it up Nothing but air And thats a turnover Shot clock violation Miami trailing by six the sets in threepoint shooting the story Thats the key to it early Theyre spreading the wealth around knocking down four threes here in the first half Weve got ourselves a game folks Took Auburn to overtime and the turnovers have piled up early in this game and theyre down six They looked sped up early and they knew they were playing against the zone They looked like they tried to race the ball up the floor and beat the zone And this is what they want to do They go right inside Renu hammered it home Plus the foul I think the officials are talking about theres a screen there U was pulled and thrown out of the way So no basket The foul was on the floor before Renu went up with it So Miami gets the ball underneath their own hoop You know you you mentioned Miami being sped up What is Stson doing to take Miami out of their rhythm in the half court Theres a foul there Foul was on Uday and not Renu But yeah theyre packing in the zone They know Miami wants to control Thats what Miami wants to do with the basketball Get it right there at the rim Second effort This time itll count for Malik Renu Job did a great job there blocking the first shot but Music Renew is really embracing this role as the number one option And thats a new role for him And hes answered the challenge averaging nearly a double double just on nine rebounds a game but also 20 points a game Good defense THE STEAL AND THE SLAM DANTE Allen on a rack attack Applause Dante Adams one of the freshman that doesnt get talked about enough but hes his versatility ability to play point as you see here pressure the basketball St Lucas is really high on him and hes showing you why The defensive intensity has ratcheted it up a notch Shot clock down to three Johnson has to heave and he draws the foul Donaldson whistled for the foul with Jake Johnson going up with it right at the end of the shot clock You see here the reject and a pull up made him take a very difficult shot just didnt allow him time to come down and theres a little contact there I know Miami staff doesnt like it It was right in front of their bench but it was the right ball Johnson gets three at the line here Every time Miami gets a big play like a steal and a slam from Dante Allen feels like Stson has answered and remained in the drivers seat of this first half And they have they theyve knocked down shots They got five threes and theyre getting points off of another threepoint shot Just getting fouled So right now theyve gotten the confidence they need Theyre going to pack it in They game plan and they feel good about keep everything in front and its got to continue to take threes and make shots Can they handle the pressure from Miami and get a really good shot against that pressure No this is a position Miami has not found themselves this season A new team coming together a lot of transfers and freshman and against Jacksonville and Bthun Cookman really from tip off they were in control now trying to come from behind They keep going to Renew and he keeps delivering Yeah hes flashing underneath the baseline They game plan and they want the guards to deny that but he puts his head underneath the rim and he flashes so deep the guard cant get there and thats just too easy Surman spins into the lane at 58 Got it up over but couldnt finish Henderson with a head of steam Lost possession Itll stay Miami basketball And as bad as Miami has played to start this game with the turnovers missed threes this is a one possession game Theyre starting to settle down They want to get stops and then get out in transition Henderson unable that time just to put it in Hes been in attack mode Scored the last two baskets for Miami Here he is again right to the rim Slams it home through contact and a chance to tie this game at 20 with the and one Constantly in attack mode there He gets it Do thinks he has help at the rim Jobs preoccupied with who They know ones there And Malik Ray New says thank you Ill take that Music It doesnt matter whether hes in zone or manto man Hes just on a heater right now and hes playing with so much confidence and hes showing coach Lucas he made the right decision by making him the primary option here His recruiting class and number one option on the offensive end of the floor Yeah Gets to return home to Miami after three years at Indiana Miami that defensive intensity creates another turnover Renew for the lead Got it Timeout sets in first lead of the night for I have to make just take the open ones that are there continue to put pressure draw fouls extend the game with their fullourt pressure as theyre doing now this is the style of play the Hurricanes wants to play just a tough physical game disruptive and it feels like the increase in defensive intensity has led to a burst on the offensive end its the way they have to Four This isnt a great shooting team They got to do better job communicating here Stson out of the timeout got a good look Ethan Copelan couldnt knock it down The hot hand Renault thought about it and said Donaldson finds Washington in the corner Nothing but the bottom of the net True Washington has been shooting over 50 from behind the arc and hes a guy if he can continue that hot hand with the pressure on the rim the other guys are applying Miami on an 11 nothing run over the last two minutes to grab control of this first half and they force another miss Theyre doing a great job of guarding their yard meaning theyre just theyre not rotating over Theyre just telling guys you just guard your man oneonone Stay between he and the basket so he can get out and run Tough take inside the fivestar freshman Shelton Henderson Hes a load I mean there hes as big as any player that the Hatters have on their on their roster And hes a starting three for the Canes and de facto backup point guard as well Stsons gone three minutes without a basket and that streak will continue Miami with all the momentum right now Right to the rim Thats a goend Count it for Trey Donaldson Nearly 10 minutes to score their first 15 points Theyve scored the last 15 on this 15 nothing run in a little more than three minutes They stopped turning the basketball over one and then now they got back into their identity of playing defense Now Stson made the threes early And now theyre starting to turn the basketball over thanks to the defensive intensity from Miami Phillips was saying that didnt go off me last but the officials say it did Yeah Miami is doing a great job Theyre getting into the basketball speeding the Hatters up right now and theyre struggling on the offensive end of the floor and their inability to make shots now particularly in the paint They dont have a twopoint shot They have five threes makes up all their field goals and they are struggling right now against the pressure from Miami This is the way Miami wants to play Stson in a 3 and 12 minute scoring drought Its allowed Miami to gain control here Applause Miami struggled for the opening 10 minutes of this game but it doesnt reflect on the scoreboard because this Canes team they can score in bunches and that is what they have done Good defense again Not much room for Copeland Has to kick it out Shot clock down to seven Deep contested three and a foul Well the freshman from Turkey Talia Alunas calls for the foul He cant believe it Yeah Tonas didnt communicate on that switch and just drunk just jumped there and stuck his hand and big man from Istanbul Turkey is used to guarding bigs on the perimeter that time just got a little beside himself and little too aggressive So Copeland three at the line knocks down the first A reminder Friday night Im calling this freshman phenoms Friday You can check out Cam Boozer and Duke And then it is Caleb Wilson in North Carolina our ACC Network double header How about a start for those guys huh But Carolina getting that huge win against Kansas Not just a huge win for Carolina but a huge win for the ACC as a whole Absolutely ACCs off to a really good start 351 to start the season heading into tonight And I think thats a big win for the league I think everybody knows that the ACC will be back this year I think theyll more than double the amount of teams or nearly double the amount of teams in the NCAA tournament this coming year And but all the conversations about how good the ACC is or isnt Carolina stamped that with a really impressive win against JayHawks Anderson easy knockdown for him Hes showing off the midrange game and Miami picked number eight in the ACC preseason poll Well if thats any indication this team has a lot of talent So if theyre going to be eighth that means theres going to be a lot of teams making the NCAA tournament from this conference Going a little too quick there Washington gives it right back Its good chance to watch this group right now Theyre about two of their leaders and Trey Donaldson and Malik Renu right now Lets see where the offense comes from if the the Hatters dont turn the basketball over Jump ball possession arrow stays with Stson and he just slips right there and got to clean that spot up Stenson yet to make a field goal in the last 6 minutes and 44 seconds Oh for their last six You put four turnovers in the mix during that stretch and its led to Miami gaining control of this first half with five minutes left in it Much needed three The iron very kind there for Stson That is the Hatter sixth made three of this first half Freshman there Leonard steps into one Really excited about him and his ability to knock down threes Wide open look Miami the immediate answer from deep True Washington delivers Knocks down his second three And hes the one guy I know can make enough threes to beat you You got to find him in that zone Leonard from the same spot this time Rattles in and out No good The one thing the Canes are not doing a great job of theyre not communicating in the ball screen action Stripped away Copeland gets the steal and the two Ethan Copeland picking the pocket of Donaldson Copeland there with the first twopoint field goal there by the the Hatters Good shake How about that Shelton Henderson the freshman showing off support Let me know what I can do to help And in turn Lucas said I hope that youre going to still be a big part of this program And Laren Egg has been to all three games to start this season sitting courtside just the other side of the court Hey I talked to coach L before and I asked him how is he doing Hows he enjoy retirement He says Randolph I hadnt lost a game So well you know what thats like I hadnt lost one since Ive been sitting next to you and I dont plan on losing anymore Anderson in perfect position for the follow flush in Miami They started this game just five of 15 from the floor Sids 12 of 14 Music You can see the physicality their overwhelming stats in their net and their just overall strength getting wherever they want on a dribble And thats the positional size coming into play that first year head coach Jay Lucas was saying Look and youre number one youve got to win quickly You youve got to put something out there that people want to see Create the excitement by winning And we said Well what was the number one thing that you needed to produce winning And he he felt like it was go get size length at every single position Just not the big men but we need big guards as well And he did He got some experienced guys And I mean you look at his freshman We talked about Henderson Hes coming out of the game and theres not many freshman built like that Youre going from a freshman 66 240 lb Shelton Henderson whos built like a football player to Teemo Malovitz whos a 68 freshman guard And theyre all versatile Both can run points Initiate offense for your group Theyre versatile defenders The only thing Ive seen right now with Miami is they got to do a better job of communicating Good ball movement by Stson Easy layin And thats communicating defensively in the switches that time Just not a good job of guarding the basketball there Good ball movement on the other end And an easy three Thats good basketball on both ends of the floor Malovic the freshman from Slovakia cashes in Malovic with his release point at 68 already and shoots that high arcing shot Phillips trying to spin his way free Dumps it off for cool that time Rolls off the rim He was looking for backto back basket Stson wins it back A deep contested three This is the track meet that Miami wants to play at And thats why theyll make you pay in transition Thats the way they have to play But they know got to tighten up on some of these long passes and outlet passes Theyre trying to play too fast and I thought it got him in trouble early Allowed Stson to get a lead Now theyre seaman and lock down defensively trying to pull away Yeah just wearing Stson down over the course of this first half But the threes keep falling That is a deep three from Jamie Phillips the sophomore showing some range That is seven made threes for Stson in this first half That was a deep one showing you his range and showing you why hes first team all sudden Donaldson follows his own miss and draws the foul Phillips is like Hey Im an all league defender in the Aon Im supposed to get that cold ref Give me that call You know Randolph for as slow as Miami started this game with Donaldson not in the starting lineup they are well above pace here if they want to continue their 94 points per game They well on their way When you defend the way they do and you get out in transition you can flip a game like they did so fast here They struggled early and now theyre starting to rotate guys and coach Lucas said hes comfortable going nine deep Hes rotating his guys here early and trying different lineups And theyve got great balance scoring tonight Four players already in double figures Donaldsons one of them Thatll be the way they they play all year long I mean Malik Renu has to be the guy thats leading and I think he will but after that I think itll be by committee Another deep three this time off the mark from Phillips Theyre a really good passing team Everybody just shares the basketball Right on Q Alioop U throws it down and Miami puts up 50 in this first half U knows if he can just set screens and roll to the rim he knows hes going to get the pass Music You say Miamis been sharing the ball Oh well that thats kind of been their thing this season Last game six Miami players had three or more assists in the same game First time in program history that has happened Theyre sharing the ball freely again Add another assist Renu the easy finish on the inside And youre wondering why Malik Renu can get the ball so much is Us doing a great job of just sealing the center against the zone And then Malik Reu is just cutting in behind and getting the basketball wherever he wants and just catching it in rhythm and finishing it right at the rim Shot clock ticks down to eight Phillips Hell get two at the line Hes been trying to play a little hero ball the last few possessions for Stson You feel bad for the Hatters who the score doesnt show how well they played the first 12 minutes of this game They have They just had a fiveminute stretch there for their inability to get a quality shot up play They started knocking down threes early and I think they spent about five minutes of the game spending too much time outside of three And when they missed those shots Miami took advantage of it And Miami 15 nothing run in less than three minutes Just turned this game away from Stson to the home team Hurricanes And theyre showing you they have that ability but its going to come from them on the defensive end of the floor And when theyre knocking down shots you can look out They can beat anybody But theyre going to have to continue to with their physicality on the defensive end of the floor now as the Hatters are extending their pressure Going to go to a 221 fall back to the 23 Try to limit the amount of time Miami has to attack them in the half court Miami can hold this for the final shot of the first half with a 5236 lead Shot clock is off Donaldson knows it Eight seconds to work with until halftime Deep three Dante Allen drains him What a finish to the first half Miami who tr I think the only question mark for this team its going to be how well they can shoot the threepoint line Thats it But theyre not built to do that They built to control the paint And thats what theyve done early and often this season And theyre going to have a big test coming up against that Florida front line Yeah that Florida game so critical for Miami coming up on November 16th just six nights from tonight You go right back to Renu And why wouldnt you He was the spark when Miami trailed 20 to 15 Renew went on an individual 8 nothing run to put Miami on top And they have not looked back They make it so difficult to to zone with so much movement It doesnt matter if its man or zone Theyre moving so much and theyre cutting guys in behind the zone and I believe Renew is just getting the ball wherever he wants and just once he gets it around that ACC line I mean theres just not a whole lot you can do with obviously first year head coach Jay Lucas wont be happy with the first 10 minutes when they went down by six but is it encouraging This is a new group that youve formed first year head coach All these guys are coming in either transfers or freshman and theyve shown okay we dont just need to take the lead early We can come from behind take a punch punch back And certainly since Donaldsons been on the floor who didnt start this game they look like the team they were in the first two games Was a little disappoint It gives them enough just to keep the attention of this group right Hey guys we got to defend Defend for 40 minutes come out slacking like you did to start this game anybody could beat you And the threes that was a good look but nothing but air from Copelan That was the bugaboo for Miami in the first half They allowed seven of them Copeland saying there was a touch Stson head coach Donnie Jones is going to use a coachs challenge here new rule in college basketball And AJ Desai the official just went right to Jones All right new rule in college basketball Coaches challenge of this one by Donnie Jones and Stson Successful call was overturned Now you do see Donaldson get a piece of the ball Our thought Randolph was even though he gets the ball there Copelands follow through still the last to touch it Thats what it looked like But Clarence Armstrong disagreed with you and I We got that wrong So 8 seconds on the shot clock after the successful coachs challenge They nearly just turned it over anyway Shot clock ticks down to five and Donnie Jones is saying it should be a reset but I dont think Donaldson ever had possession of that ball So itll stay at 5 seconds to shoot Its Stsons got to go full court here Music Phillips heaves it from the logo And all the threes that were falling for Stson early in this game they hit seven of them in the first half have turned into misses Thats a great job on the defensive end by Miami Theyre theyre doing the old Florida State zone up denial on the baseline out of bounds and most teams just go back at half court They do a great job of kind of messing up any plays you have and most teams just will throw it back And unfortunately for this haters they threw it out of bounds And Malik Renu continues to feast on the inside What a start to the season Renu has had And now Henderson hes in attack mode stripped Calvin Surmans the third leads to a transition three Phillips cant hit it And a foul on the rebound Theyre going to get Ernest Uday colliding in onar Joe Henderson on that previous possession Hes got to give that up early I thought he had Trey Donaldson up ahead and took one extra dribble and that time it cost him a turnover Once again a risky pass Donaldson like a safety on the football field read it well Got a piece of it Itll stay involved but again theyre going to have to go full court here I think its a turnover Well that was clearly off Donaldson last right Yeah No its going to say Stson ball Yeah I actually from the f original play I thought it was off the haters Applause Statu has just made two of their last 10 threes Thats what was working when they had a sixpoint lead Miamis defense has ratcheted up a notch That time the Hatters beat the shot clock as it was about to buzz jump throws it down That play just gives Miami a little bit more to talk about Coach regardless of the score of the game theyre communication on their switching Thats a late clock situation There was supposed to be a switch There wasnt They gave up a dunk Theyve made that mistake a few times here tonight Washington fouled shooting three And youre right Randolph Look youve had the scout right as an assistant coach and youre trying to get your teams attention ahead of Florida the reigning national champs and those are the things you break down Sure they wont cost you against Stson but if you do that six days from tonight against Florida its going to result in a loss Yeah theyve had a quite a few breakdowns not a lot of communication going on and thats the only thing theyve done wrong Theyve done a great job of guarding the basketball and help when needed But late clock situation youre expecting to switch and put a body on a body and that time rolled right down to the front of the rim and weak side guys not expecting anybody to be alone there and kind of lets him go and lets him get the easy dunk but got to clean those things up Couple of substitutions here for Miami One thing Jay Lucas may want to see in this second half is his depth step up You mentioned youre really impressed with the starting five of Donaldson Washington Renew Henderson and UDay but does Miami have the depth to compete at the highest level That thats still a question mark Yes thats going to be ultimately decides their ceiling right Its its where do the scoring come from when Malik Renude struggles offensively or Trey Donson doesnt have it going that night Is it you know is it Allen Which Allen Is it Dante Is it Marcus Which guy steps up Foul called on the floor And thats what the early season is for right Answering those questions particularly for a first year head coach thats brought in a whole new roster You know it feels like every college basketball teams turning over their roster but Miami truly turned it over top to bottom But a lot of guys home back to the state of Florida Couple of guys from Miami as well Well thats what attracted Lucas to the job We were talking with him earlier He was a big recruiter of the Boozer Twins who were from about five miles from here And he said Theres a lot of talent right here So when the Miami job opened up it was one that Lucas said You can win there by keeping kids home and bringing transfers back And thats exactly the blueprint so far Hard foul Phillips Hell get two Phillips really been impressive His ability to put the ball on the floor and again the physicality of his game does not bother him Hes attacking the rim showing you the range of the threepoint shot Hes hes gotten off to a hot start as well averaging 21 points a game on earlier in the season And hes a player whos preseason a son first If they get the production from Phillips and theyre expecting Stson will absolutely be in the conversation at the top of the AON a league they won a few years ago and made the NCAA tournament under head coach Donnie Jones And hes got a relatively new group of guys hes trying to put together And he talked about his inability to be able to retain guys which is pretty common at every level of college basketball right now Well even Donaldson whos got the ball here started all 37 games for Michigan last season two years at Auburn before that Thats Dante Allen through traffic Hell get two at the line Allen another local product here in Miami His father Malik Allen played in the NBA from 2001 to 2011 now an assistant coach for the Heat right down the road Was committed to Villanova early and when the coaching change happened his recruitment opened up and no ones happier about that than Jay Lucas and thats where dad played Malik Allen Villova graduated in 2000 You just talking about that bench Dante Allen feels like the key piece He is Hes another highly recruited kid and comes in and just physically ready to play Knows how to play Hes knocking down shots Look out because he can get after you defensively and create plays like he did here Right on Q Allen got it started for an easy layin with Donaldson When Miami is at their best Randolph it seems like theyre turning defense into offense They they want to They can play that way They can switch like here HERE IT IS AGAIN RENU Count it Plus the foul Malik Renu in a reborn Miami team Hes the face of it Music This is what the mistakes they were making early They switched on the ball screen Thats textbook you want to get up into the basketball on the switch One of the adjustments Miami made at halftime and Malik Renu was just on the staff He hes assembled here and I think its one of the reasons why everyone is watching and everyone that knows landscape of college athletics is really happy to see the U and what theyve done and and really excited for the future of this Miami Hurricane program under Jay Lucas And Lucas has been a part of big staffs at Texas Kentucky and most recently Duke And so he knows the importance of getting the right group together And everybodys got to have a different strength but as a collective whole he feels like hes built the right crew to turn this thing around quickly I said Look you could be this years Louisville He goes I dont know if were going to win 18 ACC games He said it easy buddy He he quick to quad down on that conversation Like wait a minute now of Pat Kelsey and his staff to set a high bar for year one coaches of the ACC Good ball movement up ahead and usually Milo will make you pay from there This is the next step here we talked about with Miami too You get it you get these leads up this much and can you continue to put your foot on the gas as you go to your bench Now hes got quite a few guys here from the bench The only starter out there now is Malik Renu And lets see if the bench guys can step up and can continue to put their foot on the pedal Inside Renu and hes delivered all night long With this lineup the Canes can switch if they want Theyre choosing not to allow Malik Renu to play to five Up to 20 points tonight So versatile between that four and five is capable of both Corner three falls off the rim no good Stson after making seven threes in the first half still looking for their first of this second The extra pass finds Dante Allen He cant cash in Offensive rebound Marcus Allen who got it stripped away Theyre always looking when they get the ball in the low post Theyre always looking to pass big big inside looking for the lob Stson continuing to let it fly from three Even though they have fallen ice cold in this second half theyre just giving up on trying to score inside The lengths just bothering them Too much sides in the pink Theyre just driving the pass When the threes are not there theyre struggling to get a look at the rim and warmed down by this Miami defense Next Sunday right here on ACC Network womens basketball double header tips off three Eastern with Georgia Tech and Jacksonville And then it is Florida State taking on Indiana and what should be a good one in Tallahassee Both available on the allnew ESPN app Its another look at another new head coach there and coach locks down at Florida State and theyre going to shoot a lot of threes A ton of threes Complete opposite of the mind of these Hurricanes trying to control the paint Theyre trying to space you and shoot it Yep They are not shy They are going to let it fly Hes getting on his players for not shoot threes Thats the kind of coach I didnt like to play for And heres what Ill say about those two programs Youre coming in after a disappointing season but with the infrastructure so well in place Yes youre taking over but really you look at what coach Hamilton did at Florida State and what Coach Larenega has done here at Miami and you have sustained success and youre not walking in and going Oh oh no Im inheriting a disaster Youre inheriting programs that are very healthy and theyve had recent success that you can draw upon and two coaches two Hall of Fame coaches by my estimation No doubt And I think in short time well see that happen but theyre visibly around the programs and theres so much experience that theyre helping both young coaches out Bright futures ahead in the state of Florida from ACC basketball Music Step back three No good from the freshman Shawn Morgan The misses keep piling up for Stephson in this second half Its allowed Miami to completely separate a 30point lead for the Hurricanes Yeah the Hatters Land theyre gambling You dont get a rebound theyve got to get back and set their defense And this is a Stson team that 10 minutes into this game was leading 205 Miami has just completely dominated from that point on They have a lot of confidence early They knew they needed to knock down threes They did They forced a couple of turnovers and sped Miami up And now Miami settled down and really starting to play their brand of basketball Another foul called Tutas the freshman from Turkey doesnt like the call We got a chance to talk to him and yeah hes a character huh He is He is He got a ton of personalities Hes he wants to play with a level of physicality He doesnt mind throwing his body around Nothing has come easy offensively for Stson That turnaround cant find the bottom of the rim And Miami is just so committed to turning a defensive stop into points They get the ball up the floor so quickly You have to get back and corral the basketball So many guys can attack you Theyre advancing it up and whoever gets it is putting their head down Theyre driving right to the rim and forcing contact forcing the officials to blow the whistle Heres Henderson at the line The freshman out of Texas you 66 240 Watching him a shoot around you look and go hes built like a football player He looks like Derek Henry coming at you He He does And then you know somebody on the Miami staff said Well his uncle is Eric Dickerson Hall of Fame running back You most single season rushing yards in the history of the NFL with over 2000 And you can see hes hes got that in him Hey listen Hes built like that and hes running over guys in the lane Hes not a guy you want to put just step in front of and take a charge I can tell you that Well then I asked did he play football And he said no He never liked football Whenever the football coach at his high school walked his way he he turned around and went the other way in the hallway Always loved hoops So good idea there but not quite the execution from Washington trying to bounce it off a Stson player and ends up hitting him Got the ricochet there Laughter True Washington did a really good job of trying to throw it off a defender Ends up catching it Ball bouncing off himself Defensive intensity has been there for Miami and that has been the difference in this game That school days ability there He he knows his job is to anchor the defense Did a really good job there showing on a ball screen Theyve done a really good job of cleaning that part of it up A lot of mistakes early and not communicating on ball screens Theyve seem to have fixed that here in the second half when either the hedge guy or the switch has really been aggressive in forcing turnovers getting up in the basketball Already eight fouls for Stson this second half So Miami shooting the rest of the way Front end of the one and one drained by Marcus Allen Another one of these Miami natives that have returned home via the transfer portal after his freshman season at Missou kind of fitting You can see see Charleston Young see why And theres the the own goal if this was our soccer game Yan Ratski went up for the rebound and it resulted in another two points for Miami Yeah I think a little bit of the European balls alive on the rim He didnt let that come off and former Texas AM red shirt freshman is just dropped in two for the other team Miami hasnt needed any help on the offensive end but they got it here on the rebound Whoops He does a great job of trying to high point it And who gets credit for the bucket Its a question Again if this were a European soccer matchki would get the the two just for Miami Good ball movement Didnt lead to a made three but Miami shares the ball very well Good open shot there Henderson with another baseline look there And thats a key for him Can he knock down that three Ratovski this time on the right rim Talk about Miami sharing the ball Well 20 assists tonight just one shy of their season average What you see tonight is how theyll play throughout the year here It doesnt matter the opponent They may not be able to dominate everyone on the B on the glass but they control the paint Its how they want to play Yeah it started with strong defense and then on the offensive side of the ball a slow start but theyve really found their rhythm A 7744 lead here for the Hurricanes in the second half Music over the weekend So it is chaos in the ACC You take a look at the college football playoff top 12 And you got to add Wake Forest is an all sides a flag all sides being called away from being seven and two Oh of course you got to bring up your Im just bringing an honest opinion I mean theyd be two ranked teams I mean they would they would at least get votes for the top 25 with that resume Seven and two right now Yeah With wins against Georgia Tech in Virginia they would be in the top 25 And and I think the conversation there is a first year head coach just like weve seen college basketball teams do You you can turn it around quickly year one Dickers done a great job this first year Theres no need to go okay give me a couple recruiting classes Give me till year three or year four You know Jay Lucas said youre expected to win year one He is He understands that I mean you have to show everybody what your program is going to look like And hes shown you that with his ability to recruit Hes shown you he can get fivestar recruits coming in and the university is offering a lot of support and and renovations and everything within this program and got to be really excited about what you see in the landscape in the future These guys are playing really hard for him too Hes got everybody dialed in guarding Theyre defending Theyre sharing the basketball They may not make shots every night but theyre going to compete Theyre going to defend Theyre going to share the basketball every night And thats easier said than done with a new group Absolutely Is to get them to buy in and be very unselfish You know Malik Renu hes been the most consistent scorer He scored 20 points in all three games this season But outside of him just really balanced across the board Thats the way it has to be All five starters average in double figures Again once they get into the season and these guys get foul trouble and if their depth gets tested were really going to see what the ceiling is for the Miami Hurricanes Transition triple off the mark and I think the Florida game is really going to give you an indicator going against the reigning national champions The feelgood factor has returned to this program Theyve created excitement by winning in dominant fashion in these first three games with Sunday against number three Florida national champs a year ago Thats going to tell you if this Miami team is going to be in the elite conversation or if theyre just going to be an upper half ACC team Well you dont want to put too much into one game but it gives you a marker to see where you are against that floating man Your style of play Can you be a bully to the bully And thats what Florida U did last year to win a national championship and hadnt much changed Theyre even bigger this year than they were a year ago Yeah youre kind of in a no lose situation right No ones going to expect you to win that game but if you win it woo the expectations will go skyhigh here in year one Foul called Henderson hes not afraid to put his head down and go to work Hes expecting that to be a foul the physicality there Just puts your shoulder down and he lifts that right arm just a little bit Had he not did that I think hes shooting two free throws It didnt seem like Stson was set but when you But when you do the push off Yeah Yeah You extend that arm its almost automatic And when youre up 35 you tend to not get all the calls as well Lets just put that in play A 35 point game You wouldnt know it the way Dante Allens playing defense Hes been relentless all night Thats just the way theyre playing Up 35 and hes pressuring the basketball Youre a freshman and you want to get on the floor Thats how you get on the floor Taking pride and guarding the basketball Closing the 10 seconds count They do a really good job of just getting that basketball in the middle of the zone and got to keep the ball out of the middle of the zone It just opens up too much So difficult to stop anyone The ball gets there and Miamis done a great job of just penetrating that zone and getting it in the middle and just destroying this Hatters defense You go back to the conversation we were having about Florida not just as big for Miami but the ACC because we saw last year if you dont deliver in nonconference play it negatively affects you Well the ACC has delivered and then some If they can keep that rolling into mid December you cant deny that they are going to get a lot of teams into the NCAA tournament Yeah I I think Id be really surprised if theyre not you know seven or eight teams at least in the ACC tournament I mean in the NCAA tournament from the ACC I I think the league is that much better than its been in the last couple of years And youre looking at a team thatll be fighting for one of those spots here If they can get some consistent threepoint shooting you can all but book your ticket But theyre going to defend and be physical and put a lot of pressure on teams in this league Its incredible Well you mentioned the threepoint shooting Theyve only made five threes in this game and theyve got 80 points How are they able to put so many points on the board despite not really taking and making a lot of threes Because they they have multiple guys that can put the ball in the deck and do that Thatll help LOOK OUT The freshman Henderson Hes got 17 Those are the flashiest two They got multiple guys that can attack you off the bounce and make plays just like that I mean Malik Reu gets the ball in the high post Hes a playmaker Hes a scorer And here hes looking And guys just know if I cut out they someone on this team will find me Theyre sharing the basketball at a high level They dont have to shoot threes great when theyre built on controlling the paint and attacking the rim And they put so much pressure on you to foul Theyre either getting to the free throw line or theyre making point rank layups or even dunks like that 46 points in the paint for Miami Who who needs threes when you got that right No you dont have to This team is built off toughness Its a big part of that All the threepoint shooting and all those things will come in time Right now this is his first year He wanted everyone to know what Miami was going to look like and what hes going to build this program on And his defense and toughness and thats what youre seeing And toughness is controlling the paint Yeah that physicality has just worn Stson down tonight I think its going to wear a lot of teams down and they got length I mean a lot of length here I mean this is a big We talked about it last year I thought Duke did a great job a year ago with that and he he talked to us about that like hey the length and the way the game is being played right now and you heard it even on the NBA level theyre getting away from a lot of small ball stuff and theyll play those small ball lineups in phases but the majority of this team theyre just really really big and playing with an old school traditional four and five and controlling the paint They feel like if they take the right shots the threes will fall But one thing you cant question when you look at this Miami roster is the talent Yeah Jay Lucas has just brought so much talent here to year one Its on full display Marcus Allen getting in on the act One thing that had got to be disappointing is their transition defense That was a big emphasis coming into this game and 10 minutes it was there You were saying they were packing the lane making life difficult Remember 10 minutes into this game Stson led 20 to 15 and then Yeah I just think the physicality wore them down They couldnt quite get back it turned into a track meet and thats where Miami just became a runaway train Yeah they stopped knocking down threes and what and it you know it took them quite a bit of time to even get a twopoint field goal So when they started taking those same threes and missing them now those are long rebounds It led to the transition baskets for Miami and then the floodgates opened up from there Yeah Stson started this game five of 11 from three since just two of 12 with too many scoring droughts and they get a bucket there But Miami well in control with under seven minutes left in this one All you want to do if youre coach Jones is keep your guys confident You want to leave this game healthy and youre happy to check clear Well you know you know that checks clearing coming from Miami And one opportunity to u round out that group He couldnt say enough things about what those guys have meant to this program with their experience coming in knowing the expectations And he said Look were far far from perfect But those three guys have given us a head start because of their commitment and their buy in to this program And theyre just showing you everything that he wants done I mean the way he wants his program to look those guys have come in they bought in theyve hit the switch here He was worried over the summer a little bit about how quickly things would come together When those three guys decided to come in and they were all born in it made it easy for everyone else to fall into place And theyre unselfish Theyre sharing the basketball Theres a connection among this group and its why youre so excited about the future in this season WITH THIS TEAM LOB to the rim and Ude was there waiting for it The thing I love about it is that regardless of the score theres no let up Man theyre not playing for the score Theyre still pressuring the basketball still active defensively Theyre not dropping back in the zone This is just their identity right now and how theyre playing Another turnover And And how do you create that Cuz every coach craves it but Miami clearly has it You can tell this every day in practice but again when you try to run a nine or 10 deep guys and this style of play youve got to be able to do it And right now hes building these guys to play for 40 minutes You know hes not going to back off because theyre up because theyre going to be tested Youre not going to beat Florida by 35 points They got BYU Theres so many other games coming up These guys look at this Running out the ball 60 ft down the floor Right on Q And you would never know the score of this game looking that hustle play by Trey Donaldson Its just day by day practice by practice you start building habits And its taken him this long to build this You built this type of expectations over the course of the summer and early part of the season here and its carried over into the season True Washington goes down called for a travel Washington the unsung guy I think comes in from New Mexico Locked down defender Yes And yeah that is a travel I thought he got hit as well right before that step the pivot foot was lifted And talk about Drew Washington again and his ability to knock down shots consistently be critical for this group Hes the one guy I think hes the best shooter in the starting lineup as a another wing a really good wing defender Well you couldnt have scripted a much better start to the Jay Lucas era than this one You beat Jacksonville in your opener then you take down Bthun Cookman by 40 A Bthun Cookman team that took Auburn to overtime earlier in the week And now you fall down early in this game The Stson trailed by six Only scored 15 points in the opening 10 minutes Scoring has not been a problem since Miami up to 92 after that dunk TV doesnt do these guys justice Theyre getting from one end of the floor to the other as quickly as anyone as they get another opportunity here It is one or two passes to get the ball from defense to offense And after a stop Miami is just so difficult to contain in transition Well with their starting lineup and even in their bench theres only two guys that really cant rebound and push So they got multiple guys that can that can handle the basketball initiate the break And so if you dont get the rebound youre just running And theyre looking to pitch ahead and attack you in transition And Music So Miami started to separate at the end of the first half and now a 40point lead with a little more than four minutes and change remaining Freshman JR Leonard there puts his head down and drives to the rim There just hadnt been a ton of opportunities at the rim No the points in the paint so lopsided in this matchup and thats going to happen when we said it from tip off Miami has such a clear size advantage But 56 points in the paint to 18 Yeah that tells the story Music And if Miami is going to be successful this year it wont be to that extent But they got to control the paint Thats just what they built to do is control the paint on both ends of the floor Theyve been able to overwhelm opponents here early in the season and again theyll get a big test coming up And where do you see Miami fitting into the ACC They were preseason number eight If thats the overunder do you have them I think theyre right there This team will be if theyre healthy be fighting for an NCAA tournament bid I think everyone will agree that Duke is really talented Carolina now but they Seth Trimbles injured there you know does that when does he come back NC State has looked good so far early in the year Got so many other teams we have not seen yet but I think Virginia will be another good team and SMU So many really quality squads Syracuse Well the whole leagues off to a strong start and that has continued on a Monday night Miami under four minutes now Shelton Henderson here Randolph and and this Miami team Dante Allen as well I think its a special year of freshman and youre going to see a lot of them Youve seen a few early on display seen Shelton Henderson you got Male Brown for Louisville You got Jaylen Harlson and Notre Dame I mean just a ton of guys Kayen Anthony coming off the bench for I think a really talented Syracuse group So so many freshmen as you see Henderson there and the competition will start ramping up and theyll started getting a true test and these guys have been really special here early in the year Well talent acquisition has never been a problem for Jay Lucas as an assistant and that has not changed as a head coach But its not just here in Miami It really is like you said Randolph across the ACC You know Paul Biancardi our recruiting guru at ESPN said this is the best freshman class hes seen in a couple of decades And I kind of joked with it Paul you said that last year but its two really really good backtoback classes And I think the difference is last year that talent went away from the ACC and this year the ACC has got it It has and I think its balanced throughout the league I mean last year everything was was the Duke freshman and Duke will always have those freshman but now everyone else has seemed to pick up some really talented guys and you seen Caleb Wilson with a performance thats probably ACC player of the week worthy not just freshman of the week worthy Well Lucas was part of bringing all that talent to Durham in the three years he served as associate head coach for John Shelovich knocks down another Miami up to 98 points on the night Well thats not to get to Hoke Hes got a freshman up there that had an outstanding performance against Providence but you hadnt seen him yet I mean just a lot of new faces and a lot of great talented freshman in EAC A lot of the storylines in years past are what they are Theyre in the past Miamis offense will get the headlines once again but its their defense that really dialed in in this game You know as impressive it is as it is that theyve scored 98 holding Stson to 53 after they shot and made seven threes in the first half has been very impressive Yeah theyve locked in defensively against this group and I think the best thing is that there even though its a foul called you got a freshman in the island still stand in front of the basketball Theyve been able to guard the basketball and not foul Thats really been impressive Theyre really making you guard your yard Theyre not relying on as much help Theyre leaving defenders oneonone and more times than not theyre winning those oneonone matchups And this is the culture I mean again theyre up 30 35 and and theyre still playing as if this is the first two minutes of the game Applause And that is how you set that culture Its demanding and thats the buzz word right Every coach uses it but youre seeing it in the first three games the relentlessness in which Miami plays Its their calling called Its their identity The points are one thing but I I think the defensive end has been equally impressive This isnt just a one game sample size too Youve now seen it for three games And look the the step up will be Sunday night against Florida But look look at that production And youre getting at more importantly what we do know about Miami is that theyre going to play a style thats going to junk the game up But what we do know is that when they get in these close games in the ACC they have a closer in Trey Donaldson and its hit game winners and that you can put the ball into his hands close the game out at the free throw line and this team is a dangerous team that you dont want to be in a onep possession game against Applause wears that one Hes hit four threes The freshman from Slovakia started the game tonight in place of Donaldson and four made threes for him Hes another one of these X factors for the Hurricanes who could come off the bench and provide a critical role If they can rely on him to be a consistent threepoint shooter with already having True Washington doing that with his length its just another added weapon A rare offensive rebound and Stson cashes in on it And the same thing with the Hatters Theyre theyre they continue to play Theyre battling now Theyre starting to drive Theyre not settling as much early I think sometimes knocking down threes can be a negative And they started settling and that got them in trouble once they started missing Now theyre doing making more of a conscious effort to get to the rim Our ACC Network double header continues from Atlanta Georgia Tech taking on Southeastern Louisiana Looking forward to that one in a matter of moments Music Allen trying to spin his way in Deflected out of bounds What do you think of Georgia Tech this season Randolph as we get ready for the Yellow Jackets to be the night cap of our Monday night double header I think Bongo is one of the most difficult matchups in this league Uh hell have to step up and play at a allconerence type level He needs to make a jump like the Malik Manu jump were seeing right now I think he has that type of ability and if he does look out well be talking about the Yellow Jackets early in the season You you just dont know who is going to make that jump right I think its a huge testament to Georgia Tech that they retained Dongo because you know his phone must have been lightening up with what he has done in his career so far And player retention is such a critical part of college basketball now It is And you got to be able to ret you know you know recruit then develop really good players and then you got to be able to retain them And its never been harder No its its never been harder And Damon start and it happens at every level I dont care if youre a low mid you know low division one mid major or even high major Its you know uh his starting point guard is at Georgia Tech is now the starting point guard for the Orange in Syracuse So thats just the nature of the business Arent you happy youre sitting here next to me rather than worrying about all that Im like Coach L baby Im undefeated I I hadnt lost one Yeah theyre still competing I mean everyone that comes into the game knows Theres Coach Al You just referenced him And Coach L was an offensive guy Now you can play a little defense but he he he like his guys to put it in the hole Hes happy with a Miami team thats averaging over 90 points per game to start the season I think its great that hes amazing around the program still because sometimes when you get a coaching transition its not like that and thats a testament to coach Allen It is Jay Lucas two great guys That handoff has been seamless And hes hoping that they can hang more banners like the one he helped hang in 2023 when they went to the Final Four for a magical run that again not too long ago right The blueprint is there for Jay Lucas and the talent is here most importantly and thats what coach Lucas was preaching us to us earlier today is South Florida this is a fertile recruiting ground You wont have to go far to land some top level talent that can make runs in the ACC in the NCAA tournament He made it clear Hes trying to win the state Hes trying to tell these guys Hey you can come home And if youre a recruit out there you got to like what you see Everyone touches the basketball Everyone shares it Everyones productive Get to showcase your full offensive skill set And the only thing hes demanding out of you is you got to be able to defend Its a fair tradeoff Music One thing they hadnt seen a lot of is mantoman defense though be an adjustment for them coming up against Florida who will play a ton of man Oh man Well its fitting that the final possession is more good ball movement cuz Miami had 28 assists and a convincing win against Edson 10261 the final as the Jay Lucas era continues First back to Maca
