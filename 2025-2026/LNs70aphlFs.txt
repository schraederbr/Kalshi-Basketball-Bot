year For the first time Clemson beat Duke The Blue Devils looking for some get back on Valentines Day Well how about this Clemsons last win here 1995 Duke has won the last 21 games here against the Tigers who win the opening tip and we are underway cheering They got to have a They got to have a good start They dont have a good start Thats going to really set them back In the paint where they want to live and its Godfrey to hit the first two RJ Godfrey 67 senior and Cory in that painted area If theyre going to win today they have to have a big day And theyre going to need a big day from Godfrey This Clemson team really hasnt gotten the production from their starters OB that theyve gotten from their bench which of course is the leading bench scoring team in the ACC Caleb Foster looking to penetrate and the kick outside on the drive Itll be Sar goes short with the jump shot Stay on this end Dick you mentioned Dave Godfrey Godfrey did win Georgia last year came back to Clemson His dad played football in Georgia was a star went out to fame in the NFL but he came back to Clemson and theyre glad to have him Hes physically tough He came back because of his affection for Brad Brownell He said his philosophies I really didnt appreciate them as much as I should have And when I came back I realized how good he is Off the mark and the rebound hauled in by Carter Welling who gets six a game big guy coming off 19 points in the loss to Virginia Tech But a big stumble for the Tigers this week and batted away by Boozer ON THE ATTACK HE SLAMS IT HOME YOU KNOW he he excels as well defensively as he does offensively We know he can score inside He can shoot the three And hes certainly unbelievable rebounder He absolutely is that and averages over one and a half steals per game top 10 in the ACC and showing off that little bit of that ability on the first defensive possession Justin Porter likes to get the threes in the air as their number one taker getting it back to Godfrey Godfrey again trying to get in the blue and left it short Well defended Patrick Duna who has a wrist injury injured that against North Carolina Theres some question whether he would play Gets in the starting lineup today as you look at that for the Duke Blue Devils OB John Sh told us that theyre a different team without Patrick Gumble on the floor SOLID player the first round pick Evans with a bang Should we say a kiss off the window Yeah Hey Valentines Day We giving out kisses today laughter baby Hey keep your kisses Stay right there Dicky B you know we love you You know how much we love you Hunter with the bounce here for Godfrey very active here in the opening seconds for the Tigers Looking to pick up their 21st win and thats going to be a turnover Oh theyre going to get a foul Theyre going to get a foul on Gunbo Looked like he had a stop there And John Sh is I rateate because he saw what you saw OB He felt like that was a clean strip and a great job by Gumbbo Hands up They say that the hand is a part of the ball and that was a lot of basketball on that possession I think Young is really an important player He didnt play against Pittsburgh and they dominated that game Hes an important player here today having him back Godfrey 67 senior from Sani Georgia As Dick mentioned his dad played football at Georgia and was a roommate of Dylan Hunters dad calling Hunter the Suns and guard and hell make the pair They look they they suddenly miss Chase Hunter He was a star who can get him points They dont have a star player somebody we can go to whos going to get us points where were in trouble And Dicky B thats why Brad told us this game needs to be in the 60s for his team to be successful Foster gets a great look and buries a three cheering But Duke making threes at this rate Im not sure its going to be in the 60s Brad Bell has to be disappointed with the giving up the looks early from three especially the wide open one to Caleb Falls You know Corine told me we got to get a good start early in this game But God again getting another touch trying to get out of that double and hes tied up and theres a whistle and a foul against Duke Day one hes getting doubled up and hes got to look to the off side because wide open down there but hes putting his head down when hes dribbling and has no vision or feel for where somebody is Foster with the foul John Sh year number four 38 years old as he reminded Cory in our meeting today laughter He said Im a lot younger than you are Cory Yeah he had a lot of He had emphasis on a lot than hell be Well I screwed up I said Cory did you play against Shire I said no Im like Im 14 years old Thats because Corys so youthful Welling in close cant hit My gray hair appreciates you OB cheering and applause Duke on top 84 and with the basketball coming in at 222 111 in the ACC Wheres the last second loss to North Carolina but they came back strong against Pit and won by 16 Boozer hitting the deck No whistle on that And in transition Godfrey dumping it downstairs for Welling and cant make the shot but he takes the foul hell be headed to the line But by Boozer falling down that gives Clemson a 504 advantage That 504 advantage ends up getting the second foul on Gungba trying to contest at the rim early in this game John Sh made it very clear to us they are a different team without Gunga on the floor He got in foul trouble against UNCC Only played 16 minutes in that game which is Dukes only loss That was his second foul So hes going to sit Theyre about to find out again how much they miss him for a while Its going to be a lengthy stretch on the bench Pretty good guy comes in though Malik Brown cheering Great defender one of the best in the country You know its really interesting when you think about it You just mentioned Cory They lost that game one game they played That was really a tough loss But you know think about this Their two losses They had 14 point leads in second half from both those games Texas Tech and Boston Carolina They could easily be undefeated And John Shyers talked about the issue that theyve had closing games He said you know we got to try to win some games as though hes only we lost two this year but they need to close games better Hes laughter going to win some games COME ON JOHN The fastest coach victories in ACC history Needs to win some games Davidson goes to the other side of the iron Pretty move for the 610 senior from California You know Dick played for Steve Wford down at Nevada Steve an outstanding coach Ive always liked Steve Walford as a player Could he shoot the rock Wow One of the great shooters of all time at the college level Foster jumping in to nothing but orange shirts The kick out for Sar and on the money Brad Brownell wanting a travel on the other side of the floor cheering Felt like that is the reason why Sar was able to be so wide open on that look You saw a shot of last years player of the year Of course Cooper Flag whos in attendance down for the slam and an easy two for Godfrey Tell you one thing they get the ball inside really nice Zar you talking to John Shy he goes wild and raves about his defensive ability Hes 68 freshman He said hes as good a perimeter defender as I have coached And thats saying a lot when youve got the national player of the year from a year ago sitting courtside who was cheering only here because of a foot injury thats keeping him out of NBA Allstar AllStar festivities because of an injured foot So chooses to come back to Durham while Khan Canipple will compete in the threepoint contest and the rising stars challenge this evening But you look at the talent alone that was in was on this roster a season ago with Seion James in the rotation and Tyrese Proctor in the rotation at Cleveland Youre talking about elite level talent that led this group to the final four a season ago They certainly utilized that elite talent and had some super year last year Really did In fact they were up six with about a minute to go on Houston They got to give Kelvin Samson and his kids What a gutty comeback they made to win that game But you mentioned Flag Flags going to be rookie of the year and number two of Incredible They recently squared off against each other in an epic duel at the NBA level That was a blast to watch Funo with the basketball and trailing by one I think its the game he had at 49 Guy at 34 Lets fly Hes the number one threepoint guy but only 35 Theyre not great in that category And coming up 3 Eastern on ABC in the ESPN app number 14 Florida taking on number 25 Kentucky Thats in Gainesville Florida on the way Dicky V how about the resurgence of Kentucky the way theyve played in SEC action Yeah they really have played a lot better Certainly from the way they started the season Good credit to Mark Pope for that Buckner shot clock down to five Wine in the paint turning to fire Shot Yeah man Shot Shot clock was winding down but Bucker man his father was something special Absolutely And hes tuned in today Hes got a break They have to check him Maybe hes maybe hes in the building Allstar break for for Greg Butner whos an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks His son Ace whos been playing great basketball as of late had 16 in their loss on Wednesday night Amen Shot clock down to two Theyve got to get a long one in the air and the line driver ugly off the side of the backboard But what were watching are the two best defensive teams in the ACC Now Virginia can get in that mix as well but when you consider that both these teams are holding their opponents under 65 points per game Duke is one Clemson two at 646 You always get a chance to win when you defend really well like Duke And you combine it with a lead offense as well I mean theyre ranked high both offensively and defensively with their efficiency And thats why theyre sitting there with two losses Suffocating D always under Bradell of course Davidson turns No And a rebound picked off by Isaiah Evans Hes coming off a 21point game against Pittsburgh So far Camboozer pretty quiet to this point but hes going to back that in He heard you Obie He heard you homie He said Come on Obie Quiet 23 23 points a game Thats right Hes been absolutely a 3S man Super Cintillating sensational Did I call you that Cory when you play in Virginia Absolutely And I got it on tape still laughter YOURE NOT ALONE IN THAT REGARD Saving those Dicky B clips Although that might have been a cassette Kim Belton Lets go VHS Lets go VHS OB off Clemson downstairs The Boozer playing some defense Yeah Unheralded as what he does defensively because he averages 23 points per game But also on the Nate Smith defensive player of the Ward watch list is Cameron Boozer So he absolutely plays on both ends of the floor The reason why I think the three of us agree right now that he would be our choice for the national player of the year I know doubt about it The first selection to be in the draft will be AJ the Demana Theres no question that has been absolutely super The pros love him I give him the edge sizewise Even though Peterson is a terrific talent and he doesnt play misses too many games But when you want to talk about most productive its 12 and white Cameron Boozer since high school has been the most productive guy as Welling is productive on the block for the second time Did he earn that He put up a season high 19 against Virginia Tech on Wednesday He was going bodyto body with Malik Brown That can be a long day for anybody but he made a heck of a shot But OB you see the difference in playing against Malik Brown the post in comparison to Gungba Gunga is able to hold his own from a strength standpoint Brown straight on with a triple That wont go Boozer hustles for the rebound Then an Aaron toss meant for Foster out of play I see a trend here I see a trend in this game They are get what I said what about the trip to California You won cheering those two games and youre going to come back and play I think that trip is really really tough Well Duke did it They came back and won Clemson came back and lost They gave up 11 threes in that game Off target by Thomas There will be one difference between Duke and Clemson with that trip back Duke didnt play till the following Saturday right They had a byee that week Clemson played on Wednesday as Kaden Boo was able to get inside for the easy one Tell you what we had the game last year at Clemson Clemson won the game 777 Was a great basketball game Highly charged emotionally because Dicky B was making a return And that one out of the corner will be dropped in for Buckner But for you I know a really really special day Yeah it really was very emotional day for me You know after three years battling that vicious cancer and to come back and get the greeting I did from the beautiful fans that were there pumps fans treating me like royalty and say thank you for that because being here and Ive said this so often is the greatest medicine in the world I was telling John today talking to coach Sh I said you know what theres nothing like them giving me all the medicine they want the doctors But being in an arena and being with guys like you love the game is just the greatest high I can get I mean that sincerely I love basketball Love it dearly and and its been great to me and obviously Boozer at the line Knocks that one down 77 for the 69 freshman He has five points today Boozer the ACCs top scorer You know what he does really well A lot of people dont give him credit He moves well without the ball Thats a lost art for a lot of players Cory Move it without the ball They stand and a guy that stands is easy to defend And hes also a great screener And what what did you always tell your players as a coach The guy that normally sets the screen is the one thats going to be open Part of the reason why he averages 23 points a game Most most dangerous player on the floor catalates that screen Bubba Johnson lets fly Rebound tipped and controlled by Malik Brown Shooting the three is really a problem when you look at Clemson stats 35 not a strength and a foul boozer on the entry pass 1023 to go first half Duke has won 28 consecutive home games Bronnell and Clemson trying to interrupt that today I think the record that they have 14 in a row in the conference comes in on the road in conference play is very impressive Sure And speaking of the conference we had opportunity to talk with our commissioner Jim Phillips earlier today whos ecstatic about the way things have gone for the ACC this season Right now youre talking about eight teams who seem to have a firm footing in the NCAA tournament with a couple more being considered Twice as many as last year Well you know really Jim great great commission I love Jim Phillips Terrific guy Got to know him when he was at Northern Day But Ill say this I said Youre going to get eight teams Jim Probably the end this year Lets double last year What do you mean WHAT ABOUT NINE OR 10 laughter THEY WANT MORE Everybody wants more more and more I think theyll get eight I really do Couple on the bubble of course as well Clemson with the ball Hunter Clemson averaging eight points four rebounds Hes their best threepoint guy percentagewise at 38 Pauline gives it up Shot clock inside 10 Carter Welling at 611 Awkward looking shot Had a whistle on the play And they caught Sar with the hand in the cookie jar Welling with using a sweep Thats really more of an NBA move But Sar without moving his hand out of the way makes contact as coach Emanuel Dilly is telling Sar just that You got to get your hand out of the way and get the hand up It was coach Dilly scout earlier So cheering he is making sure to get his point across to the freshman saw Tell you one thing Welling is a very good athlete He can really run and jump Hes an explosive player cheering Was the Wack defensive player of the year last year Dicky V So this young man can get it done on both ends of the floor And the Wack has some good talent Really cheering good talent some really very intense basketball He had a gutsy second half in the Virginia Tech loss He had turned his ankle Looked like he was done for the night He came back in the second half hitting the bench here Tell you one thing the Mid Majors have some outstanding teams The Miami Ohio team is 25 and0 I sent a little note to Mike Dorsey who I respect dearly does a great job at sporting news and said boy Id love to see some of these mid majors in the tournament and add so much excitement think about St Lewis is terrific right now as well Harris into the game misfiring on a long one and Clemson lets that roll out And another team keep an eye on Santa Clara Santa Clara coached by Herb Sentic who should have never been fired when he was at NC State Six straight years Cory Six Look it up Its a fact Get him to the NCA tournament But it wasnt good enough Wasnt good enough Herb is a really heck of a coach Oh Godfrey Nice reverse of field and slams it down And Godfrys been very aggressive to start this game We saw Clemson go to him on the first couple of possessions Now hes up to eight points in this one and able to attack off the bounce Well the attack from defense oneonone situation early in the game doubling up on him and he didnt really find the open man Foster really looked like he settled there for a long jump shot Couldnt hit it I got to believe Brad by now has got to like the early start of his team Well he loves to score right now This is the pace that he wants to play at Nikki V wants the game in the 60s if he can have it today Godfrey another touch Oh Brad recovered beautifully and swatted it away Foster in transition and the kick for Harris but he cannot connect out of the open floor all the way down to the other end The lay in will not go Wall shot cheering would not drop in 1817 the Tigers had a great chance to add to it 813 to go in the half Not much defensive balance on that possession The three pointer goes up and no one getting back while unable to get the layup to go but Clemson able to get out in transition where they will absolutely take their chances when they get them That was an easy layup though He really was challenged on that baby Hell let fly this one A threepointer wont go for Wall That hasnt been his strength throughout this season And Duke doesnt want anyone to have open looks but if they have to choose someone to beat them from the outside theyll allow to be the guy thats going to beat them from the perimeter cheering Isaiah Evans threepointer Got it And on the flip side thats the last guy that Brad Brownell wants to get anything on the perimeter Isaiah Evans coming off a 21point effort at Pittsburgh on Tuesday night continues his high shooting from beyond the arc Yeah hes had a solid year here Theres no doubt about it Six points for him Onehander flipped up by Hunter That wont drop Evans coming out of the Frey with the rebound And he got a recent message from his head coach Hes going to try another one and off target there but John Sh taking him out of the lineup Re that would basically be my allAmerican team And Dicky B being that were showing love Two of those guys I had an opportunity to spend some time with this summer When you talk about the Braden Smith and the Baron Phylon at the CP3 elite point guard camp and we got to show some love to my little bro Chris Paul who retired this after 21 seasons in the game What a career Incredible Hall of Fame right away for sure Jump shot from nothing but net in the corner for Dame Sar 68 freshman Good game against North Carolina 13 Tell you one thing they get squared on his floor with the defensive plays That is special He goes airborne to save the rebound Kaden Boozer inside for Cameron Just drawing a little bit of attention Heres Brown straight on Got a good look Boozer with the rebound and the dribble down Went to the other side of the iron but Clemson collapsed on him I think these six minutes are big for this game Theyre really big this time You cant allow Duke to go on a spurt right now Im going that locker room with a double digit lead Well youve seen a lot of games here You know the rhythms of this thing at Cameron Indoor and how it can get away from the opponent if theyre not really careful Honor slams on the brakes Bubba Johnson bouncing for Welling Shes having a tough time cheering Shot clock down to nothing And its a violation Duke shuts HIM DOWN ON THAT END WHAT A cheering great defensive effort right there That really is the definition of team defense Communicate help one another I mean this a great job defensively forcing a bad bad shot But how about Isaiah Evans at the end of that possession recognizing as the shot clock goes down as offensive player turns his back goes over to make sure that he cant spin back into a good look Thats the type of effort defensively that John Sh wants to see from Evans He knows what he can do on the offensive end but didnt start the second half against Pittsburgh on Tuesday night Obie because of plays like that He got the message a little bit of a message there and delivered Boozer off the mark 2318 Duke under 6 minutes to go at Cameron Indoor Duke 33 and2 in their last 35 ACC games Jumping inside the lane Nicely done by Justin Porter Gets about 10 a game And we still call that a travel in the pickup game by the way laughter Yeah they dont go to travel to the NBA No they dont Porter is a guy that can shoot the three Hes the one guy team can shoot threes Little shove here with 517 to go Bradell talking about the personality of his team and of course he is the elder statesman among coaches in the ACC 16 years were not as potent offensively as maybe some teams we play against So if were going to win were going to have to guard really well And he can get the best out of his team defensively Weve seen him do it for 16 years throughout this league And when he does have that elite offensive team and normally ends up in the elite 8 fighting it shoved back in his face a couple of times Loser one of the fouls well there but I know it was a clean defensive play Oh thats a tough pass to get cheering They never had the angle to get that ball in Thats your coaching coming out right now You starting to talk about the angle Absolutely Did not have a good angle on that pass A tough catch there No basket but another foul Thats my favorite when Dicky V goes back to his coaching days You know people have to realize what a tremendous coach he was He has downplayed it for years but he was outstanding Got to watch the documentary They got to see it Obie you and I stayed up and made sure we watched it at the hotel one night after a game Unbelievable Just going back off the coaching accolades you had well before you even picked up the microphone Its really nice you guys You my PR agents laughter Wow Im going to hire you guys Yeah like like you need any help Heres Boozer high Amen Puts it to the deck trying to get his way into the paint to get a shot to a left hand Yeah what a great move What a great move Nick cheering was a McDonalds AllAmerican as well and being able to take advantage in the post We know about his ability from beyond the ark but theyre showing off He has the ability to play with some footwork in the painted area as well He was a big time player out in California on a scholastic level Theyre all big time players Duke doesnt get you if youre not a big time player Godfrey again wriggling free but he kind of air it over the top of the rim and hes angry at himself And remember Duke playing without Patrick Gumba their anchor on the interior who picked up two fouls in the first four minutes of this game So give the Blue Devils a lot of credit for being able to hang in there defensively holding Clemson to 20 points in the first 16 minutes of action Well Clemson held number 25 which is pretty good But Im I think the next three minutes and change are really big Thats See right there You cant let them get away And if they go on one of those spurts they get the cheering Cameron Crazy all fired up This place becomes electric Good timeout cheering Real good timeout Isaiah Evans with Duke by eight but as Dicki has mentioned feels like a bit of a danger zone for the Tigers I agree I definitely see a danger zone right here Ace Buckner 62 freshman I like him I like Ace Buckner the way the feel he has for the game out there Cory he really seems so confident His dad was really spiked And lets think about this How often do you see guys willing to red shirt and figure it out Ace Buckner did that a season ago as Duke has another great defensive possession Sar on the run out on the ATTACK BUT CANT FINISH IT OH thats a break Is that a break for Clemson That was a sure deuce And quickly heres Buckner to cash in on the other end Fivepoint swing Dicky B You talked about the break on one end In comparison to getting two for the Blue Devils it ends up being three on the other side for the Tigers I tell you one thing they miss that good math teach laughter Youre pretty quick with that math man Kane Boozer rolling inside for the feed Those two hooking up and a great find from his brother at the top of the key who continues to distribute the basketball even though hes not scoring at his normal clip A really really fine passer among many other things he does exceptionally well Godfrey again hes really active today He really has been extremely aggressive and Clemson has done a nice job of getting the basketball to him in the paint And just like that now its a fivepoint game where we talked about that danger zone Clemson has been able to weather the tide just a bit Camboozer hell draw the foul Godfrey hits him Well the Boozer Twins Just like they did it in the backyard for years and years going up Thats whats called a split action which this gentleman used a lot of when he was playing for the Utah Jazz Jerry Sloan used to always run a lot of splits between his guards Normally Jeff Hornosk John Stockton I got caught up in a lot of those splits and it didnt always work out well for me OB But that split action right there is now a huge part of the college game Youre not smiling as you remember that Taden Boozer trying to muscle inside and hell draw the foul He and his brother Cam won four straight high school state championships together and a national title as well Thats Carlos Let me tell you this The one thing I love look at all the stats about certainly Cameron Boozer number one in high school He won everything He won postseasons every award going out there and he won every championship Paul Bian Cardi told me our guru in terms of the recruits he said Man he won everything summer winter playing anybody he played with they won Absolutely And Dicky V he has a chance And when you look at his high school resume he may have the most accomplished high school resume of all time He won four high school championships Obby mentioned he also won Peach Jam Championships at age 15 at 16 and at 17 The 15 and 16 titles were against another gentleman in the building by by the name of Cooper Flag Ill tell you one thing and I really hes a very impressive part of a guy with that winners mentality because he wants nothing less Nothing less A lot of guys talk the game you know we want to win want to win but how many really really make it happen Kaden Boozer with the foul but the Tigers at the line under two minutes to go in the first half 3125 the Blue Devils snorts and Ephraim Butter Johnson at the line UAB transfer His uncle gave him that nickname when he was born cheering Butter Johnson You like butter I dont think butter Too much cholesterol Dont use laughter that butter man And Ill tell you one thing we violated every rule about cholesterol last night Oh was it unbelievable I was watching our producer eat and our crew and I was unbelievable I got a lecture when I got back to the room My wife was so mad at me You know you eat tonight Six different pastas laughter chicken I knew wed get cholesterol on the air today I just had a laughter feeling we would Foster on the wing Heres Evans Hell drive and kick Shot clock to six Dan Boozer dick and a blocking foul No charge No no charge on that one That was the only chance that Welling had because Boozer started with the head of steam It was going into that spin move Welling figured let me lay down now otherwise its going to get ugly But absolutely great call on that one Hes leaning in with the left shoulder No chance of getting a charge on that So one and one Duke referee man You give me a referee going down there These are my guys See I dont have my own plane like you So I travel with these guys all the time This is what we talk about on our flights Its a good crew Tommy Moresy Tim Cockardy and Mark Schneer Clocky Thats his dad was a great great referee Yes Ive seen all of it like a few months later that foul laughter against Michigan You going all the way back to the 89 National Championship game Yeah Pretty good memory huh Oh yeah I remember that very well Boozer picking up Hunter Hell swing for Johnson Porter Shot clock again a factor down to five Then a big problem for Clemson off the back iron and a scrap for it It reset to 20 They would need a three cheering I think John Madre right on top of it does a great job of the ACC and stats out of the corner Davidson No But two offensive rebounds on that possession Another one This time itll be hauled in by Jimemena Really limited offensively Theres no doubt And Brad Brownell coach Brownell tells us that I mean this is the hiding So were limited offensively Lost a tough game to Alabama Lost a tough game to BYU Played those teams really really tough and lost on a buzzer beater to BYU and Madison Square Garden Rob Wright knocking down the three at the buzzer to beat the Tigers But thats one of the things that Brad Brownell loves about his team Theyre going to be in every game because of the way they defend A lot of close games a ton of close games They are not afraid to play in games decided by just a couple of points Played 25 games 13 have been decided by seven points or less and theyve won nine of those shocked they went so early on that possession 31 points for Duke Tied for the fewest in the first half this season Still with 8 seconds before halftime They think if they can get a mask here can give him some momentum going to the locker room They want a mo on their side Porter with the kick Cant cheering finish that at the buzzer Got to use the backboard Get a better angle Got to use the backboard Davidson with a misfire right there at the horn So were at halftime Four minutes He is out there to start the second half He has the ability to change the game defensively Underway here in the second 20 Foster giving it up for Booz Lets see if he gets rolling here in this second half The kick out for Evans and on the money They need the threepoint shot As you said earlier Curry has been a big difference maker Theyve now made seven threes cheering on the tie up Duke will have the basketball cheering applause But how about Dame Sar getting up and picking up Dylan Hunter 94 ft and just getting his hands on the basketball Flips the arrow in and Dukes possession So theyll get the next one but its all based upon the effort of Sar at 67 picking up the 6300 You know Dylan Hunter has not been a factor in this game really And hes got great experience Hes a tremendous passer great vision good assist to turnover ratio alltime leader in assist to turnover ratio in Clemson history but hasnt been aggressive Takes it into the blue Cant hit Hasnt been aggressive offensively Only one point in his last two games Wow Foster lost control of it but tipped out of play by the Tigers inside the first minute of play here in the second half You talk about a coach that gets maxim of his talent Its got to be Brad Brown No you know the key in coaching is to take your talent and get the most out of them Know their strengths their weaknesses and put them in positions to have a chance to be a success And he does that as well as anybody Yeah we got some big time college basketball games coming up tomorrow OB some women games How about coach Schaefer from Texas calling his team out about their effort Fosters pass and Boozer did not cut and thrown out a play Texas with another huge challenge this weekend but calling his team out at Vanderbilt after taking a loss on the road Question his teams toughness So interesting to see how Texas responds Sometimes you got to do that man You got to be honest You got to be honest Players respect honestly Dylan Hunter back out for Welling Welling shut down That gets to midcourt a save but the shot clocks down to one Hes got to heave it up there and it touches nothing A shot clock cheering violation And I believe thats the third of the game So cheering give the Blue Devils credit And we all know that the first five minutes of the second half are always so dangerous in this building And right now Duke off to a much better start than Clemson especially on the offensive end Camboozer crosscourt tipped out of play by the Tigers RJ The Tigers had just pulled off that impressive California sweep at Stanford and Cal just as Duke had when they came home and got beat They tipped that Its up and good This is their biggest lead now 10 applause cheering Theyre putting points on a board You look offensively at Clemson is very difficult So you know a cheering 10point lead becomes clear Look at Sar just helming the point guard and Hunter And then Boozer getting a hand on the basketball Averages 18 steals per game Gets it back and throws it away Itll be picked off by Hunter Obie thats his first turnover of the game Hes been doing a very good job of that today Hes had four turnovers in his last two games And a whistle off the ball Tell you one thing John Sh man he doesnt get enough credit I dont think for the defensive play of his team I mean hes also on a run possibly to be the winningest coach in his first few four years in coaching Right now that edge goes to cheering Brad Stevens What is that Butler Welling shorts The same Brad Stevens of Butler who John Sh beat in the national championship game in 2010 Yep Entry for Gunga playing with three fouls but he cant hit that cheering 10point lead for Duke Tigers try to cut in the pull up by Buckner They keep insisting on shooting those threes whether they go inside to their strength I mean they not in threepoint shooting game What are they right now One for about 12 Well you got certain guys that you want to take those shots Buckners one of those guys Hes made the only three for Clemson but thats the one they dont want getting good looks and Isaiah Evans What a cheering threat that is to have an inside outside combination You got we respect certainly the interior game of Cameron Boozer and then you got the perimeter game of Isaiah Evans Thats a real good weapon to have Borders three that clangs away Johnson with a rebound Nice dish for Welling Hell finish it Thats right Go inside to your strength Get angry up here now Welling with eight Dont get angry coach But heres the thing You Clemson wants to continue to play inside out They want to go inside to their strength but theyre not going to beat Duke especially in this building without making some threes And you cant make them if you dont TAKE THEM YEAH I LIKE THAT Make them laughter you dont take That was a play Look at the slam Gung men a whistle But this is one of the things you got when you watch this team play All of their bigs when you consider Bruiser Gungba and Malik Brown are elite passers So a lot of the big to passing the interior game thrives because all of these guys are able to find each other Id like that Coach K and Mickey in the stands here taking in the game Coach K let me tell you this He just sent me a text You know what he did He was outside passing out cake and passing out hats because celebrating 40 years of Shashevskyville How many coaches with2 wins are outside passing out Ken Unbelievable But how how many how many coaches have a v named after them So when you consider hes in shashesville I think its the least he can do is go pass out cake Why dont you say that How many coaches those coaches have won 1200 games That that would be very few to say the least Of course Coach K here Tell you one thing just a great guy a winner in everything he does in life in terms of what he does for the V Foundation Helps us big time Raising a lot of money 1200 wins Still staggering 12 Johnson gives it up Trying the entry pass but a whistle and trying to get that inside of the 610 senior Davidson They have really struggled here after halftime getting the ball to the interior I believe John Shy halftime really got in their faces about that We got to defend the interior We cant let them take charge with us Especially for a team thats shooting one of nine from three Again if theyre going to beat you you got to make them beat you from the exterior and dont give them to what you were talking about their strength those opportunities in the paint I think that were the one for that What are they Mr Madre One for 13 One for 13 Butner shot clock to three Now they really got to hustle Tiptoeing on the line And did he get a timeout He didorgvital raffle Meorgvital raffle and win that Porsche I want to call your name out of Rangala Gallas going to be this year May 1st We cant wait Were going to have a great off the inbounds Could not get that to go only had one second and got a pretty good look from considering the spot and what would have been a turnover Got a decent look for Godfrey on the jumpers Unable to get it to go but we talked about that danger area The Blue Devils with an 11point lead right now Clemson with the foul Duke spreading the floor here with 15 12 minutes to go on top 3928 Coming up historically speaking in this very very important month then he was alive coast to coast 3928 Duke with the lead and the ball You guys got that history down on top Heres Brown Camboozer Shot clock to six as he let it fly And nothing but net His first made threepoint field goal of this game hasnt shot the basketball extremely well but it doesnt change his impact on winning 11 points for Boozer today Shredding the D Buckner got the layup up there but a miss So that first five minutes the second half we talk about this a lot here at Cameron Indor And once again a problem for the opponent Its been a nightmare Its been a nightmare Look at that Look at his shooting 0 for four shooting a three one for nine now shooting field goals So you know really no substitute for making shots Make shots is the key in the game of basketball Talk all the extras and Os Dont have allig guys can make some shots But this is the best half court defensive team in the ACC and so difficult to make shots against them as theyre able to knock down the three Butter Johnson able to get free and one of the very few times in this game where Clemson has seen a clean look Well he looked really good shooting that So Im giving Butter the ball again You might be in a little groove right now You want to go back to butter Yeah I want to go back to butter You want another butter ball is what you want I dont want too many butter balls Oh contact there and a whistle as Camboozer gets hit 1416 to go Thatll go on Godridge number three Its the second time that a Clemson defender has tried to take a charge on Boozer while hes on the bounce moving to the basket And even though there is significant contact and you see Boozer absolutely does lead with that left shoulder but does Godfrey get into legal guarding position That one in my opinion looked a little more in favor of Clemson than did the last one I think this one could have gone the other way Should have gone the other way That could have should have Thats a key guy whos had a hot hand for them The swing for a three on the run Buckner Buckner airborne No misses another layup cheering and thats going to be Duke basketball But RJ Godfrey is insistent that it went off of Duke Brad Bro does have a challenge but does he lean on his staff to determine that this should be challenged or not Buckner getting out and nice job defensively Im not sure if theres enough evidence to overturn that one Brad Brownell smartly not going to challenge it Tell you one thing getting a possession here and not getting a score is really such a negative especially with the way theyre struggling offensively Dukes defense has been tremendous Yeah its been that way all year Its been that way all year Obie think about what we saw from them two Mondays ago when they absolutely blanked Louisville on this floor comparison to what Louisville was able to do when you saw them last Monday So you got to really take your hats off to the Blue Devils especially in this building How great they are defensively I think theyre even better today Boozer to boozer GOT IT BOOZER to boozer cheering with big trifecta Wow Cam with 14 Looks like theyre off and running man Off and running cheering Duke did not touch it Thrown out of play by the Tigers And Bradell holding on to the basketball trying to get his team to settle down Dicky V Yep Hey I know three people in the crowd right now are on Cloud9 My three grandkids Two of them graduated here May 20 May of 2025 Connor and Jake Crew that play tennis here And my granddaughter Ava Crew is a sophomore here People always say Oh Dan Boer with the slam Its the boo show now No two for seven in this odd You know people say to me Where do they get those smarts Well I know they didnt get them for me As they asked cheering me to spell Duke and gave me the D I spell it wrong Ill tell you what Duke is 16 Valentine Wow My Valentine Yeah Incredible I mean I couldnt spell Duke Im so proud they could be at a school like Duke And I can spell it if they gave me the D and they said Spell it Im just Im just happy we got Lraine on the air Thats all Im Because youve got to youve got to explain that she hates to be on TV She does and shes beautiful Shes 81 years old She She doesnt mind My wife is can care less She the best looking 81 youll ever see I tell you that She is a marvelous lady Kane Boozer with a basket and one and hell be headed for the line where he shoots 76 Now I got to take them all out for dinner tonight and you know hes going to pay I They were on scholarship at Duke laughter and theyre still on scholarship The Dicky V schy scholarship If you ever run into Dicki by the way please demand that he tell the story that Dr Vitali Frank Sinaka story Please demand that he tells that story He had us absolutely in stitches last night just swatted away by Boozer and he has just woken up cheering He really has taken over the second half He got the first bucket of the second half knocked down a three much after that has made another three but continues to flex his muscle on the defensive end of the floor and I believe that is really the most underrated part of his game Everybody knows what he does offensively but defensively hes a factor as well He has 10 in the second half by the way What an unbelievable player hes been for them Buckner trying to calm things down but he cant Threepoint land Thats been no going today for the Clemson Tigers And approaching the 12minute mark 5031 Duke Kaden Boozer negotiating his way into the paint for two more Hes going to really be a quality player here next year Kaden because theres no way hes going to the NBA right now and he he is going to be a really outstanding point guard Obie lets think about this This is arguably with Virginia the second best team in the ACC in which Duke is doing this And again we do know that Duke did take the loss at North Carolina with the buzzer beater by Seth Trimble and give the Tar Hills tremendous props for that But Duke has been head and shoulders above everyone in a much improved ACC this season and theyre really showing that here this afternoon Yeah we think 18s you know certainly with a healthy Caleb Wilson thats a major loss for North Carolina and Euban Davis feel sorry for them because that kid is so special Nothing firm as far as if he could return but a broken hand Well see if in fact he does come back at all this season Clemson in transition trailing 5233 Duke just slamming the door on the Tigers hopes here in the second half and a foul before any shot Carlos Boozer away with this thing leading 5233 You know what Duke my mind was on this when I looked at Tyrus Dukes projected to be a number one seed right now Its got Arizona Mr Dr Lonardi the guru of brackology You got Arizona Michigan Duke and Yukon The last time and Duke was number one was the backtoback years of 2010 and 2011 I didnt realize that And Boozer by the way is on track to break RJ Barretts ACC freshman scoring record 226 versus 230 Mr Boo Well that would have been a two but it never got to the iron so he violates the shot clock 5235 I didnt realize it 15 years since Duke was the number one uh seed Did you Cory In the NCAA tournament its been six years The ACCs best ever year 2018 2019 The ACC had three number one seeds Virginia North Carolina and Duke Well then they they gave me wrong information Yes that that was the year of Zion the team with RJ Barrett and Zion Cam Reddish Trey Jones They were number one seed The ACC had three number one seeds that year Okay I read the nugget wrong Give me a turnover Duke was number laughter one seed in backto back seasons was 2010 and 11 was the last There you go There we go Yeah So Duke with the ball and Emanuel will let fly Got it A threepointer The rich get richer Binya we saw him against Louisville have a strong second half performance where he made scored 10 straight points as did Patrick Gumbo who does the job defensively on Godfrey and although Gumba hasnt had a big offensive game he still has shown up especially in the second half getting him back on the floor out of foul trouble how valuable he is to this Duke team They really are a different team when hes in the lineup Hes got the high post here He brings that great physical strength brings screaming a good passing ability can score around the basket He even step out and make a three Oh what a nice play too Tiptoeing on the baseline Yeah how about great feet along that baseline to not turn it over and use that left hand to be able to finish And by the way shout out to Tajma Gumba who theyre honoring her jersey today at George Washington University They dont retire jerseys there They just honor them So her number 40 is cheering being honored today The reason why shes not here watching her baby boy play Well Ill tell you one thing You think about him they got him charted The NBA likes him Hes charted right now Um be a 17 pick of the draft And look at the vision there by Booz Shot doesnt go but the ability to see the whole floor You know the 69 freshman We talked so much about the scoring and the rebounding but hes their number one assist guy too Knocked down by Welling and and Obie thats why guys want to play alongside a Cameron Boozer Thats why guys want to play alongside a Koopa flag because theyre not only looking for their own theyre looking to win which often means you make the right play and the best play to surpass Brad Stevens as the winningest coach in his first four years of coaching Thats an incredible achievement at 38 to the final four last year You know especially when you get everybody they play plays at an incredible level against NHL wants to be here They see that jersey K They want to beat him Look at Mike K They tried to beat him too Good luck there Right Welling gets a good look but off the back iron Boozer with the rebound He now has 18 points So hes been two different guys today The second half He has taken over this thing Well the whole team I mean they played them tough in that first half They really did Clemson played the game the way they wanted to play pounded it inside score defend Second half no defense no offense and youre down at 19 And coming up at 8 Eastern on ABC in the app the Womens College Game Day crew is in Baton Rouge Get you all set up for the biggest match up of the night Number six LSU hosting number three South Carolina at 830 at the Maravic Center Theres two coaches that really can get after it man But still as special as can be Evans will draw the foul in the act of attempting a three So hell be at the line for three shots Okay So Obie I need research to tell me that Andrea Carter can do game day this morning and will she be at game day this evening Is she making the travel to be able to be there Thats a huge game I I need to call Dre up right now We We got a break in the action laughter Andrea she does a great job Shell probably do a game after that somewhere Believe it or not Dicky V Andrea cut her teeth with Obie and I as our sideline on Big Monday That she she really did And we had an opportunity to be with her and spend time with her and Obie and I like you know just beaming big brothers getting an opportunity to watch her shine on television It is so true I worked with her in game my first time with her and she was really right off the chart You could see she was going places Well shes a point guard Lets start with that And she was recruited by Pat Summit But when you think about those two things shes got to be special Vicki you worked with Elellanena Roosevelt for trying out loud laughter I mean you got I worked with You cant believe some Ill tell you one thing Two in particular I had no doubt stars One was a classmate of yours Mr Terreso Yes And Robin Roberts Yes First time I worked with them I remember coming home to my wife said They are not going to be long with us They just have the whole pack How about my man Mike Trico calls the Super Bowl and then goes to Italy to host the Olympic Games in like 5 minutes I wonder if he ate Italian food like we did last night Coo a ria Something like that Yeah No its cooia It was delicious man It was a great meal It was a great meal Great service too Yes Tremendous serving to take that paint again No travel turns and fires to hit it And a tough b tough bucket for Porter And thats what Duke has really done throughout this game Theyve made everything difficult for the Tigers on their offensive end You know Porter was the one guy I thought would be able to make some threes in you know getting a scouting report talking to people they said hes a very dangerous threepoint shooter and we didnt see that to them And this cheering defense has really rose to the challenge holding the Tigers just 42 with six minutes to go Well at the top of the show I said its a real challenge here to get out and get number 15 because theyve won Clemson Its an amazing achievement 14 straight conference games on the road But you know you played in this league 14 in a row on the road is pretty tough Thats amazing when you consider the places theyve had to win But lets also remember that when you look at Tyrese Proctor and Cooper Flag Kamalat on the baseline Malik Brown on the floor Isaiah Evans on the floor this Clemson team was the only ACC team to beat them a season ago Yeah we were there We We were there for that And please believe the competitor that John Sh he mentioned that to his team at some point throughout the preparation of this week Well look at both of these coaches today John Shier on the edge of his 23rd win of the season against Bradella knew he had a great opportunity today one game behind Duke in the ACC standings He won 300 games and this year 300 games the longest tenure coach in the ACC and his well respected contract I believe was extended to 2031 Great developmental guy Players get better and better Has that reputation Hes one of the best coaches in the country Shot clock to three Evans Does he see it He gets it off in time but he cant hit Rebound tapped down by another chance How about the effort still 5 minutes remaining Youre up 20 points and Malik Brown going after an offensive board Well thats his game his game his defense through all the intangibles and the little things Came out of Syracuse did a terrific job when he played for the Syracuse Shot clock down to one tipped away and theres another back and hit it He said a really nice day You see you know you do right now You know what I cheering would do if I WAS COACHING RIGHT NOW I hate to say this but you never ever quit Let me waving the white flag Come on Mr cheering Sh Get busy gang out of here And then foul here The Blue Devils with four and a half on the clock Kaden Boozer with 12 points today Yeah Kaden Boozer actually got his shot blocked Did a great job defensively but sticking to it picking it up and recognizing the shot clock Forget him Forget Carlos Boozer To the side to his left CC Thats mom Thats the Valentine We got to get CC on camera Shes the Valentine today not dad cheering So at the line for the Tigers Dylan Hunter whos better chase Jose Clemson stand out He has really really struggled the last two games for me He had one point in the last two Look at this guy 1500 SATs Their future going to run our nation in every cheering possible way No medicine education Wow All they want to do right now is force Dylan Hunter to miss another foul shot And he hits that But Dylans had a tough tough day His first point of the game 02 from the field Hes 01 from three And we mentioned only had one point against Virginia Tech Was scoreless in their game at Cal And this is the leader of this team They missed him last year when he broke his hand in the ACC tournament and didnt have him in the NCAA tournament moving forward But Brad Radell is going to need Dylan Hunter to be more aggressive on the offensive end But they had his brother Chase and that certainly meant a lot because that guy could score He was all ACC Look at the schedule coming up now Weve got on ESPN a big Monday Duke against Syracuse here Oh look at that game there Michigan Michigan Notre Dame then Virginia NC State Of course you got another game with Carolina after that Yeah Wades done a heck of a job with the NC State program He really has Theyve been up and down though I mean theyve had some good G Theyve had some really bad ones too as we saw the other day So they have been inconsistent Thats one of the things though with talking with Commissioner Phillips pregame the coaches in this league he feels as though the right people are now in the right places And when you have if you consider cheering Jim Phillips 5 years he just celebrated his fifth year tenure at the as the commissioner of the ACC but you consider his five years In year one Roy Williams steps away In year two Coach K steps away In year three you lose Jim Beh In year four you lose Tony Bennett And so when you think about that and then year five Leonard Hamilton Jim Larenga Mike Bray I mean think about the turnover in the coaches So when people look and say Okay what happened to the ACC Thats the reality behind what happens when Hall of Fame coaches are no longer sitting in that seat And thats also a reality of todays kind of culture of basketball the NIL transfer portal Chase Salon runs job done defensively as well Cameron Boozer now 18 points seven rebounds four assists and most importantly only one turnover Porters pass out of play off the hand of Godfrieded Comparison to first and second half the soontobe allAmerican who certainly looked like one in the second 20 minutes Well their team certainly look like all Americans the way they play defense They really did the Duke team They really exempl example is defined by their unbelievable way to communicate on defense A lot of teams dont communicate You got to talk to one another to play good defense You got to get help You have pride But Dicky B is that something that you that you can teach or is that something that you recruit Right So you you and I have always been talkers So I dont think there was ever a time when anyone ever had to ask you to talk laughter but when you think about it do you go out and you recruit guys I mean that are vocal or is it something you feel like you can teach them I think you can teach them It becomes contagious if you get enough guys to do it and they get such talented players here and those kids are just and they all know that coaches stressed this I know Coach K did and Im sure passed on to John Sh Youre representing more than just yourself Youre representing that name in that jersey The greatness that has been worn by so many terrific players Yeah Here at Duke they call it the brotherhood right I mean they wear that literally on their tshirts and their pullovers and they believe in it I mean again I Ive got a lot of friends who have played in this program and they truly believe in that brotherhood They live by it and they look out for each other But there are a lot of guys who are alums of this program who are not only locked in today but are locked in all season long and having conversations and mentoring these younger players A lot of them also exist in football in South Bend Indiana the University of Notre Dame especially now with Marcus Freeman there Hes terrific What a great communicator he is You mentioned I like to speak a lot Well let me tell you something That gift God gave me to do has really helped my bank account big time laughter with the Washington speakers I got to be honest about it Im going to tell you this That gift that he gave you has really helped all of our bank accounts Were able to do what we do because of what you did Oh I dont know about that but Well I think thats very true Well heres the gala once again Plug this away Dicki Well yeah the gala We got them today But this right here means a lot to us right now you go out and help me raise money for Kids Battle of Cancer Look Im 86 years old Ive

Weve all raised 105 million so far by Gala for kids battle Its incredible Final seconds here at Cameron Indoor Youve seen so many Duke wins here over the years Youve watched another one Dick and Cory Last year we saw Clemson win a dandy against Duke at home at Clemson Well today they came in just one game behind Duke in the standings Theyre going to leave two back And the Blue Devils truly showed that they are the best team in the ACC when you can do this to one of the next best teams with Clemson coming in tied with Virginia with only two ACC losses but to have this type of dominant performance especially on the defensive end it shows you just how quality a team Duke is The three went down The three went down Let me tell you when these run out hell get these kids to bounce back They play hard Theyre well coached They really are well coached in every way But today belongs to Duke on this Valentines Day They improved to 232 121 in the ACC in their 29th straight win at
