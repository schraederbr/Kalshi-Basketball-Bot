So for the third straight season a midweek treat the ACC SEC cheering challenge is underway and its the road team Texas AM that starts with the basketball cheering Ruben Dominguez surveys and finds Jakari Lane This is an Aggies team that has lots of depth to it McKenzie Embako miss fires from three Its a defensive possession there by Pit And I said rebound is critical and everyone has to rebound Both these teams they do a lot of switching Guards have got to go inside Therell be a lot of cross matchups Its important these guards battle down low to come up with some rebounds Pit cant open the scoring Robin Caleeppa leaves that begging Now we mentioned the two very different styles of Pit They really only play seven guys Texas AM goes 12 deep Scoop to the hoop to open the scoring Jakari Lane And when the Aggies score Randolph theyll go fullcourt pressure Yeah its a big part of it there And coach Cap cant be happy with that He lamented to his guards The guards of Texas AM they love to reject the ball screen and Lane did that there And here we go with a turnover here by Pit Yeah the one thing that Jeff Cable told us is we cannot turn the ball over He wants to take a lot of the shot clock keep possession of the ball and keep this game low scoring They are 0 and three when they allow 70 or more They are And then on that time you saw they want to break the pressure and if theres numbers there to get a layup they want to take advantage of it They want to be selective when they run that turnover You dont mind there early because its a dead ball turnover You get to set your defense What you dont want is the pick sixes that getsm out of transition Good pump fake and a bounce pass finds AG Hes rejected at the rim Cam Corin Hes been the bright spot this season for Pit so far Hes done really well I mean hes increased his range on the perimeter here And you dont want to put him in this position too Hes not a natural rim protector and it can ill afford for him to get in foul trouble Great block there and AG such an X factor in the big win against Florida State for Texas AM A monster double double 17 points 17 rebounds for him And the Aggies theyre coming in already with an ACC win Put 95 up on the seminals in that win Trying to make it backto back wins against the ACC And Bako not shy Hell let it fly connects on a three to make it five nothing early Two defensive errors led to five points The rejecting of the ball screen which they communicated that time there was no switch Minimo knocks down three Heres DeMarco Miner He hit the buzzer beater three to beat Ohio State Shot clock down to six Cam Corin cheering passes out of the double team Miner shot clock down to two Has to heave it Cant hit it And I know Pittsburgh wants to take as much as the shot clock as possible and really grind this game down right But you cant let it go down too much without a plan And its got to be some type of dribble penetration or post up a paint touch or something like that Someone you cant just throw it around a threepoint line cheering and then heave a three Its not the start to this game you wanted cheering Offensive foul for an illegal screen and Bako was moving again And it needs to be better communication Indecisive here Are they switching That should be a switch Great job there by Miner running into the screen I dont think enough guards do that when guys are setting go screens Well dont they teach you to go either under it or over it No they teach you to use your arms to hit the contact but trust me as a guard that hurts You dont always want to just run to a blind screen Heres the freshman Omari Witherspoon cheering Feeds Corin inside double teamed and draws the foul And thats what I think Pit can do offensively Get paint touches Theyre as good as offensive unit as TexasM is They dont have rim protection Theres no shot blockers on the floor So just be unselfish Drive the pass A lot of help is always coming Great job by Cam Corin giving his shoulder fake and drawing a foul Corin nearly averaging a double double on the season This is a depleted hit front court They are without Papa tonight who usually spells Corin as the big man He was warming up early and unable to go And this is a really thin front line for the Panthers against a team that their cheering recipe for success is to wear you down with their depth Good look here for Marcus Hill Cant connect Offensive rebound keeps it alive Dominguez lines up a three and buries it Not the starting one for the Panthers but this is Aggies basketball Offensive rebound pressure on you They scored Theyre setting their fullourt pressure A lot of running and jumping You can see Miners looking for the help and wondering where the traps coming from Pit trying to weather the early storm from Bucky Ball Texas AM playing with a lot of confidence under their first year head coach Kick to the corner Good look but nothing there for Caleppa See how Luffs got to learn Hes open for a reason in the corner Hes taking hes settling right now for two threes Theyre going to give him that shot Even though theyre expecting you theyre wanting you to take those cheering jump shots Put your head down there and force contact inside to AG and he draws the foul So Rashan 82 points per game coming into that matchup with Pit They held them to 66 So Texas AM theyre averaging 93 points per game Hes hoping the defense can deliver a similar effort tonight Yeah they have And they started this game making mistakes You know theyve given up three baskets and they need to figure it out because again this their styles are different but Ohio State the same They wanted this game they do it more in execution and half court and selective transition but they still want to get the pace up in the 90s likem does And Pittsburgh Panthers got to figure a way to slow this game down and control the tempo One thing they got to do on the offensive end when they break the pressure they cant settle for threes Theyre 0 for three behind the threepoint line and when theyve attacked the paint theyve gotten fouled And theyve only taken those three shots Theyve all been from three and already in a ninepoint hole Still looking for their first basket of this game Going inside to Cory Double team comes passes out of it cheering Shot clock down to 10 Theyve got to get a cutter on that weak side You cant let him get free traps to get away with it Heres Miner who had the buzzer beater against Ohio State Finds Corin Spins through two Cant finish but its tapped in by Barry Dunning Jr Great job by Dunning Jr getting to the glass there You can hurt the Agies Theyre coming to trap in the post Theyre coming from the baseline side Someone has to cut to the basket If they dont get the ball theyll get the offensive rebound Lane the blow by Couldnt finish it cheering Nearly another second chance bucket The Aggies already have six second chance points of the first five minutes of this one Tough take for two Omari Witherspoon the freshman delivers Great job there Again the pressure comes He beats it Plays off two feet Nice lefty lay there by the freshman He has the physicality and length and size to finish inside Foul called Marcus Hill hes not afraid of contact Hell get two at the line Just a great drive there but see Dun Jr gets in on the glass and they can hurtm on the glass And I think thats part of their defensive philosophy where they can be hurt I think their only shot blocker is former pit panther Federico Federico cheering had Feder Rico Federico back in the building for the first time since transferring from Pit Part of the team that made the NCAA tournament in the 2022 2023 season Welcome home He he he was a fan favorite here He was he was and they were heartbroken to let him go to Texas Tech and then after a year in love as transferred to Texas AM he wanted a larger role But I think offensively he realized that it wasnt just coach Cable but I think everyone in college basketball views him as a defender rim protector rebounder and I think thats his role even in Austin Texas He Hes getting a lot of college station Yes Which I should know My wife would kill me because shes an Aggie Oh yeah Youre Youre in trouble Yeah I just Well its funny Theyre the home of the 12th man Kyle Field Their football teams having such a good year and they go 12 deep on the basketball court They absolutely do that They got to be the 13th man cheering Another air ball This Texas AM defense dialed in on the road I think a lot of settling right now for the Panthers Nothing but the bottom of the net Pop Isac His first touch of the ball off the bench is a three Another miscommunication on the switch Theyre running an early drag screen Theres not a lot of communication Are you switching or youre not Witherspoon rejected at the rim It falls to Dunning in the corner He drives baseline and scores Great drive there using the rim protection for the shot blocker Coming over Zack Clemens backing down the freshman couldnt finish it Step back three Witherspoon got it Backto back baskets Amari Witherspoon Freshman out of St John College out of Washington DC is staff loves his potential showing you he can drive it and shoot it And after going down 101 early Pit is back within four Here youre switching youre not You can see Miners expecting to switch Cam Corin is late Thats the second time theyve had that miscommunication in year Witherspoon walks into a rhythm three and hes gone Hes off to a fast start here behind his team Heres Josh Holloway Finds him back Shot clock at five Trying to spin his way free The pit defense very much improved Another stop Witherspoons got the hot hand Finds Dunning for three No good Offensive rebound keeps it alive Really good size on the floor for Pit They were able to switch that in Do a really good job of both ends of the floor here This is a really good offensive possession and the previous defensive possession for the Panthers was really good got to continue to do that if they want to stay in this ball game But its a limited bench for Jeff Cable especially without Papakante available But you do have Noitis and Kieran Mullen who could get some extended minutes tonight Mullen 12 and white Hes only played five minutes on the season The freshman out of Vancouver sets the screen here Witherspoon showing off the handles the extra pass wide open injuris It was halfway down but rolled out It did Thats a really good offensive possession there Really unselfish play cheering Texas AM They like to go fast but sometimes too fast They turn it over Andrew Sinus from the same spot This time he hits it Coach McMillan was concerned about his group He doesnt think their defense their threepoint defense is very good Theyre not running people off the line He was concerned about that He feels as though they have to do a better job of putting their heels on the threepoint line and running teams off the line 8 nothing Panthers run Theyve clawed it back to within one Deep three goes begging battle for the rebound cheering off Holloway Itll be Pit Ball when we come back after the Panthers fell down Everyones heard of fullcourt defense Well he plays fullcourt offense as well and it can wear down an opponent over the course of a game It does And I made reference to Rick Patino you know when he was at Kentucky would do a lot of pressure You know Monkey Ball is more of the modern day analytics on the offensive end but the pressure back to a matchup zone as you see here now Pit Panthers again have to spin better do a better job on the offensive end of the floor against that zone The fourth shot at the end of the shot clock Good stop from Texas AM out of the timeout The Bucky ball requires depth though We just showed you the 45 points off the bench per game going 12 deep against a pit team that only plays seven Heres AG trying to get free Isaacs launches a deep three Too much on it Offensive rebound once again One bym Thats where the game starts here When he hits the glass who wins the glass Ryland Griffin with the ball in the paint trying to shake his way for a look Ag there cleans up the spill for two And thats why both teams are going to have opportunities because they switch a lot And that time Cummings had to switch on AG and thats just not a matchup that Panthers are going to win at all A cleans up the glass for the easy layup Griffin back into the lineup form after missing the last two games Right down the lane for two Andrew Situs Great job by Andrew Situs there Attack the rim Stop settling for jump shots You get in the paint Good things happen Wide open look Nothing but the bottom of the net McKenzie the immediate answer Bako looked so comfortable shooting a three ball A lot of this with these guys I think theres Griffin and Dominguez are I think are really good shooters of the basketball Everyone else is just kind of playing with a ton of confidence Pull up Corinth Both offenses finding their rhythm here midway through the first half Theyre leaving their guards oneonone right now And can they hold up Count it Plus the foul Rashan AG musling it home Yeah AG gets it there What does he do Andrew Situs is just trying to hold his ground Hes giving up so much strength Lets see if Pit make an adjustment Will they dive Will they dig Will they trap Theyre going to have to give these guards on this switch some help AJ given up three in and about 35 pounds in that matchup And Jeff Cable just has such a thin front court Not many options particularly with Kante out of the lineup tonight for Pit You can expect free throw or made field goal Its going to be fullcourt pressure Got to come to the basketball And this is where I think Pit has multiple handlers Good look here Got it Demarco Miner Its another three Shot 28 a year ago and hes up to 40 this year He has been redot including the buzzer beater to beat Ohio State Jakari laying high off the window for two I will say so far Randolph it seems likems getting their style more than Pit is Style makes fights and Pit wants to slow things down Low scoring AM wants to go as fast and make it a shootout Well you can expect this as a freshman Witherspoon breaks the press And then thats an open look You got to take it no matter where it is in the shot clock Good look Good shot Three ball there Got ourselves a ball game here Who gets the point I say for the ACC SEC challenge continues later tonight on ESPN North Carolina at Kentucky If you have not seen the freshman phenom Caleb Wilson you got to check him out for UNCC Hes incredible Off to a great start Must see TV and a really good front court for the Tar Hills One of many freshman that have taken the nation by storm in a loaded class As the shot clock was winding down that rims out for Brandon Cummings Good to see him back in the lineup Missed the last two games for Pit Dominguez a three Hes dangerous from deep misfired that time Nearly another offensive rebound for Texas AM But they say that Federico Federico whos playing his former team was out of bounds there Body on the body The game starts when the shots hit the rim this game Guards for both teams got to play a physical brand of basketball and secure rebounds AndM has already secured eight second chance points That could very well be the difference of this game leading by four Thats why theyre theyre winning the game right now Good for Cummings to just be coming back Hes still trying to get condition missed a couple of games and hell be needed with the pressure the fullourt pressure help bring the basketball up the floor and get the Panthers in the offense Yeah with Conte out the Panthers would be down to six Get their rotation Good defense Hill puts it up and in for two Defense into offense Thats howM wants to be under their first year head coach Baky McMillan Cannot turn the basketball over They only had five against Ohio State Withers nearly traveled there And a foul calledm scored five of their last six shots Yeah this is what you cant do here Feder Rico Feder Rico with the deflection And here off and running Peel with the physical contact and finish And scoring like that allows them to set the pressure And youve got to take care of the basketball get it to the rim Well easier said than done when youre going against Federico laughter Federico Pit fans know that He spent two seasons here in Pittsburgh playing for the Panthers Corner three Miner Its good Cuts the lead in half Thats great execution coming out of the timeout That scout report shot there You knew it was coming Great cheering execution Wide open three A miss by Diva He was all alone A defensive breakdown in transition for Pit butm fails to cash in Now Feder Rico Federicos in the game Hes the only shot blocker in this game True shot blocker Hes in Youve got to try to put him in ball screens and pull him out of the paint cuz hell alter shots like he did that shot there Jakari Lane scoop to the hoop for two Incredible finish Thats a really good drive there and finish AM has so many guys that could go coast to coast Lane is one of them He seems to be uncomfortable Yeah hes grabbing his heel Usually thats a sign of cramps Guy starts grabbing their toes And again when you play this style youre running and everybody every game youre pressing fullcourt offense like this youre playing a game defensively at a big fast pace After falling down nine points early Pit has battled their way back into this game Injuritus cant connect on a cheering three The Panthers have failed to take a lead thoughm has been in control throughout this first half Stays with the Aggies Ball underneath their own hoop makes the move there Steps through He finishes I dont see anything I think he gets get kicked in his leg there Stepped on It looks like hes just trying to walk it off over on thatm sideline Yeah you saw get kicked stepped on there and that never feels good Embako open for three AM is getting good looks in this first half They just have failed to make them Just four of 11 for three Really high level execution on both ends of Florida last couple possessions by both teams Got good looks Good ball movement Thats got to go up Thats got to go up Theyre locked down to five Andrew Sidus This fires offensive rebound Keeps it alive Barry Dunning Jr cashes in Great job there fighting on the glass cheering Hit with some momentum THREEON TWO ALIVE DUNNING SKIES TO THE RIM and its a onepoint game Oh the last four games they havent been 18 a game But hes a really good defender cheering and a really good switching defender and hes got to help these guys out on the glass trying to get AG going out of the timeout and he hammers it home Situs is going to have nightmares tonight of guarding AG in the post Thats Its just a mitch match that Pits going to have to give some attention to if theyre going to keep switching With Pits depleted front court AG has been a problem Dunning returns the favor and rocks the rim I think Pit can control this game on the offensive end if they continue to attack the paint Dont settle Keep the ball on the perimeter There are no shot blockers when Feder Rico Federico leaves the game Right back to AG Theyre going punch for punch A Rashan Ag impressive tonight Got to try to get the basketball out the middle of the floor so hard that middle ball screen Theyre they havent communicated well They didnt switch a couple of times early Got burned by three and then that time AG on the slip Shot clock ticks down to six Pit has made their last three shots Witherspoon cant make it four in a row after he showed off the shake Makes up for it on defense Body on the line to win it back for Pit and an easy layin on the other end Great decision there again Another turnover Another layup for the Panthers cheering Its funny the game is being played at the TexasM pace but Pit has the momentum right now back within one 3 minutes until halftime but the cheering Panthers are taking the right shots How about DeMarco Miner at 6 foot swatting it out of bounds Theyre dialed in on both sides of the ball right now Heres AG on this quick spin Allah Sean Kemp baseline dunk onepoint game here Great pass by the freshman Dunning music on a weak side cut We have got ourselves the games here Oakland Zoo stand up Jay Alter with you And weve got a good one in night one of the challenge here at the Peterson Event CenterM went up early Pit has battled back but they have not led in this first half Yaggies cheering led by as many as nine Ryland Griffin out of the timeout Got a good look but missed the dunk Great play come out of timeout and Griffin getting to the rim Griffin nearly made up for it Had his ball almost picked off there Theyre going to say this ball was touched bym so well stay pit basketball The Aggies are arguing that nobody touched it I thought it was the right call Its early Does Bucky want to use the challenge And it was right in front of him So maybe he feels confident that he saw that it did not hit one of his players because if you use the challenge and youre right you you keep the challenge But if youre youre wrong thats it for the rest of the game Out of bounds challenge The call on the floor is Pittsburghs ball The play will be reviewed The new rule in college basketball coaches can call a challenge but if you are wrong you lose the ability to do it for the rest of the game I think the question is when you use it I mean is this possession such a big possession in the game that you feel as though you need to use I thought initially the ball and hes right Its a great challenge Great call It was right in front of his bench After review the ball was not touched by Texas AM Hence the ball is awarded to Texas AM That is a successful challenge by Texas AM 30 seconds on the shot clock You just heard it Successful challenge by Texas AM So Aggies ball with a onepoint lead 236 remaining in this first half Looked like Bob Isaac had touched it and he didnt Great challenge has missed their last five threes Griffin drains that one Ryland Griffin Hes missed the last two games Bucky McMillan Happy to have him back in the lineup He is And this guys playing lights out I mean his split is 5240 and 91 I know Bill Subs watching this kid now going Where was this a year ago I needed you a year ago He has found himself a home Witherspoon patient on the three and draws the foul applause But Marley Witherspoon some good shake there and hell get three at the line Freshman gets the vet on the shot fake and the foul here But Griffin comes off there You cheat and go under He steps behind that line and takes advantage of the freshman there And with a spoon here with a chance to get those three back drawing a foul on Griffin You mentioned the stop at Kansas a year ago Alabama before that And on a team that is very deep you know Griffin probably at the end of a game is the guy who you want the ball in his hand because of his experience Well that was the question You know we had asked coach McMillan today at halftime I said Hey critical part of the games you know late game who do you want the ball in their hands And he said it was Griffin And thats key because when theyve been in those moments they hadnt been in it much but when they have been in critical games theyve struggled with having a guy that they trust to make the decisions and make plays and having Griffin back And looks like thats going to be his role for the Agies Witherspoon two of three at the line Hes up to seven points to go along with four assists and two steals Theyre using Witherspoons length and size to get the teeth of the defense and find his teammates cheering AG going right at Corin Spins around Didnt get a good look Good defense by Cam Corin Thats the matchup they want They want Can Corin on AG He has the physical size more importantly the length and foot quickness to keep him in front make him shoot over top like that Its really good defensive possession there The scoring is very much slowed down and that favors Pitt in this matchup Dunning cant connect for three Those are shots I think they settle I dont think theyre getting theres no rim protection Theres no shot blockers there You get an advantage drive it downhill I know youre feeling good offensively right now but you want to continue to control the tempo and pace of this game Shot clock down to 10 Pop Isaacs in attack mode Surveys Its deflected Cam Corin has it Talk a lot about the Aggies defense These Panthers are getting after it Corin feeling it right now spins right into a double team andm can hold for the final shot but instead they push it ahead Clemens cheering Oh missed it Gives the ball back to Pit when the Aggies could have hold for the final shot Yeah thats a mistake there And thats not on Clemens He gets the ball passed to him laying it up Thats on cheering the guard play for the Yaggies You got to pull that out and hold it for the last shot Lets see if it hurts him cheering Clock down to one and Pit fails to get a shot off So Pit did not take a lead in that entire first halfM was in front throughout They averaged 90 plus Pit they want games in the 60s and the 70s So even thoughM has a road lead to start the second half Its Pittsburgh that has controlled the pace more than Texas AM tonight Done a good job of when theyve turned it over Its been dead ball turnovers Theyve only committed three fouls and for a team that doesnt have the depth Thats huge Nearly turned it over there Shot clock down to six Witherspoon the freshman Hands it off and a hammer from the Australian Roman Caleppa Continue to take open threes if youre pit but I think they have to get two feet in the paint every offensive possession And I think you get whatever you want This game is tied for the first time since tip off cheering AG its worked all night but not that time Thats the one guy I think can guard him and give him issues Thats Cam Ks length and athleticism Second time hes really bothered AG in the paint Pull up pop Ding delivers and that is the first lead of the night for Pit cheering Great job there A didnt want to switch Another reject Great answer cheering Jakari Lane right down the lane Thats another mistake there again to started the game with this exact same play And now a turnover Here come the Aggies A three Its good Ruben Dominguez Jay this is exactly how the game started A a reject for a layup cheering The only difference is instead of a turnover theres an offers a rebound and three The sharp shooting Spaniard regains the lead cheering for Texas AM And now a travel And this is how the Aggies can get you with Bucky Ball First year head coach They create the avalanche of positive plays Witherspoon there Court napping Dont look for the screen You can switch it And here after forcing a turnover with the press this is the one guy shooting it as well as anyone in college basketball 33 makesh behind the threepoint line And that was 34 AG left alone underneath Hell make you pay And its a 7 nothing Aggies run This is not the start there Minerss got to be strong with the basketball Hes got to you attack where the pressure is not coming from And you see it coming on your left If you go you beat the defender on the right Got to be solid with the basketball and not turn it over Get pit in their half court offense If you dont punish the pressure youre just getting your offensive sets See Aleppa that rolls in after Pit took their first lead 3735M responded with that seven nothing run Thats a big bucket to keep it a onesore game Yeah I think thats just the mandate Take care of the basketball like you did in the first half you dont foul and get in the paint if you pitch Thats a recipe for success cheering Dominguez this time on the drive Left it short Follows his own miss Gets it back Fires a three Hits it He was too close No layups He was too close with a layup Ruben Dominguez just drilled his third three Freshmans cheering got to keep track of the count in his head Close to 5 seconds Ruben Dominguez This is a trend all over college basketball going international Hes played 150 pro games in Europe mostly in Spain but he has brought that professionalism to Pittsburgh He is shooting at a level right now that not many in college basketball is doing I mean hes shooting nearly 50 from three and hes one of the nation leader in made attempts Hes got three here tonight the decorated international player Bill Bao was his club in Spain They won the FIA European Cup last year This is a trophy winning player that has come over to America to play college basketball and that is a big trend across the sport this year You the talent has flooded between the freshman and the internationals start Oh man youre talking about look at that Nearly 60 from three averaging nearly 20 points a game I mean hes unconscious from three I mean theres a difference in taking as many threes as hes taking but he fits Bucky Ball well Hes forced Coach McMillan to put him in the starting lineup with the way hes shooting Yeah you got a guy that is shooting 60 from three in the last four games Yeah youre going to find ways to get him on the court as much as possible him in his own First couple of possessions for Pit Ball just stayed on the threepoint line like it is now Its got to hit the paint at some point either off the dribble or the pass Instead Miner settles for a three and misses it Eerily similar start to the second half as this game began when Texas AM jumped on Pit got out to a 101 lead and then a 145 lead Its a repeat in the first three and a half minutes of the second half The concern you got to have for Pit I thought the game started withms pace and then Pit cheering slowed things down Theyve done a great job of not fouling but right now pace is starting to pick up again These are two rosters that are built completely differently Texas AM tons of depth They go 12 deep cheering Pit will only play seven And as this second half continues the Aggies will continue to wear down Pit and they have opened up an eightpoint lead after the AG make The guards for Pit Panthers have got to be telling coach Cape when they cant guard AG in the post Good finish on the inside by Corin because you cant double AG because theres so many shooters on the floor form Here he is cheering again AG starting to take over Draws the foul and hell be at the line when we come back 15 matters Randolph Childris Jay Alter with you Did you Did you go against a Jimmy V coach team No Im not that old Thank you laughter Well he he kept coaching after the championship I know you didnt play against the championship I didnt play in the 80s Jay M that old man Its bad enough youre feeding meatball subs and pretzels man I mean what are you laughter doing The hospitality here at Pittsburgh Top notch Dr Jim Barber taking care of us Texas AM a sevenpoint lead They have grabbed control back in this second half And all it took was Pittsburgh taking their first lead and the Aggies have punched back big time Yeah theyre using Witherspoon and his size to help break the pressure I think Cam Coin has got to help with that as well with his size being able to look over the defense Shot clock down to three Dunning skying to the rim and puts it in The second effort is good Its a really big wing Really athletic Plays bigger than the size there Driving and absorbing the contact Being able to keep his balance and offensive rebound and finish Ryland Griffin working against Corin Really impressed with Cam Corin the defensive end of the floor Hes defending everyone on the court guard or big Holloway big time make with the shot clock down to two And now pit running for the first time today The Panthers have been slowing this game down throughout but Caleppa slept his way through the defense Something Dunning there showing his athleticism Takes the contact gets the finish here Holloway nice shot fake there Thats a diff difficult pull up there over two defenders And that was a good change of pace by Pit You know you l TexasM to sleep throughout this game that theyre going to go slow and then boom Caleeppa sneaks behind everybody This is the f first of two Third annual ACC SEC challenge continues tomorrow on ESPN A monster double header Louisville at Arkansas in a top 25 matchup And then NC State is at Auburn You just saw Louisville last week Randolph Cardinals up to six of the country Thats what they are and I think theyre as good as anyone U freshman Mike Brown is really talented a freshman point guard but the depth and the shooting in that team I think their backboard shoots as well as anyone in college basketball has a collection of guys and Pat Kelsey is as good a coach there is You talk about bucky ball Pat Kelsey in analytics He has the Louisville Carters playing great basketball But good defense Jakari Lane to steal it away Can he finish it with a three No He was wide open after he stole it away Everything but the finish Now C Aleppo draws another foul So he is not afraid of contact The freshman from Brisbane Australia grew up playing rugby He plays like he wants to feel your body He wants to feel contact Hes done a great job of cutting on the weak side going to the offensive glass and running the lane working on his perimeter shot But coach Coach Cable welcomes his activity He has had to play big minutes at the four position with Papacante out tonight Witherspoon spins through two Didnt get a clean look at it Just kind of threw it up there Them defense has been relentless in this second half Good pass AG missed the layup Reathers Goes up strong It is fouled Its been so many times here with the Panthers Its just not communicating if theyre switching or theyre not Here it should be a switch You dont communicate Giving AG the angle And now hes just relentless Miner gets caught with his hands in a cookie jar like theyre trying to ice the ball screen If thats Dunning in there icing he cant let him come back middle If theyre switching its just this really late switch And its a mistake that theyre going to pay for free throw Aging backto back games against ACC opponents where he has found a double double Had 17 and 17 to the win against Florida State 17 and 10 already tonight and he has been a problem for Pit throughout So they just keep feeding him Checks out after he makes two for the former Panther Federico Federico andm has tied their largest lead of the night cheering and the pressure suffocating Pit has to use a timeout The Aggies with all the momentum in this second half theyre back up by nine on the road 40 minutes And this team as a whole had their first practice since June with everyone yesterday And here we are December 1st and they get your first finally get all your guys together Coach McMillan finally feels like not only does he has his full complement of players hes starting to feel like his guys are in the condition and shape that he wants him to be in to play a full 40 minutes of style in the way he wants to play Witherspoon misfires out of the timeout and he he thinks the chemistry of this team is just starting to click But this team is just going to get better and better over the course of the season And already tonight in the ACC SEC challenge on the road theyve looked very good The former Panther gets his bucket Federico Federico a fan favorite in his two years in Pittsburgh deliversm their largest lead of the night And thats a mistake there on the defense Cam corn You never want to let when youre in drop coverage let the offensive guy get behind you You know in drop coverage the weak side guard is not expected to help because you should stay between the ball and basket but also as low as your offensive player And that time Federico Federico able to get behind the defense P completely out of their offensive ver right now Theyre in a scoring drought of more than two and a half minutes Its allowed Texas AM to pile up the points 196 run Cummings kick out Corin finally fires it home Jay paint touch paint touch paint touch Hit shooting 50 from the floor but only 20 6 from three Continue to get in the paint Play off two feet Dominguez a deep three Its good Wow Nothing but the bottom of the net And the Spaniard sharpshooter has just buried his fourth three of the night shoot 49 of the year and his numbers are going up cuz hes four of six from behind the threepoint line Its unbelievable streak in the way hes shooting the basketball Andrew Sinus turnaround cant finish it Nearly fell to Corin Itll stay pit ball off Federico Ruben Dominguez one of music the best shooters in all of college basketball in this young season Player 150 pro games in Europe A lot of those coming in Spain for the club Bill Bao who won the European Cup a year ago And Jay the ACB is one of the best leagues in all of Europe And you see the international players coming over Its why you see the GLeague guys being able to come over cuz these guys are coming over with a pro look and coming over with so much pro experience Dunning there saves another one Thats a trend that both of us would expect to continue as Dunning did well to deny Dominguez this time Yeah look at the effort running back there He misses the steal but just contest Great contest at the high point and the length and athleticism to block that shot I think Dunny could be in a conversation but if he wants to put so much energy into that side of the ball could be cheering a defensive player of the year candidate Hes been the brightest spot for Pit tonight His versatility on the defensive end Hes been able to switch Hes held his own against bigger guys Corin pulled the rug and AG lost his balance A jump ball as things get physical and a technical foul cheering Great job officiating there I thought Mack and Bakco got a push there at the end of the play and officials caught that I think you can see it here Just another great defense again by Cam Corner on the inside and right here See the push there by Drew Situs in a headlock Yeah but that was just going for the basketball Right Right And then as he wrestles the ball away shoves him Yeah Andrew Sus just like What are you upset about You you put me in a headlock and throw me and then youre upset Yeah that push there was where it went a little overboard So Demarco Miner two free throws because of the technical This was a twopoint game at halftime And before that made free throw Texas AM had outscored Pit 22 to 12 in the second half applause Sometimes it can take a technical foul to spur a team on Jay the Aaggies are shooting 61 here in the second half and and uh after only shooting 39 in the first half theyre starting to pull away Lets see if the Panthers can take advantage of that technical foul cheering Shot clock down to four Dominguez with only 23 on the timer is fouled Demarco Miner reached in there and he didnt have to Yeah he was trying to fight to get through the screen I dont think Dominguez knew what how much time was left on the shot clock Two seconds because of the technical foul I dont think realized that it did not reset No So bailed out there by Miner and now a fresh 20 Dominguez leaves it The onehanded hammer rejected by the rim Its right there hanging around Corin a three Missed it way off the mark Thats just not his strength And again if theres a one difference between these two teams is that Embarco changes things with his ability to shoot from the perimeter Everyone else I think is better attacking the basket off the bouncer And both both teams the front line guys do a better job of just driving it getting the paint Theres no shot blockers Foul on the floor before the in Andrew Sidus bucket Good things happen again for the Panthers Foul here Just continue to try to drive it or throw a post up inside and play inside out Youre the Pit Panthers Its just your formula for success Midway through this second half Texas AM already 16 fouls on the next one Pit will be in the bonus Dunning on the drive Tough take for two Hadnt had an answer for him all night long again and his size and athletic ability when he puts it down and gets to the paint Once he elevates theres no one on the TexasM roster to bother a shot Lane lost the handle Its loose cheering Reathered Griffin open three Missed it Thats a play that wont show up on the box But Miner did a great job He had a decision to make Deme will give it to Griffin And I thought he made the right choice You dont give Dominguez open looks Hes burned you for four threes already Cam Corin you got to put him in the rim Backing down Dominguez And Cam Corin makes it a sixpoint game That his game isnt shooting threes Just getting in that paint scoring Did a great job there taking advantage of his size Texas AM in a threeminute scoring drown Six nothing run Pit Aggies take music a timeout Third annual ACC SEC challenge tipping off tonight in Pittsburgh Randolph Childris Jay Alteria just as Texas AM was starting to separate Here comes Pit on a six nothing run Well I thought the technical foul motivated these guys Gave them a chance to settle down get some momentum and theyre back to attacking the paint Theyre back to defending and rebounding getting themselves back in this game just when you thoughtm was going to pull away Back come the Panthers cheering cheering Dominguez contested three Missed it Dialed in on defense A six nothing run since that technical foul Two possession game under nine minutes to go Minor crosscourt pass Andrew Sidus drives at a jump ball Possession arrow with Pit So ball will stay underneath the Panthers hoop Andrew Sidus will learn that all he has to do is get that ball up to the rim If he doesnt make the shot Cam Corin is there with the mismatch The mismatch is the reason he got that shot Two guys went inside to Cam K there Hes got to know get it up on the glass No one there to stop Cam Korn from cleaning that up Often tell guards a lot of times if you drive it just dont get your shot blocked You got to get it up to the glass on switches Give your big man a chance to clean it up Andrew Sidis this time up and in for two And all thats because again they dont want to switch any guard on Cam G So hes involved in every action on the offensive end of the floor Lets hope he can sustain it for the remaining eight minutes during a fourminute scoring drought form Theyve missed their last six shots cheering Make it seven This pit defense is frustratingm and its led to an eight nothing Panthers run with eight minutes to play cheering Going to a ball screen Cam corn trying to force the switch Step back three Its cheering good Demarco Miner makes it a onepoint game Jay when you hit gamewinners like that it gives you so much confidence Step up and take and make big shots Yeah Hit the buzzer beater three to beat Ohio State on Friday Now on a Tuesday gives Pit an 11 nothing run And this is whenm gets into trouble A lot of dribbling not a lot of ball and body movement but another errant shot He has missed eight straight Yeah thats not bucky balling And we talked about that in shoot around Thats when they get in trouble is when a lot of guys start dribbling holding on to the basketball Its not movement Its not body movement ball movement cheering Miner again cant connect Corin trying to haul in the offensive rebound It keeps it alive Theyre caught in a cross switch if they can get it inside to Cam Corin They do Dominguez called for the foul And now Cam Corid can give Pit the lead from the foul line at the free throw line to regain the lead for the Panthers who looked left for dead down 12 in this second half Yeah they got motivated by that technical foul They got free throws and then since then theyve upped their intensity on the defensive end of the floor Start attacking the paint stop settling for threes And on the other end the one thing coach McMillan does not want in Bucky Ball is a lot of dribbling and standing around And the Yags have been doing a lot of that the last eight possessions Under seven minutes to play Pit back in front by one leading for just the second time tonight cheering Texas AM has missed their last eight shots Five minutes scoreless desperate for a bucket AND THEY TURN IT OVER The Pit defense continues to deliver Thats Miner that time not being burnt cheering by the reject of the ball screen Did a good job of cutting Hill off Good pass Its a three No Situs buries it got some play Coach Cap was working on in the shoot around knowing cheering the defense that the Aggies were going to play And cheering Clemens trying to back down Sidus Gets to the block and scores COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL Zack Clemens Situs is having a difficult time on these bigs and the switches Theres no help coming but a great job there And its again its Cam Corner on the roll inside Spraying to the corner And Sid is knocking down a three But here in the other end of the floor hes just having the size advantage of these bigs And its difficult for any guard to sustain a big that long that length of time Too many dribbles no help no digs cheering Clemens completes the and one and its back to a onepoint game with under six minutes in regulation Your minor again Chris Dominguez got to bring it up And again theyre going to go back to the zone They made a really good offensive rhythm Theyve made five of their last seven get a touch inside the threepoint line Off the dribble or to Cam Corn inside Shot clock down to four Corner three Doesnt fall but in perfect position Barry Dunning Jr cleans up the spill Thereve been no answer for him all night long cheering Heres Jakari Lane driving baseline Good take cheering and it rolls in for the senior Mike with a strong move there bumping Cummings off the spot using his physicality to finish cheering Good job here by Miner not settling for that shot again 10 seconds left The ball spending way too much time on the threepoint ripped away Jakari Lane UP AHEAD GRIFFIN AND HE PUTS Texas AM back in front Jay this is where the wearing downs coming from I think Sidus has got to get off the ball and let another decision maker have the basketball Now they went to the lob to Corin Ag says no Up ahead Griffin and he is hammered A hard foul Brandon Cummings came down on Ryland Griffin Griffin who just came back tonight after missing the last two games with an injury has stayed down for the Aggies Critical turnovers here Young guards of the Panthers are getting sped up here and theyve got to settle down and handle this pressure here Cummings just elevates and He falls down on Griffins legs here And heres a steal Backto back turnovers cheering there Pit goes from up one to down one And you in this second half Pit had done so well Yeah Limiting the turnovers keeping care of the basketball and in two possessions Texas AM takes it away and turns it into points Yeah minor struggle I think hes tired Hes starting to fatigue Let other guys bring it up Hes got to command the basketball He and Brandon Cummings get pit handle the pressure get pit in the offense cheering Griffin looks okay to continue Makes the first The ACC SEC mens challenge continues over on ESPN tipping off at 930 North Carolina at Kentucky Its a big game for both teams They both needed UNCC needs to show they can win a game with Seth Trimble being on a big game and Kentucky has been all over the place to start the year and both teams can use that win Both of these teams here in Pittsburgh coming off their best win of the season Texas AM a blowout win against Florida State Hit a buzzer beater to beat Ohio State Final four minutes of regulation and somebodys going to come away with another big time power four winM is pulled back in front with a six nothing run Witherspoon spins into the lane hands it off FOR CORIN WHO HAMMERS IT HOME Thats a great possession there by the freshman They bring him in the game and allow him to be the point guard to see over the defense to handle the pressure He runs the ball screen with Cam K They switch just the patience inside to create for a teammate Taking the next step mentally is the freshman But Lane he has controlled this game down the stretch and draws the foul again Both teams in the bonus as we have a got to continue to take care of the basketball and he got a rebound I think both teams has an advantage or pit on the offensive end when Kim Korn is involved in the action because of the switching allows him an advantage and right now on the other end is when TexasM involved AG in the action Spit hasnt had an answer for him Jakari Lane nails them both from the line Threepoint lead for Texas AM and they can set up their fullourt pressure And weve talked about how Texas AM with their bucky ball style They want to wear a team down So in the final three minutes theyre the fresher team Lets see who Pit goes with down the stretch here Theyve only played seven players tonight Trusting his freshman Witherspoon with the basketball and then the decisionm and so far in the second half lately hes been making good decisions Here he is Lefty off the window No good Not a great possession there Great shot tried to get it to Cam Corin inside Great job on the interior for the Yaggies and this game will come down to half court execution as well Dominguez tangled up gets the ball back and draws the foul Both teams in the bonus So shooting on every foul the rest of the way This will be a one and one And this is where Lanes experience in late game situations Again pitch relying on a very inexperienced backcourt Theyre allowing Witherspoon to handle the pressure but at that point I think Miner needs to get the basketball and getting the ball screen They got to involve Cam Corn a lot earlier in their offense cheering Dominguez knocks down the first and earns the second I think this is a big possession coming up for the Panthers Got to get a paint touch Got to get something at the rim And if its a three it needs to come off the dribble penetration post up Fivepoint deficit Both teams with two timeouts the rest of the way Yeah Miner does a great job here Go back and get it Get your team off the zone And this is where Pit has struggled failing to get it inside where theyve had the most success Miner weaves his way through Shot clock down to five Crosscourt pass finds Witherspoon Step back and it rims OUT NO GOOD OFFENSIVE REBOUND DUNNING jump ball possession arrow Texas AM The Aggies defense stands tall and they get the ball back leading by five Tonnings done a great job all night crashing the offensive glass and seeing him tipping and keeping it alive and AG with a great job walling up causing a turnover cheering I think this is a big possession as big as weve had in this game Well with two minutes to go Texas AM looking to add to this fivepoint lead They have led throughout Pitt has made it uncomfortable Can the Aggies get this to the finish line and escape with a road win at the ACC SEC challenge WHAT A CUT DOMINGUEZ is left all alone and he makes it a sevenpoint lead Just a back screen there that Pit needed to switch No communication Mingz gets the easy layup Pull up three Nothing but air And this one unraveling down the stretch for the home team Panthers I mean heres the back screen with the freshman You got two freshman defensively involved in a play with Witherspoon and Injitus And they dont communicate They dont switch And side is looking for help and thats what you get sometimes when youre dealing with young guys and freshman and the critical time to make that type of mistake by the freshman and just the difference in this game and I think Lane and Griffin and their experience in the back court and even the experience of Rodriguez I mean Dominguez has just been been the difference here since Pit took the lead Texas cheering AM on a 122 run Ag left all alone THATS NOT USUALLY A SHOT BUT he drills it Rashan Agy for three Solid A lot easier to take that shot when youre up seven Knocks it down Witherspoon in trouble Kicks it out Pit needs his three and they get it Noas intrusitis gives pit a little It goes a long way So the clock started to run after Dominguez passed it to Lane which you can do after a make So they got to reset the clock here Now Dunning should know he should have stayed there on Dominguez He wanted you to foul him but trap him and dont foul I whistles and a timeout was taken before a foul or a travel Pit was screaming it was a travel AM was screaming it was a foul The officials say it was an Aggies timeout Where is it Lucky McMillan was half at the half court line called a foul Calling a timeout I think the timing of it was great because if not I thought Dominguez there was in trouble We started slide Watch that left foot Start sliding that left foot Look at him Both feet are moving You see it was Agy calling the timeout Yeah thats a moonwalk there buddy I think they got away with travel He slid the right and the left foot But again Bucky was nearly at half courting a timeout And I think the got away with one there Yeah Well Texas AM will take it as theyre trying to cling on to a sevenpoint lead This would be their first true road win of the season A team that has improved their chemistry under a first year head coach playing 12 guys that all came from different locations And Bucky McMillan said Look the chemistry is going to continue the style the conditioning to play this style of basketball is such an adjustment in early December its going to look totally different come March But if you can learn and win yes that makes it even better And again youre talking about December 1st being the first time you have your full compliment roster of players You got to be happy Your team is six and two and this is the fourth game on the road They get theyre in a little bit of an ACC stretch here with beating Florida State and cheering 41 seconds away of potentially beating Pit And then next they get SMU Pit with their backs against the wall here Got to go quick Ton of time coming off the clock now Just 30 seconds left Minor heaves a three Hits it No Pitts getting the threes Backto back triples for the Panthers 27 seconds That was nearly taken away by Miner and instead Ryland Griffin is fouled Problem with being in this situation against the Aggies is Lane hadnt missed a free throw this year and Griffin shooting 91 So and hell get two because nowms in the double bonus Difference in this game down the stretch is just the experience experience of Lane and Griffin and how goodm has been from the foul line Yeah And Dominguez is involved in that as well with the back door layup and the draw a couple of fouls Youre so worried about him shooting and making shots He started these the free throw shooting here late Texas AM 17 of 19 from the foul line Theyve made their last five shots cheering and you couldnt play better down the road in a onep possession game They got the separation they needed 90 from the free throw line Thats a good recipe to win Corin puts it in Two possession game Sixpoint lead Under 20 seconds left I dont think he touched the basketball enough here down the stretch Who Cam corn I I think he needed to touch it a lot more or be involved in the action But again when you got an inexperienced youth and guards Witherspoon I thought played a great game handled the pressure a couple of times got sped up Before the game you know they are 50 and they hold the team under 70 Yeah 0 and3 when they allow 70 or more Yeah And the streak continues from now Thats the magic number That is the magic number for them And theyre going to be kicking themselves because I thought the staff did a great job of telling them what was going to happen I thought some of the guys were a little slow Although the first eight points they gave up was all mistakes by the Panthers rejecting ball screens not communicating on the switch And when youre not great offensively and able to make that up and youre kind of a grinded out style even though youre young youve got to be rock solid on those type of communication A deep three off the mark and Texas AM will hold on Even with the travel theyve got an eightpoint cushion Pit took the lead 6362 with 505 to go And from then on Bucky McMillans team found a new gear And this is a very impressive road win For a team that beats Florida State and Pit they can head back to College Station 7 and two It earns a point for the SEC in the ACC SEC challenge
