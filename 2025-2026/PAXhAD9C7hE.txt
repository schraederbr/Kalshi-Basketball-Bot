Coming to this game 2 and one just off of a loss against Davidson The Hokes 30 after a convincing win last time out against St Josephs Tip off goes the way of Dain Mingo And we are underway here in Blackburg Solid also with a lot of newcomers None better than the center Anton The 72 transfer out of Providence as the ball is loose And here is Neo Abdales running the point for Virginia Tech And we focused on Hansbury there in the open but theres no doubt that Abdales has gotten a lot of the national love so far for Virginia Tech Welldeserved The NBA loves this guy Virginia Tech fans are loving this guy too 33 against Providence Projected as a lottery pick by the NBA Hansbury gets the roll on the three He struggled in the first two games from long range early and then shoots the ball well lately But it that thats bad news for the opponent when he can get off to a good start Yeah Hanssbury a guy that takes a ton of threes just under a 30 threepoint shooter still tries it for the Hokes Meanwhile a layup goes for Mingo the senior from Hamilton Ontario Yeah the transfer from Marshall is a really good point guard The rest of the team is sort of getting used to playing with him So Hansbury hands it off to Jaylen Bedford Another one of those newcomers for Virginia Tech that has really stood out Lwal musling his way right to the hoop and gets the score for Tech Each game we see a move that he couldnt make a year ago Much improved That really has been the theme so far this year for Virginia Tech Much improved with the newcomers added to Mike Youngs roster as well as a guy like Toby Lal a returner who has really stepped it up So here is Abdales running the point for Virginia Tech The freshman from Greece standing in at 69 Double teams already there for him Theres Hanssbury Lost the ball and a foul is called on the 49ers Thats going to go on Bradford Mike Young in his seventh season as the Virginia Tech head coach trying to go 40 for the first time in three seasons here in Blackburg and just had such a convincing victory Mack against St Joseph You got to remember the Hawks beat the Hokes by 20 last year and Virginia Tech laid the beat down Was a 35point victory because of plays like that from Jaylen Bedford Yeah two good wins for the Hokes already Providence is going to be a potential NCAA team and so is St Joes out of the A10 Virginia Tech back on defense Here comes Mingo splitting the defense Swinging out for Butler Bonk with the rebound and the 72 big man is able to hook it in He is going to be a challenge for Virginia Tech He is huge and very skilled Here comes Abdales swinging out into the corner Hanssbury thought about it Bedford for the tray Hes got it I dont know who the best shooter on this team is but its a really short conversation and Bedford is in the team picture I know that Now the transfer from UNLV working his way into the starting lineup after such a promising preeason as that rattles out Tyler Johnson one of those returners for Virginia Tech that we havent mentioned yet Here is Bedford off the side of the backboard and hell go to the line for two And Bailey thats where Virginia Tech has been so good this year in transition and a lot of it due to Abdollis being able to throw ahead and hooks running the floor Well Aaron Fern looking on as the head coach of Charlotte native of New Zealand in his third season as the Charlotte head coach came in in the interim role after coach Sanchez went to Virginia to be Tony Bennetts top assistant as Bedford misses the front end of two shots Yeah Coach Ferman is a very entertaining guy I met him this summer at a clinic in uh Charlotte and had a great conversation with him last night and uh uh I think hes got a good plan for Charlotte and he certainly made a big addition uh with the the offseason transfer portal and if you look at the Charlotte roster Fern himself played in Australia from New Zealand most of the Charlotte roster a lot of international guys have made the trip down to North Carolina to play there Yeah And he talked about the fact that they just have a different experience And speaking of experience theres Bunk coming from Vanuatu a small country in the middle of the Pacific Ocean Here comes Bedford Slides it over to Abdales Oh what a pass from Abdales Here comes Hanssbury Finishes at the hoop with a miss And then a rebound pulled down by Ethan Butler who gets the start today Yeah And Bon didnt get the the block shot but he sure influenced that shot Thats going to stay with Charlotte Yeah the penetration caused help Nobody to block the big guy out 77 Antonio Dor We talked about this yesterday with coach Fern Anton Bon is a guy who didnt play basketball until he was around 16 years old It wasnt very popular and the small island nation of Vanuatu that only has about 350000 people So he basically learned how to play basketball off of YouTube Yeah He actually grew up as you can imagine in an island country rowing cheering Made his way to the United States with a friend Played some Jo ball in Arizona Got himself to Providence Didnt play much last year and hes still trying to pick up some experience Meanwhile the Hokes bring in their own international big man and Antonio Dorne A Dallas cant get the midrange to go and it goes back to Charlotte Major Freeman draws a foul That goes to Toby Lau Hokes enjoying a pretty good start here of Dallas and company regrouping Its 116 Virginia Tech jackpot with this one These are great guys They care about winning So its been a joy coaching this group guys Yeah thanks Tamar Weve seen a couple of those newcomers already hit a few shots here today Jaylen Bedford two for two from the field Sunk a three Meanwhile for Charlotte Itll be interesting here Matt Kell Mading is in Its the first time he has played all season for the 49ers Yeah hes been hurt this fall A former starter at NC State and they really like this young man A foul called on Virginia Tech This is a big team Theyve got We talked about Bonk but uh they theyve got a lot of size They got a guy named Ree Hart whos 610 Uh and a guy that wont play today Jarna Elona 610 whos been starting as a freshman Yeah the absence of Jarna Elona Eyea is going to be tough for Charlotte today Thats a guy with some international experience had played for Belgium internationally and actually against Neo Abdollis But meanwhile Maden comes in and immediately makes a difference Yeah and penetration just breaks the defense down and leaves somebody wide open because you have to help stop penetration Swinging into the corner Dorne was open returns to Dorne Swinging out for Bedford whos been hot and stays hot Thats really nice We havent seen a lot of Dorne yet He he didnt play the first game Second game was Providence It was back and forth a lot but today we could see him a lot because of the size that Charlotte has Mingo goes coast to coast right at the hoop Alen Bedford starting out a perfect three for three as some subs look to check in for Virginia Tech and Ben Hammond and Jaden Shoot Hot pass down to Dorne pump fake right to the tin Yeah Hogy fans are going to like him They havent seen him yet but this guy is very very skilled in addition to be a big body in there 21yearold freshman also bringing some international experience Played a couple of years in the second tier of German professional basketball Mingo steps back Good poke by Bedford keeps the ball alive and forces the turnover What a really good play by Beford is a great oneonone defender Abdales goes to the hoop and scores A play maker I you we talked pregame theres a lot thats been said about him already but but theres not much he cant do out there Thats his first points of the day Already has two dimes for Virginia Tech among the nations leaders in assist Mingo Bradford arcs up a three Bit too hard and here comes Abdales crashing in for the board Yeah number 12 in America an assist at 73 a game Toby Lwal swinging out for three Followed the shot Tyler Johnson gets a second chance on this possession Timeout called by Aaron Fern And Virginia Tech has got its crowd up to its feet here in Castle Doubledigit lead for Virginia Tech Mac Yeah AD Dallas has played off the dribble really well Can get to the rim And then Tyler Johnson the returnee improved in every phase of the game fans checking in for the Hookies out of the timeout Number two Jaden Shoot at three Ben Right back here in the first half A quick timeout taken by the 49ers Tamara what do you have Fern music was very clear about todays biggest challenge stopping Virginia Techs pace and their freshman sensation Neil Abdulas And he told us a plays with incredible pace he can shoot it get to his spots and create easy opportunities for others So I can imagine thats why he called that quick quick timeout Yeah no kidding there 2010 Virginia Tech saw the pace start to escalate a little bit and the Hokes able to get up by double digits here Every player that has been in has scored and now Jaden Shoot and Ben Hammond will try to join that party here coming off of the bench after the timeout colorful Mike Young veterans coming off the bench whove really played well here early in the season in a different role than a year ago Jaden Shu on the defense front rim on the three and here comes Ben Hammond the point guard adding a bit of a different look that you could say than Neo Abdales at the one position Yeah about about a foot difference look Hammond certainly has improved this year You can tell the confidence is there for the sophomore guard from Northern Virginia Shot clock down to 10 Player development so big for both of these programs and both coaches do a great job Hammond Someones going to have to shoot it here Hammond chucks it up Foul called and you call a shot clock violation Yeah little better defensive set right there for coach Fern He didnt like those backto back layups at the rim Tyler Johnson Lews rebound on the other end We didnt get a chance to talk about it because it went to the other end but in a crowd just rising above everybody Averaging just about 11 rebounds per game The senior from London England one of three international players for Virginia Tech Harrison in really looking to score the basketball as soon as he comes in And he does Coach Fern had a lot of positive things to say about him and shoot around yesterday Hes a guy that hunts for the three for the 49ers and a great leader for this team whos going to need even more out of him today if theyre able to pull off an upset Hansberry though wasting no time gets fouled and the West Virginia transfer will go to the line Brings us to another timeout Hooks up 202 1154 left to go here in the first half off to a great start getting all the way to the rim and doing what he does the very best shooting from three this season He is seven out of 10 Bailey 70 aint bad for long range and no and Jaylen Bedford was music one of those guys that when he was added over the off season Mac he didnt really garner as much as of attention as you know a guy like Neil Abdales obviously or Antonio Dornne or even Isaiah Pasha the CIA rookie of the year Hes been one of the best pleasant surprises for this Virginia Tech team He really has He has earned his way into that lineup Theres no question about that And uh he he is a weapon and has been really good here early in the season averaging almost 13 points and three and a half rebounds in addition to what I mentioned shooting seven out of 10 from long range Hansberry another one of those guys added in the off season after assistant coach Chester Frasier made his way back to Blackburg Able to hit both of his free throws there as Hsbury has followed Frasier on the last couple of stops Started out at Illinois then West Virginia and after Morgantown came here to Blackburg and has made a big difference here in the start of the season so far for Virginia Tech A Dallas gets called for the foul and thats going to be his second Doesnt look like Abdales approves of the call Neither does the Blackburg faithful here He fell but uh you know he had his hand on him but he did not cause the fall Wrong place wrong time for Avdales And uh 11 and a half minutes left in the half And I imagine Mr Odales will be on the bench for quite a bit of that if not all of it And it off to Mingo So two fouls See what Virginia Tech does in his absence here Heres Spencer Elliot Front rim no good An offensive board snatched by Kylin Blackman getting his first playing time today Spencer Elliots dad Thomas Elliot was a starter here at Blackburg Actually went to high school in Chattanooga and then came to Virginia Tech and played here from 1989 to 1993 Yeah Yeah if I had done a better job of recruiting he wouldnt have come here There he is right now Thomas Elliot Hes wearing all Charlotte stuff today though No theres no about uh theres no doubt who hes hes rooting for here today Yeah blood over alma mater Lobbing it up for Bonk Bonk goes back up The block was there Its a tie up and it gives the ball back to Virginia Tech How about that Hanssbury at 68 given away 6 in to Bump Contested the pass but got the shot with great timing And let me tell you this theres a lesson right there Always be the second guy off the floor in the post If youre the first guy youre at a disadvantage Well after the good defensive play by Hanssbury Hokes get the ball back with the point guard Ben Hammond running it and a walk is called on Jaylen Bedford Ive seen a lot of walking early in the season but most of it hasnt been called to be honest A lot of people playing so fast Virginia Tech certainly has done that here today Slowing down a bit here though A bit of an offensive drop for both teams Charlotte trying to change that from Harrison Too hard on the three Heres Jaden Shu We talked about Harrison looking for his shot and he hes touched it twice and shot it twice Hammond veers off a screen finds Hanssbury Johnson fights for the rebound throws it off the back and now here comes the 49ers Conjurs into the game for the first time Layup is no good And Bon comes in on cleanup duty Yeah And then Bons banner had to try to contest the layup And when he didnt get that done Bonk got the dunk Give it over to Hanssbury now Big jump stop and swat it away Oh the big man able to put a full palm on the ball returning the favor after Hanssbury forced the tie up And here comes the 49ers again after that ball is swatted out on the sideline The bigs getting after it and Bon with a big play on both ends of the floor Now Bon already has six points for Charlotte leading the way for this 49ers team whos just coming off of a loss to Davidson Picked up a couple of wins to begin the year now with a test on the road against an ACC team OVR freshman from Barcelona Spain coming in Nice passer Big point guard Good vision cheering Good effort by Johnson Here comes Hanssbury up the floor into the corner for Jaden Shoot Rattles Hanssbury got the offensive board and the Hokes restart for a moment Bedford flings it up in the air Hansbury look at the effort Bedford is there cheering Did we talk about it in the opening offensive rebounding That possession was all Ammani Hansbury there A couple of offensive boards and setting up his man Jaylen Bedford who now has 11 for Virginia Tech What effort hasnt gotten to play much this year Were seeing a couple of guys come in for the 49ers who havent gotten a ton of burn yet for Aaron Ferns team Loose ball and coralled by Johnson Badford thought about it Hes continuing to move quickly Hammond with a size mismatch and picks up the foul applause Ben Hammond is fearless going up against a guy whos over a foot taller than him and Anton Bunk and now hes going to go to the line Yeah Hammond finished last year really strong Played well in February down the stretch for Mike Youngs team but he really worked in the off season and you know we weve mentioned it several times about player development giving up some inches but takes the body blow keeps his eyes on the rim and goes to the free throw line Hes actually going against VR that time So still a mismatch but not as giant of a mismatch as if he went against Bonk laughter Giant being the operative word and Toby Lau coming in as well as Antonio Dorne Hammond starting off the year almost averaging double figures Got about nine points per game This is the second free throw And here is Bon Fox with six points and six and five rebounds already in the game Major Freeman drives inside the perimeter working off of shoot and draws the foul against the Duke transfer for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech Both teams really trying hard to penetrate and pitch And of course Charlottes been able to penetrate and kick it to the big man or get a shot up and then big man b get the offensive rebound And Tech has dribbled more to the rim either to shoot the basketball or kick it out for the threepoint shot Thats now four team fouls for Virginia Tech Bradford Alen Bedford providing the tough defense on him but a foul is called on the Hokes guard And thats that confidence of Ben Bradford who got off to a great start with over 30 points in the opener against Indiana State for Charlotte Bradford starting out the game 0 for four First trip to the line for Charlotte Yeah Charlotte 0 for seven from the threepoint line cheering Well and we were talking about this with Aaron Fern yesterday as he misses the first one This team is trying to figure itself out combining all of the cultures of basketball just the cultures that theyre bringing as people from all over the world on this Charlotte roster And you even said it you wont see truly good basketball from both teams or from any team until about January Yeah Ive been Ive been preaching that fans need to keep their expectations in check Theyre going to see good basketball but not consistently good basketball Until all these teams sort the chemistry out Dallas back into the game after picking up two fouls Charlotte registered with a foul there Its going to keep it on the floor and that goes on Ardan Conjurs Been a pretty cleanly played game for the most part and a physical game too So the South Carolina transfer goes to the bench Better an officiating crew here today headed up by Jerry Heer And so far theyve been busy 10 total fouls Jaden Shoot on the free throw line Obby Lal providing Virginia Tech with another chance here as Shoot bailed on that after see a bunk in his path See what ADA can do here Down low to Dorne Now the big man spins and almost got it Able to fight back though Jaden shoot lets it fly screaming A foul call down low cheering and it keeps the ball on this side of the floor Yeah good job officiating right there It was a It was a physical play but they just wanted to make sure it didnt escalate from the hard foul to anything else Theyll probably take a look at this Theyll probably take a look at it Taking a look here Certainly the foul was on Bunk Foul on Virginia All right as they review it we are going to break 2515 Hokes up 10 The previous plays under review for possible flagrant foul now Welcome back everybody We got an explanation with what happened right before we went to break Its an initial foul after review but then its up on the play 49 has been charged with a flag one foul Virginia Tech will shoot two shots and ball possession on the end line with the hook and hold there Yeah big play right there the two big men We talked about how physical the game has been and Dorne misses the first one Really has been a physical game here Six fouls on either team and Dorne hits the second you get the explanation of what a flagrant one is there Yeah And that thats they got it exactly right There was the initial foul on Dorne and then the shove out of bounds by Bonk Uh they did not rise to the level of the hook and hold They left it at flagrant one But I think they got it all right Hopefully both teams settle down and well get back to basketball Now here we go Now Dallas running the point for the Hokes to maneuver his way through this physical game Toby Lwal gets fouled and another foul on Bonk and that and thats a big foul as much as Abdales whos back in the game by the way with two fouls for Virginia Tech So two fouls on Anton Bunkies Yeah I think the Hokes have a little more depth and can withstand Odales being on the bench but uh it will really change Charlottes chemistry on the floor with Bonk going out and it looks like hes going to be replaced by 67 Ethan Butler Low hits the first of two Of course they have Ming in the game already at 611 So theyre still a big basketball team Yeah they got a lot of size thats providing a little bit of irritation to what Virginia Tech is trying to do offensively today laughter I think both teams defensively have been a little irritating you know and the offense helps with that by driving the basketball and creating that contact opportunity So six points for Bon and then goes to the bench with a couple of fouls 49ers trying to pick up some points with the 72 big man on the bench now Heres Ming You see the open middle Everybody outside the arc for Charlotte Ming from the elbow able to sink it They really like this guy and uh they thought he was a potential starter uh and he was injured this fall and finally getting healthy Hammond back running the point Lost the ball recorouse it Moving lower into the shot clock here Thats what the 49ers wanted to do with Virginia Tech out of a double team Low cant get any help off of the glass and a rebound goes the way of Charlottes Dane Mingo Mingo bounces out Major Freeman thought about it from the logo Penetrates spins misses Got his own rebound here pumps and slotted away Toby L Wow applause An emphatic block if there ever was one for the senior from England Virginia Techs gotten a lot of a national attention early this year Some of it due to Avdales obviously but Top of Law of Law is is one of the best athletes in America thats playing basketball probably playing any sport number And much like what we were talking about with Bunk this is a guy for Virginia Tech that didnt really play basketball until his late teen years Yeah And and he continues to improve because of that Had a great off season went through the NBA process the draft camp and all that kind of thing but also got bigger and stronger in the weight room Now Tamar go ahead When I was talking to the team earlier today and I asked about the athleticism of this team cheering the first thing they said was Toby Lwal jumped to the moon Teams have to respect him So if that says anything about his athleticism I mean come on I cant jump to the moon Im 52 So laughter he certainly does jump to the moon And we saw that even in a pretty tough year for Virginia Tech basketball last year Toby Lal had great moments for Virginia Tech Now youre starting to see this team gel a little bit more The talent has been elevated for the Hokes this year and that just means his impact has grown Averaging a double double along with Hansbury a great offensive rebounder giving the Hokes a lot of second chance points and thats why theyre averaging nearly 100 points a game Lost the timeline Charlotte able to force the turnover as Bedford lost the ball Yeah not not a good job right there you come across midcourt you better have somewhere to go with it because the trap is coming New defensive game so far that weve seen here Lots of physicality of Dallas off of the floor right now for Virginia Tech Hanssbury back on though Yeah Coach Fern felt their defense was way ahead of their offense at this point during the season They got off to a bit of a slow start against Davidson a few days ago And a late surge Could not come back and win that one But the offense looked good there Courtesy Bradford Yeah Can really drive the basketball And thats his first thought He will shoot a three if hes wide open but Speaking of wide open Tyler Johnson was open He missed What a rebound from Bedford Puts it on the deck and swirls it in He continues to do something a little new every game doesnt he 13 points for the UNLV transfer He started five of six from the field Freeman stepped out of bounds Stepped out of bounds Another turnover forced by this Hokes team Watch Bedford elevate and then finish against the size down low Been the Jaylen Bedford show so far here today a couple of threes Thats his first rebound of the day but 13 points Okeis have a lot of different people who can score big numbers So far theyve shared the basketball Five people in double figures averaging of course when you score almost 100 points a game A lot of people do score double figures Tech has looked good so far this year and everybody has really noticed the balanced effort of Virginia Tech specifically from a guy like Hansbury who misses it off of the side of the backboard there Yeah Ming with a contest there at the rim Charlotte back within single digits though Ninepoint lead for Virginia Tech Mingo tries his luck Bit short Goes right to Major Freeman Mingo Another try at it In and out on the three These offensive rebounds are piling up for Charlotte Yeah a lot of athleticism on the floor for Charlotte Nice job of pursuing the ball Ming Shot clock inside of six now Poke loose by Hammond Mingos going to have to make a play Gives over to Ming for three Able to hit it at the buzzer That just feels like such a big shot for Charlotte Yeah 10 offensive rebounds for Charlotte We talked about the Hokes on the offensive rebounds They have eight but Charlotte kept that ball alive Three for three for Ming who has not played yet this season Jaylen Bedford though continues his hot streak Yeah and the nice pass by Hammond He shrunk the defense Found Bedford on the wing Hammond Hes got 16 points so far Bradford answers with a layup Bradford getting going isnt he 16 points See the Hokes continue to feed Bedford here There he is Top of the key Now for Hammond Hammond with a nifty dribbling swinging out Bedford wide open for the tray Theres a miss Hanssbury throws it back in and it hits the referee So that brings us to a break Hokes up by seven Jaylen Bedfords been hot and so is Ming Mac music music Welcome back to Castle Coliseum where the Hokes lead the 49ers 33 to 26 And the 49ers are not going away uh without a fight Theyre chipping away at the Hokes lead And its a big part of Ben Bradford Hes music had two of their three last baskets And I caught up with Ben Bradford and told him that Hey your head coach says you had the best offseason by a mile Why is that He was like The new guys theyre pushing me They came in and they brought me to another level Those results have shown up immediately Thats why I had 31 points in the season opener and I plan on carrying that over tonight guys Yeah Thanks Tamara Ben Bradford has looked good here keeping the Hokes at bay 3326 after Virginia Tech had such a dominating win against St Josephs and a bit of a close one here Little close for comfort for the Hokei fans in attendance against this 49ers team And just like that Ben Bradford sinks a turnaround jumper Three baskets in the last four possessions Charlotte also doing a great job on the backboard 19 to 16 with 10 offensive rebounds Thats a place where Virginia Tech expected to have a little bit of advantage You know Abdollis backing in has been a bit quiet on the offensive end today Hanssbury too high and short on that three trying to make it a one possession game Charlotte also with 16 points in the paint A lot of it either on the penetration or off penetration by drawing help and kicking it to the bigs Theres Bradford whos got the hot hand for the 49ers Drives in gets blocked but a foul called on Low cheering Yeah you can see the confidence growing that coach Fern talked about in Bradford as the game goes on And they also are working a little bit deeper into the shot clock slowing this game down a little bit And thats exactly what Fern wanted to do Yeah And Lal has a little bit of an argument He did stay kind of straight up but there was contact Bradford to the free throw line He misses the front end of those two Been very good so far this year 11 for 13 coming into today He mentioned something there about Charlotte One of the things that coach Fern talked about with us yesterday his goals for the game today try to get Virginia Tech to work all the way into the shot clock Yeah And theyve done a little bit of that defensively And on the other end theyve occupied the basketball here especially in the in the mid part of this half Two minutes left to go before halftime Swing it down low Hanssbury wasnt ready Yeah miscue there A little unforced error They actually had two people standing Hanssbury up in the lane The wall was wide open on the wing Bradford Its a screen penetrates Pump fake and a foul is called Bradford wants the bucket to count on the goending Yeah blocked on the way up And the Hogs have been very good about taking care of the basketball Near the top of the ACC in assist to turnover ratio number three and turnover margin He did not hit it so it will not count as a basket there cheering First one goes for Bradford Its a lane violation cheering Free throw counts And now it is a onepossession game Give Charlotte a chance to set up their fullourt pressure This time its just token to slow the Hokes down a little bit Hookies get to execute in the half court Now Virginia Tech has led by as large as 13 and now its down to a threepoint game Force it out to Hansbury Everyones in the paint right now for Charlotte Low tries his luck from three and it tickles the twine Thats a huge bucket for Virginia Tech cheering Shot nearly 37 last year He hadnt shot as well this year but something that hes worked on in the off season Took that with a lot of confidence That was a big basket for Tech Back up to a twop possession ball game after Virginia Tech went scoreless for two and a half minutes Here come the Hokes in transition Jaden Shu takes a quick three and cheering buries it for the Hokes Hammond made a turnover the last time but this time made up for it finding Chute wide open and another cheering turnover for Charlotte Now Charlotte a bit discombobulated here after the big bucket from Chute and Lal Backto back threes and all of a sudden the lead is back up to nine Lewal after an offensive rebound makes the three and then in transition Hammond with the dime to shoot in a corner So now 3930 Virginia Tech going to try to make its way through the pressure of Charlotte here One minute left to go here in the first half Charlotte has hung in there against this 30 Virginia Tech team Heres Ben Hammond Hammond draws a foul Good job by the pesky point guard there Hell go to the line Lead was down to three Backto back threes And just like that back to a ninepoint lead And Hammond goes to the free throw line Virginia Tech you see that those threes have made a huge difference today Virginia Tech has hit six of them As for Charlotte 49ers have only hit one triple so far in this game And that was as a shot clock ran out Ming from the top of the key Front end of the one and one Virginia Tech back up to a double digit lead Have shot really well from the floor really well from three on the season but they havent been as good from the free throw line And uh I think this will be a good free throw shooting team but so far only 67 Thats a productive trip to the free throw line for the Hokes point guard And Mike Young calls a timeout Were going to break here 4130 Virginia Tech up 11 here in the first half 41 and a half seconds left before music halftime The Hokes have 41 points themselves up against Charlotte here 49ers have made this a bit of a tougher game than I think some Hokeie fans watching this would have anticipated M Yeah And and most of the works been done in the paint either rebounding the basketball where they hold a 20 to 18 advantage with 10 offensive rebounds Uh and Virginia Tech has shot the ball well from the perimeter outside not you know shooting 6 for 13 and good from the free throw line but not so well overall at 41 for the half a big difference like we mentioned before we went to break six threes for Virginia Tech just one for Charlotte Mingo lost the ball tie up forced keeps the ball with the 49ers the physicality and that intensity even with Charlotte playing very tough against Virginia Tech Hooks have responded Likewise against Kev or Aaron Ferns team Yeah I both these teams have had some physical challenges already Davidson is always a tough team Charlotte lost to them in their last outing and uh the Providence game and a St Joes game for Virginia Tech Both got very physical Mingo looking for a screen Goes up against Hanssbury Misses it but Ming cleans it up Same thing If you got to help on the penetration you cant block your man out Shot clock now off Virginia Tech going to take the last shot here with Hammond running the point Hammond veers left over to Lal Hes got to shoot it himself And a foul booked on Spencer Elliot Oh and the red shirt sophomore from Atlanta was not excited to hear that whistle Thought he had a good defensive play there and instead Lals going to go to the free or the free throw line three times with just half a second left See if we can see the contact right here Yeah it gets him on the wrist He really has no gripe about that and uh and he broke the golden rule fouling the jump shooter and and he compounded it by doing it with 510 of a second left in the half Well the Wild hits the first one Hes an 81 free throw shooter so far this year Make it two in a row can end up being a huge foul as Charlotte had been pretty close in this game against Virginia Tech And now its as if that shot went in The wild converts all three Elliot with the heave cheering and that is it for the first half here in Blackburg 4432 Thanks coach Good luck in the second half Appreciate it Great stuff from our own Tamara Brown there with head coach Aaron Fern Mentioned the threes Charlotte one of nine from beyond the arc Hookies have hit six And now back out with the starting lineup Neil of Dallas whos been quiet today thanks to getting two fouls early And Jaylen Bedford misses a three to start it out here in the second half Yeah the threes basically are the difference in the score Hi also got to the free throw line 15 times versus only eight for the 49ers Anton Bon back into the game the 72 center He also missed a solid portion of that first half thanks to getting two fouls So see what they can do with him in the low post here Shot clock down to three and a foul booked on Hansbury Thats his second of the game Yeah Hookies did a nice job defensively that time They had some switch opportunities and did it aggressively but the foul right there resets the clock for Charlotte at 20 Feed inside Major Freeman cant get it to go and Lw able to snare his seventh rebound of the ball game Backing in Tyler Johnson a guy we havent talked about much yet today Hanssbury gets called for a foul again Virginia quick two fouls for Hansbury here in the second half He now has three Yeah And the Hokes see it right here Virginia tag 77 Yeah a little bit aggressive going for the ball against Bradford U and the Hookies played 10 minutes of the first half without ADAS and already Hanssbury on the bench here to start the second half Mingo goes under the hoop and finds a way to get the layup to fall for now it to be 4434 Back to a 10point deficit cheering Mingo only has six points but hes had a big in impact on this offense with his penetration Bedford feeds inside returns back out Here comes Bedford cant get it to go and the Hokes guard will go to the line Charlottes 49 I like that You know Bedford missed the three to start the half and and good shooters got to keep shooting but uh shot fake and drive to the hole was not a bad decision at all Jaylen Bedford leading the way for Virginia Tech here Even with the fouls you feel like its a little bit of a quiet day for Neo Abdollis and everybody thats been tuning in to Virginia Tech basketball kind of expects the freshman to really take over the ball game every time Thats been unfair Yeah Yeah You know its its thats a thats a tough thing to expect when when youre in and out of the game and dont play but half the game itself applause Hell make his impact on this game I assure you Might get an assist here if the shot falls Wow Talk about an impact the rebounds accumulating for him Its a return feed and the slam with two hands You can see it coming Back up by 13 Ding lays down the screen for Mingo Theres that penetration that disrupts everything Speaking of disruption Tyler Johnson reaches in and a foul called on the aggressive defense there for the sophomore Three quick fouls for Virginia Tech in the first two minutes of the second half And another look at this Mac knocked it away right there but a little shove with that right hand Jerry Heater all over that call Bad news for the Hokes but the right call Thats Johnsons second So three Hokes with two fouls and of Dallas Tyler Johnson and Jaden Shoot Hanssbury with three now driving inside Major Freeman with a right hand Thats really nice Bumped the defender Created some space Always looking to score is Freeman Dallas draws the foul on the penetration Dallas has only taken two shots today Does have a pair of assists One rebound and now will throw the ball in for the Hokes Bedford Lwals wide open from the wing cheering Ming you see Ming did get the start in that second half didnt he Hadnt played at all this year and has been a major contributor for the 49ers Tyler Johnson pulls down another board Thats his fourth There is Neo Bedford was wide open but only for a moment Bounce to Dorne And then Antonio Dorne Theres a name we havent talked about much in the season for Virginia Tech Hes gotten a lot of burn today Yeah And you knew he would with the size differential in the team And that started when the when Charlotte chose to double ting Abdales at midcourt Turn around No good Here is Dorne Picks up the rebound and a foul The Bronx cheer Theres the nice play Bedford drew two He had a double team at midcourt Then the ball came out of that double team Then another double team And Dorne gets the bunny Antonio Dorne had played in the last two games Now with a careerhigh with such a small sample size hes now got five Set play right here A Dallas creating that double team Bedford wide open again Boy what a day for Bedford now with 20 points for Virginia Tech Abdales gets no credit He made that play by by accepting the double team and making the right decision Now Bradford Oaks feeling it a bit here in the second half Bradford backing into Dorne Doesnt like it Five on the shot clock Bradford Itll go to the line Bradford is clever with that ball Crafty whatever term you want to use Hes been stand out for Charlotte this year Aaron Fern will not hesitate to mention that he is the hardest working man on this Charlotte team Caught him an everyday player Coaches love everyday players because you know what youre going to get from them every single day cheering You guys talked about what coach Fern said about Bradford Well I asked Bradford What type of guy are you Who are you He said Im a downhill guard who works incredibly hard on both ends My game starts downhill I like attacking and everything else comes from that I take pride in my physicality and my defense guys Hey certainly played downhill today Hes kept Charlotte in it even though Virginia Tech has jumped back up to a 14point lead here Largest lead was 16 just moments ago Trying to add to that with now Ben Hammond running the point for Virginia Tech Heres Hammond and Jaden Shute trading the ball around A foul called on Charlotte Yeah Mading wrestling down low with Dorne Bringing us to a break 5238 Hokes up here in the second half who are with us today Welcome back to Blackburg everyone 5238 Mack this is an old Metro Conference matchup Yeah that was a great basketball league Look at those schools and uh and all of them are still pretty darn good in basketball And Charlotte and Virginia Tech make met music quite a few times Now this is actually the first matchup between the 49ers and the Hoke since 1999 An old Metro Conference matchup Okay So when you went to school at Virginia Tech were they in the Metro Conference I guess Okay 197 All right We were independent Gotcha All right Three laughter Back before all this conference realignment started Bonk back into the game for Charlotte An interesting matchup to watch with the two sevenfooters down low Him and Dorne How about that shot for shoot out of the timeout again Mike Young special Bong takes a three Able to hit it Hes such a good player Jaden shoot over to Hammond Hes trying to have a quick answer after the big man sinks a three Is a 50 threepoint shooter this year There is Hammond Getting blocked by Bradford Three on the way Demani Harrison answers with a triple of his own Did we mention it When he has it he shoots it And Aaron Fern had talked about Demani Harrison as a guy that can heat up quick Charlotte needs the entire team to do that here The wow from long range too hard and Bonk able to collect the rebound Back to back threes by Charlotte has cut this lead and another look Anton Bon with a heat check there That got swatted Almost fell into the hoop My question right now is how did Bonk not play much at Providence This guy is good Well thats such an interesting thing for the big man for Charlotte how he hadnt played that much basketball before this but these two threes igniting Charlotte They only hit one the entire first half Cut the lead from 17 to 11 in a hurry Again math not being our strong suit I worked it out ciphering here on the paper Knots here is of Dallas trying to heat up for Virginia Tech Get the whole team to heat up around him here Jaden shoot open for three and airballs it Well he was short on that off of a screen HARRISON POPS A THREE Its inside a single digits now after two threes from Demani Harrison The southern Indiana transfer native of Atlanta Theres Jaden shoot as Harrison was down in the back court A three falls for the Hokes And now a whistle Theyre going to check on Demani Harrison Harrison looking to talk to somebody He hits the three Oh yeah it was a big collision but I think he initiated the contact to be honest That seemed like a fair screen And he never Dorne never moved Hes a big body against a small body but illegal nonetheless Theres Var six on the shot clock and gets slapped Theres a foul Physical matchup continues here Thats been the story of this ball game And this may be the continuation rule right here Two shots in the active shooting A new interpretation right now that he was going up for the shot and he will go to the free throw line and VR goes to the line having only shot five free throws so far this year The freshman from Barcelona and he hits the first one Played for FC Barcelonas B and A team before coming to play college basketball in the United States with Charlotte The is very skilled not a big scoreer but a good passer and obviously can knock down some free throws He now five of seven on the season Charlotte will zone defense What are the Hokes going to do to get around that door open at the free throw line and takes a shot Charlotte still creeping here Just a npoint deficit Theres Harrison Almost able to bounce it home but instead Lau with nine rebounds Singledigit game here Hammond trying to change that Floats it up Back iron No good And Bonk didnt block it but he affected that shot So here is Harrison down to Bonk The matchup weve been watching all day Bonk unable to get it Elliot able to get the rebound though And Charlotte can reset with 20 on the shot clock now dwindling down to 15 Yeah Bon kept that rebound alive Another offensive rebound for Charlotte Good play by Shoot Telegraph that feed from Spencer Elliot Singledigit game in Blackburg 5849 under 12 to go Well were starting to see the threepoint shooting heat up for Charlotte Mack They only hit one threepointer in that first half and now three here in the second Yeah And efficiently three out of five And thats a big difference Demani Harrison able to hit two of those after a relatively quiet first half And now Demani Harrison music has eight Three of six from the field so far for Charlotte And this is a singledigit game all of a sudden in this physical matchup between the Hokes and the 49ers Hansbury back in for Virginia Tech Hansbury got those quick two fouls to start us off here in the second half Tamara Brown on the sideline guys I stepped into the Hokes huddle and coach Young immediately said Number 10 is cooking and we have to do something about it He then turned to Ammani Hansbury and said Youre in I need you on the floor Hansbury then turned to his team and said We have to fix our energy Were only up nine Come on guys They have missed Hansbury here a little bit in this second half and he got those fouls so quickly within a minute a span of about six seconds as Dallas turns around and it pops out for the freshman The Hooks amplifying the defense Here is Bonk Drive in Abdales with just his third shot on the other end One of three for the day There is Harrison And just like Mike Young had been talking about he has been cooking for Charlotte now has 10 points for the 49ers Yeah and that was against Bedford Probably the best 101 perimeter defender cheering for Virginia Tech He along with Tyler Johnson Abdales steps back for three No good Rebound Blackman Sevenpoint game Charlotte coming out of the American Conference trying to make a statement here against Virginia Tech in Blackburg Okis coming off of a 35point win against St Josephs now in a bit of a tough fight here as Harrison continues his second half Now has 13 for Charlotte with his third three of the second half Fourpoint game Mac and Deonti Harrison is the reason that Charlotte is back in it Hes done it from long range Hes done it from midrange and he is playing with a ton of confidence for coach Fern and the 49ers Hes been redot for Charlotte in these last two contests Was able to pick up double digits in the performance against Davidson but now trying to convert it into a win here today And the foul called on Kylin Blackman as Neo A of Dallas was able to draw the foul Guys I was just in the 49ers huddle and coach Fern said the two things I asked of you at halftime Compete your butt off and be physical Lets do that for 10 minutes And they certainly have here for the first 10 minutes of the second half Dallas backing in Fades and misses Foul called And keeping it on this side of the basketball court here for Virginia Tech Thatll put Virginia Tech in the one and one Right now thats just five fouls for Virginia Tech in the seventh for Charlotte Dallas getting a quick moment to talk with head coach Mike Young You can sense a little bit of frustration there for the freshman from Greece Shots arent falling Missing the front end of the one and one and into the hands of Elliot for Charlotte Oh just a fourpoint game And they actually have Abdollis on Harrison now Tyler Johnson booked with the foul Thats now his fourth foul His third personal excuse me And theyll switch up now Tyler Johnson came into the game during that last timeout and hes in the game to guard Harrison Abdollis had him on a switch Elliot hands off Harrison The red hot hand for Charlotte OPEN THREE AND ITS FOOT good for Ming ONEPOINT GAME OFF OF THE three from Coell Ming 5857 A couple of guys who hadnt been big factors for Charlotte Big factors today for coach Fern Charlotte looking for its first lead of the game Bedford steps back for three Cant hit it Lau wrestles for the rebound Goes up for two and draws a foul Offensive rebounds are going to be big for Virginia Tech down the stretch and Hanssberry and Lwal are two of the best in the ACC at that Making another double double for Lau But you cant say enough about Coell Mading here Had not played snorts all season and the graduate student from High Point North Carolina has been a star 12 points He hasnt missed a shot Move back closer to his home obviously in Charlotte and has three fouls also He is going to play alongside Bonk Now that free throw for Lal stops a 100 run for Charlotte Hokes have led by as much as 17 points That was just six minutes ago Lal makes it a pivotal trip to the free throw line Threepoint lead for Virginia Tech Castle Coliseum getting into this one Brayley Yeah Trying to spark some momentum for this Virginia Tech team that has been largely without it for the better part of six minutes cheering Mingo up against Abdales Mingo turns around midrange rattles home What a bucket for the senior from Canada Yeah he he hadnt scored a lot but he has created a lot of offense for them And that time he said Ive got this one Here is Abdales Hokes protecting a onepoint lead Abdales veers left Lals open So is Bedford Back to Lal Corner three Swatted into the hands of Bradford Here comes the guard for Charlotte trying to take the lead 49ers have not led today Mingo calls for the screen Mingo penetrates Pump fake Foul called Thats going on of Dallas cheering And a smart play again Texas 17 Third foul for Neo Abdoll Charlotte looking for the lead When we come back Mac oneonone mingo against AD Dallas Backs him down Shot fake Knocked the bottom out Charlotte is nine for 16 Just 26 for Virginia Tech So here is Mingo going to the line Charlotte has not led all game and hes an outstanding free throw shooter Nine of 11 on the year over 80 last year at Marshall First of two shots misses applause And the Castle guard loving that Students are into it They turned out today cheering Have been turning out the last few games for Virginia Tech mens basketball Misses both Those are huge misses But Hansberry it goes off of his hands Yeah And that was bonk pressuring him from behind that caused him to knock the ball out of bounds So still a onepoint lead for Virginia Tech Charlotte with a chance to take the lead Bit of an antsy crowd here now as Virginia Techs lead has dwindled down to one Ben Bradford who had a great close to the first half goes up to the rim misses the shot and a foul is called him a ding Thatll be his fourth I think And it is And that was a block shot by Lwal Look at Tyler Johnson skying up to the glass Theres the block Theres the rebound Well if Virginia Tech ends up winning this game you got to think about that possession right there That was just great defense for the Hokes Yeah And if you if you think about it from Charlottes perspective they missed two free throws and got a layup blocked came away with no points with a chance to take the lead So Ming goes to the bench Big free throw there for the sophomore from Orlando Florida Tyler Johnson now with three points for Virginia Tech Doesnt get to the free throw line often but pretty good shooter Hes four for six on the season now marks up his second one and a good trip to the line for the Hokes Jaden Shute checking back in Jaylen Bedford goes to the bench and Harrison also out of the game So the two guys who really have gotten Charlotte in it on the bench right now cheering What can Elliot and company do here Bradford feeds over to Mingo Mingo driving in Bradford to tie it cheering No good And wow Lwal almost scraped the roof of Castle Coliseum to get that rebound Big defensive possession Abdales feeds Hanssberry Jaden shoot pump fake three on the way No good Johnson offensive board back out Bodies everywhere Heres Lwal Hes open Hell take the three No good Hanssbury locked up under the rim Then we got some extracurriculars here between Bradford and Hanssbury This crews done a good job in a physical game and uh they jumped in there to to to settle things down Another look at that Yeah got him by the arm Hansbury pulls away Yeah unnecessary but thats a good job of officiating because it could have escalated in a hurry Could have gotten worse Two players we focused on in the open Hansbury and Ben Bradford Bradford now with three fouls A pair of 49ers with three fouls Ben Bradford and Anton Bunk and Ming with four Yeah And Fern trying to get Bradford out of there before something else happens Bradfords not happy about it but uh you got to keep you cool here Coach Coach Fern doing a nice job He knows his players And Hansbury gets the friendly bounce right there I dont even know if that was a bounce Actually I think laughter it just flopped in Well as Hanssbury tries to convert this free throw its a big moment for Tech because Hokes have struggled from the field Mack theyre one of their last 13 Yeah this whole second half has been a struggle from field goal range cheering Back to a twocore lead for Virginia Tech 6459 Bingo lets it fly Bonk trying to get the rebound with Elliot Throws it off of the leg of shoot and it stays with the 49ers Nice hustle Bonk keeping that The Hokeis having to rebound by committee down there because Bon is just bigger than everybody else But good play good hustle by Spencer Elliot Trying to get the ball in Hes taking his time applause and a foul called on Virginia Tech Virginia Tech So thats on Tyler Johnson He now has four Mac Yeah And hes such a good defender and a reliable player for Coach Young but hes going to have to take him out right now Oh Jaylen Bedford ready to check back in for the Hokes with a little bit smaller lineup Thats a little bit of a misnomer when you have a 69 point guard Big trip to the line here for Demani Harrison cheering whose 13 points lead all 49ers and now has 14 Yeah Harrison back in Ming still on the bench Im sure hell be there till sometime under the fiveminute mark but getting a little rest over there too cheering trying to make it a onesore contest and cant do it there Lal got that rebound but Hanssbury made it possible by blocking out bunk Can the Hokes close this game out with 6 and 12 minutes left Led by as much as 17 Missed their last nine shots from the field The feet inside Hanssberry cant get the roll Lal was ready Offensive board his second one of the possession And that one rolls on in for Virginia Tech getting the Hokei crowd into it Lal has just continued to get better in his twoyear stint here in Blackburg Hooks have missed 10 in a row Lal leading the way with 16 points for the Hokes as that layup goes Mingo with a quick answer for Charlotte Have I mentioned how much I like Mingo What a point guard So as the Hokes get on offense Toby Low careerhigh rebounds with 14 foul call before the shot Yeah the double team and everybody the Hokes are going to have their choice of shots Two people following the ball Somebody is wide open Now that double team has really been a constant theme here today for Charlotte against Neo Abdollis and Virginia Tech in the second half Even with those open shots they were unable to convert on him and thats how Charlotte got back into this game Yep Hansbury has been perfect from the free throw line today He was eight for 11 coming into the day Now hes 13 for 15 on the season Hes got nine total points for Virginia Tech 6862 cheering Mingo finds Harrison Another three Bouncing out to Mingo Wants to give Harrison another chance cheering calling for some help right in front of his bench Screen from Elliot Mingo dribbles Harrison this time from the right wing Too short Another offensive board Bradford with a huge offensive rebound after Mingo got one previously Third chance for Charlotte See if its the charm A senior from Canada driving in on off Dallas Layup cant go Goes out of bounds Whos it with Virginia Tech Yeah it was off Mingo that time Yeah applause big defensive stance there for Virginia Tech despite three offensive rebounds for Charlotte There it is Theres that last little touch just on fingertips Two3 zone for Charlotte Charlottes had a couple of chances here Have not been able to convert but Virginia Tech keeping them in it Staying ice cold from the field Bedford trying to change that Bank wasnt open Rebound Bradfords got it to where they wanted High post out for a threepoint shot LOB IT UP FOR ANTON Bunk and Bradford with the assist 6864 Back to a fourpoint game Trying to get them lined up defensively Back in that zone again Inside Hanssbury of Dallas for three Hes been cold today of Dallas Charlotte going to cut down on this once again They have not led all day Bonk on Hanssberry Bonk stutter step Foul is called and thats four on Ammani Hanssberry Fourpoint game Anton Bonk heating up the drive the help and that leaves the big guy ready for an easy twopoint basket Crazy Crazy Demani Harrison leading Charlotte with 12 points in the second half He only had two there before we went to the halftime intermission And Charlotte has stormed back as a result Hokes have been cold from the field Anton Bonk Hes in double figures as well And hes made it a onesore game of that first free throw Yeah he has not been a good free throw shooter but hes such a good threepoint shooter I imagine that may be just because of a small sample size Both free throws nailed there Twopoint game tying a careerhigh Aaron Fern so excited about the potential of Anton Bon and before this game and before he got to Charlotte only played in 24 basketball games of 10 in 10 minutes or more So this is a guy thats not even an experienced basketball player making a difference You know who is experienced Jaden Shoot And then after the timeout set play from Mike Young gets a wideopen three again 7166 A huge three for Jaden Shoot now in double figures with 12 coming off of the bench for the Hokes The wall did a nice job of cutting Mingo off right there cheering Bradford backing in Pump fake spins too short Rebound Johnson Good job by Johnson contesting the shot blocking out getting the rebound Now Dallas draws a foul number and it goes on Spencer Elliot Yeah And ADA about the only thing ADA hasnt done well this year is shoot free throws And again were only talking about three games in Hes three for eight And theres the foul by Elliot Easy call for the officials Dallas will be shooting two here He has struggled shooting the ball today Yeah just one of six from the field Another manette on that free throw though Looked pretty good on that one didnt he Form is outstanding So on the season had shot under 70 in those first three games The free throws have made a huge difference today as now Tech is 23 of 28 from the free throw line in this ball game Those are winning kind of numbers and probably the you can point to that being the reason theyre ahead right now cheering only up seven and a foul called off the ball It goes on Jaden Shoot Thats four on the sharpshooter for Virginia Tech Yeah And he needs to leave the official alone There are a lot of players out there with four fouls with under three minutes left You can expect it here Shoot Johnson and Hanssbury for Virginia Tech and Coell Mading for Charlotte now with four as well as he returns to the floor First free throw good for Demani Harrison There you see it And that could be a huge factor especially if it gets into overtime Harrison trying to make that a possibility goes one of two at the charity stripe there 15 rebounds for the senior from England in Lau Thats been a big part of the reasons the Hokes are still ahead too Off of the screen Hanssberry He wanted Lau out in the corner and he was cutting in Oh another miscommunication right there Another miscommunication for Virginia Tech Not many turnovers today though No that was the first one of the second half for either team And the Hokes went uh 25 minutes against Providence with just two turnovers in that shootout Two and a half minutes to go Sevenpoint lead for Virginia Tech Make it a sixpoint lead cheering Ming another three And a rare miss for Ming in this game Foul called That goes on Charlotte and Aaron Fern is not happy about that whistle Yeah there was there was a lot of contact on that rebound but the Virginia Tech guy had the ball so and that goes on Bonk his fourth foul So the two big men for the 49ers in trouble with four fouls and ming bonk could have been or Johnson that was fouled Front end to two for Dallas Every free throw just feels huge for Virginia Tech with those two big players in foul trouble with four Spencer Elliott also with three Bradford with three as well Free throws like you mentioned big today for Virginia Tech to maintain that lead Eightpoint lead for Virginia Tech 7567 Hokes have hit 25 free throws today and force a miscommunication for Charlotte Their first turnover of the second half Yeah Mingos made so many good decisions That was a bad one He could have been a little more patient and thrown the ball up to bunk looking for a dagger field goal here Havent hit many field goals in the second half of Dallas Goes into the paint draws a foul Is that Mading And look like it was close to being Bradford there Yep its Bradford And it is on Bradford So his fourth now Three 49ers with four fouls Another look at this one to the line Not a lot there but Dallas is perfect at the free throw line so far today and stays perfect Five for five Alen Bedford returns for Virginia Tech Been a while since Bedfords gotten a bucket He does lead all scorers with 20 points and Neil Abdales six of six from the free throw line 10point lead for Virginia Tech cheering Charlotte had climbed to within one multiple times and just could not convert Monty Harrison A couple of pump fakes draws a foul Hansbury And Ammani Hanssbury his day is done Thats his fifth foul Story of the game a physical one And weve gotten our first player to foul out Virginia Tech had a good situation right there They had the man double team Could have just had gone straight up but just got a little too aggressive And Hansbury is going to have to take a seat The Hokes are going to go small right here Check it back in for the Hookies Number two Andberry did get him on the elbow Yeah And what they what they might do right here is go small on offense and then sub on defense if there are dead balls A timeout on the floor 10point lead for Virginia Tech Just a minute 48 left in this one So Matt you know Charlotte was able to storm all the way back here Theres got to be a couple moments that the 49ers are going to kick themselves over if theyre not able to pull off a pretty miraculous comeback here in the minute 48 remaining Yeah theyve had a couple big turnovers a missed shot the the the opportunity when they were at the free throw line and got two more rebounds and and couldnt convert But that last one was a big one because I think Mingo really if he was just a hair more patient could have gotten it to bonk music for an easy basket But but right now theyre going to have to knock down free throws I dont think they can continue to play zone They may continue to press but Im not even sure about that They want the game to get up They need as many possessions as they can cuz right now it stands with a 10point lead for the Hokes Now Charlotte had its chances It hadnt had any field goals in almost 3 minutes Thats 2 minutes and 43 seconds without a field goal for the 49ers Virginia Tech meanwhile has led by as much as 17 Theyve made some pretty clutch free throws down the stretch here Yeah they have made clutch free throws for sure and gotten to the free throw line And defensively I think is where theyve won it though Tyler Johnson has been extremely good Toby Lwal has been guarding the point guard Mingo on multiple occasions Theyve done a good job of communicating on switches so that they can contest shots too So I I think for the most part Coach Young hasnt been happy with some of the defensive things Down the stretch theyve been pretty darn good So a couple free throws coming up for Demani Harrison leading the 49ers with 15 points off the bench cheering Misses that first free throw Yeah hes missed a couple free throws now And you know he has not played that many minutes Hes only played 11 minutes a game today 24 though and 15 points Well Charlotte trying to make some free throws in front of this Virginia Tech crowd Theres a lane violation as of Dallas slipped into the paint there Yeah hes been hes been right on the verge of that the whole game but that time a little off balance cheering Second one goes 14 of 22 today from the line for the 49ers Jaylen Bedford Hokes navigating through the press Get it to an open Jaden Shoot Trying to dribble this out Shoot Lowed up for Lu Hokes crowd loving that The bounce goes out to the corner Bradford for three nicks the rim Shoot Fighting for it Throws it in And here come the Hokes cheering Neo Abdul So many weapons cheering applause Energy is back around mens basketball here in Blackburg cheering Bradford another three Swirls it in 10point game Just a minute and a second left to go cheering Dallas now in double figures with that dunk And you could just tell Virginia Tech was waiting for a moment like this the entire game Yeah And what a luxury Lwal is You It doesnt have to be perfect because anywhere near that rim and above that rim he can do it And Bedford with the unselfish play giving it up to Avdales whos not had a great field goal shooting day but he didnt have any problem with that one wide open in transition Yeah that dunk for Neo Abdales was just his second field goal made today But if youre looking at the story of this game Abdales came in clutch music with those free throws Hes perfect from the line today And that really as we have talked about before Hokes made a huge difference at the charity stripe going 27 of 32 as opposed to Charlottes 14 of 22 from the line You take a look at Neos day 10 points Also has a couple of assists for the Hokes and one rebound And every games going to be Neo watching Not everything is going to be chart popping or just going to be eye popping watching him play But today he has made a couple of big plays and big moments particularly at the line and really couldnt say that enough because Virginia Tech was able to escalate its lead back up after Charlotte crept back in the second half with those free throws And I think theyre looking at a clock issue here Mac able to spark a little bit more here in the second half Tamaro with more on Neo Aales When I asked Coach Young about him he said hes as good as advertised The best passer Ive seen in 40 years of coaching I love his size vision and his pro experience is already showing up guys Yeah I can definitely expect to see some dunks like that on the pro level but theres still some growing and some you know just evolution that is going to happen throughout the year for Neo Abdal You got to remember this is just his fourth game in college basketball Yeah hes gotten bigger and stronger and and uh something weve talked about in the past he hes never been the guy and now he is the guy Hes always been kind of a role player and uh uh now the attention is on him and and I would argue that his stats today are a little bit deceiving because he was doubleteamed a lot he was in foul trouble a lot and whenever he was double teamed he made the right decision and Virginia Tech went through a stretch there where they couldnt knock down any open shots and uh that also affected his stats on the day so now they have looked at what the clock is going to be were going to get an explanation here reset the clock here all right Mac the clock stopped prematurely after the dunk so itll be down to 58 seconds it was a 3second different before it re it restarted after that dunk in transition So now 58 seconds left as opposed to 1 minute and 1 second And now with only 58 were going to laughter have to figure out how to do this Yeah I think Charlotte would object to that And there we go Okay and and they need our help because we are so good at math Were so good Oh my gosh thats my worst nightmare Everybody looking at me while I try to figure out how to fix the clock No way All right now back 58 seconds left His up 10 cheering A swarming of Dallas at midcourt Shoot Theres a foul Yeah and that was a good play by Charlotte You know try to get the trap See if you can get the steal after the pass out of the trap Youve got a foul because youve got to try to get as many possessions as possible It looks like Virginia Tech going to wrap this game up Got a game in a few days but its really going to start getting a little bit tougher for Virginia Tech here at the end of the month of November going down to the Bahamas in the battle for Atlantis Yeah theyve got a stretch coming up thats going to be very difficult down there Theyve got Colorado State possibly Witchah State or St Marys Uh then theyve got South Carolina and George Mason when they get back from there So uh theyve got a fivegame stretch where were going to learn an awful lot about Virginia Tech mens basketball this season I cant leave out the game against Bryant in just a few days Thats going to happen here on the ACC Network Extra Heres Demani Harrison Boy hes had a great day He really has Came up a little limp right there but he has certainly earned some playing time He gets booked with the foul Thats Deonte Harrisons first foul I dont know if he cramped up on that shot or uh tweaked it when he came down It looks like he just got a kind of walking off a cramp but he has had a great day 18 points now Yes sir 18 points threepointers as now Bedford goes to the line for two Now that is 30 free throws made for Virginia Tech The most ever under Mike Young And hes been here seven years now Yeah And hes had a lot of highscoring games Hes such a great offensive coach But maybe hes just doing such a good job getting open shots laughter Major Freeman The low pass to Mingo Bonk cleans it up with a dunk And again created by the penetration of Mingo Somebody had to help and that left Bonk with nobody to block him out Its going to be interesting to see what Charlotte is able to do here in the next few weeks Got going and then the American going forward Yeah Yeah They got App State coming up a Sunb Belt game and then playing Shaw University Itd be interesting to see what Aaron Ferns team can do and what he had talked about with us yesterday Theyre still learning each other as a timeout now is called Get another look at this putback from Anton Bon whos put together a really great day for Charlotte Yeah and see Lal comes across to try to contest the shot leaving nobody to block the big guy out And I dont know if you cant block him out Hes just big 15 points 10 rebounds for Anton Bunk Career high for him Didnt play much at Providence last year a team that the Hokes just played two games ago and got the overtime victory Anton boxing going to be a problem in the American Conference Yeah averaging a double double already had 13 and 14 against Davidson 15 and 10 here again today So he is increasing those double double numbers And back down to a single digit lead for Virginia Tech as Tyler Johnson tries to get the ball in and he does to have Dallas He let that one go off his ankle Charlotte ball Good play by Bradford didnt let him have it and when they threw it in he contested that pass off off Dallas off Dallass leg and Bon comes back in to try to add to those points Charlotte needs a couple of big shots here Bradford jumping up and gets fouled Tyler Johnson Thats his fifth Yeah you just cant make that foul You just cant make that foul You cant stop the clock inside of 30 seconds with a ninepoint lead Oh Johnsons day done with six points for the Hokes Another look at the foul here See a little misdirection play They threw it screen going away from the ball Tyler Johnson was aggressive but You got to give that one up right there You got to let him catch it and then defend it Thats two Hokes that have now fouled out Ammani Hansbury and Tyler Johnson Two starters for Virginia Tech out of the game Bradford misses The expression I was looking for is this discretion would have been the better part of valor right there Look at you with your 8 words here Lets go cheering Well we both went to the same school Its laughter easy Easy And Hammond running the point for the Hokes with the shot clock off 8476 cheering and applause That will do it So Virginia Tech applause going to 40 for the first time in three seasons and the fifth time in seven years under head coach Mike Young It was a tough one today but the Hokes earned it 8476 with a win over Charlotte as the 49ers fall to 2 and2 has a great
