Tuesday plus 610 of a second of Kieran Mullen Jeff Cable will take all the help he can get Hes down three players as he may be for the rest of the year Witherspoons missed jumper is tracked down by Trimble for North Carolina Both teams need to defend without fouling Monitor pace Pittsburgh wants to slow this game down and control the pace Carolina always wants to get up and down cheering Force the action Lets see if they continue to do that with a completed pitch Stevenson with a three That will help The first five for the Heels And its the two bigs Pie and Stevenson who provided him Theyre

as a six seed right now as we hit the middle of February Buggabot sticks a three Backto back triples for the heels Front line of pitch Theyve got to get up on the level of the ball screen cheering Intercitis has got to fight through that Bovach you dont want to give him direct line of sight to the rim First look at Jeff Cable on the Pittsburgh bench trying to snap an eightgame losing streak to ranked opponents severely underman team Deshawn Jackson has not been cleared this year due to a medical condition would have been their big man 611 from Iowa State Papa a backup knee surgery and Brandon Cummings their leading scoreer missing his fifth in a row with an ankle injury Pick goes inside here to the freshman Roman Caleeppa who had 19 against Duke on Tuesday If theyre going to switch that ball screen Caleppas got to be in force inside took advantage of his matchup Pogba drives and scores Hes got five applause Pogbas known more for shooting a three not for attacking the basket like that but a direct line of drive He can attack off straight line drives there But Pit doesnt want to foul They dont have enough depth They dont want to foul your UNCC Everyone just continue to attack Try to force for force the Panthers to use this bench See the physical freshman from Australia misses everything Rebounded by High Boats into Stevenson Typically more of a shooting big fades away and scores it in the lane And Carolina without Wilson and Vessar has hit its first five shots How about the roar of enthusiasm cheering for the folks in Carolina blue for this underman squad which is shooting the lights out early Witherspoon on the drive held up by high Here come the heels with Trimble Little over exuberant with a dribble though Theyre missing Theyre two stars on the front line They have to defend Take care of the basketball and let the chips fall where they may Trimble is fouled the first of the game What a start and wrong time too late in the year to be trying to figure things out and theyre about to have to readjust and see what this team is going to look like We got a good glimpse of it right now Guys are playing really well and well see if they can sustain it at NC State Tuesday They dont play NC State twice this year The ACC schedule adjustments go to Syracuse Three good teams come here Louisville Virginia Tech and Clemson and then of course end the season at Cameron The good news for the Tar Hills theyve done a lot of work already They have five quad one wins as Barry Dunning misses a three for Pit cheering Saved by DeMarco Miner whos back off the bench But for the Tar Hills it is a really testy stretch run They hope theyll have Wilson back before the end of the year They hope theyll have Visar back maybe as early as next week Great catch and finish by Trimble Bogots last basket was goended in That means North Carolina cheering is seven for seven Huber told us early before the game it doesnt matter whos not available Whoevers out there has to defend and rebound the basketball Carolinas doing a great job of that right here So early in the first half And wraps it into Corin trying to take Zayen High who holds him up well Got the refeed and High reaches in for Carolinas first foul Does a great job there Just handling the basketball in traffic You want to get it up in the air to an athlete like Seth Trum with a great catch and great finish Better playmaker maybe than folks think too Two and a half assists a game Leads the team with a two and a half assist to turnover ratio Carolina has scored the last eight Heres Miner and a hard screen on Trimble from Corin Corins already hit one three Make it two Missed his 10th and now 11th of the year Well see if Carolina make an adjustment Maybe trying to close out to him Zayen High is trying to back up to help on the dribble penetration from the guards Cam Corin knocks down his second three They may have to readjust how theyre guarding him Bogots into high in the post Mismatch Witherspoon High finishes off the window Eight straight makes for Carolina Great job there just punishing the switch applause The lineups out there now Both teams are going to do a lot of switching five and great job there by Zayen High taking advantage of the smaller defender Pit has his usual starting five in Miner Witherspoon Dunning a great athlete Caleppa and Corin Kins going to shoot another three and he hits it They didnt make that adjustment yet you were thinking about RC Thats three for three for Corinth Well Dixon switching inside and hes fronting So he needs to tell Zayen High maybe deny that pass Came into the game 32 nine out of 28 Heres High at the elbow High facing Corin Bounce it back for Seth Trimble Trimble over Corin and the first miss for Carolina was well defended by the 610 Corin Cam Corin is a big guy that can defend smaller guards on the perimeter D misses a leader Bar Dunny Jr had a big game against Duke 17 points Tuesday Carolina starts eight for nine Two for two from deep High doesnt typically shoot this He will swirl it out He was feeling maybe a Cam Corin effect as Corin drives it in high on the other end and gets it to go Cam Corin has 11 of Pits 13 And then Miners swipes it out of Trimbles hands on the other side to prevent a breakout Something to keep an eye on too Kevin is the front line guys where the availability here is Cam Corin applause looking to get the basketball inside You still backing off me Ill knock down another He has three threes here does a great job initiating contact so high cant try to block the shot and finish at the rim Quick 11 Hes going to need some rest He wont be there long He may be there only the under 12 given their lack of depth Kieran Mullen the 7ft freshman is in as Trimble gets the friendly bounce applause Conditioning of these guys talked about Cam Coin you can see hes over on the bench stretching that left ankle out He rolled it in their last game against Duke and didnt practice all week kind of walk through shoot around yesterday here Again he was listed as a game time decision Hes averaging 33 and a half minutes a game on the year Caleppa a tough finish by the freshman Loen Caleppa over Trimble And Pit starting to get hot from the field Back within five He just does everything well I dont know if hes great at anything but he does everything well high motor guy This kid goes to the zone now but you cant leave the basketball Cant leave Bogavots cheering and applause 10 for Luca Bogots who had come off the bench in his last nine games and the Heels are now 10 for 12 Minor pull up three Rebound to Dixon on the run for UNCC options to both wings and Dunning slaps it out of play Carolina better offensively without Caleb Wilson and Henry Vesar music Many are saying Henry who Caleb who you dont need those guys when you got bobots knocking down step back threes Carolina cruise control here Big scorers early Korn with 11 of pits 15 Bogabots has scored or assisted seven of North Carolinas 10 baskets Remember if youre just joining us well remind you Well let you know for the first time No Caleb Wilson today Hes out indefinitely A broken bone in his left hand Carolinas also without Henry Vesar their starting fiveman band Six since Tuesday Also dealing with a lower extremity issue And the Heels have started 10 for 12 without their two best players Trimble at the end of the shot clock misses a three and its rebounded by Corin Thats outstanding ball screen defense there by Johnny getting through getting into Bovots getting over the ball screen multiple screens Thats a really good defensive effort there by the Panthers Mullens pass through the hands of Dunning and then off the hands of Stevenson It will stay with Pit as Roman Cipa checks in for Mullen And there are the two stars for Carolina on the bench Caleb Wilson who by the way was in amazing spirits he was before the game today highfiving fans taking shots righthanded smiling like a guy who you know thinks hell be back soon And he does seem to think hell be back before the end of the year And Henry Bessar who did not participate in warmups was just on the bench dribbling for a little while I mean this guy Cubert Davis every time you ask him about Caleb Wilson raves about him raves about his personality Yes And we saw a glimpse of that before the game over cheering here greeting fans smiling His leadership they think is still going to pay big dividends for this team even while hes out It has You can tell by the fast start See Aleppa end of the shot clock and get the rim Thats a shot clock violation What will be the biggest challenge for Carolina without Caleb Wilson Lets assume Vesar is back soon What will be the biggest challenge without Wilson I think their ability to continue to def to rebound I mean youre talking about even Miami game they brought rebounded They gave up 12 offensive rebounds They lost rebound margin by six Lost it by 12 against Duke even though we know they won at the buzzer and youre missing your leading rebounder I think one of your more versatile defender He was a switchable defender and thats two of the areas where Carolina has been really inconsistent in and I think thats where theyre going to miss him the most Off a missed three by Dixon Heres Dunning who spots up and misses a three When we talked to Hubert Davis today about what they need to do he he didnt even mention scoring without those two Stevenson having a problem scoring right now Hes got eight Hes three for three and the lead is 11 because Stevenson is more than capable of picking up some of the slack I dont think any one person can do it Now their depth hasnt issued The quality of what they can do has not changed They still going to be able to run that high low action You know I think among their bigs hes just as good a shooter applause as Caleb Wolf Corin rattles in another two He is five for five Hes got 13 a pit 17 Cam Corin now that hes knocked down those three threes Kevin Hes going to have the option of driving the basketball Nice feed Dixon to Stevenson and he misses from deep Ryan Evans ready to check in for the Tarheels See Aleppa way too strong A tough start shooting for Kip Boavots for Dixon Dixon has it knocked away by Miner and theyre both in the role of the photographers Dunning down the court will bank it home The first bucket for the senior Barry Dunning Jr Thats the part of Carolina that Hub Davis been frustrated with Its the live ball turnovers that are leading the baskets Youre controlling the tempo and pace of this game right now take care of the basketball Bogots misses Carolinas got three subs ready to check in now Miner on a hard charging drive is stripped Great hands by Treble who takes it all the way applause Great job there by Seth Trumble Pit Panthers do not want to foul They want to rotate and try to keep it in a sixman rotation if they can Great job by Seth Tumble Continue to attack the rim cheering applause has been flying by cheering a few minutes since the last whistle Corin into Stevenson his first miss Fights for the ball and theres a whistle Itll go against Corin his first and take us to a timeout Wow gnarly stuff for the Big East there guys Thank you Keep an eye and see how that St Johns Providence game cheering finishes here in Carolina Been a much better start for the Heels who didnt lead until the final shot of the game Saturday against Duke Didnt lead at all against Miami They tied it twice but didnt take the lead on Tuesday On paper home versus Pit a much friendlier opponent Even without Caleb Wilson and Henry Vesar the Tar Hills ran off to a great start They have been They played really well Theyre sharing the basketball Its moving Theyre really punishing Pittsburgh on the switches Heres Jonathan Powell knifing in for two more applause I think somethings to be said too when this type of shake up in a lineup Everybodys playing free because they know theyre going to get minutes Fouls a guy that 28 of his 39 field goals have been behind a threepoint line He throws out hard trying to run him off the line He does a great job of just driving you Nice crafty finish at the rim there Evidence Jaden Young on the floor for the first time High returns for Carolina Powell and Treble Freshman Omari Witherspoon got fouled with 37 to shoot Tonight 8 Eastern ABC and the ESPN at the womens college game day crew is in Baton Rouge at the Maravit Center Huge game tonight One of the biggest games in mens or womens hoops tonight Maybe the game of the night Number three South Carolina Number six LSU South Carolina has won the last 17 games but this is going to be a big challenge for Don Staleys Gamecocks tonight That sounds unbelievable Well heres the crazier thing LSU leads the alltime series 221 So it was 224 and South Carolina could even hit 22 Kim Moy and Don Staley there BFFs there Thats going to be a really fun game to watch there Thatll be really competitive I dont know if were going to get a Providence St Johns level brawl but uh itll be nasty Physical Be physical Itll be close Denning checks in for the freshman Mari Moore Saw Zayen High get a little treatment on his right hand there Thats what Carolina wants Another injury to a big man Witherspoon freshman from Buoie hits the first free throws either teams taken in the game None of these teams are great free throw shooting teams And as you mentioned neither team is going to want to foul today because they are both very thin Yeah cheering Carolina stay mo mostly with their manto man but pick youll see change how they cover ball screens Here theyre switching Trimble accelerates into the lane and finishes through the contact from CPA applause And thats a tough cut from Caleppa Youre talking about one of the best athletes on the floor He just changes speeds and goes to a gear And hes a big time athlete He gets to the rim and shields him off and nothing he can do but go through his body and foul Pittsburgh does not want to foul with their limited bench And right now both of their front line guys can corn and see has one foul each They pick up two You might see zone the rest of the way 71 from the line Seth Treble and he hits Carolinas first free throw attempt of the game Pittsburgh can you settle down and get back in this I mean just run your offense You still got enough time but youve got to figure out how you want to attack him And they want right now theyre switching inside And you have CP in the post on the guards If not then your guards got to attack the Mitch Matt outside Witherspoon will take a tough shot instead He hits him He didnt see as you noted CPA against Evans but Witherspoon with a skilled finish And then nobody guards Jaden Young Theyve got to get back and set their defense Thats not this just team Thats been it feels like the history of this program Youve got to get back Make Carolina play five on five They are as good as any team has ever been Its built in the DEA of wearing that uniform You got to get from the defensive end of the floor to the offensive end as quickly as anyone It sounds like youve all experienced that I have from a player and a coach Youve got to get back Shot goes up If youre not going only two guys go Youve got to get back And its just inexcusable there You just dont match up Thats just a lack of communication cheering But that happens So we let a 49 free throw shooter misses the first And youre fighting you realize this And pit this point in the year you wonder just where the psyche of this group is Youve lost seven of eight coming in Youve just lost so many players You just wonder at times whats the mental approach of some of these guys and theyre competing and theyre fighting but you just wonder if the sets in eventually and Carolinas punching them early They have got to fight through this try to get back in this game get to single digit court Trimble how from the corner knocked around and grabbed by Dunning Heres Miner whos yet to score Dunning early feed to Corin Just lowered his elbow into high who tried to sell it and despite the contact no foul Cam Corins got 15 Zen High doesnt want to pick up a second foul either Carolina so limited in the front court High failed and Cam Korn just sat there for a second waiting to see if the officials going to go to with Trimble is bumped by Caleppa Thats his second So he becomes the first player in the game with two fouls here He gets it inside and I think was his heels on the line Hes lucky he wasnt call for a foul Hi You think I think hell I mean high had his heels on the line Felt like time froze there for a second laughter Went saying you sure he just paused like all right can we He was expecting it was the blow in the room applause Well Cam Corin has kept Pit hanging around here On Tuesday six points against Duke were tied for his second fewest of the year Three rebounds were tied for his fewest He played 35 minutes Big step up today for the senior from Allen Texas He hadnt practiced since the game And Ill tell you this from a players perspective I preferred rest at this point in the year I feel like I didnt need as much practice So coming into a game feeling fresh went a long way applause Now you mentioned he would practice because he had a little bit of an ankle roll on Tuesday So Pit trying to keep him relatively fresh Hes playing 33 and 12 minutes a game on the year even more of late cheering Miner drives it in side of high Corin sealed off two defenders and Miner shot rattled out is throwing his hands up like what more can I do Zaden Hive for three No good Pittsburgh youre happy with that shot You You leave that for him all game long and high played well here in the first half but I dont know how many more threes you Davis wants in shooting Ding throws it right to Bogavots It does get back defensively this time Carolinas third steel It has only turned it over four times Carolina only two UNCC games typically dont feature a lot of turnovers either way Evans had a big game at Miami Tuesday Beats Bogots off the mark from deep Not a good offensive possession there Ball ball stayed nearly on one side of the foot Tony chain shot once and a lot of dribbling not enough body movement and ball movement Corin again loving that match up with high 17 on seven of eight shooting for Cam Corin His careerhigh is 25 Hes 68 of the way there with three and a half to go in the first half Offensive rebound high refeeds Young who hits the underside of the basket then throws it out to Bogots Shot clock did not reset from that second shot but it started at 20 off the first miss Bamont step back three to short and tracked down by Intracitis Once again we are flying by without whistles in this game cheering Yeah neither team wants to foul and youre going to jinx us cuz theres going to be a foul on this possession because of what you just said Oh no Foul laughter I was right You were wrong boards first miss of the game from three cheering Only seven fouls combined Carolina has missed its last six shots Hit its first eight Lets watch highs conditioning too I mean you can do a lot of work in practice but when a game comes around youre not used to playing 25 30 minutes a game You start gassing quickly cheering Young from the logo Well these possessions are ending up in some really unusual places for Carolina Weve got a foul here for the strong contact for the body of Stevenson who goes to the line and rolls in the first free throw applause I know its a flagrant one and its called but Im telling you when guys are running in thats how they teach you They tell you you better put your you better put your body in front of his and applause initiate the crash You wont see Jeff Cape will be upset with him about that Not on a physical box So Jeff Cable has both Corin and CPA his two starting bigs on the bench with two fouls That means the 7 foot freshman Kieran Mullen is in the paint did well to alter that shot which he then knocked out of bounds to pit Mullen right there was going to red shirt this year but Deshawn Jackson was their big transfer from Iowa State has music not been cleared due to a medical condition and dealt with a preexisting heart condition in his life Papa Kante 610 red shirt sophomore has been out since the end of November knee surgery So Kar Mulla had to play and hes a skilled guy Hes not physically ready for his strength yet but he has good skill set So dont be surprised Hes capable of picking and popping and shooting threes and then passing on the move He can do a lot of good things but just not a physical player yet A good move by Witherspoon The freshmans got six has missed its last eight after a 15 for 21 start Youre starting to see right now a little disjointed offense from the lineup thats usually not on the floor Well their identity is playing through those bigs and theyre not theyre no longer there cheering Trimbo will get hit with an offensive foul here Charging into Mullet that sets first Thats that strength I was talking about I dont think he was trying to take a charge I just think physically he gets hit and he goes for a ride I dont know if I agree with the call How lack of strength ended up being did It is I knew that you know thered be something good to be thrown around like a rag doll before Having seen it happen to me in my life enough Its nice to see get rewarded Witherspoon rolls it out Heres High flying in for the rebound Trimble tried to break the rim and gets fouled What a ferocious dunk attempt Trimble is out of the blocks When the shot goes up I mean he is out Watch him in your bottom of your screen He is gone He catches it on the fly and its one dribble and he is going to the penthouse Nothing you can do but foul him here Looked like he reelevated in the air like he was going up for a layup and then got an extra gust of win Foul is the second on incitis Its just called being an athlete Something neither you or I can relate to Neither you or I I think one of us can relate to that Not jumping laughter I can I can shoot it Im jumping Thats not you know that wasnt in my game Different kind of athlete Yeah Yeah Tribbles too non jumping athlete Sure NJA nonjumping athlete applause When you be an athlete at Scrabble Indraitis hes got two fouls He stays in the game cuz pitch has got to play some minor in the final minute of the half Give it to Witherspoon and he gives it applause right back with a carry Yeah thats Arminer I know he hadnt been here We talked about his story his travel but he had Stevie there on an isolation with Mullen inside I mean he hadnt playing much Youre not going to take advantage of the switch with him So thats on Minor Hes got to get in the paint off the bounce and make a play Kids going to their zone Can they rebound out of it They goend in it Dunning slap Stevenson shot Stevensons got a dozen You mentioned with minor folks just joining us He welcomed a baby girl into the world He and his girlfriend had a child at 124 in the morning just over 13 hours ago He got on a commercial flight today He made it here about an hour before game time He came off the bench for just the second time in 125 Division One games But he is here Nice back cut by Indraitis And Dunning feeds him for pit as Carolina holds for the last shot there Great Carolina did a really good job of defending until that last back door cut Got to keep him in front A little too aggressive there Pit made him pay Treble in the dying moments of the first half Spins on Indraitis finds Stevenson who is mauled with 19 to go Great applause pass there by Seth Trimble gets to his spot tent spins there on the baseline elevates and soon as he identifies the help comes over he lays it off to Stevenson there Great vision Caleb Wilson was ready You know the person that leads the nation in dunks you know what he was going to do Hes used to getting that pass tearing the rim down Carolina which is not a great free throw shooting team eight for eight Theres Caleb Wilson who has been smiling through this whole day since he was out on the court early getting up shots with his right hand Stevenson perfect at the line UNCC 9 for9 at the line in the first half Witherspoon will step into a heave and come up wfully short So no Caleb Wilson no Henry Vesar right now to play nearly 30 minutes of this game and and he hasnt done that all year long So lets see if fatigue doesnt set in because we saw earlier in this game Carolina did go 0 for seven in the stretch Can they come out to a fast start and try to put the Pit Panthers away Has already played 15 minutes which is a season high in just one half Hes already one rebound shy of his career Hes got four points five boards Dixon created space and missed the jumper Derek Dixon did not score in that first half He does have four rebounds and two assists which is a big talking point for Cubert Davis was getting his guards to rebound and he and Vogabas did a really good job of cracking down helping the bigs and especially on the switches Theyve been battling the bigs to hit to help out on the glass And theres Miner on the floor to start the second half Witherspoon turns it over looking for Caleppa for Carolina Its Dixon Trimble Boavat Stevenson and High the makeshift starting five Henry Vesar out has been sick and is also dealing with a lower extremity issue Was a game time decision Caleb Wilson out indefinitely with a broken bone in his left hand Uh Kevin and I think Carolinas just doing a better job of attacking the paint on their switches Bogavots shot was followed up missed by Stevenson And then Bogavots reaches in to pick up his first foul What can Pit do to create good shots The problem theyre having is theyre trying to attack the switch Theyre getting Derek Dixon on Cipa but hes not a tall guy Hes only 66 and Derek Dixon is 65 So hes trying he cant throw it over the top Theres only a 1 in height difference that theyre trying to throw it around Its taking too much time So I think Miner is the guy thats got to get going And you know I dont know how much you can expect from a guy whos probably hadnt gotten any sleep and just travel really late But if he can settle down and somehow get going in this game he has the shot making ability and the creativity off the bounce that could give UNCC some problems Theres Corin bodying high Left it short What a highflying rebound That was Dunning Crashed in there Hes got four Just the second offensive rebound for Pittsburgh today Dixon with an open three that is banked in Banks are open early Saturdays applause First points for Derek Dixon Carolina 6 for 16 from three Heels who are an okay threepoint shooting team have been okay today and lucky after that last game So that is an over weird ankle to be banking in a three there You dont think he intended it No that was intended Stevenson on the bounce from Dixon and Jiren Stevenson with 16 One shy of a season high Thats what they can do still That is rebound and push tempo See Aleppa on the step through scores it for two Hes got seven gets in the danger zone here Theyve had some tough starts out of second halfs recently as SMU allowed a nine nothing run last Saturday to start the half Duke had the first five on Tuesday When its your day its your day Derek Dixon catches it Shoots his horse shot off the glass there puts his head down But as you say Carolina right now is in control offensively Theyre getting every shot they want Nobody stepped up to defend Bogavots to the great eye of Jeff Cable Bogots has a dozen Retar heels in double figures Witherspoon off a handoff Deflected quite from Bogavox He tried to alter the shot It came back to Dunning for a mystery and Trimble tracks it down Got to get back in front of him Trimble bogots acres of space He misses a three Maybe his best look of the day Hit the difficult shots all game long and missed the easiest one he had all day long Miner in a switch with Stevenson Passes out of it to Witherspoon And Witherspoon is called for an offensive foul Hes picked up his second and third in the last couple of minutes Three games today here on ESPN They are good ones Texas Tech and number one Arizona is the marquee game at 630 Eastern Dan Shman Jay Bis Chris Buddton on the call for that one The Wildcats no longer defeated losing to Kansas but theyre still number one Auburn Arkansas and Gonaga against a really good Santa Clara team Do not sleep on that 1030 Eastern game Santa Clara coached by Herb Sund is a legitimate tournament contender Theyre a really good team really deep team All the great things thats happening in the league under his leadership I think Virginia Tech Hokes are going to get in I I think were going to get nine teams in as a car I think Miami that win that they they got against Carolina puts them in And I think the Hokes are going to find a way to get in Well coached team and I just think theyre finally getting healthy at the right time going to win at Clemson this week Yeah Dunning turns it over Heres Dixon Heres High High flying cheering for two applause Dixons not scoring but hes seeing the floor well with his size and getting out in transition Carolinas just doing a great job Again its cheering applause Cubs got to be pleased with the effort hes getting on the defensive end of the floor The execution may not always been great but the efforts there Step back Miner and he buries it Demarco Miners first bucket as a father laughter I think that shots been there I mean hes a 36 threepoint shooter That thats in his bag and I think hes turned down a couple of threes on those switches Now well see if he has any dead strength Hes going to guard Stevenson to the post and Garren lays it off for High The 16 6 point per game scorer has eight in his first career start It takes a long time for the dad shrimp to kick in when youre minor It didnt happen that fast He had enough time and his uh daughter his first child was born at 124 in the morning Cope shakes free from Stevenson Impressive that Mer made it here Got here about an hour before started the game Came off the bench He does have seven rebounds and an assist today That was his first bucket High again Six in a row for Zaden High Both teams right now theyre switching and they also the other they both teams know now what to do against those switches Theyre just setting one screen Theyre slipping Theyre back dooring action right now and lets see if someone changes that and more importantly will pit change that because right now theyre getting gashed inside with the front line guys of Carolina Corin into high couldnt finish it Dixon with another rebound sees tremble the whole way So did C Aleppo who parries it out of bounds Zayen Hyde now one shy of a careerhigh with 10 Its amazing what happens when you get extended minutes and hes been comfortable from the very beginning dropping a jump hook off there and here hes running the floor and the easy finish in transition Look at that the biggest cheerleader Trimble sneaks in between a couple of Panthers off the inbound and Carolina has its largest lead at 20 cheering 15 more for Trimble tonight Yeah right now Pit struggling right now They dont know who to look to Theyve always had issues all year long scoring the basketball They usually do a really good job defending holding their opponents below their season average give Carolina a game Theyve been challenged by Hume Davis with their front line guys being out and they stepped up and theyve answered the call here so far We got a lot of time left to play but Carolina really look good here today Carolina since the break Six assists seven field goals Tar Hills are shooting 56 Thats always a good sign I always say when you watch the amount of field goals a team making how many of those was assisted on And thats its always a great number to watch when you see a connected group of guys playing together Corin trying to assist Witherspoon who breaks a three Two heels went for the rebound Dixons got it Hes got six rebounds and six assists today cheering Hubert Davis pointed out to us before the game Dixon Bogavots Evans He said zero rebounds for his guard 73 minutes at Miami So Dixon with six rebounds is a big number for Trimble driving into Indraitus draws Indraituss third foul Theyve done a really good job I think when the opportunities have presented themselves because they a lot of times now their guards are being switched on the front line guys Theyre defending more in the post But when opportunity presented itself they have crashed the glass The first free throw miss See if you can explain this one Pit big free throw struggles As you look at Trimble by the way big bounceback game today Pits opponents are hitting 763 of their free throws Yeah So not only are they not hitting at the line applause whenever they foul teams their opponents hit from the line Thats a deadly combination That is thats when you say Hey youre fouling the wrong guys You got to foul Idris shakes free for two I mean thats thats not explicable to anything is it No Facing I cant teams that shoot good free throw percentages Dixon the last four games Pit by the way has faced UVA SMU Duke and Carolina Those four are combined 80 and 17 37 and 10 in the league Is not going to like some of these easy looks at the bucket Caleppa with another Pittsburgh layup applause CP is so strong as well And thats a difficult ask for a guard trying to defend him in the post Trimble couldnt convert Theyre trying to linger in this game Down 17 Witherspoon off the kick from Indraitis and he was out of bounds when he caught the ball Nice turnover indefinitely Carolina today an easier opponent in pit two and 10 in the league tie for last but they played well with Stevenson one shy of a season high and Zen High one shy of a career high Bogavad has been good as well and the Tarheelss have never trailed still showing flashes of things that Hub Davis wants to clean up Just the unforced turnovers still giving up a couple of offensive rebounds And Corin gets good position on Powell His first bucket of the half Hes got 19 How does Carolina change and how do teams change the way they guard them without Caleb Wilson cheering I think Stevenson helps you with that because his ability to pick and pop Youre going hes theyre going to dictate matchups because front line guys now because of his ability to score youre going to continue to see the same coverage You were afraid of Caleb Wilson posting you up inside Stevenson is more dangerous on the perimeter popping And so I expect the guards to benefit the most from that And I think were seeing that with Seb Trimble and Bogavas getting it going tonight knocking down some shots because theyre attacking the front line guys with the switches Bogots has 12 Trimble has 16 Witherspoon by the way just picked up his fourth So he takes the seat Dunning returns for Pit Kayen Evans way off the mark His first shot attempt of the game Itll go back to Pit Im still a huge fan of Ken Evans game I just think he needs to spend more time attacking the paint and plays out He plays the game right now outside in and as a point guard I think he needs to reverse that and get more in the paint and then play his way out to the threepoint line I think he and his team will benefit from that Evans guarding Dunning right now Dunning gets a step on him Terminated the dribble Miner lost it and Pit turns it over for the 10th time Miner just lost that The timing and rhythm been off all day long Theres Trimble Oh man out of a whistle A dead ball Carolina had a good look at the bucket Thats happened way too many times for the Panthers Just not getting back and setting their defense Miner with a three Young with a rebound Here go the Heels again Even shorthanded they are zipping through the tempo today as Youngs three is flat Carolina hasnt scored in about 3 minutes Pitch trying to slow the tempo now And Carolina trying to push it You can play fast but you got to make shots When you dont you end up spending more time on the defensive end of the floor And got to find a way to continue to dig deep and get stops when youre not scoring

Carolina gets NC State Tuesday in Raleigh Powell bangs it home from the corner First three for Jonathan Powell Pittsburgh looked fatigued Theyre just not getting back matching up and you just got to do that against Carolina They played eight today again Minor who knows if he slept Mullen and Moore really on the fringes of the rotation Corinth off the back of the iron Sele great offensive rebounder had his shot knocked away Heres Evans North Carolina 51 from the game Only seven of 21 from deep They have owned the paint Just continue to run your offense No need to force anything Heres High looking for a career high And hes got it A dozen for Zaden High applause who averages cheering 16 six points per game and has had his best game in Carolina blue Indraitis high went over the back and hell get hit with his third foul Carolina just running their offense running in transition there You wont get a better look than that You see Caleb in the background the right hand the good hand laughter showing you his enthusiasm for the game And High showing you patience inside He had to mismatch the entire possession Gets it late in the shot clock and the easy finish A very skilled player High who just hasnt played a lot No Two years ago he averaged less than five minutes a game Well a lot of times these things it works in your advantage High is not no pun intended hes not high on the scouting report for the other team and then he comes in and then now hes playing 30 minutes a game So a lot of teams will take a a look to see what he provides for this lineup but it doesnt doesnt look like much has changed He set up a three right there for Babox whos got 15 Great allound game for Zaden High who didnt play last year served a oneyear suspension for an offthecourt incident this year is averaging just over five minutes per game and today he has played 24 as Corin finishes over him Jeff Cable will take a timeout from seven I cant imagine any bracket not having those two teams in their final four as of right now Should be a great matchup Give me your top four cheering title contenders right now I would say those two and I would add Yukon in the mix and I would say Arizona Well were going to another break So you got that in perfect time and well be submitting that for Randolph Childriss record 45 He hit 10 threes as Louisville destroyed what had been a pretty hot NC State team on Monday night Yeah you saw the emotion for Michael Brown Tony hes been through a lot with the back injury And of all the freshman theyve had signature moments all year long And he let you know why hes considered a lottery pick in the upcoming draft as well Hard fall here Mari Moore for Pit on the left Jiren Stevenson for Carolina on the right Everybodys got to get up The coaching staff both teams doesnt want to see any more injuries applause No more illnesses They want everybody to start this game to finish this game No more lower extremities Moore took the worst of it Yeah he did And he got hit with a foul The second mentioned Caleb Wilson Henry Bessar is next to him today Besar is out dealing with illness and were told with a lower extremity issue that Carolina continues to monitor See if Hubert Davis has more word postgame UNCCs next game is Tuesday at NC State Hard to imagine going into that game without Wilson and Vessar but they have played very well without those two today Albeit again a pit team thats two and 10 in the league There are the two Carolina stars All America type players maybe the best front court in the country Cppa lays it in Hes got 14 Some of the issues that Carolina has are just inevitable with all the switching that they do You put guards inside battling against big times youre going to need help coming down to help you with that And giving up offensive rebounds when you switch is inevitable at times when you do as much switching as theyre doing because you know when they switch you got your guard down there battling the front line guy misses high Oh cheering hit the side of the basket and he got tripped up on the way down by Suppa Looked like he didnt know where he was when he elevated to shoot that He was behind the backboard But when youre going for career highs it doesnt matter Youre playing yourself to a heck of a game here Hes played really well Hes got a careerhigh 12 points high Hes now got a careerhigh seven rebounds Hes also gassed too A couple times you can see him putting his hands on his hip 26 minutes Thats more than his two highest minute totals of the season combined applause Well thats a careerhigh Two assists have tied a careerhigh as well Darren Stevenson won off of a season high with a 16 Bogots 15 His season high is 19 His ACC high is 16 So Stevenson High and Bogavots have been asked to do a lot more today and they have delivered Absolutely You ask for a group project everybody participate and help out and they have Anditis with a three for Pit Now Pits shorthanded Pits two and 10 And Pitts has had a nightmare of a season So how much can you take away from this game thats applicable to playing NC State playing Louisville playing Clemson playing Duke One you can only play obviously the team thats playing in front of you but theyre taking care of the basketball which is something theyre going to have to do against NC State You got to turn them into a half team applause Theyre doing a great job I think of just sharing the basketball taking advantage of the switching Theyre still going to be do doing a lot of those things against NC State Thats not a big team They do a ton of switching themselves I got 15 And youre right Val Luben former Carolina big man of course is the five for NC State 68 Absolutely They have knockdown shooters NC State Theyre a really good team They dont have a ton of size either like this No And I think that bodess for car in Carolinas favor but it its in Raleigh and that place will be rocking Be an easy sellout at the Lenovo Center Corin with 23 Hes tied a season high Hes too shy of a career high That game is Tuesday at 7 Eastern on ESPN UNCC and NC State It will be one of the more hotly anticipated Carolina NC State games probably of the 21st century with Will Wade NC State looking like tournament teams Yeah the Packers back I tell you what if Im in the guards of Carolina what I like is the adjustment Id like to see is that battling inside against those bigs I I prefer to get into the ball and get over and you just show and allow me to stay on my on a guard battling a big sometimes Even though I do like the size Derek Dixon at 65 and the physical guard provides that but hes also had his challenges in there competing against those guys cuz you also even the guards attack your bigs You got to battle on the glass and thats just not something you want to do all the life They need to hit the glass here Stevenson with a season high 19 six for seven from the field three for four from the threepoint line and perfect on four free throws You may not see this type of 20point game performance from him but I I think you will see some consistency His numbers will increase with Caleb Wilson out He leads the way with four double figure scores This is the current Joe Linardi Second team out Florida States playing really well of late Theyve been one of the better teams in the ACC the last couple weeks Thats still going to be a quad three loss at home Its just a killer to throw into your resume in midFebruary and theyll probably need a couple of really good road wins maybe even here in a couple of weeks to overcome that You know whats unfortunate about that Its Virginia Tech right now where they saw it on the bubble is those three losses at the buzzer that they faced throughout the early year If they had win they say two of those were not having this conversation They lost on a poopy Miller half court shot at SNU that would have been a quad one win Theyre probably in the projected field but they win that game alone They lose a weight late Nate Cal Misman Theyve just had so many tough late game losses this year And the good news about the ACC is youll have more chances But those losses like that are brutal when youre right on the bubble Heres high career high 15 and seven for Zayen High today Hes played 28 minutes No Henry Bessar illness and lower extremity issues No Caleb Wilson out indefinitely They hopefully will be back before the end of the year with a broken bone in his left hand Now that Carolinas made the adjustment Theyre trying to stay big on big So theyre showing more This I think helps the guards and help them rebound But the guards have got to fight to get over screens to eliminate shots like that Jing fired in a three Leads 14 Carolina has never trailed today They never led at Miami They never led against Duke until the final shot from Seth Trimble in the game 410en of a second to go but they have never trailed today 18 assists just four turnovers for UNCC which has the best assisted turnover mark in Carolina history right now Trimble has his shot carried away to Dunning It needs a quick basket here probably a three and Dunning wont get it Dixon with his careerhigh seventh rebound applause Carolina in the half course been running a lot of their ball screen motion offense just flowing into it and just continue to move the basketball to take advantage of the switches Right now you got high inside running a lot of isolation right now with Seth Trimble Trimble is fouled He will go to the line for 1 and1 North Carolinas womens team goes to Duke tomorrow on ABC and the ESPN app at 1 Eastern followed by number four Texas A great Madison Booker and Tennessee That Duke Carolina game pointed here where the mens game was a classic The womens game could be a classic as well Duke is 13 and0 in the league right now UNCC is 10 and3 and has won eight straight Carolina women beat SMU Thursday 9442 Their largest ACC win in program history India Navar is a phenomenal player One of the stars at that matchup tomorrow applause Tar Hills are looking to get that out You dont like to say you must win the rank teams You want to put pressure on the Ducas you got to find a way to win that one Duke did not have a great nonconference Has rolled in ACC play The only team to beat Louisville in the league this year Corin turns it over Thats Pits 12th turnover Jeff Cable just hoping to get some healthy bodies soon Hes not going to have Deshawn Jackson or Papakante the rest of the year Brandon Cummings their leading scoreer is a real doubt to return with an ankle injury Its just been one of those nightmare seasons pretty much from the start for Pit which lost a ton from last year lost its big transfer portal edition before he even played a game and theyre going to be two and 11 in the league They are a real doubt right now to even make the 15 team ACC tournament Three teams get left out of the postseason tournament They have a great recruiting class coming in next year and they have hope for the future but this has just been a year where everythings gone wrong for Pit The recruiting of freshman is not the issue The issue for Cable is going to be the financial support and what theyre able to do in the NIL which is just part of college basketball I think you can say that about any team and every team in the league but definitely more so for the Pit Panthers triple at the end of the shot clock Gets his own miss back spins around and he gets fouled applause We dont have public NIL data out there Its believed that Pit is very much in the lower end of ACC programs in terms of NIL Kevin I think teams have to when you start talking about opportunities in a league I think thats how you have to rate where you are in the league to give yourself realistic expectations and coaching does matter but I think the first thing that matter is how much money are you willing to invest in your program And for a couple of years it seemed like Pit had turned the corner They made the tournament three years ago two years ago They were very close Last year Pit got off to this great start They were a top 25 team Started three and 0 in the ACC England just a couple of ACC games the rest of the way They started 3 and 0 They went 5 and 12 down the stretch crashed out the first round of the ACC tournament and theyre getting dropped to 2 and 11 in the league this year One of his recruits is very expensive player that hes out right now but he went to Kentucky And Jaylen Low would have been pit starting point guard again Was last year Final minute of play Louisville and Baylor coming up Mike Brown Jr and the Cardinals were a team with amazing potential Three for Dunning is good Harry Dunning Jr into double figures That Louisville team I think is scary because I think theyre the most dangerous team because they have elite shooting and when theyre knocking down shots they scare anybody applause Matt Kelsey thought that was a team that could make the final four when they got Mike El Brown They havent looked like it much of the year but theyre starting to now If they can get some production out of their four and five spots some consistency look out That team could be scary in the tournament Trible gets the offensive rebound and will pull it out with a shot clock off cheering So North Carolina in its first game without Caleb Wilson and somewhat surprisingly its first without Henry Vessar leads wire towire
