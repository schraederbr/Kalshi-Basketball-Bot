must start with a win today Ryan Cissano will throw it up Eric Lewis and Tony Henderson the veteran officials alongside him And Wake Forest wins the tip The Demon Deacons who had the week off 211 a year ago just out of the NCAA tournament picture 10 and seven and 1 and three in a much improved ACC this year Weeks got two big scorers Cali and Juke Harris who each had 28 in the North Carolina loss on Saturday Heres Omaha Belaloo giving it up for Cal First shot of the game and missed three and grabbed by Florida State and the affformentioned Robert McCrae the fifth who tries to go all the way and leaves it off the rim Chanty Wiggins misses an open three Offensive rebound of the stick back the freshman that is Tomas Bang a young man out of Paris whos really been coming into his own the last couple of games Both teams do a lot of switching Theyre going to switch five sometimes if you smoke to the lineup So youve got to watch the glass Youve got to rebound regardless of position The key match up watching who controls the back Harris misses an open three One change in the starting five for weight Trayvon Spillers for the first time in two years comes off the bench as Martin Somerville rattles in a three Florida States best threepoint shooter at 39 on the year Cooper Schweaker getting the start for Spillers A 610 junior rolls home the two Randolph they need a little more out of Spillers Schwagger is coming off a season high nine and he gets the start and thats why hes in the lineup He gives them the ability to score inside when theyre not making threes or theyre struggling to get going in the game He has the ability to score with his back to the basket Much much needed punch by the Deets McCrae answers with a triple Two straight threes for a Florida State team 30 in the nation in threepoint attempts per game Good sign for a Florida State Simmons group Theyre really aggressive and getting the attempts up Even better when you get them to go down Omaha Belaloo Bricks it cheering Rebound to Alex Dean 69 senior up from D2 Florida Southern You want your guys ready to take shots but Omaha Belaloo is not a great threepoint shooter A little early in the shot clock to take that shot Off the takeaway Calm kicks it Harris hits it A three for the 204 per game score Fourth best in the league Struggled a couple of games ago The last two games been amazing from behind the threepoint line Hes nine of 20 last two games coming in tonight Great look for him Knocks down his first three Florida State 83 points a game seventh in the league Thats because of their pace largely They are a very poor shooting team They started the game three for five and they turn it over music for a second time Luke Ls 35 years old was a point guard I think 20 dial though ran off you think is pretty attractive It is really fun to watch They get up and down but theyre not just on one end of the floor Defensively they throw a lot at you They change defense zone presses man pressing zone to man man to zone They do a lot of switching and a lot of creativity on the defensive end of the floor as he continues with this program Theyre going to be really fun to watch and really fun to play for Theres McCrae 53 of Florida State shots on the year come from three Sixth highest rate in the nation Theres another And McCraes misses grabbed by Harris One adjustment I like the Seminals to see is see they dont get back hit defensively is just take you dont have to force bad shots Theres no theres no shot blockers on either team So instead of taking bad shots get in the paint drive it get to the rim draw fouls and try to finish at the rim when youre not making three 87 off the bucket by Schwagger Hes got four in just his second start of the year McCrae McCut Estee and he draws the first foul of the night Stevie at home Theyre coming off a loss at North Carolina No favors on this schedule in what is a much improved ACC overall It is The league is much stronger and this is almost a must mustwin game for the Deaks If you didnt do yourself any favors early on the schedule didnt help you at all You want to get back in the tournament conversation You got to find a way to get this W on the road Gray hits the freshman again Bong with a three just his eighth of the year And Florida States three for five from deep We saw Vong out early spending a lot of time working on his three ball knowing he get quite a few attempts here early and similar knocked down three threes here early Calm penetrating on a kick out Its Harris in and out in search of his second three Its out of bounds and will stay with Wake Forest Saturday So many close calls and whatifs Theyre looking to boost their resume as the season goes on This is more of a cant afford to lose game for Wake which has been knocking on the door of the tournament for 5 years Count me short of three Thats Nate Counties coming off 28 in the Carolina loss He started 0 for three Wake is three for 10 And FSUs getting great looks as Chanty Wiggins music puts down his first two We talk about the need to be aggressive There are no shot blockers on this court here today get downhill get to the rim force rotations and deliver the pass Trayvon Spillers whos coming off the bench for the first time in a couple of years is fouled on the drive This is what you want to see if your Florida State similarly play a great driving downhill Chanty Wig the beneficiary of that play Get to the rim force rotation find your shooters or drop it off in a dumpster spot for an easy bucket I think thats a recipe for success all afternoon long Wiggins just committed Florida States first foul Heres Cooper Schwagger averaging five and two on the year Schwagger whos got an early four misses Spillers in there for the offensive rebound And thats the aggression they were hoping to see from Trayvon Spillers off the bench Message sent and delivered Spillers was not in the starting lineup for not bringing that type of effort and energy First time on the court Gets an offensive rebound and the putback Le Jones though buries a three over spillers and Florida State has started four for six from deep and another player not their starting lineup for his lack of activity comes out first time he touches it laces up a three so guys responding coaches are sending messages and the guys are understanding whats been said to him theyre delivering here early this three by Drew Harris a 20 and a half point per game scorer Florida State has taken nine shots six from behind in the arc McCrae at the rim too long Spillers with a rebound He sees that Wake is switching five He needs to attack Swagger every opportunity he gets Not always to score Harris into a double cheering Good defense here Bong the freshman went straight up Duke Harris starts just one for five He does a great job of initiating contact that time Was defended well Didnt reach Youve got to defend him without fouling which has been an issue for the Sims Theyve done a lot of fouling The message early turns it over right into the hands of Schweer McCrae in the loss to Syracuse Tuesday had six assists but tied the season high with seven turnovers This is where both teams struggle when theyre in the half court A lot of pressure on these point guards Kyle Niss McCra to fifth to get things going for the team Theyre not against a switching defense It takes out away a lot of your sets and forces you individually to make plays Kobe McGee the Drexel transfer out to Bong in and out Wake has hit just one of its last seven Four for 15 start for the Deaks on the road White doesnt have a lot of guys that score in the offense but Juke Harris does a really good job of not necessarily being a ball screen guy but hes a straight line driver Draws a lot of contact like to get to the free throw line Also their second leading scorer fakes a three Dying moments of the shot clock rejected It was an onrushing 64 McCrae and McGee cannot convert at the other end Former Wake Forest Demon Deacon Robert McCrae the fifth playing for Florida State as Miles Kov hits a quarter three Both teams are trying to get open threes before the defense establishes Great job there by the Deaks running wide getting to the corner and a steal Easy one for Calies who converts it for his first two Its a bad turnover there Problem Craig just careless with the basketball He almost was again Hes already picked up three assists but hes turned around a couple of times in the league Had a couple of close games as well and hes hoping today will be his first day with an ACC win as a head coach Yeah they just find ways to lose games to shoot themselves in the foot Here theyve gotten off to a really good start Theyve shot the basketball well Theyve struggled rebounding on the year and theyve rebounded the ball well but then you get some grenades got four turnovers here early which led to five demon Deacon points All four turnovers in the game committed by FSU Ult for three Two turnovers in the last 3 minutes or so The backup point guard the freshman Cam Miles sees his three grabbed by Le Jones as McCrae the fifth gets a blow for the first time AJ Swinton also barely played of late is into the game Miles again is open and hits it second chance on the possession and his 13th three of the year Thats a great job against the trap as a guard You always love when the big short rose he catches it and turns Twoon one on the backside Puts that weak side defender in a bad position He has to take the cutter leaving the open three takes Harris and Schweer out of the game Missed three by the sophomore Sebastian Aikens is grabbed by Somerville Steen caught it right under the basket Throws it away for the fifth Florida State turnover This is what you want to do against a trap You come off you see you got two defenders against you Turns forces rotation Twoon one in the backside Three ball Florida State Thats when you know as a guard when a traps coming It always helps when that big stops Doesnt roll all the way to the basket Its easy outlet They continue to trap that ball screen and hard hedge I expect the Sims continue to make that adjustment Kai Mason on the floor for the first time His shot wouldnt fall Marcus Marion who hasnt played the last two is in for Wake as well Unusual lineup for Steve Forbes Everybodys on a short leash today And Ste puts it in plus a foul Hard finish for the 69 senior out of Panama City Beach Alex Steen Again we talked about it Now its an empty side ball screen No one to help Marian comes over late Steen takes the contact goes to the line with a chance for an averaged a double double each of the last two years at Florida Southern A great division two school is a wonderful offensive rebounder Fourth in the ACC You shoot this many threes Kevin he does a great job of tracking the ball Its hard to rebound threes because there long shots long rebounds He does a great job of tracking and chasing it down Couldnt complete the threepoint play 2114 Florida State going back to the scores table for Wake has given cheering it two big scorers of late a rest here Where the offense come from for Steve Forbes on a cut Nice finish by Mason whos averaging eight points a game off the bench This lineup has to be solid defensively in the half court They got to rely on execution They dont have that dynamic guard in Kyle Meek that creates and scores in the rhythm hes been playing A lot of space for Swint the 32 threepoint shoot players in the country Great match up in Leach 8 Eastern 7 music Central here at Tallahassee Florida State is 6 for 11 from three And you could tell during the timeout Wake Forest coaching staff cannot believe the looks theyre allowing Theyre chasing right now and they got to make a decision Do they want to switch their reaction and you got to guard the basketball at that point Too much penetration cheering by the seminals leaving wide open shooters and Wake is late on closeouts right now and theyve got to make that adjustment Calm Harris Schweer all back on the floor for Kovven Aikens and Marian Here is Nate Cali Step back three Thats good The first triple tonight for Nate Calmese I think hes the guy I know Chick Harris leads his team in scoring but this team goes as Nate Calmese goes Really good speed with the basketball in his hand He can get his shot whenever he wants And here again in the passing lane the Deiques fourth steel Hes got a couple Thats why these are the teams one and two in the league in steals And you see why theyre never out of it because of that ability And McCraes most frequent connection has been with Cal Mice laughter Hes gave Cal three of his assist Couple of big sixes couple of touchdown throws off his miss Heres Cal Me Got a couple of dunks tonight and a three for his seven Hes got the switch against Steen HE RISES AND FIRES over him Its a seven nothing run for Nate Calse laughter This this game might not have a producer for much longer with your attitude laughter from here I thought I I just thought that you were trying to figure out the most eloquent way to describe Nate Calmise as a dunker He almost had another one He does My goodness The ball is magnetically connected with Cal who sets up Harris who could not give weight its first lead He is doing all he can keep these digs in the game Hes just got to find someone that want to help him out Three of the five steels for a weight team that leads the ACC nine and a half a game Somerville step back in the corner McGee misses Rebound to Juke Harris Calm a transfer from Washington State Put up a donut in their first conference game against NC State Has scored 24 a game since This three is missed by Mason and highpointed by Leger Jones The one advantage that the guards have on both team is identify the matchup Who do you want to attack Florida State you want to attack Steve put him in ball screens and to try to attack him as much as possible Wake Far has to continue for this group right now And again he has it going early Hes going to have to find someone else to step up and help him at some point But right now hes doing all he can to keep the digs in his game Wake Forest needed to tweak the dials after they lost at NC State in the conference opener and Calmese did not score and he said after the Virginia Tech game he was happy his teammates were encouraging him encouraging him to play better They knew they needed more The message was received End of the shot clock McGee misses a deep one thats kicked to Harris who draws a foul against Martin Somerville Just the second of the game against Florida State Look Nate Calmese RC is a real big scorer in his career 15 points a game last year for Washington State You go back three years he started his career at Lamar He averaged nearly 18 a game as a true freshman The only true freshman who scored more in the regular season that year is Brandon Miller And Nick has bounced around a little Lamar Washington Wazu Wake Forest but he can score and he has been scoring for Wake and they think this is more the guy hell be down the stretch in ACC play Well hes the guy that has to be for the Deaks to be successful They want to get back to their winning ways Hes just so critical His ability to create and his speed causes problems with the defense He can just get wherever he wants on the court Only thing that has stopped him is himself His percentages have been great Its not just the last three games To give you an example he shot 47 shots in the last three games You have to go back eight games to get that level of a field goal attempt from him The percentages are identical A higher volume He has been successful and hes open here Misses a three into the Florida State bench Still an eight nothing wake Thats over the last 307 Florida State has not scored a point in the last 326 Now what Nikal Misha is going to have to remind himself is that the other guys is going to need his penetration to get their shots So we still got to be really selective And that was a little bit of a quick trigger considering Florida State is switching everything He didnt identify the right matchup that time Florida State led by Bong with five Eight of their nine players have scored Had it ripped away by Mason Jones leaves it short and Harris rips away his sixth rebound Thats the adjustment both teams have to make Theres no shot blockage You get to the paint Mason breaks a three Here comes Somerville Somerville will take it to the paint Get stripped and fouled on the way up Second and third free throws of the game coming for Wake The foul is the first on Harris Tomorrow afternoon on ESPN 2 and the ESPN app Terrific womens basketball double header Good one in the ACC Number nine Louisville The best team in that league so far at NC State Then a really good game in the SEC LSU and Oklahoma number six number 13 Again its all right here on ESPN 2 and the ESPN app Martin Somerville the sophomore from Buoie Maryland Eric East Rookie of the Year at UMass Lowel a year ago had 18 four for seven threes six for seven at the line in just 21 minutes up at Syracuse Tuesday really good shooter 39 on the year and I think he has a chance to get involved as well in the offense a little bit more than he does Kind of wait for things to happen the ball to find him I think he can identify matchups and attack his growth maybe more defensively for you I think he needs to take a step defensively for this group and some of that is again the major jump jumping up the high major lever Hes not used to the athleticism and the size and hes got to find his way He shoots it better from two than he does from three which tells you hes having a tough time finishing at the rim And that just comes with time and understanding what you can get away with Hit the free throws Florida State back on top Mason sets up Harris A drive by Juke Harris into two seminals And Harris finishes off the window Thats what we talked about Dont settle Hes missed a couple of threes that time Soon as he caught it put his head down attacked the rim Hes always looking for contact Able to keep his balance and finish McCrae almost turned it over again Jones on the drive Jones is denied by Spillers A rare block in this game Trayvon Spiller is probably the best shot blocker on either team at 11 a game Kov rims out a three Every time Wade has had a chance to take the lead theyve missed Thats a good shot though Good spacing Miles Kobe hit his first three from the corner Went scoreless against Carolina So I expect him to be really aggressive here Steen from McCrae Got hit by Kovven and hell shoot two Juke Harris here No hesitation Gets it and goes Could have caught it Shot the three Hes missed a couple of threes here Does a great job of hanging in the air kissing it off the glass He just finds ways of scoring Hes not scoring a ton here early but hes rebounding the basketball And dont worry about him Hell find a way to be productive on the offensive end of the floor Largest scoring increase in the nation 143 points per game more than last year Whats changed for Duke Harris You won the year two A lot of his body Hes filled out You know the biggest jump you take physically in college basketball is your freshman or sophomore year Youve gone a year you understand whats happened Physically grown stronger Hes confident My son came back and he played in a group and he came away and he said Dad that Juke Harris kids a proud His jump reminds me of the same jump and Ive said this before that John Collins made from Wake Fors a game And theyre different players but the production is the same Just physically maturing in their ability to be confident in their adjustments that theyve made in their game FSU meanwhile on a never ending possession Swinton who had an offensive rebound in there breaks a three CM on the run McCrae back to guard him Calmese Kovven Mason got it and Wake Forest has his first lead tonight Another hockey assist there in the sense of mow me to just drive the paint Three guys collapse on him one pass and the second pass and you get a wide open three there by Mai Mason McCrae got the switch on Spillers and finishes through him and Spillers is called for a light foul at the end Has not turned the ball over Wake has also music not taken a free throw An odd statistical start to Randolph Childress is biggest difference right now with the Deaks have been able to create five steals as Huck said and they turned it into 70 run Robert McCrae who finished through contact Trayvon Spillers completes a threepoint play That was the first Florida State field goal in 6 minutes 8 seconds But still have the lead McCrae with an team leading six Wake Forest led by Nate Calse whos got 10 points two assists and no turn Now this is when Florida State get their bag They show you the two3 look You start running your zone offense but theyre really running manto man and teams get stagnant and not as much ball movement Youve got to continue to run your mantoman stuff They got a three from Harris missed and last touch by Wake Forest Florida State you mentioned the rebounding would be a significant number in this game United Neither team is a very good rebounding team Florida State is plus eight and in this fourgame losing streak in ACC play theyve been minus 9 Yes And thats critical for Wake Forest I mean they lost the game to Miami and theyve shot 52 from the field and 51 from three And you hear those numbers and youre like thats impossible But its because they got dominated on the glass and right now we still have 2 minutes and 45 seconds left and theyre down seven on the glass McCrae fifth turnover of the game for the man with the V at the end of his name McCrae the fifth It leads to another touchdown off a takeaway Coven for two And its nine nothing Wake and points off turnovers McCrae has six points three assists and five turnovers He is singlehandedly keeping the Daks in the game with his decisionmaking He has got to be better with the basketball Wiggins clanks a three Offensive rebound down to Somerville Kept alive by the freshman Bassau McCrae feeds Wiggins in the post One dribble Wiggins scores it Good side for Chanty Wiggins put the ball inside No ones doubling Be patient He is 610 He prefers to play facing up on the perimeter but that time showing you he has the ability to score with his back to the basket inside So three years of Clemson for Wiggins Mason set up by Caliss and one week player went for the ball was Harris Easily cleared by Bassan Artist State now plus 10 on the glass and leading by one in the closing 90 seconds of the first half The guards of Florida State Just pick your matchup Not a good shot there Trailer Coven Calm gets up to tip the ball to Mason Hovind again will pass up a three Wake is five for 20 from deep 20 of their 36 shots from three Florida State 16 of their 28 from three Calm with another Thats too deep And Kovven went well over the back of Somerville for his second foul Well its NFL playoff time Its divisional round Tomorrow afternoon the Patriots and Texans will play at 245 ABC ESPN ESPN Deportes the ESPN app If the Bills win in Denver winner of this game will host the AFC Championship next week If the Broncos win the winner of this game will go to Denver Either way Drake May CJ Strat and their respective teams just two wins away from advancing to the Super Bowl You and I have a friend that if the Bills lose hell probably claim New England now as his new favorite team Im just not even going to Im just a friend of ours Thats a mutual friend A mutual friend We have person of interest laughter Any Bills fan who claims New England is his favorite team I would imagine is not a real Bills fan laughter Somerville at the line hits the front end of the one and one Theres Kovven whos the first player with two fouls in the game Florida State which has had trouble at times committing fouls only committed two and a half Gray will take a seat Florida State started the game hot from three and theyre starting to cool off a little bit and want to get to the foul line when you do cool off Great job by Somerville Four of four at the line Somerville nine and a half point per game score has seven Threepoint lead restored for the Nullles who played just about the whole way Got to be pleased if you wait four Youre only down three Youre struggling from behind the threepoint line Youre five of 21 here in the first half 35 for the game and really relying on that young man Nate Kiss She has 10 points two assist here Neither he nor any of his teammates have committed maternal Its helped keep Blake in the game despite the poor shooting Harris tried to shoot it Harris Kiss Harris again one power dribble and he does not get cheering the shot off in time and there is the first turnover for Wake Forest tonight Yeah I think Juke Har didnt see Nate Cal right behind him Great defensive possession there for the Siminals Guys are flying around Thats what you want to see Practice yesterday guys were struggling to communicate on the defensive end Theyve done a really good job here in the first half of being really vocal Its something theyve been challenged on in this first half Theyve answered that challenge New Bucks has talked a lot about that Lack of communication from a new team much better today And McCrae the fifth is back in the game Florida State will try to hold for the final shot Theyve only trailed for a few seconds in this first half and McCrae may have just destroyed a popcorn bucket The leader of soda his sixth turnover of an erratic first 20 minutes That thing had some serious velocity Yeah that was a fast ball there You can you should get him a try out with the Warriors Get him in the camp cheering with that velocity being the four starter Calm me got fouled trying to put up a three from half court Eric Lewis has the foul call Calm me is pleading his case that it should be a shooting foul Its not going to be called one I dont know why Hes got a real argument there Hes in the act of coming off the floor in the shooting motion I think a swift foul I think theres without question And that should be three shots Got it Should have fouled on the other side of half court Now Calmese at the horn off the side of the rim and Florida State for the first time in ACC Got to take care of the basketball to continue to control the pace of this game if they want to find their first ACC win Last made three was AJ Swinton at the 941 mark So what do they do Get a three from the freshman Tomas Bong to start the second He knocked down one in the first half And again great spacing Great catch to shoot Song leads the way with eight Calmise leads the way with a dozen for Wake Forest 5 for 12 Hes gotten very little support though Randol from his teammates What can Wake do to get better shots around Calm in the second half Well guys just got to step up and make shots when the opportunity presents himself Florida State switching everything and so youve got to find a matchup and attack it Offensive rebound McCrae into Bessong Blocked by Schweagger Gets it back Throws it to McCrae into an open C Nobody found him for week Thats what happens when you do a lot of switches sometimes You try to run back to your matchup Just got to identify a guy put a body on a body and defend the basketball Harris only two for eight in that first half for five points Trayvon Spiller starts the second half for Omaha Belaloo And Spillers gets the bucket to go Beloohoo has been playing through a foot injury only four minutes in that first half and did not score McCrae hot puts it to Somerville Cooper Swagger started out playing well and a lot of energy for Trayvon Spillers That is the seventh turnover for McCrae The fifth Harris three good as a trailer Harris buries a triple and once again Wake Forest converts off a Florida State turnover At this point in the game you just tell Robert McCra to fifth just to attack the rim I thought you going to say tell him he doesnt play for Wake Forest Yeah he the transfers couple of years old You you change uniforms You dont play for the black and gold anymore First two years of Demon Deacon Wiggins misses a three Wake Forest has led this game for all of 49 seconds trying to get to two and three in a brutal start in ACC play Brutal in terms of the schedule Spillers from Cal Good finish and Spillers gives the Demon Deakons the lead here early in the second He received a message Hes back to playing with his motor playing hard Hes 67 but when he plays hard and attacks the rim he plays like hes 610 And coach Forbes didnt like the way he had been playing the last few games and did not start the game here this afternoon Harris reaches in for his second foul Spillers is three for three Hes got six and five rebounds Screen and roll here He catches it gets to that left hand and great job there slipping the ball screen Rebounded the basketball His motors turned on and he has to leave it on That is his strength Spillers has a block a steal as well His first game off the bench in two years at Wake Forest after 49 straight starts Le Jones had seven rebounds in that first half Only three points misses a three Spillers not a threepoint threat typically Calm will drive it Industine got the big on him and draws the foul Wake Forests first free throws of the game coming up after nearly 23 minutes You worry about if youre a Wake Forest fan and Nate Calis wearing down here in the second half But great job there identifying the matchup knowing he has Steen Its just an easy crossover drive Gets this to his body there to negate the ability to get his shot block All you can do is foul him at that point and he gets to the line First missed free throw of the game on the first attempted free throw of the game for Wade They dont get to the free throw line a ton typically Kevin hes a 90 free throw shooter Again you start coming up short on free throws cheering And with his usage rate here in the first half and here early in the second half thats what you worry about Thats the start Thats fatigue Missed both 18 of 20 He had missed two all year He misses two on that trip Now some of the members of the seminal sound band were holding up pizza boxes Do they get free pizza because he missed two free throws in the second half Im told no and theyre just holding up pizza boxes for fun Wishful thinking Yeah I mean its Florida pizza anyway so who really needs it Jones laughter short on a three Offensive rebound Somerville spoken like a true New York Thats right laughter Jones will turn it over Calm me was not looking and Miles Culvin nearly crashed into us I thought he was passing to one of us Expecting his teammate to run through the passing lane there as you see a little pepperoni there Is that what Florida pizza look like They try to dress it up as much as you want laughter If there is good pizza in Tallahassee by the way Ill take any recommendations BEST SONG THROUGH CONTACT

you up and put you in a rim when needed Points off turnovers now 143 Randolph This is the largest lead at three for Wake McCrae will cut into it Its the reason Wake Forest is in this game Theyre not playing great but no one creates more turnovers than the way Fors does per game averagewise And its whats the reason theyre leading Coven with a three Hes starting to find his shot after the dunk a possession ago Kovven is the third deak in the double figures and Wake Forest has its first two possession lead tonight But Gray driving stumbling and he throws it away His season highment Theres a

want to hear him talk about basketball Oh you did Even though he had an amazing mind doubt his life his life story Uh just extraordinary Folks can look that up if they dont know what what he went

floor Calm in the lane Knocked off his knee Swinton was in there again only the third Wake Forest turnover Florida State is minus 10 in turnovers plus 14 in rebounds and had a Somerville three for the lead rim out When youre learning how to win you take shots like that because youre trying to ride the momentum of the crowd in a run And had a couple of good possessions there youd like to see

out Five ties 10 lead changes tonight Harris powers in couldnt get it with a right and grabbed by McCrae the fifth The six rebound to go with eight points five assists and eight turnovers And McCrae is fouled Officials will come together to decide if this is a shooting foul or a foul on the floor And its going to be a twoshot foul Hell get the continuation Thats a big play there I thought the foul happened earlier in the contact Great job by Rob McCra to fifth getting it up to the rim forcing the officials to give him two shots Bastard Akens back up point guard with a foul Wake has only made two substitutions in the half Mason for Schwagger and Akens just came in for Cal Sho good for McCrae 64 foul shooter number three 14 games as a freshman of Wake Forest took a red shirt year Steve Forbes said when McCrae came to Winston Salem he could be an all ACC level defender He maybe hasnt quite gotten there but they thought he was a really athletic kid He had a 42in vertical the first summer there which would have been fourth at that years NBA combine He had a 24point game in a scrimmage as a freshman Just didnt quite find a home They had such good guards there Two great years at Jacksonville and hes back in the ACC at Florida State Akens with a finish for Wake at the other side Its a great drive there by Akens initiating contact creating space and finishing there is a wide open Shanty Wiggins catches that pass from McCrae Regrettably he had not yet entered the game And thats McCraes ninth turnover You said 14 games you probably need to add about five or six minutes today Hes passed to the Deaks more than hes passed to his teammates That time he passed to a teammate out of bounds and just bad luck there He sees a teammate out the corner of his eye Unfortunately that teammate was walking to the scorers table New season high nine turnovers Hes had a couple of games with seven equals his career high Culvin cheering way off target on the three AJ Swinton will return for Le Jones Car is 28 from three Eight for 29 And both teams live by the three They die about a three again I think the team that controls the paint meaning getting to the foul line is going to win this game Thats been Florida State Nine free throws made to one offensive rebound Chanty Wiggins No but he will get to the line And appreciative Florida State bench applaud smacks the floor and well salute Wiggins as hell shoot two Great job here Chanty Wiggins usually spends most of his time on a threepoint line facing the floor He is getting in the paint scoring with his back to the basket attacking the offensive glass He is trying to bring the Florida State Siminals home Wiggins 26 for 29 from the line this year cheering Florida State is 10 for 12 today You look at Wakes loss Saturday at UNCC they lost by three North Carolina was 20 of 30 at the line Wake was 8 for 11 so theyre minus 12 Today theyre minus 10 and they trail by three They get destroyed on the glass and thats just ultimately what dooms the digs the inability to rebound the basketball Thats why they didnt start Trayvon Spillers start the game I think hes come in and give them that some activity and this isnt a very big Florida State team Chanty Wiggins is the biggest player and this is a guy that started at the three for the Clemson Tigers a couple of years ago Kulvin putting up a lot of shots in the second half Hes two for seven from three McCrae kind of taking a hit to the head there Grimacing down the floor McCrae needs to put his head down and get in the paint Dont settle and dont try to be a point guard Just get in the paint Sets up Swinton Not a usual threepoint shooter And both Kovven and Harris went for the rebound A discombobulated Wake Forest team down by three with under eight to go Brad Brownell is as good a coach as there is in college basketball and its not really a surprise That is an amazing thought They may not have an allconerence player May have to get one by default if and I will change one thing I will change one thing you said I dont think theres any might about it I think Camboozle will win a national player to I think hes been that dominant Jones misses a three I Im saying might only maybe as an injury hedge as Swinton hits the other side of the backboard Hes about two weeks away from being able to shut down till March and still win the award Thats how good a year hes had And if youre Wake Forest you got to find a way to rebound the basketball And I know its been in Achilles heels You got to get five guys helping you out which means the guards got to crack down and help rebound 5653 Florida State plus 20 just crushing them on the glass and they get a rare takeaway Wake Forest turns it over for just the fourth time tonight Swinton assues a three takes a two and he can make a three Swintons giving this group really good minutes from the bench Not expecting much production from there Almost took the three And again we said it all afternoon long There are no shot blockers Get to the paint initiate contact and finish And worst case scenario get to the free throw line And Florida States doing a little better job of that right now than the Wake Forest Demon Deacons Second foul Mai Mason FSU will be in the bonus the rest of the way as AJ Swinton hits a rare free throw Just nine for 13 on the year Hes got six points four rebounds and a steal in just 13 minutes Florida State just two off of its largest lead tonight Calm Wake Forest has gone absolutely cold Down six with under seven to play and Harris was out of bounds when he caught the ball Wakes trying to manufacture offense I think their best play is just living down with the ball in Nikis hands Try to get a back door cut Shoot Harris steps on the line and a lot of time left to play Hey no need to panic if youre the Deaks but youve got to find a way to stay in front of the basketball and keep this ball out of the paint Jones into the paint Florida State is getting to the rim at will Steve Forbes takes timeout and he walks away as soon as he calls it And Oregon 94 to 25 Miami has better NFL talent on his front line and O line Game is one in the trenches in Alabama I think Kurt Sigetti greatest program building job maybe in the history of the entire sport 150 or so years I got Thats a Disney movie Thats a Disney movie Somebodys going to do a show Yes it is And whatever actor plays Fritz signetti will have to do an audition without smiling Wake Forest meanwhile down by eight They havent scored in more than three minutes We are in the danger zone in terms of the Demon Deacons trying to avoid a loss And thats not the offensive possession you were looking for if youre a Wake Forest fan Coming out of a timeout you get a heave three as a shot clock running down And right now with this matchup I expect McCrae to get to the rim at minimum throw foul here against surprisingly kicked it out Jones elevates over Harris Midrange contested two Not a good possession at the end for Florida State which has scored 18 points in the paint out of 27 total in this second half Get a coachs challenge here Luke LS will challenge the out of bounds call He has three timeouts with which to play If you win the challenge you keep your timeout you get one more challenge If he loses the challenge challenge out of bounds on the floor Loses the timeout So pretty lowrisisk time to do it up by eight three timeouts 538 to go Wake struggling on the offensive end right now Gives him a chance to draw something baseline out of bounds play Felt really comfortable That was really quick to go to the coachs challenge Happened right in front of the bench Looks like its off Spillers left foot Did I see that correctly the left foot of Fremont Phillips Oh didnt touch his foot Whose hand does it touch last Wiggins is in there with Swagger I think I saw it called Swingers right Swiggers right hand I think its a good challenge Eric Lewis Tony Henderson and Ryan Cissano are our officials 6153 Florida State with the lead Seminals only lost by four at home to Duke Hung in there at Syracuse on Tuesday before falling by eight Lost to North Carolina by 13 Got destroyed by NC State a couple of games ago looking for their first ACC win and the officials trying to see if theres enough to overturn the call on the court and the call on the court is off of Florida State But they had a a reckoning just a week ago Lost 11369 to NC State One of the worst ACC performances in school history Completely changed the starting lineup at Syracuse Played well offensively but gave up 60 shooting today Wake Forest is shooting just 40 Heres the rule book for the coachs challenge Lets see what the officials have determined After video review the call is inconclusive The call stands Florida State will lose their timeout and have one challenge left Well Florida State should have no challenges left because the call stands Just clean that up from Eric Lewis So Florida State will lose its challenge and lose its second timeout Had that been called off of Wake Forest it would have been enough to overturn that the other way Still have two timeouts left and Florida States extending their pressure Theyve really struggled this year defensively as Eric Wner and Paul Ryano together What What have you liked about Florida States defense tonight They havent switched as much as I thought they would do I think theyve done a really good job of just being solid Their switching has bothered Wake Force and theyre making Wake Forest on onedimensional and thats why Wake Force is struggling on the offensive end Theyre switching everything So its forcing Nate Cal Me just to create everything The officials apparently were taking another music look Steve Forbes cant believe it Okay so Tony Henderson just said theyve got another angle that hit the back of one of the league players leg Yeah thats what I saw originally and Im not blind after all I was able to see that one but yeah I thought it was off Trayvon Spurs After fur further review successful challenge off black leg white ball on the baseline right And they get a timeout back understand Steve Forbs frustration The call was made and then it was a review after the review Luke Lou pats Eric Lewis on the shoulder It does look like the officials got the call right It was just a long and winding road to lead to that door So Florida State with the ball with three timeouts and an eightpoint lead Gray to fifth Jones three Not even close And Florida State ends up giving it up on a missed three And no harm no foul Ball back to the Deaks Blake Olfords last three from three two turnovers has not scored in more than four minutes Calmese is 5 for 12 Is 5 for13 Harris is 4 for13 Someone else will Forest has to step up right now and make a shot Calm in the lane short follows his miss Schwagger was on the ball with Bong and Schwigger draws the foul Its only the third against Florida State Tomas Pongs second Swagger was active early on the offensive glass scoring inside early for the Deaks The issue theyre having with him is on the other end of the floor Florida State seeking him out and theyre driving him putting the digs in rotation but hes been really active on the offensive end of the floor Seven straight for the seinals Kovven against the bigger Wiggins Kovvin will try to take him to the rim gets the contact as Basson came over to help Bass commits his third foul and Kovven will shoot two Miles Coven or Mai Mason or Juke Harris One of these guys when theyre in the game from the wing spot has got to help Nate Calme Sings create offense because Spillers and Swiggers need their aggressiveness and they dont have to settle behind the threepoint line Shoot threes drive it get to the rim finish with your size If not get to the free throw line An 80 free throw shooter has hit both free throws in the game cheering Lets see if that gourmet pizza could distract another Wake Forest player Despite the looming pepperoni Coven makes it a sixpoint game 440 to play Jones with Wiggins Bang McCrae and Swinton Not a lineup youve seen much from Florida State this year McCrae misses an early shot clock three WIGGINS PUTS IT UP AND IN CHANTY Wiggins has dominated at the rim A rare show of low post dominance from the senior from Atlanta Chanty Wiggins is having himself a second half Hes keeping Florida State in this game Hes controlling the glass finishing inside known as a stretch big Most of his damage is done on a perimeter shooting threes or driving it but hes been a force inside Just 15 points in 55 minutes over the last two games Hes got 13 tonight and this is the largest lead of the game for FSU Were at goal time here if youre a Wake Forest fan Problems again its got to have a lot of pace within our offense but where do they go This is where I think they get predictable and its really Nate and Calmise for two there Only his third and fourth points the second half And I mentioned to you in the first half I was worried about him wearing down They were so heavily relying on his usage rate and we need someone else to step up Song No Chased down by Wiggins over the shoulder and theres a foul against FSU to send it the other way Wake Forest has had they played a very very difficult music schedule to start conference play and they are also close to giving Luke LS a conference win They have theyve come out today theyve been the more desperate team and it hasnt been pretty As you just talked about at the break theyre one of 22 in their last three point shots And usually you wouldnt expect to pull away from a team but when you dominate them on the glass and youre plus 21 in rebounding affords you the opportunity to make Wake Forest play nearly perfect basketball to get a win here in these last three minutes You mentioned the predictability of Wake which has gotten really stagnant offensively Harris on a kick Calms got a good look and missed a three Offensive rebound Kovvin is double teamed finds Schweagger whether he intended to or not Schweagger steps through and cheering a very late whistle is called Eric Lewis has a foul which will send Schwagger to the line A weight got bailed out of another offensive set destined for nowhere And that is a good call And theres Steve Forbes over there working for his groups Hes fighting As you can see there the call is made and hes like Hey relax Steve I got it I got the call Little bump on the elbow from McCrae Schwagger hits the free throw A lot of time left in this game And again youre awake Keep clawing Keep fighting cheering Both teams struggled in moments like this with goto guys for Siminals Robert McCrae the fifth has not played a great game from a decisionmaking standpoint and the balls going to be in the point guards hand and I think hes had that mismatch a couple of times with Swigger and hes been unable to attack coming off the ball screen been indecisive here look at the pass every time McCraes pass knocked away with a steal with a finish 6461 McCrae has a rather Igninius double double 10 points 10 turnovers Yeah unfortunately hes had most of his assists to Nate Cowies for pick six touchdowns Hes just got to erase all of that and just get to the rim Right now hes trying to get the ball out of his hands Puts a lot of pressure on this guy Chanty Wiggins to figure it out Bullied his way in the paint again A lot of contact and finally Kovan is whistled for a foul Well dont forget the national championship game Monday night ACC Network has a can win their first title in two and a half decades Wiggins 10 of his 14 points in the second half and a careerhigh 22 against Duke a couple of weeks ago And Chanty makes this a fourpoint lead with one to come at the line Right now Wiggins is really controlling this game and trying to bring it home for Florida State for Wake Forest again No need to panic but someone else besides Nate Cummies has got to step up here Look for Juke Parish to be that guy 6661 cheering has struggled mightily in the half court all day Kise got the switch on Wiggins He steps back over the big and he clanks a three Its grabbed by Spillers for a reset Under two to go Harris determined to get to the rim And Harris whos shooting eight free throws a game will take his first free throws of the night with a minute 55 remaining Thats the great part about his game when hes not making shots he uses his 67 frame to get to the rim initiates contact and gets to the free throw line And credit Florida State for defending him well 15th the nation 78 attempts a game His first free throw tonight goes Foul was the third on McCrae Florida State will bring Somerville back in for Swintville Lake Forest has hit six straight free throws after Calmys missed their first two of the game cheering and they get seven 6663 We thought it would be a highscoring close game Its been one of those Bulls have the laughter ball with a minute 50 left Try to get Wiggins in the paint again or look somewhere else I think you have to because McCrae has been a little gunshy with his turnovers and hes not as aggressive coming off Hes just driving a pass Hes driving to get contact here and he misses the bunny after Kovven hit the floor 90 seconds to go Wake can tie it with a three Yet another close game in a season filled with him for the Demon Deacons Caris just get in the paint Use your size Harris fouled by Jones Harris shot two on the last possession and Wake is in the bonus Question is is this a twoshot foul on the floor for a one and one Its going to be a twoshot foul Tony Anderson signals cheering So Juke Harris a 77 shooter will shoot two Or it was a oneonone actually beg your part it was a one and one And Harris will now get the second Florida State is going to use it second I think his usage rate is so high he wears down and last two possessions its been Juke Harris who is their leading scoreer in 20 a game whos been rather quiet here all night but he has been really loud here getting to the free throw line and making free throws Wake has hit nine in a row 6665 no field goals in the last 310 for Florida State McCrae five assists 10 points 10 turnovers guarded by Kovven Its a back from Somerville Yeah its going to be a twoman game between he and Chanty Wiggins And he got fouled by Spillers One and one here Its not necessarily an awful foul though Its not what Wick wanted to do McCrae is just a 64 free throw shooter He is three for three tonight Thats what this games going to come down to And He had a little bit of fatigue a little gunshot Team both teams switch a lot of actions Put a body on a body Its going to be on these guards to get downhill draw fouls or finish at the rim Former Wink Forest Demon Deacon swishes the first I think thats been problem with some of his turnovers I think hes been so aggressive so wanting to make the perfect play against his former team cheering And you saw from the kid there Florida State has gotten to 67 on the scoreboard So it looks like a juggling act among all the young fans 6865 McCrae five for five at the line tonight FSU by three One minute to go Right Forest again Run your sets Keep your spacing Find a way to get the ball in Juke Harris hands when they cali making a play Calvin CME is going to drive it on Bassan Got it knocked away and he was fouled So a one and one was the ninth Florida State foul and Nate Calm will shoot two Wake does an unbelievable job and when they pass the ball away they move away from the basketball Defensively everyone is taught to jump to the basketball A lot of zoom action throw it right back to that point guard or that defender at the top and hes cutting away and creates space and they are able to get downhill Its the fourth foul on McCrae Calmise missed his first two today MISSED ANOTHER BUT SPILLERS GETS THE REBOUND CALM Spillers only hit two threes on the year Doesnt want to take it The switch with Wiggins Calm into the paint Got warded off Only eight to shoot Its Nate Calmese way short from three Culvin gets it to Schwagger and its a onepoint game Steve Forb screams for a timeout and Wake gets it with 241 And how quickly Randolph do they foul here You got a chance to establish a defense try to music get a trap and rotate first Plenty of time left Its only a onepoint game You go for the steal If you dont get it you dont you dont get a good trap then you foul cheering Wiggins can move here after the made basket Only one timeout into McCrae to fifth He gets trapped Dribbles out OF IT THROWS IT LONG AND MCCRAE has turned it over for the 11th time And Wake Forest has the ball with 18 to go in a world of time Got the trap we talked about You did not have to foul So much time left Perfect scenario for Wake Forest possession and Wake Forest has dominated the offensive glass the last couple of minutes They have the last five rebounds of the game Four offensive rebounds Drew Carris is going to inbound it Calm Spillers Coven and Schwagger Florida State with Bong McCrae Swinton Jones and Wiggins A lengthy lineup cheering Heres Calm 10 to go Calm against Jones PUTS UP THE SHOT AND GETS IT TO GO WAKE FOREST IN FRONT Florida State with timeouts remaining McCrae will call one across midcourt with 48 to go Nate Calmese late game heroics again and Wake has the lead with under five Plenty of time here and they have court to get wherever you want to get I think you try to go as soon as you get it giving your teammates enough time to go to the offensive glass in case you miss Someville will inbound Florida State has a timeout remaining Its into McCrae The ball is in his hands The former Demon Deacon GETS IT BACK HIS SHOT NO GOOD AND WAKE FOREST somehow someway survives the Seinals for a onepoint road win
