you in the white pine bluff in the black alltime matchup number eight between the programs and Brian Burton Im John Little We are ready to go SMU coming off that 8785 victory over Butler holding off the Bulldogs in the end Pine Bluff is playing game six of 11 straight on the road to start the season And See Yiku takes the pick and roll feed from Poopy Miller for two Yeah beautiful design play to get their big man an easy basket to start this time Ly Miller coming off that careerhigh 12 assists last time out for Pine Bluff The Golden Lions their starting lineup Alex Morosini along with Jaquan Scott Milan Charles Keon Williams and Trayvon Payton A really talented group for Solomon Boseman They just dont have much depth right now Theyre trying to get some guys back from injury Yeah feels like this is his best group as far as talent Feels like he has all the pieces that they need to do the job they want to do finishing at the top of the conference and having a chance to make a tournament run And one of the dudes that can do it is Jaquan Scott who actually was 20 of 20 from the free throw line this season before that miss but hes been at big time programs music like Mississippi State in his career Yeah one of the top Jo players in the country coming out of Salt Lake Talented young man coming home to Dallas Played at Mansfield Timberview and definitely look to have a good homecoming Yeah a couple Dallas kids on this roster Meanwhile for SMU this starting five averages 70 points a game Out of the corner the threepointer does not go down for Deron Pierre Jr who had the gamewinning layup last time out against Butler You see early both teams wanting to play fast get out in transition The question is who can slow the other team down Pierre Jr out to the corner to Poopy Miller slides into a three and Mirini tracks it down Hes from Arlington just about 20 minutes away Golden Eagles giving a little bit of trouble with their zone that theyve started in defensively And theyve had some games this season as that one gets thrown away where theyve hung around for the first half of games against teams like OU and Washington and Vandy as well Solomon Boseman a longtime coachs son and a great player in his own right at Arkansas Little Rock uh back in the day Yeah Led them to the dance was a big time player himself and is in year the year for him where he wants to turn the corner with this Golden Eagle squad Yeah Fifth year Is is that normally a big year for a young coach Yeah absolutely I mean he talked about it with us in our conversation just his growth and patience and having more patience with the young man He has the buy in and the belief and that patience helps him get through and make the run when they need to Young man from Arkansas back in Arkansas as a division one head coach as cutting to the rim Jeron Vier Jr after 17 and a half a game heads to the line for two Yeah one thing about a great scorer which is what this young man is is being able to get fouled And speaking of great scoring Salman Boseby was one of the best players in the Sunb Belt Conference when he led Arkansas Little Rock to the T tournament under Steve Shields No he was absolutely outstanding and was the Sunb Belt Conference student athlete of the year as a senior and then honorable mention allAmerican Hes a dude that could get uh to the free throw line Averaged almost 17 a game as a senior Yeah as he would talk about with the players he likes to recruit He was a dude himself and hes got a team full of some guys that he feel like can be dudes His big mission this year with this team is like many teams in the country is getting them to play together You have so much uh accumulation of talent and everyones trying to prove how good they are He wants them to prove how good they are together by making extra passes and being a little more disciplined music on offense Doesnt matter who you are Both teams having trouble finding the range finding the cup early on but a three to one lead for SMU Take a look at the keys to the game tonight as SMU and Arkansas Pine Bluff get together Well you can see just slowing down this SMU offense is going to be a big key And there you see a good execution offensively for Pine Bluff They need a 40minute edge Coach Boseman talked about they played well in Spurs They need to do it for the full game And for SMU they must dominate the paint 62 points in the paint last time out And a defensive focus from start to finish is what coach Infield wants to see DJ Edwards adding more threepointers to his game this season and looking for his shot Thats a big difference for the senior Knocked away by Miller out front Loose ball Yiku pounces for SMU Yeah SMU scoring about 26 or so points a game in transition Didnt look to take it that time but so dangerous when theyre able to get steals to lead to those fast breaks Both teams high pace teams SMU getting out in transition a little bit more this season Miller stares at one instead Cuts to the glass Theres nobody there to help Its a goalend And it went in anyway for Buffy Miller Well what you saw right there was a great example of what not a lot of players understand That tempo and the pace He went slow to fast Most of the time you see young players wanting to go fast to faster and he just showed you a del to an exhale Yes I did say that He slowed down so he could speed up and got the wide open layup SMU coming with some threequarter court pressure turnover those Golden Lions early on Trayvon Payeyton was the first man to hit the three for Pineluff He was a D2 outside bomber for Limestone University music before the university closed and he had to transfer and he found a home in Pine Bluff Milan Charles out of France with a reverse Yeah good job executing Thats one thing Coach Bowman wants to see More patience less turnovers and poor shot selection Cant get any better shot selection than a wide open layup and bluffs showing some trapping zone defense as this one gets knocked away from cement Yiglu and music it stays right here with the Mustangs Andy Anfield secondyear music head coach at SMU 28 and 11 in his two seasons 11 wins shy of 300 in his career when you go back to G Coast USC and of course here at SMU Cory Washington best defensive player that SNU has had early this season leans in and you could dream up the glass inside Yeah Again where they want to do their damage is in the paint Drives post ups offensive rebounds in transition Golden Lions not bad size especially for a slack team but they just dont have anybody that can match up with Yukatu at 72 Taquan Scott they want him to get in the paint forcing his way in And Washington always thinking rebound pulls it down for SMU Illu trying to do his work early against Scott Keeps it alive but Trayvon Payeyton comes out with a boy Yeah a lot of contact there Re letting them play both ways Something coaches often like to see not letting guys get in early foul trouble SMU did not get off to a great start against Butler last time out Little better this time as this one ricochets off the rim for Scott And out the SMU Mustangs leading into a 10 to6 lead early on Arkansas glove Standard They want 16 assists But if they get 20 great If they get 10 though that means theyre not sharing the ball spacing the floor and moving the ball the way they want to So that assist column is definitely something to look out for for tonights game Brian Yes it is And there was an assist right there out of a timeout which coaches love to see the concentration of players being able to take whats coming from the huddle and put it on the floor Yeah Mitchell Holmes scoring again He is 11 of 13 from the floor early this season You know where hes going to get his shots and he normally is going to make them at three Kums off and Kyle Brown big rebounder inside able to bring it down for the Golden Lions Ball throw it away out top Boopy Miller all over it along with Miracini and its jump ball Its going to stay right here with the Golden Lions Yeah had a great conversation with Holmes during shootound and he talked about how much he grew not only physically adding about 18 to 20 pounds from his freshman year where he red shirted music to now just having more comfortability having a better IQ for what the system is and understanding what coach expects and learning how to use his physicality to be productive Yeah look at BJ Edwards getting in that passing lane knocking it to himself and setting up Pierre Jr from out top to right in a triple Yeah hes been awesome since hes been in the starting lineup Led the team last game in rebound and one of the things that coach really was challenging him on to be better and he has stepped up to the challenge especially in the second half Last game comes up short Yeah Andy Enfield said there was no D in Jeron Pierre There was no rebound in Jeron Pierre in the first half but second half he looks so much better at all the things we want him to do Sam Walters the ultimate stretch four nails one out of the corner This Pine Bluff music team can be susceptible Threepoint drizzle But Andy Enfield said after the Butler game you know we are not a threepoint hungry team this season What were hungry for is we want to get to the rim We want to put pressure on the rim We want to get to the free throw line this season Thats what theyve been doing a great job of Well when you come into a game knowing that SMU has scored 62 points in the paint the last game youre going to try to clog the paint So those threepoint shots get more and more open because of that Pierre Jr another three No this one rims out And in addition to that for SMU theyre top 25 in the nation when it comes to free throw percentage and free throw makes as well Walters had the rebound He goes down hard Is it stolen away from him The layup is good And one And there is some concern as well for Walters Went down with a noncont issue here It looks like hes in a lot of pain Hopefully its nothing serious Definitely Uh yeah Ankle Yeah You hope its just a sprained ankle but after he played so well in his early minutes making that open three youd like to see him be able to ride that momentum but unfortunately got a little bit of an injury and like you said hopefully not too serious Keon Williams able to take advantage of it Yeah its just tough to see and great to see him get back to his feet The way that ankle rolled it really took a turn Literally No thats what Im saying Have you ever done that before yourself Oh dude When you used to play dude was that a part That was the That was the injury I always have When you played When music I played When did you play Every time You know up to like five music six years old something like that No Im just kidding Im just like pick up in college Thats what I would always do I mean that counts That counts It does It does Keon Williams not able to knock down the free throw but Williams with a great start to his career at Pineluff averaging 16 and eight coming into the ball game That would have been a new one A five sixyearold getting an ankle I know that would have been a new one I like that music Its going to stay right here with SMU as you Lewis back in for great early work by Mitchell Holmes And you think about Mitchell Holmes you know you got this big SMU freshman class right The everybodys touting top 10 in the nation Uh some people think its tighter than that And then you get Mitchell Holmes as well who red shirted last year to even add to that youngster lineup Miller dashing through two to set it up to the corner to a freshman in Davis Ray But BJ Davis Ray misses over the top Yeah Second chance would also be in that same category as a young man who red shirted last year and has a chance to be a part of that 12 minutes left in the first half SMU by 10 Ripping around the corner Milan Charles out of France Murosini fade away from the short corner Doesnt pull Pulled down by Nigel Walls for SMU Little bit of razledazzle right there from Pierre Some similar to what we saw in that gamewinner last game Outside Romel Lloyd junior transfer out of Long Beach State Started his career at Nebraska is in Spot up in the corner by Milan Charles falls off the rim and SMU has a chance for some run out points No numbers Miller pulls it back and weve got another man down for SMU Its Yigolu for the Mustangs So when they look at the SMU big man step away as well caused it to become undury So the Mustangs going to be a little bit young inside a little thin inside without Jaden Tombs until next week Uh going with some younger players inside there as Ron Pier Jr music can certainly fill it up and has six already Nice flashing play inside but Scott waiting for the skies to clear Not able to lay it home Yeah really good execution for the back screen to get Scott the open look Just kind of rims out the last minute SMU takes away the rebound Some really good defense on Pierre turning inside Holmes hits the baby hook He continues to produce Yeah he talked about that as well in my conversation with him He said I know what my goto moves are I have about three things I know I look for and when I can get to those I feel good about it Miracini can really shoot it from outside Not able to knock that one down A former D2 guy who is in his first year on a full scholarship What a great story Pierre out of the corner Another three for Don Pierre Jr And another timeout called by Solomon to be perturbability That is a huge thing not only for broadcasters but also basketball players Well theres inperturvable satuity again Hell head to the line to shoot a couple Yeah Again there those quick decisions as soon as he catches it puts it on the floor to attack Able to draw the foul against two defenders I believe thats Juan Jaquan Scott second foul which would be big for SMU cuz they can get one of the best players on Arkansas Pinels front line to have to probably sit for the rest of the half Theyre going to be nice to him Theyre going to go ahead and get foul on Payton instead which is his first Still there is a line change awaiting for Arkansas Pine Bluff Its Don Pierre Jr who had the gamewinning reverse layup with 4 seconds left on a second chance opportunity for SMU against Butler over the weekend to make the Mustangs 4 and0 hits one of two Well his confidence just continues to grow in coach infield system Yes he was a top four scorer in the country last year player of the year from C USA coming over to SMU and early on wasnt playing as efficiently as he is now but starting to play some outstanding ball in this system and started the last three games after coming off the bench for the first couple Miracini I love his game He is unflapable The 510 senior out of Arlington Yeah amongst the trees not afraid Great finish Washington speaking of not afraid to get inside Hes fouled by Trayvon Payeyton Yeah just the athleticism and body control in the air Great finish at the rim Again coach Boseman loves the talent on this team Just working to put it all together for consistent stretches And meanwhile Mr consistency Washington has been really music just outstanding in his play here at SMU Mr Double Double elite on the glass elite in the winning plays category and has lived at the rim Again always on time Yeah one of these guys that is helping SMU at the free throw line He gets there a bunch and he knocks him down music Hes 90 at the line this season Yeah averaging right about 14 and seven Again just Mr Consistency does a little bit of everything and his shoe game is on fire tonight He brings the juice in every respect See if the Golden Lions can get things going offensively down by 18 early Theyve been able to score at times this season Nice job to hang in the air by Mirosini That extra little beat gave Scott time to break free Yeah I tell you what this is the smallest lineup that weve seen from SU this season playing virtually all guards Five guards on the floor a lot more speed and athleticism on the floor Not as much height Speaking of athleticism Jermaine ONeal Jr gets the fall away jumper to go down Jermaine ONeal Jr about 7 in shorter than his dad The tallest guy on the floor right now is Chance Courier at 67 Threepointer fired off by Miracini and the rebound knocked out Last touch by SMU Golden Lions have a lot of different guys who can run the point including Keon Williams who Solomon Boseman really compares to Marcus Smart Metroplex guy from Marcus High School but of course has made his name in the NBA with his defensive exploits But Keon Williams on the offensive end gets it done here to put full weight on his ankle here And we can see that hes obviously now better now out for the Mustangs playing on the floor again Now that things going to swell I can tell you right now but but right now is the best time to go ahead and stay out there Keep the blood pumping on it Couple free throws on the way here But uh good to see that it wasnt a severe injury for Sami Gatola music I mean you can see the look on coach Enfields face when that injury happened hoping as he should that his big man was not in any serious arms way as they already have Jaden Tombs a heralded recruit one of the top recruits to lace it up has not had a chance to lace it up just yet and then you have Sam Walters who got injured in his game as well who looks like he will not be back with ice on his ankle a little bit long yeah right now theyre waiting on Tombs to get medically cleared hes been working through a wrist injury I think hes about a week away and hes going to add something special to the front line for SMU when hes back Williams around the freshman ONeal Couple extra passes Its back to Scott Hes got a really special play at 68 An inside out guy Offensive rebound by Charles Sticks it out for a threepointer Hayes not able to knock it down Roosey Miller 23 and 12 last time out Its Edwards who has a couple 20point games this season New career highs Illu slapped at Hes able to hold off Scott Back to Miller Kicks it out to the corner Germaine ONeal Jr comes up short Yiglu fouled And theyre going to get it on Jquan Scott 15 foul on Heimblock Yeah Yugato is so good on the defensive glass when hes in great position like that and drawing these little fouls to get closer to the bonus Something again they shoot they make 23 free throws per game SMU does right now So always a threat to be on the attack and that physical play pays off for them to get to the line when theyre in the bunks Hope to get there as soon as possible Fine Bluff will let him underneath Edwards runs into consternation Triple team Miller able to slap it right back The shot clock never reset Finally its cleanly stripped by Lloyd and Washington comes back with another swipe Loopy Miller transition triple Its Bottoms for BJ Edwards Yeah BJ Edwards playing good basketball as well shooting it well from the three Again this is a threepoint shooting game that you love to have these games as you keep building confidence in this season of having games where you make threes because theyve already proven how well theyre going to be able to do things in the paint So if that confidence can grow from the threepoint line and beyond the arc this SMU highpowered offense music that averages right at almost 90 a game gets even more high power Yeah last year they were really good threepoint shooters and its not like they looked for a lot of volume in threes They did hit eight a game but they were at 38 from three That was 21st in the NCAA this year Not quite at that type of clip Well the thing about it is you just need the timely ones You need to be able to have with confidence as you can see You know theyre shooting 30 right at 35 34 Not as high of a percentage but if you can make consistently the right threes it makes their inside attack even harder to guard Still no trouble scoring for this team early this season 88 12 points per game Shooting 57 from the floor so far Pinluff has been limited to 32 shooting Long possession here and a misguided pass by Kyle Brown Mhini could not save it in Well Pineluff has controlled the possessions well and coach was talking about wanting to improve the shot selection They havent taken a lot of bad shots They just have had a hard time finding ways to score against this SMU defense so far Thats one place that coach Infield wants to continue to see his team improve is on the defensive side of the ball And one of nine from three so far is Pine Bluff Pierre rear miss from deep Williams Payton back outside Williams cars out the three Thats the right shot Those are the shots coach Boseman wants to see from his team Just rims out and you want to keep getting a steady diet of that kind of quality Miller not often guarded by a smaller player Goes to the dirt fade away doesnt fall But how about Deron Pierre Jr on his pogo stick Okay it doesnt fall but hes after the offensive glass He grabbed the D board at last time up Hes getting out there and rebounding And this is something that people talk about with player development Sometimes you think its only with freshman that come along over the course of a career or a young player Well you could see the development Obviously the talent is there but part of development is the buy into a role and getting a player to increase his game in areas that he hasnt typically done in And Pierres rebounding is one area that SMU has been able to get the development to pay off Well a little bit of a a moment of laps for Cory Washington there I think he was fearful it was going to be an over and back and so he picked the ball up traveled with it So it is a turnover Lets see what happened here Yeah one of those moments where this young man doesnt make a lot of mistakes like that Just probably just misunderstood the moment It seems like thinking that it was a back court Its only the third giveaway on SNU in the first half The Golden Lions have only turned it over six times SMs defense has just been really stingy today making it really tough on Pine Buff to get the quality of shot they have I mean thats a tough three right there Boopy Miller going after the rebound Its tracked down by Scott No look feet inside Williamsu is in the air and now hes on the ground Give him a minute Give him a minute Hes 72 I think it was probably more scary than it was an actual you know just like Im glad that wasnt worse Let me just relax for a second Its like chopping down a Christmas tree laughter Yeah You dont want to see your big man 72 up in the air on a shot fake like that Thats where coach is probably going to tell him Hey just keep your feet on the floor and wall up I dont want to see you do that ever again We need you for the rest of the season big fella So Yigatu 12 points eight rebounds a game this season and shooting 51 from the floor Yes the foul was on him music Andy Enfield seeing his season flash before his eyes a couple times here in the first half Keon Williams from Jonesboro Arkansas Originally started his career at Oklahoma State Couple productive years moved on to Abene Christian and Now here to Pineluff and you can definitely see the pro potential in Keon Williams Hell be making music money playing basketball somewhere Well the part about this offensive possession is when you cant score you need to get to the free throw line They were able to get one out of two but havent been able to score in the last four minutes from field goals As a team this season theyre only shooting 37 from the floor Thats just not great But they have been playing some really good teams Boopy Miller two feet in the paint out to Pierre Jr lines it up just off to the left but skying in and not reward rewarded for it was Edwards Here comes Williams Fleet of FOOT DROPS it off for Charles the Frenchman for two Timeout SMU Yeah that shows the transition that the Golden Eagles want to be able to play like havent been able to do it much but good that either know him or know his dad along the way and those connections run deep as he helps build his team in Pine Block Yeah a guy that grew up in the gym Nice finish there by the big man inside But yeah young young man whos now growing in his own head coach experience and dad was a division one assistant as well and has been around So the relationships that are able to be cultivated like you said between the two of them and the and the Boseman last name and what that means uh is everything in the state of Arkansas What about the respect for lower level type of basketball like division 2 programs with the fact that his dad coached in division 2 You got Mirrosini hes a division two guy as Ricky Miller knocks down a three Youve got another division 2 guy in Trayvon Payeyton stepping up and starting this season as transfers for the Golden Lions Well I think you just understand the level of uh play that happens at that level You know hoopers if you can hoop you can get it done It doesnt matter what division is next to your name and coach understands that well SMUs got a lot of talent on this end as you forces his way inside And hes going to be called for an offensive goalendu thought that one was headed off Lets see Im actually surprised that he didnt get called for the foul Theres a lot of contact as he goes up for this Jucoin Scott you mean Yeah Yeah Andy Enfield agreed with you Yeah Im also a little surprised that offensive goalend it was on its way out He maybe could have waited a maybe another half a second but close call But I love the way the big man when he gets deep position like that I say this often watching him play the deeper position he gets the better he is at just being able to go up and finish Tan Hayes they love this kid Three star recruit out of Hot Springs Hes a future star Just a freshman Wears number two for the Golden Lions Miller looks offu instead Pierre from the corner Cant get the bounce Its kept alive and out last touched by the white shirts of SMU Yeah more threepoint shots going up in this half than typically even in the game 17 threes already attempted by SMU Yeah SMUs season high was 18 in their opener Yeah here you see them letting it fly with confidence shooting the average of 35 which is what theyre shooting on the season got off to a hot start cooled off a little bit and a few have rimmed out but love to see that confidence of letting it fly that way Edwards knocks it into THE BACK COURT EDWARDS BLOCKED FROM BEHIND BY KEON WILLIAMS Catch and SHOOT THREE MAROSINI OH WHAT a play Thats a small example of what Coach Boseman hopes this season will look like as they keep getting better The defense on one end thats a highlight leading to transition three Nothing much The bottom of the net My goodness those are two athletic guys going at it Edwards getting blocked by Williams but Yeu just too muscly inside again Deep position Doesnt matter if you double team him or not Love the decision and the patience and going up strong Less than a minute to go in the first half SMU by 18 Scott playing with a little more pace Hits Mirisini Wings it outside Lloyd 17 ft away drops it in Lloyds been out but really adds size and playmaking ability now that hes back in the lineup Edwards lost the three and hits Thats his third of the first half Hey letting it fly You said it 18 is the high on the season for Tips They now are seven of 18 for 39 in the first half in this one taking what the defense has given him in this one Heinluff playing with fire and SMU having no trouble Two seconds left in the half Williams gets it off in time and knocks it down They count it on the floor Theyll review it but it looks like it Uh I would expect SMU to have continued open threes because again the 62 points in the paint is what they do best You want to keep them doing something that they dont do well So taking away the paint is not the wrong thing You just cant give wide open threes when you do take away the paint Its going to be fumbled out of bounds by Eigull but the last to touch it Jaquan Scott Meanwhile on the offensive end for music Golden Lions who would you like to see in the pick and roll if coach wants to see more of that Well I think the thing for the Golden Lions they have to get inside the ark more and share the ball to go back outside So now you have rotations going for SMU They pretty much kind of played inside the arc or outside and the inside hasnt been distributing Its kind of been more in the oneonone aspect Little bully ball there for Washington against the much smaller Mirosini and ripping it to the cup Trayvon Payeyton who had an early three knocks down one going to the cup Yeah they havent done straight line drives like that with a decisive going strong off two feet Seven points for Payton in this one coming off the 22 against Vandy Ball tipped away Mircini has it with a two on two to Williams and he is fouled hard by Washington The free throws for Keon Williams Yeah you can see UAPB has responded to coachs halftime message of the fight and again that defensive discipline part of the discipline he talked about getting out in transition They havent played in transition much in this game and getting stops is a big reason why And you see when they are able to get stops they can play their brand of basketball Dion Williams a productive first half with five points three assists as well That last second shot at the end of the first half it was just by maybe a tenth of a second Little too late Hes back up to seven now shooting 86 at the line coming in Yeah neither team really getting out and running much Le combined 13 fast break points between the two teams Boopy Miller rejecting the screen taking it to the rack A leak out Johnson music up the floor with the deuce for Payton Yeah again this is what you want to see if youre Coach Boseman on the bench being able to get your team to respond from halftime Can you take the message and can you apply it on the floor So far theyve done that in this first minute and a half You can tell with a good low catch hes denied by Kyle Brown Try to keep him from getting in position to shoot the ball beyond the baseline Yeah 6 run for Pin Bluff And if you notice they changed the lineup to start the half some guys that normally would start like Jaquan Scott didnt start the half maybe coach sending a message maybe theres something else behind it either way the 6 run led by that group that did start and setting the tone early on in the games is all about early on the season all about setting the tone for your team to understand what you expect and what you are not going to allow to be acceptable shot there as Williams commits the foul and its great for Pinelop to see the team responding to the call for some intensity especially defensively here Yeah coach B is all about grit and toughness He said if theres anything I want people to know about this program and what we are built on it is work grit and toughness and they are showing some resemblance of those things right now Miller gets the edge on Williams for two and after the play may have a double technical here as well But music first the end one for Boopy and Miller just picking up and doing what he does Just hey you guys think youre on a run Well let me just show you how I can answer that run Do what I do Hes a shot creator with the best of him He can create a play at any point in time with the ball in his hands for himself or a teammate We talked about in the open He contributed to over 50 points where he created offense for his SMU squad talking to coaches shoot around he said he said sometimes our best offense is get the ball to boopy and get out of the way let him go make a play and the ultimate playmaker shy town stand up especially with the way hes playing this season and over the last two games especially shooting about 70 from the floor when theyre talking about so much of his offseason dedication too to his defense and just being a complete basketball player he wants to not only get his team into the tournament but he also wants to make a tournament run of his own that hes able to be a big catalyst of So hes dedicated and the dedications paying off Williams unable to hit By the way it was a pair of class A technicals One against Jaquan Scott for Pine Bluff and then cement Yugatou for SMU YUGU DOWN TO WASHINGTON CUTTING BASELINE FOR THE RIM ROCKER YEAH even those quick decisions Boopy led that whole way The short roll to Yugato and him also making a great pass to his teammate Washington Love to see the way this SMU team shares the rock Yeah give Miller the hockey assist for the secondary assist like were in soccer ACC champion SMU mens soccer by the way You caught that didnt you I think I did Its big time by Kevin Hudsons program Rookie Miller gets fouled out front I think that was an inside foul on Yugat I dont know that for sure but I think big fella too picked up music I think youre right Junior picked up Yeah Yep Second on Romel Lloyd The fouls mounting on Pinluff Thats already five in the first three minutes of the second half as Giron Pierre Jr takes the hand off from Miller and executes Yeah nice back screen and Boopy with another assist and another bucket for Pierre Jr Yeah Boopy Miller already coming off the 12 assists a new career high as Trayvon Peyton stepped out of bounds So a 70 run over the last minute 10 for SMU responding to the 6 run music Three of three in the last four field goals the last three possessions and just total control outside of that one minute of Golden Eagles basketball They are back to doing what they do SMU going to continue to execute at this rate Largest lead for SMU as Pierre cant hit the tough one but a blocking foul is called And Trayvon Peyton a little bit frustrated with how late that one was called Yeah it doesnt mean its not the right call Sometimes its not always on time but it doesnt mean its not correct Again this young man is playing some really good basketball starting to understand what it is that coach infield and staff want from him as far as the little things Again weve mentioned this before not about this young mans talent but hes starting to figure out if he can put the habits and the approach with the talent that he has you can score with the best of Again its the second straight game where he is leading the team in rebounding as well I mean used to seeing him lead everybody in scoring but the rebounding that takes that next level effort and hes giving it well I think his focus on the floor too for the little things is DEFINITELY MILLER UP TOP DOWN HARD FOR PIERRE JR Little things just like that Run the floor get the stop finish above the rim When I do the little things right my point guard will find me in the air Boopy with a little Gary Peytonesque I like it Yeah a little lob Wasnt quite Sean Kent but it looked like the rain man on the finish So Don Pierre Jr up to 17 points now after the slam and Miller up to seven dimes not even to the first media of the second half 126 SMU outscoring Pine Bluff and an oneno run that snapped by Paytons bucket Mitchell Holmes back in More productive work for the young big man in the first half as he canu sits down nursing that ankle injury from the first half Payton four straight games hes been in double figures coming off that D1 careerhigh 22 against Andy last time out Like you said you can fill it up Doesnt matter if youre D2 guy or not STEP BACK THREE He wears number two but D2 he is not And Boopy Miller chilling with with the man Williams up the floor too Yeah hes a bad man Anytime you get poked a bear its a wrong bear to poke right there Dont want to get that one started May only be the size of a cup but still that bear big one between Duke and Kansas as well will be watching that top 25 matchup out east And here in Dallas its SMU on top of Arkansas Pine Block by 26 John Little Brian Burton Brianna Sorenson and the whole crew on the ACC Network Yeah ACC making some noise already this season North Carolina with a big win early against Kansas See North Carolina State Will we wade his new era doing well Washington making three He said I want to get in on this rain making thats going on and Moody It is a threepoint party Definitely is going back to the ACC Virginia their new coaching staff also getting some things going in the ACC So its exciting to see I know SMU doesnt probably like the fact they were picked six even though they finished fourth last year So theyre looking to overachieve what the expectations are for them again You know I think it is really interesting You know thats something that Kevin Hudson we talked about the head coach of the SMU mens soccer team bringing up that he feels like SMU as a whole just does not yet get respect in the ACC Theyre seen as a school as a whole that is just kind of lucky to be here but its anything but Yeah I dont think that it doesnt make sense to see it that way but I think its more the uh recency unbiased almost of like theyre not they havent been here long enough Theyre not used to seeing SMUs name and considering them amongst the traditional powers or just traditional teams within the league But Ill tell you in the year in the era of the transfer portal though and the era this new era of all collegiate sports things happen so fast I mean I get blueb bloodoods and everything but my goodness real quick SMU has become a factor in every single sport out there as Davis Ray finishes inside Oh my god its a its its becoming as they call it an everything school Exactly Where you see football playing in the championship last year excuse me the playoffs last year and you see volleyball top 10 in the country two years in a row soccer playing some elite soccer as usual And I think some of it with SMU mens and womens basketball part of it is they werent coming in as a already successful program in the American at a high level Maybe I shouldnt say successful but not a championship contending program So harder for them to see that hey youre new kids on the block in this league This is a bigger level than where you came from So I think some of it is just that having to earn the respect But I dont think Andy Infields worried about that at all cuz hes earned plenty of respect at every stop hes been at This will be the third program when hes able to get the ponies into the dance the third program that hes been able to facilitate and orchestrate to get to dancing and sweet 16 for Dunk City if you remember back in the day at Florida Golf Coast that led him to USC where he had great success in LA as well No doubt as Washington knocked down both free throws Yeah well see if this is the year for SMU or not What does it take at this time of year to set you up to be that team that is making the NCAA tournament run What makes for a successful team then as far as what you do now How do you prepare your team to do those things Yeah I mean doing exactly what theyre doing now Theyre undefeated Theyre meeting each challenge as it comes Every game presents a different puzzle that youre trying to solve and figure out how to win last time last game came down to a gamewinner and a game defending stop Uh you know the Charlton game had different challenges The Murray States the this game has had different challenges So Christie was kind of a grind Yeah every every one of them youre just trying to get better as you go You mentioned it with this transfer portal You have so many new players on the team so much new chemistry to figure out And the good thing for SMU too is they have a lot of chances in the league cuz the league will be even stronger So Coach Enfield talked about this their wins on the road almost didnt mean as much because those teams didnt have as good a resumes whereas the ACC is a little stronger and they have four SEC opponents coming up before they start conference play So theyll have plenty of opportunities to music prove their resume Oh yeah December is a big time proving ground for this SMU team Ruthie Miller with a dozen as SMU gets Germaine ONeal Jr back into the matchup By the way that was the fourth foul on Jaquan Scott Golden Lions big man Three personals and then a class A technical factoring in there as well 31point lead for SMU Wow Dashing through the double was Williams but he loses it to the ground Boofy Miller AHEAD OF THE PACK and blocked from behind but fouled Yeah SMU just doing the job this game I mean you think about music coach would probably say Hey this game we didnt shoot it great This game we didnt play two halves So far in this game theyve shot it well Theyve defended it well and theyve put together two strong halves to this point where theyre playing the brand of basketball that they want to play and that they want to build on Big key now is continuing to do it for the rest of the duration of the game Couple free throws for Boopy Miller passing you top 25 in both free throws made and percentage Ree Sorenson why are they so good at free throws I dont get it Thats right John I know you talked about the importance of free throw in this game and thats because this SMU team is learning from the best Coach Enfield ranks second all time in NCAA history in career free throw percentage after holding the top spot for 17 years He shot 925 at John Hopkins making 431 out of 466 free throws Coach joked around saying sometimes the player challenge him to shooting competitions but he tells them he cant go past that threepoint line but he will stick to free throws So moral of the story do not try coach Enfield in a free throw contest at practice All right Ive been warned Mitchell Holmes by the way man looks so in control Love that power dribble Oh wow Great job by Murosini Finishes and one as he split the hedgehog front Yeah speaking of a little bit of control music man in the air second time hes had one of these acrobatic plays at the rim Came out on fire man Alex Miracini from Arlington Martin High School again about 20 minutes away started his career at San Diego Myiramar a community college went all the way out to the right coast in West Virginia music Westland and he settled right back in the middle of Pine Bluff SMU getting some of their younger players some experience in the game Had four freshman in the game a second ago on that last foul now have three true freshman in the game in this one Nigel Walls one of them along with TJ Davis Ray and the man inbounding Jermaine ONeal Jr So they go to the 131 here this Pine Bluff trying to get the freshman to make a mistake You can out to the corner willing to make the extra pass Davis Ray steps in deep two Doesnt fall but Edwards tracks down the board NEW 20 DAVIS RAY LAYS it over the front of the rim Ray DJ Davis Ray from JCR Catholic in California but originally from St Louis Marosini taking it away Coming up short grabs his own rebound Hell do it again Little short again That Pine Bluff set of faithful right behind the bench ready to go crazy You could watch out Fouled from behind because its its Mississippi State its Vandy itsm and then LSU after that as well Yeah two neutral court games to go in there as well And yeah this is what its about You want to be tested You want your team to be ready not only for conference play but you want them to come out of those games and at least be able to feel like you know exactly where you stand and come away with some victories in that stretch as well By the way that uh foul on Kyle Brown got upgraded Lets see what happened here As excessive is what the referees came and told us And you can see that replay Great job by them to be able to identify that get that corrected So two shots in the bowl for SMU Neither of the free throws good by Yigu music but with SMU now in the music double bonus for the remainder of the game with 12 minutes left music chance to put that free throw shooting to work for the Mustangs right now A chance for Edwards to run the point A little bit of a different type point guard than Goofy Edwards but he can get the job done Just a little too tall for the big man Only the second turnover on Edwards against seven assists Well both those guys have seven assists in this game So when you have point guards that can make plays and create for their teammates makes your job as a coach much easier SMU was looking for 16 assists coming in Theyve got 19 tonight Thatll work from out front Kyle Brown cant make it go Davis Ray one of the rookies in there for SMU Freshman gives it up to Edwards Eiglu hard post tries to post to rise Brown and again fouled on the way by Yeah I think thats the aggressiveness and the way the coach wants to see the big man continue to attack the rim Those decisive quick moves inside where the double team cant come Youre turning away and again theyve celebrated his work on his free throws this off season and excited for him to continue to grow here because they know hes going to draw attention to get fouled Two of three at the line in this game for cement as original starters come back in Boopy Miller and Cory Washington What do you like about cement in year two Sir Little I like the foul discipline I like how hes not picking up cheap fouls I also like his his rim timing is a little thin a little bit better in the second half this or in the uh first part of his second season Oo Miller picked out of the play by Scott Still the run to the rim by Mirosini Doesnt go ONeal loses it up in the air Yeah thats one of those plays you always want to protect your point guard You got to yell out that screen Everyone in the gym you want them to know that that screen is there Ly Miller so dedicated on the defensive side He had no idea that screen was coming I think Yukatola just in general looks more commanding on the floor as well More sure of himself as if this area is mine I think his numbers show those things you just talked about too John Washingtons drop shot Butter For Cory Washington he was at two points at the half and 11 of his 13 have come in the second half Hes four of five from the floor Again a guy thats not hungry for his shot but fills it up Jaquan Scott from deep Hes in double figures Just Scott showing a little bit of his range again a Mansfield Timberview product that started his high school career there from Dallas home and hope hopefully has found himself a home with the Golden Eagles A player who can be an allconerence level player in that league I think no doubt hes got a big gear coming up Washington from the corner comes up a little bit short SMU has put up 21 triples in this matchup Looks like Yugatos not coming down Got an injury with his ankle looking to come out of the game Yeah once he gets tender was playing five on four for a second there Just a stoppage for the injury here Well theyre actually going to call it a foul in the fifth on Jaquan Scott Hes fouled out as we get a look at Yukatollu trying to walk off that ankle injury again Its going to bring Mitchell Holmes back in SMU shoots two the rest of the way as Jaquan Scott in his homecoming fouls out Scott did so in 22 minutes of work Yeah Coach Bs been pleading the case thought there was contact before that led to that foul Sometimes referees only music catch the reaction They dont necessarily catch the first one Unfortunately Jucoan Scott music will have to watch the rest of this game from the bench Scott also picking up a technical foul as well and a double technical earlier on in the game Factoring in on his foul out Germaine ONeal Jr South Lake kid with a steady confidence is at the free throw line for the first time in his career This is perfect Stop the clock One of those games where you get a chance to have a lot of minutes for these young players to get some confidence to build some you know game experience with the lights on Its one thing to do it in practice but when you can do it in the games and see the ball go in and have some fun doing it Yeah I like to see I like to see the Pine Bluff Faithful coming out Great crowd section behind the bench being able to support UAPB Coach Boseman talked about that with the two young men from Dallas coming home along with just a big fan base in this Dallas Fort Worth area They came out to see their club play and they let the fresh know they didnt like that call that time John and it got overturned They did as the official from across the way actually saw it The lead official was the one Roger Z who had to hustle all the way across the way and overturn the call that Tommy Morrisy and Cla Aubrey had agreed upon Milan Charles a 21yearold freshman out of France a music GLeague drafty Back in the day you know GLeague drafties could not play in college basketball but those days are no more of course And Charles is another puzzle piece for Arkansas Pine Bluff where Solomon Boseman says Hey we got everything we need And and Charles is a big part of that getting some of the international flavor to come to Arkansas Loves the roster versatility that they have Again working to work out some of the kinks Thats the early part thats so hard for the Pine Bluff schedule as they play on the road Coach says we havent even had a chance to practice All we can do is travel and walk through or shoot around as ONeal Jr knocks down the triple Speaking of shooting around let it fly young fella Let it fly Another threepoint basket goes in for the Mustangs Now up to 10 in the game And ONeal called for the foul Number 88 player on the ESPN top 100 ONeal Jr Just a little too physical And then the swipe down with that athleticism and length You want to keep yourself vertical But this young man you mentioned it from Arlington coming home himself and he has definitely had some highlight plays You can see the talent Hes worked his way up from the junior college ranks all the way up to now being a division one guard and you can see a lot of promise on this club and hes going to be a big reason why the Golden Eagles can have success Coach Boseman saying you know he admits that Mirosini struggled a little bit to start the season shooting this 29 from Philly into the one of 10 tonight is not going to help but he really wants the world to see how good Alex Merini is And hopefully hell have that chance this season Boopy Miller nice maneuver down the baseline and Washington finishes with a flash inside And Booby so good I think not that it was a bad play to make last year but I feel like last year he would have scored that basket Now hes looking so much more at how can I continue to create for my teammates and make things easier on them Another assist back double doubles for Boofy Miller Yeah hes got at least five assists in each game this season Hes the first Mustang with five plus assists in five straight games since a young man named Kendrick Davis who I think most people are familiar with He was the American Conference Player of the Year when he played here He was just outstanding at the guard spot And Poopy Miller you know known more as a scorer when he came over from Wake Forest But man just the way hes running the show this year its been a revelation Another assist this time ONeal Jr no but ONeal runs down the rebound PIERRE INSIDE SHOULDERING OFF A DEFENDER and the tree and coming downhill That is a Sports Center play The truck coming down the lane looking like a running back hitting the hole Lloyd doesnt go cheering SMU blowing this thing open In the second half they scored 45 in the first half and in the first 12 12 minutes of the second half theyve got 46 Thats ridiculous So in other words youre saying theyre playing well John Yes And a very rare turnover for SMU tonight is Washington The youngest player to ever be drafted in the NBA and play an NBA game He started his career in Portland and was the most improved player at one point in time Threetime allNBA Just a incredible resume for a player who came out of high school 611 a little taller than his son but his son I dont know they might if they had a dunk contest Germaine I dont know your son hes right there with you yeah and a true five meanwhile Germaine Jr I mean hes a wing is what hes going to be Its about 65 right now So different games for sure but still very very effective Yeah But how cool to be able to watch your son play college basketball and sit courtside You see the same thing with guys like Carmelo being able to see his son play You see a lot of NBA guys having their sons have success Dominique Wilkins son is playing at Georgia LeBrons son played for Andy Enfield He sure did He sure did I see youre keeping track John I see that I read the papers I still get the papers The papers kind of like the internet Is that Yeah exactly I print out the internet Is that what people used to use before that Mhm Horse and buggy Is that how they delivered it Im not sure Well Derpierre Jr he is a Renaissance man 19 points in this one So hes got at least 18 in each of his five games in an SMU uniform Thats some consistency Yeah Starting to play again his best basketball of his young SMU career Starting to really get into a stride and hes going to be a big factor on this team as losing three double figure scorers from last years team They would need his point production Well good thing they start five double figure scorers this season and its going to remain that way after tonight as well most extended playing time music for some of these freshman like ONeal who gets it from Pierre Lofts the triple and rolls it down That is a smooth stroke for Germaine ONeal Jr His first double figure game in an SMU uniform Well we talked a lot about his dad but also this young man Hes an elite defender The staff says they love his defensive tenacity and length and athleticism if he can figure out that threepoint shooting is something that they need Hes a great rebounder as well He can fill a spot that they need in a rotation as a three and D wing Yeah So maybe the freshman dont start Maybe one or two of them do as the season goes on but they provide valuable depth for this team going forward Well theres one thats definitely going to start as soon as he gets back in the uniform I dont know if we know if if weve seen how good that young man is yet but Mr Tounes is mustsea TV Just a elite competitor Kind of an old school game Can score can rebound has a high IQ and SMU fans are going to love seeing that young man play And speaking of love another finish and call it a filt The kids do I see you doing the hard hands over there Love what Pierre Juniors doing He said he was on his way to a 2410 evening And this man lives at the rim Lives at the line So physical strong and athletic And again no extra celebration Hes been there before Hes again hes really kind of getting in sync with this staff and what they expect from music him And thats a great sign for SMU fans to see number five getting better and better at what he does So its a 23piece 140 run by the way I see it Seven rebounds four assists in 27 minutes Eight of 14 from the floor Just some light work for Jeron Pierre Jr And comes in Team gets a little younger Threepointer from out top Johnson hard off the heel and too much contact underneath This foul is going to go on SMU BJ Davis Ray Is there a time in life where youve referred to yourself and somebody you just told them like Hey thats light work music in reference to yourself I just wanted to No no I always love that you want everybody to think that everything I do is very very difficult and Im putting a lot of effort into all the time I want them to know how much Im inconvenienced by the fact that I have to put in some effort Ha Well BJ uh Edwards putting forth light work right there on the mini for the hund for this SMU club thats averaging right at 90 a game They get to 100 yet again on the season Its no 67 The kids dont get excited about 100 like they do about 67 these days Oh 100 to 50 SMU doubling up Hinduff tonight Do you think your kids know how cool you are in terms of like cultural awareness Yeah they they try to deny it I let them know every now and again Edwards little shake and bake Oh the fadeaway comes up short Denniso out of Columbus Ohio Secondyear transfer from Hawking Community College tears down the rebound Little developmental time for both sides Catch and shoot triple for the freshman Hayes is over the top Offensive rebound Asoro The Golden Lions get it again as Payton tears to the glass leaves it inside Assor cant finish And a host of SMU Mustangs in transition Edwards looks off Davis Ray banging inside Feeds it out Spot up THREE FROM THE CORNER ONEAL JR CATCHES THE STRINGS Tell you what this young man you can tell he put a lot of reps into that shot because he is catching it and shooting it with a lot of confidence and that one snapped the net letting people know Id do this I think 3 and D looks pretty good on Germaine ONeal Jr Think I think the student section is calling for some of the walkons They want Trey Utter They think its Trey Utter time and definitely will not be the last as this team has a lot of offensive firepower The Mustangs have three straight games Oh my goodness Germaine ONeal Jr 3D D and D for dunk This young man having a career game 15 Oh BJ Edwards Tell you what ONeal Jr showing the promise The no look by Edwards for the lob So nasty in the authority for number seven Its contagious The hops Another rejection this time by Nigel Walls the freshman out of Houston This is one of those games that for Germaine ONeal Jr will definitely give him a ton of confidence And this is why that time in the game with the lights on makes such a difference and number seven showing hey Im not only am I already in the rotation but Im going to be able to contribute Uhoh we got a few substitutions coming in or maybe one Yeah Trey Uter the only not red shirting player who hasnt played in this game Theres a big collision on the baseline and it looks like Trayvon Payeyton got the worst of that Well the excitement is utterly palpable as Trey Udder is entering the contest out of the metropolis of Argyle Texas You think theyre excited The entire town of Argyle not only them but the student section Oh student sections They are hyped Now whats going to happen on his first catch and shoot attempt from about oh 24 feet Thats the question I mean so many times its hard to get two full minutes of game time I know that sounds like its not a lot but games are so tight SMU getting the job done dominating from start to finish in this game wire to wire creating some great opportunity for some young men to get a chance to get some prime time minutes Curer his three crawls over the top That is threepoint attempt number 27 tonight for SMU The wings and the corners have been open this evening for Andy Enfields team and theyve knocked down 12 of them Now youre exactly right You know so often the walkthroughs at the end of the bench they get you know 20 seconds at the end and students are thrilled with that But two minutes its like an eternity Well SMU did the job tonight I mean you look at the stats 58 from the floor 12 threes made 19 of 24 from the free throw line able to get 44 points in the paint still Just all facets of the game Oh double clutch threepointer by Ahmad Johnson right against the shot clock Hits his fourth three of the year Defensively be able to hold Pine Bluff to just 35 Walls going baseline out top Termaine ONeal Jr Little bit long Courier had the rebound for a moment but its stolen away by Brown cheering And another Mustang Casher Stork is up Alicia Stork ready to come in for the first time And well do that after the timeout for substitution for SMU So with mere moments left Callisher Stor goes baseline tries to dump it off inside and Chance Purer is fouled A chance for the Dallas Carter kid Carter Cowboy to try a couple free throws and get on the board for the first time in his career Curer knows the system plays to it with no hesitation now in his music second season Kind of a physical cutter guy a rebounder from the wing spot at 67 67 The first point of his career and hes called for the rebounding violation music So up next for the SMU Mustangs they stay at home and they get Arkansas State over the weekend and then Ratford next week That one thrown behind the intended recipient Kyle Brown with 37 seconds left Wiretowire victory for Andy Enfields team Nearly almost led the whole way tonight So for the Mustangs what do you take out of a game like this Yeah you just take the confidence You take you executed the game plan dominating on all facets Now the build to go forward Good idea through the legs of Pourier Keeps things moving forward He was supposed to shoot that Yeah he was He didnt get the memo He plays the game the right way I was about to say credit to him for playing the right way but hell learn Hey let it fly buddy You seconds left Another block Second one by Walls Again dislodges it And that one will count for Kyle Brown But the SMU Mustangs
