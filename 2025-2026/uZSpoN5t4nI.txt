make up time A lot of the same principles in play in the quarter court defensively except for with great rim protection Maryland wins the opening tip Ron Gruber Lee Cassell and James Breeding are officiating crew The Turfs are without their leading scorer and rebounder Farel Payne Thats a significant loss Appeared to hurt his knee last Saturday in the loss to Michigan the number one team by many metrics in the country Number two in the polls 10183 And the first shot missed by Miles Rice as Virginia pushes Tempo We will say that tonight more than youve heard for a long time around these parts Get into the paint Heres Tessa Ritter leading scorer for UVA Off the window wont go Don Hall charged down and it will be a foul against Hall over by the Maryland bench cheering Good effort already for Buzz Williams team He liked the way they played Debbie in the loss to Michigan and they actually led by nine in the second half before Michigan took over in that Wolverine win on Saturday This is a Maryland team that has to move the ball Not because theyre the best shooting team that Buzz has had cheering Theyve got to get Virginia rotating and attacking closeouts that can get downhill and get to the free throw line and thats when theyre really good Maryland starting lineup its their sixth different starting lineup this season Theyre with Payne and Gulpino a freshman due to injury Terrapens have missed a ton of games due to injury this season and Buzz Williams is limited again today Heres David Kite at the end of the shot clock cheering coming off 31 against Michigan Quite will not get a shot up and Virginia much like the Wahoo teams of the last 16 years forces a long possession and a shot clock violation This is where the perimeter size is a factor Look at the switch right here out to the perimeter That is a lot of size on David Kite the 511 graduate transfer for Virginia down hall The BYU transfer leads the point There are three transfers in the starting lineup Malik Thomas and St Louis and two European players cheering Tess Ritter Johan Grunlow both potential NBA players And Ditter again with a miss and a late foul Grunlow was going for the rebound got pushed and the foul is going to go against Maryland and Elijah Saunders who spent last season here at Virginia the first year Turpin foul So Kevin this is a Virginia team that has size at every position over Maryland Maryland without pain doesnt have a typical five or a rim protector So Saunders is actually their five player in this lineup Thomas for three No good This rebound will stay with one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country Virginia To your point on that size Debbie theyre a great shot blocking team Theyre a great offensive rebounding team as well Well they crash They have assignments about crashing and theyre committed to going to get an offensive rebound to create extra possessions Heres Grimlow the sevenfooter from Germany Paul the veteran after three years at BYU scores the games first bucket for UVA cheering Really nice action in the middle third He snakes that ball screen gets his HIPS AND SHOULDERS PAST to the second level and does a nice job of finishing does Don Hall Its a Maryland team that is not a great shooting team What they do well they get to the free throw line as much as almost anybody in the country Solomon Washington spins into a tough two and the Toledo transfer St Lewis at 67 with a rebound UVA an outstanding threepoint shooting team One of the best in the country Good job by Miles Rice right there to force him uphill and not let him go back door But Hall finds the sevenfooter and Virginias got the first four You want to have better ball pressure on the passer on that but thats just a great piece of execution by UVA You can take vision away Kevin but when youre undersized you got to really get up in guys and make them feel you Quite graduate transfer NIU Kansas Now Maryland finds a little seal leaves it short There are a lot of rough shots Debbie around the paint because of the size of Virginia Theyve been one of the best twopoint defensive teams in the country Maryland has started 0 for three and all three of those misses have come from inside the arc Heres Hall A bucket and an assist already Hall for Thomas at the dying moments of the shot clock Thomas drives and is held up by the red shirt freshman George Turken Turken having to play above his skis Fiveman at 67 Heres Miles Rice good scorer Began his career at Washington State And now Saunders the former Cavalier with some jeers from his old crowd Washington end of the shot clock placed in the second shot clock violation for Maryland in the first four minutes Good ball pressure good rotations good discipline on the defensive end not allowing Maryland to get in the paint Watch this snake right here This is a terrific job of playing in the middle third by Hall Getting all the way to the rim and then the lob right here The middle third with shooters in the corner You cant pinch Theres no help Its a great job executing The scorer and the sister on that play both check out Chance Mallerie spark plug freshman from here in Charlottesville is in the game along with Vana Onenso Terrific shot blocker 33 in Virginia Orange And here is Mallalerie trying to burst by the freshman Andre Mills on Yenso for cheering three The fourth of his season and career He worked on it after shootound today He got some extra shots up And then MALLERIE SNAKES HIS WAY IN cheering FOR A TAKEAWAY Chance Mallerie who has 15 more steals than anybody else on this roster gives Virginia an extra possession after he sent up on Yenso for a three Youve got guys that have been winners Theyve been successful at other places but now you step it up a level and uh they have uh produced Theyve held Maryland to 0 for four with three turnovers two shot clock violations so far First of a fouryear home and home between these teams Virginias got a seven nothing lead as Jakari White their best threepoint shooter misses a three and then commits a foul against Miles Rice Tomorrows ESPN college basketball double header Final games for each team before a holiday break Miss NC State at 1 Eastern then Clemson and Cincinnati ESPN and the ESPN app starting tomorrow afternoon Look to see if Will Wade put a charge in his guys See how they respond based on some of his comments I think uh Paul McNeel will be ready to play He dropped 47 the last time he put the uniform on NC State threepoint record in the win over Texas Southern 72 after the Miles Rice jumper gets Maryland on the board off the Sam Lewis miss Here come the Turps with Rice again Banks cheering it in for three Miles Rice who is seven for4 from deep scores a quick five straight So they get backto back stops It allows them to get into a little bit of extended pressure Buzz Williams looking to change the rhythm of the game quickly cheering off that last time out Theres White who recently hit 12 threes in a row to Ritter Freshman from Belgium Backs his way in Misses his third shot of the game and his fourth Mallerie sticks his nose in there the smallest GUY ON THE COURT FORCES the rebound almost five rebounds a game hes an amazing rebounder he is plays with a high IQ hes got a great motor he understands being a guy thats smaller at the guard spot playing underneath playing off two feet shoots with range got a really bright future he is 510 and I think cheering were contractually obligated to say of someone whos 510 in basketball he is listed at 510 10 cut there The pass went to Onenso Lewis end of the shot clock leaves it short White in between three terapins found the basketball for cheering the fifth offensive rebound So UVAs missed nine shots and grabbed five cheering Lewis a shot fake Deon Tillis onu for three again Thats well short and Mallers hoist does not draw the iron Oh its a shot clock violation How about the response of Maryland coming off the timeout Two baskets playing with better energy and effort on the defensive end Theyve been able to extend their pressure because theyve scored Youve seen enough Biz Williams teams You had a sense there might be a response after a slow start I expected a response They got to stack a couple of good plays back to back Its a building Buzz Williams of course very familiar with Six year or five years at Virginia Tech Texas AM and now Maryland Heres a miss three for Andre Mills Offensive rebound for Maryland Colin Metaf The first of the game for the Turfs I love this middle third action right here Right Steps back passes up a three Its a lot of screen rescreen action Adams tremendously talented freshman The wild shot on Yensu and away Shot clock is not reset and the ball trickles out of bounds with 210 of a second So not even enough time to catch and shoot This will have to be a tippet Onensu doing a really good job of protecting inside Now this is likely going to be a third shot clock violation Isaiah Watts junior transfer from Washington State comes in again Two ten of a second have time to catch and shoot Virginias got to Yeah thats a tap and they got to really close the space right here Good ball pressure Every possession matters Those Williams goes a little bigger underneath and theres a shot clock violation Buzz looks dismayed Yeah actually Uh I would be too Like hes kind of kind of concerned and confused See you bring the ball down right here and theres Mallerie knocking it out of your hands Allows Virginia to reset their defense Hes got 23 steals now The next closest Virginia player has eight coming off a six steel game with 10 points five assists and a win over Maryland Eastern Shore 11 days ago Look how spread out the floor is Hall back on that floor for UVA which has missed its last seven shots And Hall gets dispossessed the takeaway Adams cheering from behind by who else but Mallerie A Charlottesville kid kicks it for White and then Mallerie fights for the rebound and he gets called for a foul over the top of Kite Look at this energy So explosive and such great use of his speed Feels like there are six chance Malleries on the floor at any point Two really small guards right there really battling two of the most fun small guards in the country Maybe Quite whos coming off 31 against Michigan and started the game three for three from deep You know Quite played against Elliot Kado in that last matchup against Michigan Im wondering if backtoback small guard you dont usually get to see Another steal Jakari White leaves it short Welcome to Charlottesville Virginia and Maryland in an old school ACC matchup Kevin Brown Debbie Anteneelli Been a slow offensive start 75 lead for UVA which scored the first seven David quite place a three Marylands leading scoreer on the floor has not scored Forel Payne the Turpps leading scorer for the season is out with an injury but the Turpps are hanging tough Theyve helped Virginia to three for 16 shooting cheering Quite Solomon Washington through the lane is fouled and Marylands going to shoot free throws for the first time he defends and the IQ with which he plays and sometimes its risky but I think its a calculated risk So Maryland is at the free throw line right now Solomon Washington a 67 senior from New Orleans who joined Buzz Williams when he came from Texas AM to Maryland with four players transfer over fromm Washington hits both free throws and Maryland has answered a Virginia seven nothing run with one of their own Theres Buzz Williams twotime SEC coach of the year Three straight NCAA tournaments to end his tenure at Texas AM Little bit of a surprise to some when he replaced Kevin Willard at Maryland but Buzz Williams six years at Marquette five at Virginia Tech six atm has done well at all those programs has moved in around the same time and now hes hoping to revitalize Maryland Shown they played 30 possessions of zone against Michigan in their last outing Mallerie tries to break it with Devin Tillis weaving it inside and throwing it away cheering for Johan Bruno Its the third Virginia turnover What a nice change in rhythm What a good time to bring out the zone I thought they were going to bring it out when they were down seven zip They did work on it today in shoot around and so 14 points nine turnovers For all our talk of this is not the same Virginia it kind of feels like statistically the same Virginia but its early cheering Theres Miles Rice 8 and 12 point per game score Washington State Indiana Maryland Rice misses a jumper The rebound to Grenow the sevenfooter from Germany Thomas tremendous scorer longest scoring drought of the season right now for UBA cheering and it will continue as Lewis turns it over and Tillis commits a foul You do not want to put Maryland in the bonus when there when you have a team that struggles to score You dont want to put them in an early bonus situation Its five team fouls on Virginia Ryan Odum experiencing a drought He hasnt experienced here 515 cheering without a point for a Virginia team thats scoring cheering at 87 plus points per game cheering Sixth best in the ACC That is amazing Darius Adams strokes a jumper and the Terrapens after a dreadful start have nine straight in their first lead playing with a lot of confidence with a lot of effort very connected on this end of the floor defensively They have effectively mucked this game up Ditter UVAs leading scoreer goes charging in and draws a blocking foul Virginia will get to the free throw line for the first time after 10 minutes and 11 seconds Ditter 0 for four started the game trying to ISO on a clear out and and Maryland stood up vertically and held him out And I think plays like that are the kind of plays that build confidence with a defense Maryland just hung in there till they got to that first media timeout And then theyve been fantastic since Tester Ritter 16 point per game score was a potential second round pick decided to come to college at UVA What have you seen early in his college career I love the versatility I love the skill set I think the the passing ability when you have bigs that can pass that see the floor that not just can pass into the second level but can read the third level as well And I think thats what Der can do Goes two for two Snap the fiveminute plus scoring drought Miles Rice into the paint And you saw Gruno come over at the last minute to alter his path Rumla one of two Virginia players along with Onenso who are in the top 11 in the country in blocks per game Im going to step out and shoot it as well cheering Hell give it to Mallerie here Guarded tightly by Isaiah Watts Mallerie will pop miss it deep up in the air and a foul on the rebounding action Its going to go against Virginia and Johan Grunlow picks up his first And thats six against Virginia in the half So Maryland will be shooting free throws the rest of this first half And Grunlo still gapping at James Breeding at the other end of the floor Theres another thing thats new for UVA this year Debbie More pressure under Ryan ODM The packline defense is a thing of the past They aim to not necessarily turn you over Ryan Adam ODM said but slow you down Maryland got a quick shot there of George Turson fouled by Glumo on the rebound So thats two quick ones on the seven foot freshman And thats the seventh team foul So moving forward from here on Maryland will be shooting free throws And thats what Im talking about putting them in the bonus early You have to have better discipline But Maryland has been aggressive on Buzz Williams teams everywhere the stops that hes been from Marquette to Virginia Tech to Texas AM Hes won over a 100 games Theres not many guys that have done that at power five level And I know hes going to win a 100 at Maryland at least Hes had way too much success 11 NCAA tournaments in his 18 years as a head coach in his previous stops If he does win 100 here hed be the third D1 coach ever to have 100 wins Of course Steve Alfred and a name very familiar to Maryland fans Lefty Drael I think Rick Barnes has got to be in that category too Is he I wonder is it Clemson Tennessee or Texas and Tennessee Question Maybe hes at 99 somewhere Thomas drives it and scores it Elite Thomas leading scorer in the West Coast Conference a year ago at San Francisco puts Virginia back at front UBA had missed its last 10 field goals before that layup The tough schedule that Maryland has played cheering the quality of competition that theyve taken on They have lost four in the last five but Virginia was very cautious with their team not to get lost in the numbers here This is going to be a competitive game Adams got in soon in the year picks up the foul on the backup big man his first and Virginias eighth So Darius Adams a tremendously skilled freshman is going to do what he does best get to the foul line So when your game plan defensively is all pressure and you have a team that doesnt shoot it well Marylands moving the ball and forcing closeouts When you force somebody to be laid on a closeout you can attack off the bounce Thats part of the reason why Maryland is in the bonus early and why theyve been able to get to the free throw line here Its because they are attacking a late closeout because theyre moving the ball You got to keep the ball in front You got to guard the ball Adams goes two for two Maryland back in front Andre Mills a red shirt freshman returns for Watts And every dead ball and every bucket Maryland extends their pressure as well Really guarded hard by Miles Rice Marylands given up 100 points three of the last five but cheering they are guarding it tough and they will get it on an offensive foul called against Thomas and Maryland now will be in the double bonus the rest of this half with every successive foul I mean the switch right here is a switch with pressure and then you see the push Miles Rice is a veteran player now He sold that pretty well Here is Rice cheering Five points to lead Maryland early Washington Just his fourth game back Long time out with an ankle injury Trying to drive cheering it at Ditter A tough shot will go for Solomon Washington Late clock cheering clear out Washington off the bounce in a matchup that Buzz Williams likes Largest lead for Maryland cheering onenso as a distributor looking for a back cutter instead Lewis cheering Lewis a slow start from the field will leave another one short Hes 0 for three and Marylands got the ball with Adams He is really physical on the ball both sides cheering Adams for three Dont count it An offensive foul against Turson will send it the other way Its pretty ugly for Buzz Williams Little family that much faster It looks faster because of the number of points theyre scoring but the way they defend and the way they guard fullourt and the way they offensive rebound Oh and Yenso missed it right at the rib The Ritter got a good look from three Its better movement that possession for UB Theyre four for 21 as Washington grabs the offensive rebound for Maryland Heres Saunders short for three and a foul as Hall came flying in for the rebound Its against Virginia Thats going to send Maryland to the line for two And the Turfs are in the double bonus for the rest of this first half I mean its an aggressive attacking mindset by Maryland coming on the road Handled the sevenzip run by Virginia at the beginning of the half Get to the media timeout And since then Buzz Williams team has done a fantastic job of staying aggressive moving the ball and getting to the free throw line Foul was Derritters first Solomon Washington hits the first Tomorrow on ESPN and the ESPN app the Pack 12 rises again The second annual Invisalign Bay Area Womens Classic Oregon Stanford USC and Cal Old rivals take center stage on ESPN and the ESPN app It all starts at 6 Eastern 3 Pacific And a lane violation So wipe out that first free throw for Washington It was dead on a first free throw of two Lane violation and Washington misses the second applause Lets see if Derritter can get going right here Hes 0 for four Id like to call his number probably if I was Ryan OD See if he can get him an easy one White contested three in and out And this foul is going to go against Maryland Just the Terrapenss fourth of the first half Havent really gotten easy shots for anybody in a long time Look at this on the free throw You know whats odd about that is that its a Virginia player that steps in and its a Maryland player that makes the basket That should have just been a made It should have counted cheering And Virginias got a Second violation inbounding the ball So what in the world has gotten into this game Thats the sixth UVA turnover We have more turnovers than made baskets in this one Its not close laughter Were at 138 turnovers over made baskets which is fine for Buzz Williams whose team is the uglier the grittier the griier the better when you come on the road and youre playing the number 23 team in the country I mean hey good competition You mentioned theyve given up 103 of the last five Gonzaga Alabama Michigan Theyll score on you but Virginia has been right there with those teams this year in terms of points and theyre at 11 for 14 minutes Theres quite even scored yet This is wildly on a step back three Turkens got the offensive rebound hanging tough despite the lack of size Rice leans right into onenso Rice is cheering not as good of an actor as he thought earlier Another offensive rebound Washington late shot clock Heres Kite cheering Step back Kick out Three No good And another offensive rebound cheering for Maryland MILLS HITS A THREE THIRD time the char as the Turpps throw bodies to the boards caution to the wind and lead by six I mean toughness on the glass BATTLING NOT JUST BLOCKING OUT PURSUING THE BASKETBALL cheering Ditter into quite he misses a shot cheering being guarded by the smallest guy on the floor and hes complaining Washington out of control Its saved by Rice Every hustle play and he gets fouled cheering every loose basketball And thats the second foul on Ditter the third Virginia player in the book with two fouls And right now its a sixpoint game but it feels like a onesided dropping I mean thats a foul Nine offensive rebounds for Maryland cheering They get three in that last possession Washington has been living in the line Its three for four there officially This was 7 nothing Virginia It is an 184 Maryland run And you could really say its more of a slow jog over that pace Virginia had seven points at the 16minute timeout Theyve got one field goal in the last 1030 I mean this is Solomon Washingtons fourth game back from injury What a tempo changer he can be on the glass What incredible energy he has brought to the lineup And we go back to the losing four of the last five The four losses that Maryland suffered are all in Ken Poms top 20 These are all good teams And part of the reason they fell apart in the second half against Michigan Washington was ejected for a little shove after play That was his second technical So he only played 10 minutes Remember theyre doing this all today without Farel Pir their starting center Back to the zone mixing it up Valerie behind the bag cheering Valerie trying to shake free of Watts He does with a crossover Leans back into Watts It looks like Virginias just trying to force contact cheering UVA has made one of its last 17 Going back to the horns Buzz Williams has had to call more sets than he usually does with this group out of the coach maybe harder than hes ever had to coach in his 19th year as a head coach Thats what he told us Heres Rice Shot clock two Rice has to hoist Offbalance runner No Rebound by Gruno Back of the game with two fouls White for UVA White into the paint Held up by Turken who falls DOWN AND GRUNO MISSES a dunk He got the ball back in his hands Tillis leans in Tillis flips it home Keeping the cheering pivot foot maybe just maybe down And finally Virginia gets a bucket I mean this is starting to get good now You can sense it You can feel it in the crowd is starting to get a little restless Maryland takes a timeout Buzz Now this is a game I know those two gentlemen are not enjoying Theres no way John Crispen would go 10 minutes without a basket or at least trying Heres Mallalerie Virginia down by six Theyre five for 27 Heres White for three Hes fouled cheering And that is not the most intelligent play for Maryland Try to get UVA back into this David Kite who has not scored commits a threeshot foul Virginia early in the first half went to a lot of middle third uh ball screen snake action reach screen and they scored They went up seven zip and they really have gone away from that since Part of that is because Buzz Williams has mixed up a little bit of zone to take some of that away But hes only run a couple of possessions of zone He ran as I mentioned earlier 30 possessions of zone against Michigan He did 30 possessions of zone in the six previous games to the Michigan game So its a new a new uh change of rhythm for him with this team White hits the first two Dusty May and again Michigan pulled away in the second half against Maryland Dusty May said last Saturday about playing Maryland Every single shot that goes up is feudal warfare in the middle Yes theres no archers Its just straight mucking it up Braveheart style Weve seen Braveheart style basketball so far for Maryland and its working Well you have to win the margins when you come on the road and when you go against a team like Virginia thats got the size and the advantage on the glass cheering Maryland has neutralized that with effort and energy on the glass Remember theyre doing this without cheering Payne into Saunders Washingtons pass ends up in a heat of orange Sam Lewis White just hit those three free throws into Tillis Brad transfer UC Irvine is fouled on the dig down Its a blocking foul and itll go against Miles Rice Marylands sixth foul of the half Miles Rice just got to stick his chest in him and just try to hang on until he can get some help in that post up Virginias had balanced scoring Seven of their nine players have scored The problem is theyve all scored either two or three Nobody got Tillis And an easy bucket As easy as it gets Hes now the leading scoreer for UVA with four And they are within one cheering Look how quickly the rhythm has changed and the momentum has swung Seven straight for the Lahoos White knocked away The pass from Rice cheering and applause to Turks screen Rice wraps in Mills has it knocked away by Lewis Its off of Mills and Deon Tillis is extolling the crowd here to get loud and they respond on another Maryland turnover Thats the 10th Turp turnover of this half So Miles Rice at Washington State 40 of his possessions were pick and roll and he was the ball handler Hes doing less and less of that And part of the reason is Buzz Williams needs to call more sets so they can get into their actions quicker Theyre going way too deep into the shot clock up top for applause a lot from Chance Mallerie The finish by the freshman from Lawning in Germany and Virginia scored nine straight to take the lead back cheering under 90 seconds in this first half Mills quick shot from three Didnt get the rim Washington his fifth offensive rebound and he is denied by Gumro on the outlet pass Heres Lewis got Mallerie trailing Tillis off the shot fake kicks it Lewis Mallerie Grunlow White cheering No but the offensive rebounds there for a strong put back by Lewis And Virginia has turned it cheering forward at the end of this first half cheering Two for one Can they get it applause Not going to be a two for one now Adams cheering took too long Turks in three Not even close cheering Virginia which has a timeout applause can hold for the final shot Boy after 18 slumber minutes of game play this building has roared to life in the final 120 seconds Mallerie got cheering his man Mills in the air He drives He misses Bruno does not takes over three minutes to the first VIRGINIA THE OFFENSIVE REBOUNDED 10 OF THOSE Buzz Williams team is going to need that effort here in the second half on the road They start the second half on defense and give up the second bucket for Malik Thomas Virginias second leading scoreer of the year 12 a game It was a 7 nothing Virginia spurt to start the game Then Maryland went on a 194 extended run Now Virginia has scored the last 15 How does Maryland avoid this game getting away much like much of their recent losses have cheering and applause Well theyve got to be efficient with their possessions They cant have a live ball turnover Its Hall who takes it in for two applause Theyve got to minimize all of those mistakes with Buzz Williams having his offense in front of him I think hes going to continue to call a few more sets And I do think they they might have scripted what they wanted to do And this is an early timeout by coach Williams 54 seconds in Virginia today Wonderful history in this long time ACC rivalry now Big 10 ACC David Kite has his first bucket to bring Maryland within six Blake Thomas cannot answer for two Ralph Samsons final home game as Virginia Cavaliier He had a gamewinning shot with 4 seconds to go And one of the many folks in a packed University Hall that night is now the Virginia head coach Ryan Odum whose father Dave ODM was an assistant at UVA I think he was a ball boy that night Ryan was a bullo on the baseline for that shot and one of many special moments for Ryan whose team has taken the ball away again who grew up here This is his 12th year as a head coach and hes had success everywhere hes been Lewis leaves it short on the drive Loose ball and Saunders former Cavaliier will take it away So Miles Rice to the bench that was three possessions two turnovers Clay meanwhile has hit two straight threes Remember he scored 31 against Michigan Saturday He did not score in the first half today But a quick 60 run makes this a threepoint game And then nobody guards St Louis in transition You cannot make those kinds of mistakes when youre taking the number 23 team on and you have them in a position where youre putting game pressure on them I mean youre forcing Virginia THIS IS A QUAD FOUR GAME right here Marylands net would mean a quad four win if Virginia can hang on to it Its not the the win its the loss that would really hurt them Kite driving Kite stumbling through Hes got eight straight David Diggy Kite who is just a walking bucket has pushed Maryland back within four with a second half spurt Hall inside to Gruno whos got three dunks and misses a little baby hook was a 31 per game scorer in Jo a few years ago Quite kicks it Adams sticks it Diggy Koy having his way right now with the Virginia defense Paul with a lead down to one Another easy basket As easy as could be Backto back transition cheering Got to stop the ball especially after May baskets Threepoint lead UVA quite stripped again Its down hall The graduate student tags it bounces it cheering away for Bruno And Virginia bounces himself in the foot to turn it over Yeah you got to throw it up for the big guy You cant throw that bounce pass in transition But watch Diggy right here Keeps his dribble alive Gets inside And then he does through the paint spray to the three Its a great way for Maryland to get some threes Thats just their third of the game Get a breather here early in the second half Kit with eight 15 point per game scorer Remember theyre without Farel Payne their leading scoreer on the year Maryland within three Andre Mills ties the game from the corner THE SECOND THREE FOR THE RED SHIRT freshman and the turfs are four for four from deep here in the half cheering Williams begging his guys to get a stop right here Valerie absolutely hounded by Rice who has gotten the message after spill on the bench An aggressive foul will send us to a timeout Once again Maryland takes some punches music and fuss your head coach or any head coach period Do you feel like youre a first year head coach A brand new Virginia team a brand new Maryland team and the Turfs have shot the lights out the second half Five for five with four threes to tie the game Maryland back in the zone Did a bit of that in that first half effectively Heres Tillis in the soft middle Kicks it Ditter spins out a three He has still yet to hit from the field Virginias leading scorer Tessa Ritter has two points and hes 0 for seven I I got to believe the zone has worked well Well I Im not sure Maryland maybe has had one possession where theyve scored out of the three or four possessions of zone that that Virginia has or that Maryland has played against Virginia 33 apiece Maryland led in this half by Ky who has eight Adams seven in the game Mills six Virginia led by Grunlow and Hall with six And Mallerie steps in the lane again Hes got his fifth steel He is fouled Three turnovers by Miles Rice in the first four 40 of the I mean he he just the pass is too long and over against an overplaying team And this is part of the reason why Maryland turns the ball over so much is taking him too long to get into their sets and so Buzz Williams has to call every set because it tries to eliminate some of the decision making that you are asking your players to make That looked like John Matir at the end of the first half at Norman last night Fifth steel for Mallerie 27 on the year in 11 games closing in on two and a half a game cheering And then Ditters nightmare night continues with a travel Now with all the turnovers that Miles Rice has just experienced he did a really good job of forcing that turnover on Virginia because he was up the line on an uphill pass Virginias turned it over eight times Maryland 14 Virginia typically doesnt turn you over much Their season high turnovers forced is 15 Well this is a very high turnover rate team by by Buzz Williams Dinner almost got the 15th 27 of their possessions cheering Remember they really want to get down Kite step back and quite draws a foul against Mallalerie cheering So Diggy Kite will have a twoshot foul to try to get to double figures and give Maryland the lead again David Ky what a player he is I mean he hes Diggy Koy He got his name nickname from his dad before he was even born Hes got an incredible story because uh Diggy didnt get any offers out of high school and he was delivering pizzas and then one of his coaches locally told him cheering about a Jo school in New Jersey He went to play in the Jo and then he ended up at Northern Illinois His last year averaged 21 points a game last year at Kansas And theres a really great story uh about coach Buzz Williams who had recruited him to come to Texas AM but he didnt have a spot for him So they sent him to Kansas called up Bill Self and said Hey we got a spot for you We you should take this guy Hes a good player And then uh when the portal opened up again this year Buzz Williams snapped him up and he didnt know if he was going tom or Maryland but hes glad to be back with Coach Williams O Williams said uh David Ky I cant coach everybody like I used to coach but I can coach him like I used to coach and he asked me to coach him that way Hits the free throws His teams up two on ties in the lead Really good patience and poise in the paint to be able to finish that play at the rim About 63 is their percentage at the rim In the paint thats how good they are inside Theres K Step back three Left it short Fight for the rebound One by Maryland and the freshman Adams All 10 in the second half for Kite cheering Does not use the screen Kicks it Adams on the hard and ten even cheering harder by Onensu And plucks it into their transition game Tillis White three Yes White applause after an 0 for four start from deep puts Virginia in the lead applause Onensu is having a great impact on this second half Quite around Mallerie Kite and Onensu is there to deter him Force the turnover Marylands 15th Hall now taking it into Washington keeps the dribble alive Mallerie deep one off the back of the rim and here comes Washington charging ahead for the turfs Loses the ball which belongs to UVA applause and cheering Buzz Williams thinks it was tipped out Wonder if this is a potential challenge here as we look at the replay from Onensu Look at Onenso keeps his footwork alive Does a good job of pivoting inside a good ball fake and then gets a block on the other end that ignites their transition game up the floor See I like a shot blocker that keeps it in play Thats an incredible weapon on the back side of your defense Buzz Williams and American Bench were looking down at a tablet to see if that was a challengeable play They decide not to take the challenge on the out of bounds Paul has had some hard charging drives today Hes got eight points on four for four shooting And Virginia stretches the lead to five as Saunders has nowhere to get the ball in And Saunders has to take a timeout It is And and that will be an exciting match You talk about athletes Yes If youre not a volleyball fan watch like two or three points and youll be hooked instantly AndM tries to make it a little better at sports weekend football team lost 103 to Miami in the playoff today Heres Adams in all kinds of trouble Malleries cheering six deal Mallerie shoulders into quite throws the ball away and he is hurt Mallerie is down under the basket Left hits a three But Chance Mallerie is waving around at the base of the hoop with his multicolored Christmas shoes on He gets to his feet and he will humble over to the Virginia bench He gets the steal and then watch a little bump right here He gets off balance and just looks like a lower left leg right there on the left foot Valerie leaves the game Marylands got to get the ball across the timeline They do just in time Its a 100 Virginia run cheering Got another UVA run Three of at least 7 nothing in this game Heres Kite wrapped inside Saunders at a very quick backnet recount for goending and Yenso got it on the way down Happy they dont print posters anymore He certainly just turned into a gift or a gif depending on cheering how you pronounce it And theres the Jakari The Jakari White special tshirt section White leads the way with a dozen now Virginias up by nine Maryland had an edge a toughness They were on a 194 run They were on the glass They were getting to the free throw line They dont seem to have that same edge here in the second half And cheering give credit to Virginia They have locked in on the defensive end Well they havent hit the ball inside the ark until the 4second mark of this possession Mills sets up a three for Watts One and done Rebound on Yenso On Yenso has been fantastic He has altered shots blocked shots He scored on the other end This could be the stretch where Virginia pulls away and that will help Yenso Fantastic Again the delivery to Tillis applause Washington cheering Largest lead for UVA Washington will try to cut into it at the line You can see that Ryan ODM just doesnt want his guys fouling the shooter anymore They foul too much in the first half And look at that Jakari White dunk in transition Deon Dillis is aware of the red light He knows exactly where the camera is applause But Jakari White was known a couple of weeks cheering ago for his shooting cross He hit a Virginia record 12 consecutive threes cheering Stretching a couple of games He went seven for seven for deep against Dayton He is more apparently than just cheering a threepoint shooter The transfer from North Dakota State with the most ferocious throwdown maybe of the UVA season cheering He had 27 made threes and eight twos coming into the game tonight And hes a career 42 threepoint shooter Miss free throws by Washington keep it at 11 White is off the floor right now Mallerie back in the game Great news after he hurt that left ankle it appeared as the misjer by Lewis goes the other way to quite finds Watts hits a three Much needed to slice the lead to eight Isaiah Watts just 24 from the threepoint arc this year with his first points tonight Really good sprint by Maryland up the floor and a good switch sides in transition Its a great way to get a three White Knight for Thomas on Yensu instead back out for Mallerie cheering Mallerie into the paint Mallerie kept the pivot foot on three No Heres Mills up ahead again Watts gets to that cheering left arc This time way short maybe tipped by Tillis and Mallerie emerges with the ball Washington a little slow behind the play Tillis master of the shot fake Drills it Its a three Just loving his old man game and his barrage of shot fakes I Hes been coming off a knee injury and hes starting to get his minutes up Looks pretty good today Commits a foul right on Q Tillis has nine off the bench Hes a threeyear starter at UC Irvine Two time all big West performer Hes got some range Got a waiver applied to come to Virginia for this fifth year of college starting at UNLV Not a lot of connections on this team by the way but he and Malik Thomas who both transferred in were AAOU teammates as teenagers for the Compton Magic So they are very close And Tillis said when he finished his visit to Virginia he texted Malik If this waiver goes through you better become an UVA So he helped serve as his lead recruiter Quite what a tough cheering chance against a runner Contested saved by Saunders cheering Its going to be Maryland ball Seven to shoot Not a foul in there Just be a baseline out of bounds for the Turpps If you know anything about Buzz Williams therell be no quit in his team They are going to have another run here Rice gets it into Saunders Its had a very quiet height and Saunders a very tough shot for his second basket Four points for the man who played in a home jersey here at Charlottesville last year Ninepoint game Nine minutes to go applause Mallerie no good on a three Heres Turkson Here comes an opportunity Real good opportunity right here for Maryland to get a little run together Stack a couple plays together offensively Saunders shot ready Drills it Saunders has come to life the senior from Phoenix Five straight points and the lead is down to six Ditter once again Virginia scores after a made basket in transition and that is the first field goal for their leading scorer Tester Ritter with a chance for one more Ditter being aggressive right here advancing the ball up the floor You got to guard the ball not the action You cant get hung up on that screen And Saunders gets hung up on the screen and Ditter sees space to the rim Dritter misses it Fight for the ball A rugby scrum goes to Maryland and then theres a foul in there How do you explain the dichotomy of Maryland Debbie which plays so hard and has fought while so under man and yet has this passel of silly mistakes and mental errors throughout the game Its unlike anything I think coach Williams has been a part of and he told us today you know hes a college coach learning to coach in a professional environment I mean these are not just college athletes anymore These guys are all pros Theyre all getting paid And when you get paid youre expected to to produce So you got to clean up and and stop making the same mistakes over and over That was the third on Brumo Saunders again Theres Adams the freshman with seven off the bench Rise and fire And here come the turfs within six again as Buzz Williams shouts out instructions on the press And theyll drop back And cheering Id go right back to see if we can get Ditter going Youve been calling for it He just made the basket on the last possession Thomas instead in and out Quos follow in and out And Halls third shot of the possession will go Hes five for five for 10 points Example of your guards crashing the offensive boards and not giving up anything in transition because youre pressing anyway Adams Thats tough No foul on the play Rebounded by Washington Sets up Rice Missed a three Now Thomas has Hall in the leak ahead Its Hall who lays cheering it big applause He has been a transition terror cheering Yeah transition defense has been the difference here for Maryland Theyve got to stop the ball AND VIRGINIAS TILTING THE FLOOR I MEAN they are aggressively trying to get to the paint cheering Paul has more than doubled his scoring average Rice gets around him and got contacted in the air by Thomas 10point lead getting downhill in their transition game up the floor into the rim and scoring And Marylands going to have to do a little bit more of this They built their run in the first half by free throws and offensive rebounding and offensive rebounding and speeding up the game here is going to be something theyre going to have to do on the offensive end Miles Rice hits free throws eightpoint game One of the things that we saw today at shootound with Buzz Williams is the bubble on the rim And the bubble on the rim is to keep the ball from going to the basket so you can work on offensive rebounding And thats what theyre going to need right here And uh during that shoot around the managers sprint as hard as the players do The unsung heroes of college basketball the managers I wonder if any of these players will tip the managers for all the extra effort that they make uh in practice to make them better You know the rebounding drills keeping everything organized and orderly for them Id give them a tip I think in the NIL era thatll be more than appropriate I think be more than appropriate before the NIL era Yeah every college D1 player should be tipping the managers across the country That would be enough holiday bonus Show up in your stocking Paul meanwhile seven cheering for seven has dominated the paint 64 grad student from BYU 10point game Saunders guarded hard by Ditter Adams Now Ditters all over him and that shot is on the wrong side of the basket Was it tipped Thats the question James Breeding and Lee Cassellar are talking to each other Certainly seemed like it had to be tipped to end up there And it is going to be Maryland ball 18 to shoot In all the years Ive been watching Buzz Williams teams theyve always been good in their ATOs Their ATOs today have not been very good Theyve not executed Theyve not gotten good shots Theyve turned the ball over Theyve had shot clock violations and theyve turned it over 17 times I mean its not typical of of his teams Its part of the all newness to college basketball right Kevin Like coaches will tell you we havent had time to come together We got all these new players from the portal trying to figure it out Thats part of the pro mentality that the college game has Now Paul with a three He hits seven buckets pretty much all at the rim And his first deep shot is good Hes got 17 And White with a steal is stuffed by Saunders 6249 Virginia threatening to pull away Adams cannot answer Itll be a foul against Virginia to keep the ball here A bowl season rolls on Monday afternoon with a famous Idaho Potato Bowl on the beautiful blue turf has to be seen to be believed in Boyisee Idaho and Albertson Stadium Washington State and Utah State Miles Rice and Isaiah Watts former school against Ryan ODMs former school Monday 2 Eastern ESPN and the ESPN app You ever been to Boyisey Ive never been there Really Its one of the few states that I have not checked off my list for having played or worked basketball games Great town Boise Good food and the blue turf is very cool Heres a steal for Hall Hes all over the place And Hall is fouled 17 points four assists Thats his third steel And we may have a flagrant foul situation Now as Hall was grabbed on his way to the basket Lee Cassells going to go over to the table I mean just over penetrating Theres help in the gap Theres nowhere to go And there you see Miles Rice grab his jersey from the the back And youre not allowed to do that Thats some holding 10 yards on the defense right there for Miles Rice Illegal contact Hall hits the free throw Hes been terrific Hall I mean I I I think we were wondering who was going to be the guy when there was some adversity in the game that was going to be the leader that had that voice He might be emerging as that guy And with that free throw hes rolled in a season high 19th point A 58 point per game scorer has exploded in the second half Remember he had two at the break Hes got 17 cents He played for Mark Pope at BYU and I watched Don Hall in an upset over Kansas I had that game I had him in the NCAA tournament in the first round couple of years ago Ball again WHAT A FIND AND DITTER IS FOULED Washington thought he had a clean block but hell get tagged with his third to send Ditter to the line as Washington tries to scratch all of his hair out Watch all the activity around the rim right here I mean Solomon Washington was not going to let his team team get dunked on right there He wasnt going to let himself get dunked on for a second time The Ritter has not been his night Two of four at the line one of eight in the field And this is a kid who withdrew from the draft in mid June as potential second round picks Going to turn 23 in January And hes a first year player but has two years of eligibility Theres a lot of thought that this may be his only year in college Theres a lot of scouts at every game Theres some here today Who do you think theyve been impressed by I think Jakari Whites athleticism has been impressive Rice sticks a three right over him And that snaps what was an 8 nothing Virginia run I think on Yenso has been impressive Hes had a big game and of course Don Halls had a really good game for Virginia Grunlo three No and Der got pushed in the back going cheering for the rebound Is this a game that will prepare either team particularly well for their respective conferences How physical its been Well Virginia was picked fifth in the ACC So I definitely think the physicality uh certainly in the first half the physicality was at a higher level than it has been here in the second believe it or not Its part of the reason why both teams shot it so poorly I think Derritter I think theyre learning that you know without Ditter having a big game that they can handle some adversity that Maryland showed them early on But I mean you got to win these games at home Ritter missed the front end of the 101 Hes two for five and then he gets his hand in the cookie jar and he will send Rice to the line for a oneonone Foul on the Ritter We were just talking about physicality right You cant put two hands in a guys chest and push him Thats a foul Five points three fouls for Derritter Miles Rice who is 19 for 20 at the line this year will shoot a one and one cheering And Rice calmly hits the first Devon Tillis going to come back in the game replace Ritter with 423 to go I think Ryan ODM has been incredibly calm and poised Hes got an older team Even when you know Maryland would make a run or or make a push or even when they tied the game here in the second half there was just adjustment just one tactical move out of another keeping the emotion out of it you know just staying poised Hey he hasnt really been in our periphery much because hes a very calm presence on the sideline for a guy whos in his first year here first quote unquote high major year though he has had some wonderful jobs VCU Utah State of course UNMBC notorious year for their first ever 16 over one NC tournament in the mens game over Virginia Wayne White hits a three Hes got 15 Hes been terrific Hes been cheering athletic Hes active This is a deep Virginia team Bruno pokes it out of bounds Jakari White has 15 Hes got three threes Hes got four free throws Guys there are so many electric freshman at college basketball this year Its been an old mans game today with Don Hall 19 but you hear Cameron Boozer Caleb Wilson for UNCC Uh Malik Brown junior for Louisville Of course not a true freshman but Chester Ritters 22 is a first year player for UVA Chance Mallerie a freshman in this league alone and there are so many great freshman in college basketball AJ Data Darren Peterson among them as richer freshman Andre scores theres a bucket on an ATL yeah just to finish up your point I mean Cam Boozers must see TV like Dukes won nine in a row playing up in the garden and Schulman on the call it should be a lot of fun is he the player of the year early on for you now he is Hall has not missed I mean theres only two guys that are averaging 20 and 10 and theyre both playing in that game next JT Toppin is the other guy applause Mallerie with his first bucket Hes done everything but score until now for Virginia Shout out to Yaka Lindborg in Michigan as well Was certainly in the player of the year conversation Maryland just saw him We were talking about Mallalerie early earlier in the game The guy averages 12 points on six field goal attempts That shows how much he can impact the game in other ways and score Its steals assists his ability to get to the free throw line Thats how he gets 12 points on six shots You know Ryan ODM told us about a practice that Virginia had there Their last game was 11 days ago So to be fair to them for a tough first half they hadnt played in a long time They beat Maryland Eastern Shore He gave him two days off They had finals exams and he said I didnt know how hed respond practicing after two days off And he said it was the most competitive best practice Ive ever had after a couple of days off And he singled out Chance Mallerie He said he raised our level in that practice He got a couple of offensive rebounds He started talking some trash and that raised the level instantly Hes impacted the game in every way but scoring And heres the guy who has scored 20 Don Hall Thats his first miss of the game It comes on a free throw and not a big deal because its grabbed by Grudlo who is fouled Well Virginia will highlight Monday nights ACC Network mens double header They dont play for 11 days Now theyre going to play in two days hosting American final game before the holiday break And then the affformentioned Caleb Wilson in North Carolina hosting East Carolina Double header starts at 6 Eastern on the ESPN app Nice win for UNCC today over Ohio State And the returning debut of Seth Trible is a big big deal for the Targans Adds to their depth Gets their veteran leader back You dont like to see anybody get hurt especially when this is their last year Missed nine games 36 minutes 36 minutes back A really good Carolina team with only one loss on the year wins over Kansas Kentucky now Ohio State Step back jumper here will go Nice looking at stroke from Isaiah Watts Makes it a 13point game with 220 to play Paul with 18 of his 20 since the break Three shy of a careerhigh Bumping into quite into Grunlow Got a ton of height on Saunders and easily flips it over I mean what a beautiful soft touch inside Its the first time weve seen Virginia double the block as well So theres a lot of ways that Virginia can play They have a lot of weapons with great depth Chance Mallerie as small of a player as he is it has never prohibited him from having success because hes got the competitive heart that you just cant measure Same you can say for that guy Ky pops a three in his face 13 points all in the second half for Diggy 90 seconds to play Virginia on the verge of 10 and one Valerie finds himself alone and it will clear it out Twoman game on the naked side Weve seen Virginia score a lot on their transition game not having to run a lot of offense really I mean because theyve been so effective playing fast in their transition game up the floor Foul by White with a minute seven to go You know they might get to 80 again after a 24point first half They put up 51 in 18 minutes and 53 seconds here in the second You mentioned their efficiency That is efficiency I think thats the thing thats so impressive about them is the amount of players that Ryan ODM has at his disposal to play and to play the tempo that they want to play and control the tempo with that efficiency Remember Virginia we showed you the top and they won like they didnt score a lot but they didnt allow any points They played at a slow tempo as slow as anywhere in the country They wanted Tony Bett Its just a different style now Its not run and gun Its just a little bit less deliberate offensively And after 380 point games this season the last 16 years Tony Bennett Ron Sanchez which included title incredible success theyve scored 89 of the first 10 I mean philosophically the biggest difference to me between what Ryan ODM does and what success Tony Bennett had is is that Ryan ODM sends five guys to the offensive glass You know there might be a couple of guys at the nail but theyre going to the glass And Tony Bennett elected to get back and play quarter court defense in the pack line Just a difference Still successful Carolyn still fighting by the way Couple of offensive rebounds on that possession Wants hit a three Its a cheering 10point game And when you send five to the glass and you fullcourt press it makes sense It flows right into your fullcourt pressure by crashing the glass Maryland not looking to foul right now Down 10 and they will foul 18 seconds into the shot clock Mills bumps Tillis So its going to be double bonus the rest of the way And for Buzz Williams I mean theres no question that theres certain lineups on the floor that are better rebounding and better effort on the defensive end Theres certain lineups that are better decision makers with the basketball on the offensive end And its still a work in progress figuring it out Process right Its a process And this has all been without Farel Payne today Their leading scorer leading rebounder Now Maryland does not give specific injury updates We saw Pay certainly hurt his knee in the game against Michigan Saturday but the hope is it is not a longterm injury 69 240 17 points seven rebounds a game He will be needed in the rigors of the Big 10 He will factor in And if you know Buzz its a blueprint thats mapped out with detail analytics and feel for the game And he is very much a visual teacher They got to call their final timeout The Turpps will be back in 30 for the final 37 Come back And when New Year hits conference play its go time And Virginia is going to start with two tricky ones on the road at Virginia Tech and NC State Rhino throw a little zone out here Quite is fouled again by Mallalerie Ryan ODM who was an assistant at Virginia Tech under our friend in the studio weve heard from today Seth Greenberg for seven years was the interim head coach Charlotte 2015 went to Lenor Ry for a year for five Utah State for two VCU for two step by step up the ladder and a place where he feels like and the folks here feel like he can stay for a long time and he can build something special But theres a 2019 national championship banner hanging Not that long since Virginia had something truly special going and they have invested in the team Heres our just a really tough mistake to make with seven off the bench Quite kicks it Saunders good for three Sevenpoint game Maryland does not have a timeout remaining Got to get a steal right here Tillis will be fouled with 122 12 threes hit for Maryland which had a season high 14 last game Buzz Williams felt like there was a lot of good to take out of the Michigan loss This was their best offensive efficiency their best offensive rebounding night of the season There will be some good to take away here It didnt look like a win though and then after Old Dominion and its Big 10 play and its meaty everywhere in the heart of the Big 10 I think Buzz will have a lot of great film to break down I I think the mistakes are very much fixable I think that as they get healthy and they get pain back theyre going to do some uh some wreckage in the Big 10 Tillis at the line 0 for three hits the second 7870 threepossession game still has got cheering to have a three at some point here Washington will take it in for a quick two of 59 Valerie gets fouled and Virginia could get to the magic 80 again Its a sixpoint game You you have to keep trying to extend the game if youre Buzz Williams So Virginia wins over Northwestern on neutral court at Texas Dayton in Charlotte That was not a neutral environment but its technically a neutral court Again this is not not a great net win at the moment but another high major win Their only loss was to Butler at the Greenbar Classic in West Virginia cheering So they were picked fifth in the ACC Where do you see them I see them finishing higher than fifth I can tell you that But I I think their depth their size their rim protection the way they move the ball and uh I think they showed us something on the defensive end today Theres Mallerie for that big round number at the end of the game Theres 80 for the 10th time in 11 games Virginia hits the 80 point mark And Virginia defeats Maryland in this rivalry renewed here in the DMV 8072 A 24point music first half a 56point explosion in the final 20 minutes Ryan ODM and the Cavaliers are rolling
