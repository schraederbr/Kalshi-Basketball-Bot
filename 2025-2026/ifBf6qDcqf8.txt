Im excited to see this Duke team play in person and Indiana State better have Larry Bird walking through those doors Exactly You just saw the record there with coach Shier 49 and3 here at home under his leadership as head coach They went undefeated last year at 170 They won their only home game earlier this year And its right into Boozer to get things started I love it A quick cross screen using Gunga as the passer out to 15 Quick cross good job at sealing and staying close to the basket Starting five of the Sycamores Scott leads the team with 143 points a game They go inside and they get the bucket for Scott Ill give this Ian Scott number 23 for Indiana music State Got to watch out for him This is an NIA transfer who can really score the basketball Terrific player Sar working his way in Got it knocked around and Scott comes up with it for Indiana State Derek Vorst now blocked by Boozer Got it back cheering Sterling Young on the drive Rebound Gunga relocating Foster for three Thats not good And forced on the rebound Theres a foul on the floor here Should be on Ian Scott Good call Well hes turned around and face blocking out Cam Boozer He knows the physical strength of the bigger Boozer Youre going to have to do a good job keeping him off the glass And thats a point of emphasis this game for John Shy and his coaching staff He said rebounding is going to be the key to this game Offensive foul on Gungba and the moving screen for Duke and they turn it back over Our officials tonight Clarence Armstrong with Jamal Spearman and Jeff Pon What about as a team coming in here for the first time right This is the first ever matchup between these two What is it like if youre at Indiana State right now I I think one thing that you just youre lucky if youre Coach Slesinger that you have veteran guys and older guards that can kind of manage some of these things It can be a lot when you first have it But Sterling Young last years swack player of the year hes ready to play Heres Isaiah Evans trying to feed it to Boozer that got intercepted And the Sycamores with Xavier Hall bring it over Three early turnovers right now for Duke Indiana State scoring over 80 points a game through their first three contests This is a team offensively thats pretty good They have deep range especially Camp Wagner Deep three there No good by Wagner cheering Some five out motion using Gumba at the top Hes a terrific passer in these sort of a situation Hes so strong physically Evans pulls up No good Rebound Young Another long three from Wagner and he drains this one Wagner you better find him Quick fast and in a hurry 26 out of his 30 field goal attempts on the season from three Not calling him a onetrick pony but he knows what hes looking for Boozer up top to Nice play Boozer You see the versatility both as a score Nice lob pass and a little four five action And that goes off of Duke If youre going to surprise somebody and youre Indiana State you got to knock down shots Camp Wagner this is what he does That is beyond NBA range NBA range excuse me And then short roll action You got to be able to make a decision Quick toss up You know where your guys at Gunk buff Thats two So much for nerves coming in here right If youre Indiana State They do it again Wagner again He hits another two on three Two for a dollar Big time shot Same spot And right back the other way as Kaden Boozer misses on the three Wagner feeds it to Hardy Back inside cheering Young with a wideopen three He drains it and the Sycamores are up 14 to four My goodness Sycamore is ready to play Ball movement cheering at an alltime high They come in with a reputation of a as a terrific offensive team but they better guard him Boozer for three and he comes back for the Blue Devils cheering No home run trots either Indiana State looking to push up tempo and play quickly And like you said Mike not a team thats going to be intimidated by the moment A lot of older players and guys that have had success at the college level Yeah no doubt Theyre four of five from threepoint range And Harding misses on that one Four of six now And its out of bounds off of Indiana State Its raining threes right now Mike Cory Indiana State music playing really well The balls popping around a perimeter And Cam Wagner this is what he does His second three of the contest so far music And then Sterling Young This guy played at FloridaM last year He was a swag player of the year Hes shooting it too Duke has a music battle She said they went through the stress test with him He passed with flying colors doing much better And then by next week they said theyre looking to hopefully get him driving again and getting out and about and uh starting rehab as well So we wish him all the best and a speedy recovery Absolutely And we talked to coach Sles or Slesinger before the game and he said it was almost divine intervention that he got to come back to Indiana State in terote He grew up about an hour away and he did a fantastic job with UNO University of New Orleans He helped them transition from division 2 to division 1 Uh made it to the NCAA tournament but there was something calling him to come home His parents were getting older He wanted to be around He has three children and it just made it for a perfect situation and Indiana State should be happy that hes back and a guy with such experience to help out when times are needed right now for Indiana State Yeah no doubt I mean it worked out for him Had 24 years at Louis in Louisiana and as you said his children uh one of them appropriately named Nola right from New Orleans where they were along with Holden and Bo and his wife Tony and its been a its been a good move for him and the family and we want to send our condolences as well as his mom Barbara passed away in August Uh his dad Lewis now living with them as well So uh just great to hear that story and coach Slesinger whos the interim head coach right now for Matthew Graves The foul here was on St Bernard his first And Indiana State shooting the cover off the ball I like what Dukes doing right here Switch up the flow of this game You have the best defensive player in the conference on the ball in Malik Brown Uh change it up a little bit Camboozers got seven points here for Duke as theyre within five You saw the note the largest they have trailed this season in the first three games It was four points and they were down 10 here early 144 Theyve closed the gap at half And if youre a visiting team coming in as a mid major to a place like Cameron Indoor the best thing you can do is hit a couple threes to start to gain some confidence Uh like I said these are older players on this Indiana State team Not a lot of freshman getting minutes Harding misses on the three Yeah theyre moving the ball too Terrence They got five assists on their five made baskets What a drive here by Kaden Boozer Simply put Kaden Boozer is a winner A point guards point guard does a nice job putting pressure on the rim Thats his first two of the game here tonight Xavier Hall has it for Indiana State Duke is on a seven nothing run You notice all five out action a lot of dribble up handoffs uphill DHOs This is a guy that makes it happen for him though Heres Wagner again for three Thats short Tipped around and saved from going out there by Jay Walker Enel say Bernard back out here for Hall Shot clocks at 10 Threepoint sycamore lead Walker No the pump fake by the official here Offensive Yeah good call I think excuse me Nicholas Amenya coming over getting outside of that charge circle holds his position Really well done by number 14 I thought he was going to call a block He goes charge Good basketball Well and thats picture perfect there on being set and waiting for the contact And that is a great call right there So Walker gets called with a foul for Indiana State Nicholas Amenya is an interesting player Hes 68 shoots the ball really well I saw him in Switzerland at the 19 World Cup where they won a gold medal and hes just a terrific role player a cerebral guy who can really shoot it and hes got size to boot Foster fouled on his way in Indiana State has to has to withstand this rush thats happening right now The energys picked up on the defensive end for Duke If youre Indiana State maintain your cool your composure keep moving the basketball and being safe But Caleb Foster is interesting to me Mike and you know whenever he was in high school this was a tough shot maker a volume scorer and hes had to change his role as the longer hes been at Cameron Indor and playing at Duke Hes turned into more of a facilitator more of a point guard Uh not the scoring season he wanted last year but of course they have Cooper Flag Conanipple and Conanipple is tearing up the world for the Charlotte Hornets right now Oh good pressure stays with Indiana State Yeah Back to Foster 26 start tonight 68th game in his due career And to be able to have that kind of experience in this program coming back thats huge It it absolutely is huge And heres the thing about it is hes improved his percentages big time at least through the first three games of this season Uh you need veteran pieces Retentions still important I dont care what anybody says about the modern day of college basketball I agree with you there Look at Malik Brown All of 69 switching on everything cheering Great pass Kicks it out Young for three and rebounder Look at the outlet here cheering Time out Indianas your defensive pressure You put Malik Brown on the ball going full court mixing up the coverages a little bit You just picked up the defensive intensity more than anything Quick manto man fullourt Indiana State looked comfortable by going with that fullcourt pressure John Shire needed to take them out of what they were doing Mission accomplished 110 run for the Blue Devils Yeah the last field goal came with a 1639 mark here for Indiana State Three ball and thats good Thats Bruno Native of Spain Grew up in the Manresesa Theres a couple of those guys around college basketball Nice move Boozer inside for the two And were tied at 17 This games happening quick John Sher talked about the pace of play as of yesterday One of the fastest teams in college basketball Hes like I dont know if thats a good thing or not yet Were still trying to learn on the fly But Ill say this Mike Cory its entertaining if nothing else Right Well you can tell Indiana States game is early Theyre five of 10 from threepoint range They turn that one over and Jimenez is going to head to the free throw line Telling you Jame is an interesting player uh doesnt pop off the film as a great athlete but he gets his hands out gets a lot of deflections hes got long arms shoots the ball well Hes got the swagger of a NASCAR veteran as my main man Dell Curry would have said Yeah I mean to add on what youve been talking about with this guy just you know the experience right Hes only a freshman but to be able to win gold medals with USA multiple Yeah multiple gold medals Got three of them right The under 18 under 19 I mean and hes a physical player I mean he comes in at 68 215 and already an immediate impact here for this group Absolutely McDonalds AllAmerican the whole bit This guy can really play from California Makes the trip cross country Shoots a pretty ball though I can tell you that I was looking at those notes earlier for Duke Always having a McDonalds AllAmerican on this team every single year At least one for the past 41 seasons cheering Its a lot of burger boys 1917 Duke on top by two Heres all for Indiana State Allin got it knocked away Out of bounds off two I was about to give Indiana State a compliment looking at how spaced out their offense was and then the one time where everything tightens up thats when they decide to drive to the hole So you got to be smart about your opportunities Ian Scott whos got two fouls by the way for Indiana State and its stolen away by Malik Brown Up to Boozer Kaden Boozer Evans for three Wow Terrific screen My man sets his feet You could forget about it Isaiah Evans very much a feel guy Can get hot in a hurry He hits his first shot and had a hand right in his face Duke on the defensive end really picking it up Malik Brown This is what he does on the defensive end of the floor Then the ball moves around Isaiah Evans thats what he does Corner pocket Thats three for number three Uh he raved about Camboozer and I and I said you know theres a lot of comparisons to you I think he might be more more athletic than you Kev He said well theres no doubt about that but the ability to get a rebound and make an outlet pass And I was like absolutely Or I he said absolutely but he goes I think hell have a better career than I will Now thats Kevin Love saying that and hes the sweetest human being on the planet But what a compliment by two guys uh that play the four5 position so well I found it just unique that Kevin Love so in tune with it was able to give him to the give him the award and hes a guy that Cam Boozer is often compared to I think theyre very similar in how they approach the game Both were inside out guys the game has changed some sure but at the same time the ability to get a defensive rebound and push it out uh and make an outlet pass Weve already seen an example of that Thats where he thrives and thats where Kevin Love has made a long NBA career Thats a great story Uh Terrence you just saw Carlos Boozer there in the crowd as well And yeah I think Kevin Love too an inspirational player in all aspects on and off the court Heres a three ball Yeah Camp Wagner It doesnt matter where he is hes going to put it up Hes hit two of them here tonight Hes two of five from the threepoint range Theyve been about that range too He Duke has done a nice job forcing him to fire it away from way beyond the line The length of the Duke defense is really impressive this year Kaden Boozer was called for the foul Theres three team fouls on Duke Six right now for Indiana State Walker and Scott each have two shot clock inside 10 and out of bounds on the sideline ball They really cut off that baseline pretty well right If youre do and not letting any penetration underneath the basket 100 Theyre just loading up on help side Uh you see the pack line Gungbuda doing a terrific job getting over Thats just a big man Hes running into a wall Little Sorry Mike A little switch in defense A little extended 113 that turns back into a 23 You got to find your opportunities and if youre open you better shoot it Boozer Brothers right there The tip goes up and in Kaden Indiana State started off so well Duke now on a 203 run Picking the ball up and going in and getting blocked as St Bernard quickly the other way Jmenya for three Lay off and Forest has it How about the crosscourt pass by Camboozer Another three Wagner No good Offensive rebound Sycamores have it Its over to Young Another long three Young this time back rim They hit him early You cant settle for him on every possession Evans What a drive for Duke Come on man Length for days Isaiah Evans not just the threepoint shooter Excellent in transition with the step through Hes got five points and Duke leads it 247 It is now a 203 run by Duke Theyre getting stops and theyre off to the races Look at how much ground hes able to cover on that little euro step Terrific touch Gunga with his second personal foul for Duke Isaiah Evans I knew he was going to have a big year I actually picked him to be a first team allac guy I because hes going to see more opportunity this season Uh little bit more of an offensive focal point through the first three games prior to this one Theyre running him off screens A lot of flares a lot of pin downs for him to find some rhythm in his shots and he just has terrific feel and really good balance as a catch and shoot guy An 11 nothing run Duke is on right now Indiana State trying to change that Its a three Wagner got it Camp Wagner sets up camp behind the threepoint line Hes not going anywhere inside of that Darren Harris misses on the three and almost a save from going out there that time by Brown Valiant effort and into the cheerleaders Indiana State Theyre going to hang around That balls got to move Nice ball fake Hes not going inside that threepoint line Mike Cory laughter No hes not He knows his role Hes got nine points on threepointers Three of seven Perpetual movement for Wagner You have to be really disciplined on the defensive end Hardin has it Pushed out deep here with eight to shoot Wagner Oh nice little move inside Doesnt go Tries to tip it in And theyre going to count the basket and say interference And weve got a big night coming up for you here Were just getting it started at Duke Well go across town to North Carolina Number 18 in the country Theyre hosting NC Central right after us at 900 Eastern here on the ACC Network Doug Sherman and Chris Bullah have the call for you music on that one Camboozers must see TV Caleb Wilsons mustsee TV You want to talk about another freshman in a year of the freshman Yeah I mean just an outstanding athlete And to be honest the really intriguing part about that is Kaden and Cam Boozer were on the same AAOU team as Caleb Wilson add another layer to that rivalry Cant wait for that to happen for that to happen And and thats going to continue you know for years down the line too Obviously not just in college you know when you know these guys from a young age They tried to go with a little alley there Boozer looking inside Now hell get it back and score Big bully get bucket Thats all that was Cam Boozer Im bigger than you sir Thats 11 points for him so far in this first half Averages 183 a game Young dumps it inside for Harding Out to the corner its Walker and Long on the three Ive been really impressed with Indiana States big men passing the basketball Heres Foster Yep Dale Foster on the floater Thats where hes most comfortable Pick and roll as a scoreer Get into the lane Survey and shoot Thats four points for him cheering 3022 Duke by eight Harding trying to work his way inside He gets it over Brown Hey Marcus Harding hes a nice player every bit of 610 255 lbs Nimble a foot Doesnt jump very high Does all his work on the ground but he has the size to be able to bang with the big boys down low for Duke T Indiana States hanging right in this game here Its a sixpoint game cheering Not too bad Heres a three ball Brown Well good box out there that time Theyre going to get an over the back foul on Darren Harris Great box out by Alan Its going to be Indiana State ball down six when we come back Its a sixpoint game and theyve got the ball Towns Uh Duke went on a 20 to3 run Since then Indiana State got comfortable again at least starting to knock down a couple of shots But its been this pressure that has changed the course of the game for Duke Look at Sar He is pestering the basketball Gets the steal and the finish You want to get the crazies going thats how you do it Terrific defensive possession Six turnovers for Indiana State here in this game Down by eight on the drive Paul knocked out Dame Sar hes got a wingspan of a pterodactyl Look at this I mean the ability to reach around gets it the Italian played for Barcelona last season up until August of this year Great block and Sar on the block Dame Sar up until this year was the youngest player to ever get minutes And were going to take another look Offensive goalending What a block Oh Im not Yeah they called offensive interference Interesting call Um Dame pulling a net by the way Oh yeah Okay Yeah Yeah I didnt see him pull the net Thank you for that Uh Dame Sar was the youngest player to ever suit up for Barcelonas top team in the ACB prior to August of this year Only a 16 years old when he got his first game action Defensively hes special A nice play initially but then it was Gungbud that scored it after St Bernard got a piece of it to begin Four points for him And its a 10point Duke lead now 34 to 24 6 minutes to play first half Xavier Hall reforced and a little bit needed a little bit more on that pass Intercepted Kaden Boozer for his brother Three ball Ken Boozer And its 37 to 24 I love the extra pass to the corner Caleb Foster wasnt feeling it right there Right back to the big fella The versatility of Kim Boozer Just such a good player Terrence is already going to have his average here in the first half Hes got 14 points so far and he just has a habit of making everything simple Mhm Right I I think theres a grand misnomer with young players thinking I have to make the spectacular play Foster for three Keep the game simple go under Foster knock it through You dont have to make something spectacular This Duke team really really tough up 16 against Indiana State trying to hang around out of keeping the game simple Thats why hes so valuable Was he have 14 No excuse me 16 points here in the first half I cant remember any of them being difficult Its because he does all the work before he gets to the shot Just a terrific talent all the way around How about the 10th 10 nothing run that Duke has been on in a game this season Three of them are here tonight after trailing 14 to four Its a 3610 run Young on the floater No rebound Foster cheering Boozer How about that When Foster first threw it I got nervous You throw that ball on an arc it could be dangerous with helpside coming over And a steal Cameron Boozer and hes fouled by Wagner I was going to say maybe its our um angle from being up here right on that pass but I thought it was going to get intercepted I got nervous Helpside Its a lot of time for that to happen Thatll be a talking point But my goodness what a finish being able to catch it and finish over the top This is where Ducas stood out on film though Their ability to get out in the passing lanes has been incredible through the first three and a halfish games that theyve played They live in transition We talk about pace and theyre one of the top in the country in pace Well a lot of the reason is theyre getting so many live ball turnovers and getting the layups Coach Sh has been very pleased with his guys that look for that extra pass to get that better better better shot they just saw on the last possession I I He just does such a good job of dumbing things down for guys like me and you Like he said What whats your most valuable quality He said Its our ability to say no And were like What do you mean when you say that Well if a kids really talented and he doesnt fit that type of mantra or his mentality as far as how hes going to play unselfishly and he doesnt have big goals to play in the NBA we can say no to these kind of guys We dont have to put up with the riff rack Were doomed Right Right Intercepted What a luxury Foster and fouled on his way in Well thats the thing I mean not a lot of teams you know have that ability right I mean they obviously have the resources They always attract typically the best players right I mean at least in the running for them but then they decide is that player right for our program Speaking of which they got a really good player committed today And nobody with the coaching staffs allowed to talk about it but Im allowed to talk about it Cameron Williams coming over He played with the Compton Magic on the Adidas circuit This guys terrific Long arms slender reminds me of Evan Mobley a little bit and how he moves Perime perimeter oriented guy at 610 611 Duke they dont rebuild they reload Yeah that just came down today right Shoot around You got to test Yeah said they got to commit Foul in between Sar and Wagner for Indiana State Well recap it for you when we come back Duke up big knocked down a couple of threes so far His versatility has certainly stood out Hes about to get Indiana State by himself Seven of eight from the field And look at that The most in the first half for a Duke player since 2024 And already with 19 here in this first frame And a nice little scooping runner by Scott Ian Scott Thats what he does Awkward finishes off the wrong foot This is a guy that was runner up to national player of the year in NIA last season This guy can really play Only his second shot of the game He sent them both Hes got four points And its back into Boozer Hes not as big as that guy though Boozer a manchild I mean his size coming in as a freshman at 69 250 Look at this My goodness Cameron Boozer What a start here in this game for him Look at the start of the season Wow Oh nice feed That was from Wagner to Scott Incredible pass I was about to say Kaden Boozer his defensive intensity has been outstanding on the opposing teams lead guard What a wraparound pass that was Indiana State scored 14 points in the first 3 minutes and 21 seconds of this game and theyve scored 14 since and weve got two and a half left in the first half Hey I want to talk about versatility with big man What do you think Mike Uh go ahead Is that a GOOD IDEA GET OUT OF THE PASSING LANES Booze behind the back Im going to go ahead and finish with two What a play by young Cameron Boozer Let me rewind or let me remind those who are watching at home My mans 610 250 lbs Yeah hes a freshman Okay I know I I I was right in front of him earlier at shoot around today just watching him put up threes and its just another level as Hall gets the runner for two I mean you talk about a guy whos going to go top three pick in the NBA draft Like the only thing that you can pick apart from his game cuz hes so wellrounded is like he cant put his chin on the rim but like he doesnt really need to Malik Brown can Yeah Speaking of getting the gyms chim youre right How much fun is this Duke team Yeah And Boozer at the foul line too by the way If you think well whats he at the foul line Its 20 of 23 87 So yeah not a lot of uh weaknesses in his game to say the least Heres Young Got it stripped away Oh and right back the other way as Harding intercepts and Hall got fouled Its on Isaiah Evans his first Itll be a one andone here coming up tomorrow morning 1000 am Eastern ACC huddle crew at the University of Pittsburgh Getting ready for another full day of college football 2hour pregame show tomorrow 1000 am noon right here on the ACC network I consider everything that Eric Mlane says to music be gospel laughter One of the alltime good guys the mayor of the ACC network Eric Mlane Hes great cheering One more here for Xavier Hall Talk about Xavier Hall for a second This is a guy from Shauny Mission Kansas A Truman State transfer has been coached really well Truman State Division 2 Uh hes the engine that makes this Indiana State team run on the offensive end of the floor A guy whos physically strong can get into the paint Dukes had their way after the first four minutes but hes a guy whos going to put up some big assist numbers in their league Indiana State has done a remarkable job of grabbing some of those best players right from those sometimes divisions down like you said division 2 division three even NIA right I mean all of a sudden they step up and they get a little bit of a chip on their shoulder and they play really well at this level They fit right in cheering The portal giveth and the portal taketh away Thats for sure Kaden Boozer not there Out of bounds off of Duke Fmenya Well thats the thing You do really well and then youre even up another level But you know I thought Josh Schz from before with this Indiana State team and then now Matt Graves um continuing that along with coach Slesinger whos the interim head coach for right now while Graves gets back from and you covered the Indiana State NIT run Yes It was incredible when Shirts and all those guys made it all the way to the championship game Yeah I see Schwe and Robbie Abila and a lot of great players on that team Shirts obviously now at St Louis but I mean the tradition continues and as we talked with coach Slesinger how much the people of Indiana State love Indiana State to that is a basketball town Ill tell you we were here during the shoot around today this morning and they had a lot of donors and alumni and friends of the program come out with them on this trip on the team charter and he wanted them all to come out onto the court to take a picture and he got a little choked up He was he was talking about he just says It means so much to us all your support Thank you Like thank you for being here What a music great experience So you know youre happy for him and this group Well you you he talks about it being such a special place and weve already talked about you know being able to see his parents and unfortunately his mother passing in August as you alluded to and uh just for him to be close to family He understands what Indiana States about Its a truly special place up at Teroot and for him to be back in this position as head coach as an on an interim basis of course but he he just harped on it and harped on it how special and the perfect music timing and his words Gods will it just incredible stuff and he theres no better man for the job in the interim than coach Slesinger yeah he talked about some of the great you know towns in Indiana right the the top and Bloomington West Lafayette and Terote right in terms of their support and their love for basketball And yeah theyre theyre getting a good you know 5 6 thousand people out of every game still I mean thats going to you know that arena is big Uh but they really turned it on two years ago with that NIT run and trying to keep it going A little bit down last year but that was expected when you lose your entire starting five Heres a three ball Evans no Kmena offensive rebound for the two Thought Isaiah Evans had the first shot Passed it up for a more difficult one Game clock down to 4 seconds and that is knocked out of bounds I think theres still going to be some time on the clock here Lets see if they put some more time or do they say thats the end of the half No All right Right You do a bunch of uh NBA coverage for Charlotte I I always laugh you know we talk about guys ability at the next level and like well hes got to work on his defense Hes got to do this defensively to Im like theyre scoring 140 points in the NBA Like whos whos playing defense right now You know my favorite thing was whenever people used to talk youre like well I dont think he can stay in front of the NBAs guards My response is always nobody can stay in front of the NBA Exactly Second half is underway here in Cameron Indor Stadium The Sycamores with it underneath and trying to get it divorced and its intercepted Terrific helpside defense Cam Boozer sliding in Thats 13 turnovers now for the Sycamores and making them pay off of the Caleb Foster miss is Gungba with a follow Hes got six Gungba lost 20 pounds in June and July Duke hired a new strength coach Coach Preston Green brings him in and hes like Man youve struggled with some injury stuff Sure But lets see if we can drop you down a little bit of weight Gungas never looked better as far as physically how hes able to move around the floor being able to switch out on some players that last year he would have had no business doing Uh he looks really good this year compared to last Yeah thats a good point Sar knocking down that jumper for Duke as they lead it 56 the 32 Make it 34 Basket and a foul as Sterling Young will head to the line here This is nice job Camboozer trying to stay or excuse me by Sterling Young getting downhill I was thinking that was the possession prior but uh Sterling Youngs a guy who can score it uh today got off to a little bit of a quick start at the very beginning of this contest and then Duke turned up the intensity defensively but played at FAMU last season for the Rattlers by the way underrated jersey combination Florida incredible but he uh swack player of the year last season and thats off of forest as Boozer was creating havoc there once Yeah And he picked up the foul on the previous possession Hes only got one foul here tonight 23 points You talked about Yeah he is human Oh right Thats the first mistake Ive seen him made pretty much all day I mean he hes been spectacular in every facet Forest No but foul and its going to be on Sar Thats going to be his second Back to your point about Indiana State getting off to the fast start They were four of five from threepoint range Since then theyre two of 12 Yeah its just been a different kind of intensity And Im not saying Duke was asleep at the wheel but sometimes when youre playing an older veteran team and they have guys that can shoot it youre playing half court defense they can get comfortable because theyve seen that so much Duke switching to a fullcourt mantoman just changed the rhythm of everything And are they showing a hogy on the baseline there cheering Thats a Harris ter hogy Yeah I love the creativity of the Duke student section Its awesome Every every game coming in with something different Right Heres Boozer Just too easy Im just bigger than you Thats all that was And Ian Scotts a big guy Like we talked to Ian Scott before the game like this is a guy whos going to go into premad like really intelligent Hes about 68 210 pounds Its just the sheer size and width of Cam Boozer Just incredible really Well it ties his career high if I could say that throughout the first three games of the season Hes had 25 Hes got 25 tonight Heres a three ball Thats no good by Evans And then Boozers got the offensive board Oh no And Foster misses but sticks with it Boozer again and hes fouled Ball slipped out of Caleb Fosters hands Hey John Shy point of emphasis for him We didnt even ask him a question He came over We got a rebound tonight And that is a terrific example right there You get an open look Thats all well and good You got two guys fighting over the same ball That slipped out of his hands Im g Im giving Caleb Foster a pass there Slipped out of his hands But I like the tenacity on the offensive glass for Duke Obviously a giant point of emphasis I want to say this on the nineman rotation they pretty much have going right now for the Duke Blue Devils I mean I think Coach Sh was talking about it before I mean they have four freshman right I mean but theyre awesome I mean you know normally youd say Oh freshman but were talking here at Duke and they come in with the size and the ability like theyre already a senior I mean Boozer case in point Amenya his brother Kaden Boozer and then also Dame Sar So you got four really really talented freshman out there Absolutely And I think thats the first thing too is you know you talk about Duke and how many Wow Indiana States just falling apart They need to get back to being solid You you you talk about guys when you know the NBA draft comes up and different things first thing they look at is body size And anybody that John Sher brings in theres certain prerequisites right Nobody that has played tonight is underneath 64 in tall And Im counting Kaden Boozer as 64 because I dont know actually how tall he is because his hair but Im just saying like he plays like a bigger guard Good pass Intercepted back the other way for Evans And that led me to my next point of the other guys as Evans tries to go up top for Sar You got the four freshman and then the other five players theyve been with this program I mean thats what you said retention and how big that is today cheering as this threepointer goes up and in by Scott He got Foster third year of the program Isaiah Evans his second year Malik Brown his second year Darren Harris his second year and Patrick Gungbas second year to mix in with those four freshman music And the Blue Devils lead it here big time Well be back And then they give up a three on the defensive end and he calls a timeout I I just know that feel You know I coached for a short amount of time Get him Somebody get him Anybody just get up off the bench get his butt out of the game Hey its a commitment to excellence man Like John Shy are so good at performing Wow Boozer and the foul teaching moments Now up 22 You got to get value out of these games right How about this Sheer strength What do you think about maybe a little push off there Derek Boris is not a small human No And Kim Boozer moved him out of the way as if he was my son Damon on an 8ft hoop And Im flushing it Heres the thing Youre up 22 points We talked a little bit with John Shy about playing different styles of teams depending going in your nonconference and even when you play Indiana State he said you know we played against a lot of teams last season They wanted to play a slow and that was great because it helped our defense out He said he wanted to add some tempo to the nonconference slate this year simply because youre going to have to communicate a little bit more to figure some of these things out because in the ACC is Boozer is just going to score all the hes going to score all the points tonight Uh in the ACC youre going to play against some teams that like to get up and down play fast a lot of threes in the same vein as what Indiana State likes to do You got to be ready for these types of situations Thats why you play these Well and they are up 23 points as Boozer has 31 so far in this game here tonight in this scenario right Getting them to come to it Well it its a different day and age And and heres the thing too You see the yearbyyear improvement Second round in year one elite 8 two years ago and the final four last season They just keep getting better and better I dont know what that says for this year We shall see But you know Johns just so smart Nice pass by Sar for three No the follow is there by Brown And Johns just so smart in how he communicates His emotional IQ is out of this world when it comes to being able to reach certain guys And you know the big thing is a lot of times you only get some of these players for nine months right So you have to be able to reach them and sometimes that means a different approach The block to the dunk for Sar I dont know what Sars wingspan is but its got to be 72 73 I I mean it is out of this world and his athleticism just jumps off the page Hes getting comfortable on the offensive end And a lot of that stems from his defensive play 68 190 Talking about a number seven in white for Duke Ball inside off of Walker Defense leading to offense We have some extracurriculars Duke is everywhere Pitching ahead Dame Sar two hands for safety I mean just a such a good athlete Wingspan for days too My goodness Fouls on Brown for Duke his second This was a whole bunch of nothing right here This is This is Jay Walker whos from Raleigh right down the road Went to Combine Academy in Charlotte actually Uh just a little bit frustrated He wants things to go well coming back closer to home Paul cheering trying to get by Sar out to the wing Wagner for three Not there Rebound pulled in by Hall What do you do here Yeah Sorry about your luck there Got the ball and Boozers right on him Now inside a block again that time by Brown Missed shot in the corner All Duke tonight 6841 Amena to Sar steps in a three and its no good Rebound Boozer Second try Yes I compare him to Kevin Love Thats a Kevin Love rebound right there Pad the stats baby Hes got 33 tonight on 13 of 16 from the field and nine rebounds as well Hall for three Well now Boozers got a double double 10th rebound of the night That last defensive possession Malik Brown coming over on the help side Thats what makes him such a special contributor to this team Second double double the season for Boozer who grabs the rebound His 11th Sar for three Its good If Dame Sar can do that with consistency cheering Dukes ceiling is much different Timeout Indiana State When teams have just as much length as you do theres not many teams that do but Im talking about in tournament play Uh youre going to have to execute in the half court They have all the weapons to do just that But in that Texas game that was the first time where you know you saw a little bit of it but obviously John Shy he he wants better Not saying they cant do it They have all the pieces getting the opportunity to play some of those games and theyre coming up quick fast and in a hurry But the ability environment and everything that they have here at home which you know many of you whove seen them ton of games in this building what it means to them because Shire as we said at the start of the broadcast is 49 and three at home right I mean thats 94 of your games youve won at home I mean to think about every year you wonder why this team every single year Well thats like 16 17 wins right there if youre going to do that every year at home You know what I mean Absolutely I mean you cant defend home court that much better than they have really in their history Its not just under SH of course Foul here going in and its going to be Harden thatll get a couple for Indiana State So what else do they have coming up as Hmania picks up his second personal foul The nonconference schedule Yeah theres a few good ones right there I mean are you kidding me Look at this Theres certainly some opportunity I mean Kansas Darren Peterson at Kansas obviously terrific Hes currently out with a hamstring situation but that nonconference and Duke always has that to de be able to develop some of those things But its um its something that Duke has the ability to schedule because of the program that they are Scheduling is a very hard thing for a lot of programs cheering not such a difficult thing or as difficult as Duke just because youre going to have these opportunities because of the brand But you know half court execution theyre going to have chances to be able to work on some of those things with their upcoming slate And man that was a lot of really good teams on that schedule Yeah there really was And you know youre right I mean when you talk about some of the other teams throughout the country uh that do have a problem with that because some of them that could be really good they just dont get the ability to get some of these better teams on the schedule They say Oh nobody wants to play us Its hard to get the games You know what I mean Like yeah there theres a big portion for that I mean but you know playing against Arkansas Calipars done a fantastic job Florida former national or last years national champs Michigan State always tough Texas Techs really really good Yeah I mean they got a guy named Christian Anderson whos terrific German point guard JT Toppin obviously uh had a big game against Illinois in their last contest It like youre going to have opportunities to continue to improve before you hit conference play and work on some of this half court execution and that Michigan game as well too Thats another great team Look at this Brown for the flush Gungba how good is he And Ill be honest I didnt see all this whenever he was a high school senior playing for team takeover but the passing of what hes capable of doing Quick little dump off to Malik Brown Make it pretty for you and all the Duke fans It was fully painted uh about an hour and change ago Uh I Ive heard rumors that once upon a time at UMass Mike Cory used to go full body Yeah Right laughter No we used to actually hold up the uh the newspapers back in the day when they were announcing the starting lineups like we werent paying attention Remember that The newspaper You You never went full body paint No I never did that Okay Could have fooled me laughter We had the womens basketball promo there a moment ago How about Duke on the womens side They are on the road taking on West Virginia down by seven in the third quarter Number 15 ranked Duke on the womens side We got number four Duke here tonight No trouble with Indiana State Under 12 minutes to go in this game Hey there were some butterflies after the first four minutes Yeah down 14 to four And then they quickly erase that with an 11 nothing run and have been playing from ahead pretty much ever since Cameron Boozer Oh nice play 33 points here tonight Runner no good by Foster Foster whenever he gathers he needs to smack the basketball to get a good grip on it Its such an easy thing to do to just try to get up there and go quick as you can right sometimes hes had a problem with that couple t couple of possessions Wagner fading away in the corner for three Not a great look cheering Foster Not this time cheering Three ball Sterling Young Wow Off the backboard And they finally get another one to go down They were hot early Now just two of seven here in the second half And sticking with it for the two is Gunga 830 on a Friday and the bank is open for Indiana State Going to have to get back on defense though Im telling you Gunga is moving well running the floor Mhm Hes really improved his body Well you had talked about with the strength coach coming in I mean a lot of these guys I mean they they look pretty darn good right I mean this is only game four of the season but theyre in great shape Well they had had a strength the same strength coach for 20 plus years Wow Gungba Gungba Goodbye Not his house Nice play But I mean even there the effort to get back make a play on the ball Thats a volleyball spike cheering Sign my man up No Preston Green they hired a new strength coach for the first time in 20 plus years Uh and he comes from Clemson Before that he was at Florida Hes been at a lot of places that have had success but one common theme with the players that he has uh theres massive improvements And you know after doing something the same way for 20 years and it worked obviously but you see the improvement in Gungas body I mean getting over there Yes And six rebounds and his presence is felt both ends of the court That was a heck of a block Well be able to take another look at it This was the volleyball spike and he put that in section six row F laughter Yeah And the next possession gets another one Hall was called for the foul for Indiana State Back to Boozer Back to work And he is fouled by Ian Scott Trying to get points number 34 and 35 Hes just a load on the interior And in a in a day and age too like you look at a lot of different fors theres not a whole lot of backto basket guys anymore right And and the fact that Cam Boozer can play on the outside and be the hub of your offense be a terrific passer do a lot of those things He can also catch the ball on the wing If he doesnt have a shot he can Barkley dribble down and put his back to the defense and dribble down hadnt shot a free throw as well as hed like Im sure but to be able to post up score use leverage I I mean like its such a different type of way to attack and hes relentless in how he does so because hes so strong and he never quits And like theres a cumulative effect of playing against a guy like that You saw it against Texas in game one First half didnt have a field goal second half able to get to the foul line played a lot more physical but like eventually it just gets to you as a defensive player Jamea for three And its plays like that too you draw so much attention Nice kick out there with the assist His fifth of the game Hes got 11 rebounds 33 points You saw the note there about being the first freshman to have 30 plus along with the blocks and the assists three blocks as well First time in six years thats happened for a freshman Those numbers Kaden Boozer for three Harris got it back and then hes fouled by Young applause Young frustrated with himself right there Thats one of those theres just nothing you could do Get stuck Wrong place wrong time get to the next play Darren Harris comes in the game First time I saw Darren Harris play him and Gunga were on the same high school team They were also on the same AAOU team Mhm Played St Paul the fourth And like this is a guy thats a bigtime scorer that has been patient with his minutes that has continued to work and he stuck around And a lot of guys lets be honest too Mike you have a year where you dont play all that much guys are out of there Yeah he sticks around Well think about where you are at right to begin with and and Im with you though I think if if more players and and Im just just saying you know I know take the money out of it for a second I mean you want to improve you want to get better you want to see your stock I mean you got this guy okay You got this program I mean where else would you get someone teaching you and and the ability from these guys over the years to say Hey we need you to do this you do this youre going to play youre going to get better youre going to get to the next level I mean its a great place to be at Im not going No no doubt And and theres a lot of great coaches around the country The accumulation of talent at Duke is different They played nine guys today All of them will have a shot in some way shape or form at the next level Youre practicing against those guys every day Right Right You know you look up and down different rosters around this league There might be two maybe three on a really good team but theyre bringing theyre bringing their lunch pail every day at Duke because everybody has the has those goals Three ball Gumba No he needs to let it fly Like Gungas thinking about it instead of shooting it Yeah you saw how slow that ball came up Let that ball go man He promised John Shy he was going to shoot them Him and Malik Brown He did Thats what Sh said Man if these guys dont shoot they promised me they would shoot a couple of threes when they were open Well theyre seven for 21 overall in this game here tonight Inside for the two Foster applause The number thats crazy here is points in the paint tonight for Duke 50 or 48 there 48 points in the paint Indiana States got 47 total Thats exactly right Indiana State they they hit some really hard shots at the beginning but the length of Duke is just crazy Need to finish this And Foster does Hes got 11 Third player now in double figures and scoring for Duke And the other way its forced for the jumper Forest has a nice little game 610 250 lbs and change Not the most athletic guy but a good floor game Plays with pretty decent balance Hes going to have a really nice year in the Missouri Valley Evans for three Good job Track down that rebound Zier Green cheering under 8 minutes to go in the contest 84 to 49 cheering NBA range three gets taken away NB Wow NBA range three NBA wingspan Yeah 11 to one in terms of the blocks cheering Amena to Foster for three Inside outside doesnt matter 87 to 49 Timeout Indiana State Those three going to be in the conversation for top pick in the draft Native men obviously terrific at University of Tennessee One guy thats not on there though Mike Brown Jr at Louisville is absolutely terrific a do it all point guard can really score it Had a monster game against Kentucky St Bernard here on the dunk for Indiana State How about the guy that we just saw the other night at NC State Darien Williams Ah hes just tough but hes old I mean were talking freshman You know Darien Williams 30 years old almost Right Hes not But I but you know a guy thats had a lot of success Darien Williams was at Nevada was Mountain West Freshman of the Year State next year under Steve Alford Little high low action under Steve Alford Transfers to Texas Tech Has some big time games especially in the NCAA tournament Will Wade has a team to be reckoned with as well Yeah And thats what hes calling it I guess I was thinking in terms of ACC some of the top players were showing that a couple of them are right here in this league from that list But you know that theyre going to be a tough team to be reckoned with I think as well this year too You know not only those guys that we just mentioned Shelton Henderson down at the University of Miami Hes another guy that was a top 25 top 30 kid He was committed to Duke but when Jay Lucas took the Miami job he followed Jay down to Miami So thats uh thats going to be an interesting one Hes this big you know imposing small forward 23 type of player uh that really kind of fills the same role as Dames Sar does here Hes just a little bit bigger across the shoulders but how about Boozer Yep 35 points ties for second most by a Duke freshman Okay And how about double doubles right 30 point double doubles His father he only got one and it was his 94th game of his career against Virginia He had 33 and 10 And he got Cameron here in his fourth game of his freshman season with a 30point double double 35 and 11 Dont tell me what to do Dad How about that Thats incredible Bet you if you ask Carlos hes going to just say Oh man Hes better than me Further along where I You know what I mean Like props that he would probably give his son with what hes done so far up to this point Wow Absolutely And you know Camerons been incredible today And I sometimes I feel like because hes Cams brother Kaden gets overlooked a lot like hes another really good player and hes not going to have these giant outbursts these you know 33 35 point games but he hes a guy whos going to make his teammates better consistently and like that that attributes to winning right Hes a winning player but both of them are but they do it in different fashions and it shows a lot You know I talked to several different head coaches around the country and I I talked to Fermans Bob Richie and it stuck out to me Hes like If I can recruit a guy whose dad or mom played division one basketball it makes it my job a lot easier cheering because theres been a certain amount of conditioning with these younger players that they know what to expect No better example than the Boozer brothers here Oh yeah Well and in that example that you mentioned its usually you know the family because everybodys played that you know theyre so good You know what Im saying Like youre always like Oh hes really good Yeah Well his mom played his dad played I mean that you just already have that mentality from when you first grew up you know and you want to be just as good as they were you know So theres a lot of that And you know I have a son I think the biggest thing when it comes to guys that have played before they let their kids be coached and Carlos obviously you want to talk about jacked Yeah My man was jacked on some really good teams here at Duke I mean national championship team Its understandable how Cameron comes in comes from somewhere Yeah Looking this way right But I mean they let their kids be coached Like thats thats the biggest thing that coaches have told me over the last you know two or three years since Ive been jumping into media Like if theres a child or a a young recruit whose parents played Im going to zero in on that guy because hes been talked to a certain way and he understands what it takes recruiting at Duke right I mean you probably just have to make sure you get the alumni base and all their children that have coming up through the ranks I mean that that makes half your job probably easier right I mean that its not a hard cell I would think Yeah I mean its whats not to love And especially the focus there was a shift in Coach Ks focus to get guys that are willing to be one and done And and people dont remember like that was a big deal a while ago like whens he going to make the jump and not have these Thats right Right Whens he going to make the jump and not have these you know fouryear players guys that hang around And there was a bit of a talent gap and and Sh even alluded to that today talking about todays recruiting not that time but like theres a talent gap If youre trying to get these one and done like whenever Kay made that shift they got back to where they were really really good again That was a big deal Thats a great point People forgot that he wanted them here for four years right And that and that youre right you would not they would not be able to go early Uh obviously we know what hes done Uh and when you make that shift like you said youre now in line with everybody else because thats whats happened Yep And its a its a balancing act right now with these freshman Do you take these young talented freshman or do you go in the transfer portal You get these older players and while there might be a talent gap sure Like you know what youre getting and like thats the balance right now especially at this level like how do you go about it You know you talk about Seion James and whenever he came last year from two lane physically mature could help right away and fit alongside that team perfectly cheering Look at this student section You got the You got the free Hogy or something right Thats why theyre going nuts right The free Hogy Yeah And you miss two free throws to the opponent His at Harris Teter post game Theyre fired up Alub tries sort of and uh picked up and a foul as Gun Buzz going to go to the free throw line Yeah And you talk about getting transfers right Well Duke doesnt do that all as I mean they got Brown is from Syracuse but its a second year with Duke Sure You got the four true freshman The other five have been around this program from last year I mean its taking the right guys and its not having an entirely new team like weve seen that around the country too I mean they they do have they do have some transfers like Jack Scouts from Princeton but he understands his role and what hes here to do Sure And a couple from Rice Sure And you know Cameron Sheffield But yeah you know if you do take a transfer you have to pretty much know exactly what youre going to do with them whenever they come in cuz they could ruin it now right you know expectations are at a certain point Its its an almost impossible puzzle to figure out yet John Sh has absolutely nailed it for four years now What an incredible transition right I mean oh tough hit there as Jamena goes right into Aloin to shoot Yeah that didnt look good My goodness Yeah Bruno Elephant banged up there after that hit That was a collision right there Mhm Looks like hes going to be okay Well take a look at it right here Look thats just all out hustle Oh man to the leg He was just trying to go for the ball But yeah nothing dirty there Saturday college football coming your way tomorrow right here on the ACC network We got all hosting Virginia tomorrow Fun game Yep Sar crew here in town Theyre at the game tonight Mike Monaco with Kirk Morrison and Don Davenport on the call tomorrow Thats on ESPN 2 Tony Elliot was my moms neighbor when he lived in Clemson Really Yeah Side note Okay Super nice guy Sons a really good basketball player actually Ethani Ufu cheering checks in getting some minutes Graduate student of Nigeria number 15 Taken away here is Ian Scott Nice little push off right there You see that You alluded to like Hey hey Ian Yeah Ian Scott is going to be like an absolute killer in Missouri Valley Its just so unorthodox Yeah Well and and its its tough obviously against Duke here tonight but he averages a double double right Coming into this game he had 14 and 10 And he is going to be a threat for Indiana State this year And this guy too shot the ball well early Going to be able to keep that pace up Thats Wagner there who has incredible range cheering Nice little hop step for the two by Kaden Boozer A hop skip and a jump by Kaden Boozer Good to call his name I think your points taken right I mean hes going to do so many good things that you know maybe will get overlooked a little bit by his brother but I mean hes certainly a force you know to be with as well a point guard who knows how to play and is willing to let the ball go And that is so valued What a nice shot there Marcus Harding and a timeout 312 to go Duke up big Well be back Other guys Its been the booze crews all day today baby Cameron booze Yeah Like its uh its amazing really how hes able to impact the game on so many levels I say Oh what a shot Thats Harris He can do that He can do that Well there was a threepoint contest that Duke had in their little version of Midnight Manis if you will you know a little while back He hit 17 threes in a row Darren Harris I mean cheering sick Two and a half to go They have just been swarming on defense and applause like the the collective cheering size Theres two for a dollar again Harris this got out of hand quick Indiana State started off hit a couple of threes There was some confidence going How about that First backto back 100 plus point games in eight years for Duke Another block A fuuku on the block Now into him on the offensive end Duke has 47 assists in the last two games including 22 here tonight Just sharing the basketball and you know when you have so many guys watch out Oh nice play here from Enel St Bernard St Bernard thats what he does He lives at the rim Just an aggressive rim attack guy Well you talk about all the assists Duke only 12 turnovers to go alongside 22 assists So there were some things they could clean up For example that lob pass that Caleb Foster tried to make You know theres some small things Theres going to be some teachable moments here but the general unselfishness has been just off the charts good Now Duke has coming up Kansas 4 days from now on ESPN at 900 on the 18th You We saw the schedule I mean yeah I wonder if if Darren Petersons going to play in that game Went down with strained hamstring Curious to see if he plays He just a really talented You could have two of the top three picks in the NBA draft in that game Indiana States going to go home for a couple Louisiana Tech and Ball State come into their arena First ever time theyve played Duke here Kind of what you might have expected coming in and Duke has delivered 40 seconds left Get Jack Scott a shot right here instead of Oh here he is There you go The rebound Good pass out to the top Its a three and no good Rebound Scott off the Cameron Sheffield miss And theyre going to just hold it up here and finish this one off cheering 50 and3 now at home under coach Shier 19 wins in a row here in Cameron Indor And no doubt here tonight 10062 over Indiana State The number four team in the country is 40 Nice performance Started out a little slow the fullcourt pressure and
