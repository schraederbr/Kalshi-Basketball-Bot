including six by their true center Giovani Emajuru He will jump center against Henry Vasar and we are underway here in Chapel Hill This is an Carolina team that struggled a little bit throughout the course of the season on the offensive the floor They do their best work when they force turnovers If you take care of Jordan Riley in the half court sets you should be okay And Majuru takes up a lot of space inside dealing with Bayasar who picks up his first personal foul And when you go up against Emmauru he is a load on the interior Broad shoulders strong frame This guy can really carve out some space on the interior If youre Henry Basar you have to do a nice job moving your feet throughout the course of this game or hes going to eat you alive This guy is big hes strong hes physical and hes been a double double machine this year Every bit of 610 262 a senior from England playing for his fourth school in four years Sam Houston State then Sienna then George Mason and as you say Tio averaging about 14 points and nearly 10 rebounds per game Well for the second game in a row Carolina has its starting unit intact with the return of Seth Trimble Ky Evans at the point and coming off the bench since the return of Trimble is Jiren Stevenson with the bogots all the way to the basket Nobody picked him up and he laid it in I love the pace the Montenegrron guard plays with coming off a ball screen Little hesitation and those long steps can guide him all the way to the cup A brief stoppage and now we are set to go at the point for East Carolina Cory Cocker hes a junior from Sterling Virginia and he has been part of the issue shooting the basketball only 25 You got to have better than from everybody on the floor and especially your point guard and a guy that was a first team allAmerican in the junior college ranks Uh they rely on him to the ball a little bit better Just hasnt been able to find his range so far this year But what he does is take care of the basketball and get them into their sets Here he is with the basketball with a shot clock at two and he misfires on his first attempt aturu now picks up the foul and what should be a fun battle to watch between bigs cheering Theres Michael Schwarz the fourth year head coach at East Carolina Hes a 49yearold Southern California native who is very much out of the coaching tree of the great Rick Barnes He was with him at the University of Texas as a walkon player also coached on staff both there and at Tennessee and theyre in constant contact still I think coach Schwarz is fantastic Plays hard on the defensive end He recruits very much in the same vein as coach Barnes did at Tennessee And youre going to see the toughness of this team Theyre going to be on the floor Theyre going to play hard Theyre always in the mix But thats just good scramble offense by the Tar Hills Bivox off the nice feed from Basar Hes got all four Carolina points East Carolina playing without five of its players due to injury So a bigger role lately for number 43 in black Luke Davis Hes a native son from nearby Greenville First block of the night for Caleb Wilson who dribbles up right to the bucket Trimble and he will shoot a pair You want to talk about igniting the break Freshman Caleb Wilson Unbelievable length And one of the great things about this young man standing right at 610 The recovery speed doesnt leave his feet the first time Now he gets the rebound and he can ignite the break him break himself Excellent advance pass to the uber athletic Seth Trimble who lives at the foul line Foul on Tybo Bailey you know for Carolina fans its been refreshing to get not just two bigs back on the floor together as has been historically what Carolina has done But Coach Davis has two great bigs who are working in tandem And it seems to me Tio that Vasar and Wilson just keep getting better together as the season goes on I think theres such a mismatch especially with Vasar a guy who can handle the ball in a pick and roll at seven feet tall And then Caleb Wilson being that lob threat They just have so many different guys that can be your primary decision maker And over the last couple of years Cubert Davis who went small last season hes like Well Im going to put pressure on the paint This season that has not been the cheering case Carolina big across the board Caleb Wilson on top of the fact that hes 610 a 1 athlete Hes been that good all season Reed Kase off the ECU bench Misfires on the turnaround BSR had it for a moment picked up by Kase Stolen away by Caleb Wilson And here he comes The man who leads the nation now with 37 dunks Makes it 72 Carolina How about the length on his strides right there Just calm cool and collected in transition Guard comes in Doesnt matter Just a really good basketball player Good call Traveling violation takes away the easy bucket Lets take another look at Caleb Wilson Yeah wrong team Caleb Wilson though The composure here Youre Bailey Probably just chest him up early I would do it out there near that third hash mark Get there Put your chest on him At least make the finish tough How many times in his first 12 games as a college player has it felt like he has the ability to overwhelm a basketball game with all that he can do fouled on the drive by Bogavox I mean Wilsons name already two months not even two months into his college career at a place like Carolina When you start stacking up what he is doing averaging nearly 20 points and nearly 11 rebounds per game and the consistency with which hes done it it really is shocking the names in Carolina Lure that he is already next to Oh theres no question And heres the thing too He hasnt really developed his game beyond the threepoint line And the shots not broken Its going to continue to get better and better with added reps I I mean the things hes capable of doing And you see whenever youre thrown into the same conversation as the late great Tyler Hanssboro well not late Hes still around I I say all that to say this Hanssboro you get thrown in the same sense as my man Like youre doing something right And K Wilson so far this year Absolutely terrific in all facets except for that threepoint line And that part of his games coming Doug Four of 14 so far for Wilson Bogots gets one out of two from the line Carolina scored the last eight points in the game to take this sixpoint lead Isaiah Mbang sophomore PTOIC Maryland into the game feeds it inside but the miss by Emmauru Oh great pass Pass deflected out of bounds Meanwhile the Carolina defense doesnt get probably nearly as much conversation but it this year has been good Theyve yet to give up a field goal so far tonight and they have had lock down stretches all year long Well the most remarkable part is and you saw it on that possession with so much size and shot blocking on the interior Theyre second in college basketball in twopoint percentage defense at 41 You dont score when you get in music the paint against this Tar Hills team and Hubert Davis Whenever you add those guys in like a Caleb Wilson who can come over on help like Henry Basar who can move his feet at that size you see how effective theyve been over the last four Top 10 in overall defensive field goal percentage VSR keeps his pivot Extra pass to the corner Heres Trimble cheering Wilson fights for it Goes back up off the back iron Vasar keeps it alive And Majuru had it knocked out of his hands Carolina the last to touch Although Vasar wants them to take another look hes not convinced but it will be East Carolina basketball The balls already been inbounded Whoevers doing film over there on the side You talk about a high pressure job Yeah That better be good They dont dont mess up Thats right You know having calling called Hornets games over the past three years like I dont know that anybody has more pressure on him than the video guys right Strong rebound First shot attempt by Jordan Riley who comes in ninth in the country averaging 22 points per cheering and applause game Dangerous pass from Basar Nice job by Evans to go into the paint Trimble in the corner finds Bayasar cutting to the bucket and on the reverse he lays it in First two points for the sevenfooter from Estonia Riley his midrange game is as good as you will see basketball Pogots had it knocked away East Carolina basketball Bailey Nice extra pass This is where East Carolina struggled You get these opportunities you have to be able to knock them through So far have not been able to do it First immediate timeout of the ball game and the Tar Hills looking for their six dunk in the final 10 seconds It just doesnt happen but it had to come off a broken play Absolutely I mean just just a really tough game uh for North Carolina And this young man Derek Dixon has played really really well as of late Shooting a good ball from three standing about 65 He just understands how to play Freshman from Vienna Virginia feeds Trimble into the baseline Big cheering strides along the baseline for two My goodness what a euroep Trimble He just has so much power in his lower body He changes direction You see it on the defensive end every possession but offensively he gets inside 8 ft Just a tough tough cover Nice shot First made bucket of the night for East Carolina First points for the Pirates in over five minutes and it snaps a 12 nothing Carolina run makes his way down the lane rises up Nice job defensively by Luke Davis to meet him near the rim Derek Dixon getting into the lane Terrific pass to the corner and this power right here The change of direction and the stride He had to have covered 9 to 11 ft something like that I mean the elasticity in his lower body the flexibility to be able to cover that much space along with that lower body strength I mean just so impressive And you talk about what you miss whenever he was out for an extended period of time with that left arm injury Uh defensive point of attack defender obviously but he brings another element in transition with how fast he plays and you see him attacking the rim and how athletic he is at that point And on top of all that Terrence the senior from Monomin Falls Wisconsin is truly the leader of the team Hes been here four years Hes the captain Nice helpside rejection by Stevenson into the game at 610 The junior from right here in Chapel Hill with his first moment to shine here in the Dean Dome tonight Nice job Jonathan Pal getting over a little bit late shore but understanding if youre the primary defender youre not going to be the guy that blocks the shot You got to get in front Kelpsides going to be able to come over and help you out Jiren Stevenson at 610 able to get there More of the size for the Tarheel Shot clock down to five from the short corner missed by Riley And if East Carolinas going to have any kind of chance tonight a theyve got to turn the Tarheelss over which ECU has been able to do at times this year But Michael Schwarz needs to get Jordan Riley going again Hes averaging nearly 22 points per game Still scoreless here tonight Seth Treble I mean he might not be quite Oh my Everything but the finish for Jonathan Powell And here comes Riley back the other way for ECU Protects the ball like its a football Cant get it to go Carheels back the other way Powell has numbers Throws it up to the rim And Mr Wilson with yet another slam cheering dunk Hello Caleb Wilson both of his field goals so far tonight on slams Hes got five points Another rebound and the precocious freshman dribbles up Personal foul on Luke Davis Carolina gets out in transition and it is death Terrific pass by Jonathan Pal And Caleb Wilson understands I give it up Ill get it back Thats two hands for safety just such a talented young man Every bit of 610 his ability to get out and run that athleticism Theres been a lot of conversation about Darren Peterson Kim Boozer AJ Debansa When the NBA draft comes up hes going to be in the conversation for the number one overall coach He has played as well as any freshman clearly in the country through the first couple of months of the season Heres Dixon Steps inside dumps it off Stevenson right to the rim Come on Derek Dixon With all the athletes that Carolina has on the floor the ball is swung Fundamental shot fake and a bounce pass Whens the last time you saw a clean bounce pass Ive never been so fired up for a bounce pass laughter Thats just good hoop right there And he was under control Played off of two feet Wasnt hurried up Thats the scouting report Guy knows ball I like it Jonathan Powell picks up his first sophomore from Centerville Ohio Off the bench for Hubert Davis again tonight Tybo Bailey with the basketball Back to the point guard Cory Cawker Fairfax Christian High School Tell you what the spacing for VCU struggling a little bit They have many times had five guys and thats a good shot Fine But a lot of times theyve had five guys on one side of the floor Carolina doing a terrific job defensively of scout team defense And Derek Dixon keeping it simple Hes your guy from the midrange First two points 65 freshman a top 60 recruit out of Gaga High School in Washington DC Was a Gatorade player of the year in Washington DC last season Plays with his head up keeps it simple Excellent pass Just offer saw he didnt have numbers Pulls it back out Just really good defense Just taken away by Powell And then Bogavox whos gotten off to a quick start here tonight is fouled Derek Dixon is turning into one of my favorite players Look at this Keep it simple Easy bounce pass Nothing music Easy finish for Stevenson Then turn down to ball screen midrange over and out provide value within your conference schedule So last year a lot of teams Wake Forest in particular were like Well we dont have opportunities in the league to improve our resume No longer the case with 10 teams in the top 60 now that were starting to get out of nonconference play Massive massive for the league Virginia already won its game tonight No trouble with American which preceded ours here on ACC Network Meanwhile how about number 44 in white at the free throw line Luca Bogots Over the last couple of games he had one made field goal First five minutes tonight two field goals and back to the free throw line Wired as a scorer he was at SC Derby last year Averaged close to 15 points a game Thats in Montenegro in the Adriatic League That league known for its fundamentals known for its execution for its scouting play slower than the American College game Its been an adjustment for him to understand you have to be in gear the entire contest Sometimes those things take a little while I understand he was a pro Style of play is huge Seven points lead all scorers tonight Riley that was a twopoint try Foot was on the line Dixon at the point out there with Stevenson Bovots Vasar back in there and Jonathan Powell Five on the floor for the Heels Giving up a lot of size trying to defend that post pass was Isaiah Embang who picks up the personal And Embang you get caught on a switch and thats a tough situation to be in if youre 62 183 lbs going up against Stevenson whos Ola 610 Y the big thing you have to know is somebody has my back behind I need to move my feet and get around The second you reach and youre at a disadvantage guarding a bigger player youre going to get that foul call Get in front rely on your help side behind you especially when the balls being entered from the 45 And he is a very good defender Yes As his older brother Bezang whos in the G League now twotime Ivy League defensive player of the year Last year the overall player of the year in the Ivy at Yale But like you say when youre 61 trying to defend somebody whos 610 theres only so much you can do So youre saying defense is genetic My kids are screwed laughter Theyve got no shot So youre saying you were not known for your defense at Clemson Its not why I got paid buddy Not at Clemson but afterwards Riley on the board finally took him nearly 10 minutes against this Carolina defense I mean you see the build for Jordan Riley Off to a slow start so far today but just really strong athletic huge hands Hes had his third stop couple of years at Georgetown where he said he learned toughness Then a year at Temple and now in his second year at ECU Carolinas lead grows to 268 thanks to the shot from Jonathan Powell Its my second game here in Chapel Hill and I love watching Jonathan Powell play every time more and more And his stats arent loud but he understands spacing He can shoot the ball Nice duck in by He understands spacing He can knock down shots Doesnt turn the basketball over and he defends And when you have a threeheaded monster like Vasar Wilson and Treble you need those other guys to play well Y hes been knocking down threes at a remarkable rate 45 coming into the game Fantastic But back to Pal you need that ancillary scoring Theres going to come a game towards the end of the season Its going to be Power It could be JD Young Its going to have to be one of those two guys to hit big shots Darcy picks up the miss by Riley Shot clock at 15 835 left to go in the first half here at the Dean Smith Center Patty Darcy missires And here comes Carolina The Tarheelss have had seven different players score so far tonight including Basar draws the double finds the open man in the corner and Emmauru clears the miss How about the pass Well when youre 7 ft double team by two guys who are 6 in shorter it makes it a little easier to see over it Oh well theres no doubt but you still got to get it done And that is a strong man Emmauru at 260 lbs Discarded the sevenfooter like he wasnt even there plays basketball like a Clydesdale All power man Him a jewelry He is one strong individual But Im not talking about that Im talking about Carolina music Swing it to the other corner Jonathan Pal corner pocket Thats good Just continuing to move the basketball Pick and pop fiveman music pretty good into a similar score Theres Jeff Lebo the former Tarheel arguably the greatest shooter in program history Whoa Back on staff with Thats a long list right there But hes in the mix Hes in the conversation And you see if East Carolina is to come back tonight like they did a week ago against Buffalo and win the ball game it would be huge news First time in this instate rivalry All right It was a heck of a jacket that Levo was rocking Jeff back at his alma mater on staff with Hubert Davis who Hubert as well would also be in that conversation for greatest absolute shooting Tarheel of all time Emma who had six dunks their last time out against Presbyterian has two in the last minute against Carolina Give him eight points to lead the Pirates He lives inside six feet Hes not going to venture outside The only shot that hes going to take thats not a dunk or a layup is from the free throw line He He knows what hes good at and he attacks the basket If youre Vasar you have to do a good job continuing to move your feet Here goes East Carolina a little bit Oo Bailey force his first bucket makes it 2916 We were talking off mic in between our last segment about the fact that Carolina has come into this game very much focused and has been very workmanlike We talked in the open about you know Christmas is 3 days away Sure students are gone You know youre going to get a 4day break coming up Would they be focused Coach Davis has had his team ready to go but coming out of that last timeout seems like maybe theres a little slippage ECU making a run You see six unanswered points Caleb Wilson back into the game calling for the ball being defended by the 62 in Tybo Bailey And Calebs wondering why is the ball not coming around to the other side to find me Trimble keeps working able to get to the bucket for a layup And heres the great part about that possession because Trimble dribbles out and Basar brings his man out Theres no shot blocking for ECU Trimble without help side from a bigger player able to get an easy look Darcy good looking stroke on the three The freshman from Adelaide Australia has his first points tonight Carolina turns it over The Pirates have a little momentum here little energy They thrive off their defense whenever they create turnovers and they can play fast Thats how they generate their rhythm Well they forced 19 turnovers Wednesday in the win over Presbyterian They forced a ton of turnovers especially in the second half against Buffalo in their two most recent wins Carolina now with three turnovers in the first 14 minutes tonight 10 to shoot Nope cheering Wilson says Give me that Then coughed it up Yep And thats an over and back violation It was right in front of us Bill Cington made the right call Good hustle Terrific defensive possession Caleb Wilson staying in front of the guard tries to go behind the back and Wilsons the last person to have possession It goes back over Thats a good call by Bill Cup Really good officiating crew here in Chapel Hill tonight Trimble caught the ball from the back court before he had established himself in the front court Correct So if hes jumping over it doesnt matter your body position if you havent gotten on the ground yet Uhoh Bad pass by Emuru over the head of Cocker and out of bounds Second turnover committed by the Pirates 534 to go in the half 3119 North Carolina over East Carolina with Terrence Oglesby Im Doug Sherman Glad youre with us on this Monday night in Chapel Hill Final regular season nonconference game for both of these teams ECU will take on Twain on New Years Eve Trimble makes the bucket and then had something to say with somebody on the East Carolina bench I got the sense that maybe their feet got tangled Eight points now for Trimble a little bit Really nice move Ken Evans Good defensive possession Tough shot now Now Carolinas dangerous Trimble gets the rebound He can push the pace Theyre so quick in their decisionm When you have a trail shooter like that it just adds a different element to the North Carolina Tarheelss applause Vars a perfect two for two from distance so far tonight Strong side help cant happen Tremble over on the side gets his feet tangled up and says a little something Dont worry about that Referees Tony Chiazi hes going to handle that and Bazar the next time down gets a trail three Th this Carolina team when theyre playing fast and with rhythm it just changes what they can do on the offensive end of the floor So dangerous when theyre playing quickly So Caleb Wilson was called for his first foul Call on the floor North Carolina common foul Plays in review for a potential flagrant Oh they have it over the loudspeaker I love that They want to make sure 19000 people can boo at them Thats right So heres Yep And heres the thing He thinks hes getting hooked Caleb Wilson grabs and throws Carolina fans arent going to like what Im about to say but this is initiated by Caleb Wilson Id be shocked if he doesnt get upgraded to a flagrant one Yeah it seems to be the classic hook and hold as the three officials Ron Groover Bill Cington Jr and Tony Chiaza have their discussion and and if youre Caleb Wilson you dont have to do that Shots already off It looks like were going to excessive or and and or unnecessary I think this qualifies here Have to review the common foul North Carolina will be upgraded to a flagrant one foul East Carolina will have two shots in the ball And I actually think thats the right call Doug I I excessive little unnecessary Heres the thing if he just spins off Were going to take another look right here See number two Isaiah Mbang Hes just trying to hold his ground Is he holding around a little bit Sure But hes given up 8 in and about 30 lbs Like if youre Caleb Wilson just spin off Put yourself in position for the offensive rebound On the other side of that last shot though was Wilsons arm being hooked I no I it to me and Im not saying the call is incorrect but I can understand the frustration if he was being hooked on the other side I dont think his arms were if were going to take one more look at it and I do think that first one maybe but he grabs a hold with his right hand cheering and with that throwing motion to me no doubt I play one I I agree with the officiating crew here and I was just saying I can understand the frustration if he was being absolutely held on the other side but as you said you just cant do it Yep So one out of two from the line for Embang on the flagrant one East Carolina the basketball down by 17 Riley after the good rip through coming from the weak side always is number eight in white His head was at the rim Doug Sherman this is an athlete Lets take another look My goodness Im going to take my frustration out on the defensive end And as a helpside shot blocker he could be an allAmerican volleyball player Well between Wilson and Vasar youve always got to assume if theyre both on the floor one of them is coming from the weak side But a great defense by the primary defender to keep Jordan Riley from extending all the way up Ive been impressed with Carolina defensively today I mean so far only giving up 20 points 8 for 26 is ECU from the field Scout scouting team defense been really good Theyre pre switching a lot of these things Carolina really locked in and focused Another good one with the timer down Thats of course turnover by this UNCC defense By the way Caleb Wilson now with three block shots so far tonight Three of the four for the Tarheelss against Mike Schwarzs ECU Pirates Well it has been a struggle all year for ECU shooting the basketball They are next to last in the country in threepoint shooting percentage Only 26 only Ryder University is worse amongst the 365 D1 schools right now And then when you face a superior defensive team Emma Juru is going to be called for the foul When you face a team like Carolina that has defended so well and is engaged like this it makes it that much tougher Absolutely right And heres the thing too about East Carolina You know last game they beat Presbyterian six dunks by then Emma excuse me So youre getting everything around the cup the game prior where they got down big against Buffalo they were able to get the game into a track meet because they were getting turnovers live ball turnovers and playing in the open floor They just havent been able to get enough stops for that to be a consistent thing Heads up I think Wilson will gladly trade the free throw for a dunk Seven points for the freshman from Atlanta By the way that last foul was on Patty Darcy not on Emuru And there is some of the athleticism we talked about from Jordan Riley able to get to the rim You know when we asked him after shootound this morning have you played your last football game There was a twinkle in his eye He did when he says noticeable I I am not going to put that thought to bed He could play professionally in basketball for years to come but football is certainly a pop All right thank you guys Back in Chapel Hill can confirm we just try to get out of the way but my emotions wont let me Really Whenever Caleb Wilson has a dunk like that or Dixon has a bounce pass Uh well that your emotions can get the better of you Im an emotional fella Nothing dunks like a Wilson scorned How about that Youre on fire laughter Now Wilson has three block shots His careerhigh is four He did that against North Carolina Central Fighting for position on the baseline out of bounds out there with Trimble Stevenson Wilson has it taken away by Reed Yeah really good defense by Reed Kase And they try to find Emuru inside And just into the ball game James Brown is going to be called for the personal foul His first the sophomore from Aurora Illinois and he is just another big body for Hubert Davis Again the positional size was a problem the last couple of years addressed from top to bottom on the roster for UNCC this year Mbang misfires Here comes Trimble Wilson draws the second defender who knocks it away Cocker with the steel Now dribbles up for ECU Riley nice into the lane finds the wide open Man they cant buy one Wing shooter who missed it cheering Kase able to finally get the ball to go through the cylinder I I mean Taylor Wilsons length in his second jump He can go for the first ball fake and then land it and get back off the floor so quickly How about the elevation on that from Trimble Nobodys blocking that shot Hes into double figures with 10 fantastic athlete Hes done a remarkable job far on Jordan Riley Two of 12 Very uncharacteristic app Man the length of Caleb Wilson is insane He is bothering everything Hes blocking shots threepoint shots That doesnt happen all that often Blocking threepoint shots deflecting passes and hes the primary defender and hes getting the passes because of his length and activity Yeah One thing that I think surprised a lot of folks coming into the season is how hard he plays all the time All the time He was the guy that was engaged at shootaround today And Hubert Davis raved about it They werent talking quite loud enough And Caleb Wilson was the guy led the charge of bringing the volume up a little bit And Im not saying they were relaxed because they were having individuals before shootound They brought it Were looking ahead to a womens basketball double header on ACCN Monday the 29th Hannah Hadalgo number 18 Notre Dame hosting pit in music Southbend at 6 Eastern And then India Navar leads number 16 North Carolinas balanced attack against music Boston College at Connie Forum Both are also available on the ESPN Couple of free throws for Wilson who now has nine points He has gone for 20 or more in each of the last four games And the star freshman will take a seat with 224 remaining in the half Doug your call about a workmanlike performance Spot off I mean theyve attacked the rim Theyve def theyve defended and positionally theyve been excellent defensively Other than the one blit coming out of the under eight timeout when ECU I think had six unanswered points Carolina hasnt blinked 100 And its been the attention to detail thats impressed me the most You know these scouting report defenses sometimes guys will lose a little bit of focus You get a few turnovers you want to get out and run leak out a little bit Carolina has not shown that so far today And again it was a quick scout on the turnaround from Saturday afternoons win over Ohio State in Atlanta They did have a full practice here at the Smith Center yesterday and then had their walk through today And the guys certainly are locked in so far tonight Three to shoot Embank trying to create That is a tough shot with Powell right in his grill Vasar perfect two for two from three Make it three out of three so far tonight This is Carolinas largest lead of the ball game And Emmauru not accustomed to guarding a guy like VSR who can step out and shoot with consistency Three of three today and all three of them have been walking Davis a little strong And Majuru with his third dunk Hes got 10 points to lead East Carolina And Majuru defensively meets Trimble Itll be Carolina ball Hey hes impressive right And heres the thing Hes going to have to get out and guard on the perimeter Vasar Emu a little bit too strong on the help And Vasar just enough room at 7 ft tall That balls up high Davis Bertton who played in the NBA for a long time from Latapia Kind of the same shooting for high release point Both had good side I I I think Vasar is a little bit better of a player to be honest with you Bovots misses twice Here comes Riley with his head up Always has at least four eyes on him Gets the shot up against two defenders And then the foul on the rebound Fouls going to be on Davis trying to get an offensive rebound I Ive been really impressed with Imaguru though I I mean this is a guy from England has obviously the English passport Hes going to play in Europe for a long time if you have that kind of size and physicality And the big thing is too knowing what youre good at not trying to play outside of that right Mike Schwarz has a beast on the block That understands Im not going to try to get out outside of what I do And what I do is dunk it Yep Averaging about 14 points a game nine rebounds 16 blocks per game But he can score I mean two years ago at Sienna he put 30 on Manhattan And if you give him any space within 5T hes going to score I mean how many people are that big in that in the metro Atlantic or on the planet laughter You see it tonight really good tonight Hes the only guy can find any kind of rhythm and its just because he has such a strength advantage over anybody he plays against Final 45 seconds of the half North Carolina up by 21 on East Carolina with the ball Here is their captain Jordan Riley out of Brentwood New York Thats on Long Island Tremble after the double team with the steel trying to score on Cocker And he does cheering So strong You know Seth Treble you see him on TV and youre like man that kid looks strong you see him in person like Im not saying he has Saquon Barkley type thighs but Im not not saying it Hes so strong in the open floor Theyre trying to bounce him off Just doesnt work Hes terrific 5 seconds to go in the half Cocker finds Darcy Got a good look to close out the half but East Carolina came up empty Its been all North Carolina here through 20 minutes at the Dean Lets send it back to the studio Taylor take it away Smiles all around for the Tar Hills in that first half Seth Treble also playing well but that four five combination is good as any four five combination in all of college basketball Why do they I mean theyre both very very talented but why specifically do VSR and Wilson seem to fit so well together and play off each other so well Its because they have guardlike skill I I think thats first and foremost You can use them in so many different ways Uhoh Hog puts it back in Hes got nine points And if you want to drive coach Mike Schwarz crazy come out of the half two offensive He comes from the Rick Barnes School of Toughness and I actually think thats a good call off arm by Emituru But if youre gonna come out you need to come out with a certain level of toughness Hes a Rick Barnes guy right Cant give up offensive rebounds against a team as talented as North Carolina And I am burning up in this sweater Unbelievable I mean this Carolina team how well theyre playing moving the basketball Now we got a moving screen Little bit of a stagnant start Well the toughness for Mike Schwarz goes before his relationship with coach Barnes His mom Lynn Rubin her married name now is Leer along with his best friend younger brother Mark are as tight as a family can be And in talking this morning with Mike about it he lights up when talking about his moms journey as a refugee in the 60s from the Middle East Wound up in Southern California She worked so hard in retail and eventually owned a sweater shop in downtown Los Angeles to make sure that her two boys would never be wanting for anything Bill Gavox hits the three And so with that applause enabled Mike to go to Beverly Hills High School enabled him to go to college to Soma State And it was at that point he realized well Im not going to make the NBA I want to get into coaching Got himself to Austin Texas where the Rick Barnes relationship took off Coach Barnes he says is a father figure to him But mom and brother are watching the ACC Network right out in Los Angeles Hello to them Brother and your son is thinking of you every moment of the day Passionate being is Mike Schwarz Not only about his family about his team His mothers toughness runs through him Yep Its a great story though Mike told us about Mark early today Says Hes my best friend He lives it with me And hes been in this building with his brother multiple times Of course Coach Schwarz as an assistant at the University of Miami under Frank Hate had been in this building and then had also been here as an assistant at Tennessee So his brother has been here with him but watching from the West Coast tonight Air ball by Bovox Holds his hand up and says my fault Bad shot Out of bounds untouched Back to East Carolina Yeah and thats a shot that you probably live with in Europe but here Id like to see the ball change sides of the floor at least a couple of times And when youre a shooter like that youre going to take a bad one or two every so often but let that ball find the energy for you dont have to force the issue Cocker still scoreless at the point for ECU Wilson dribbles up Wilson with his 10th rebound This one on the offensive glass and he draws the foul I think the right word is relentless I mean hes his activity is unbelievable Talked to Dennis Scott 3D in the studio He said the competitive joy that this young man plays with is just different Wilson out of Atlanta 3D lives in Atlanta Saw him as hes coming up and all these stories about Caleb Wilson having some of the past scouting reports on him where hes fourth fifth sixth in the recruiting rankings He said thats real He said he carries those things around him all the time He plays with a certain edge and a lot of that hes feeding himself constantly I think its pretty cool Well uh who in Carolina lore exactly shares a story similar to that His number 23 is hanging to my left Caleb Wilson takes it personally Kyen Evans has had a quiet night Heres Caleb Wilson filling the lane Missed the layup Emuru clears Here comes East Carolina Nearly three minutes gone here in the second half in this final regular season nonconference game Fourth dunk of the night 12 points for Emuru Just get to the front of the rim And when East Carolinas playing fast they find those spots Nice play Vasar That is a new careerhigh with four made threes tonight 5728 Hes got 14 in counting Thats just terrific pick and roll offense by Luca Bovots Snaking the ball screen getting in the paint Both guys come and hes able to spray back out Just really good snaking it getting to that ACC Immiguru overcommits and you cant do that with Henry Vasar who the two games that Ive had Carolina he has been nothing short of outstanding In the first game he was he was 11 for 12 This game five of six so far He doesnt miss much Carolina fans if you want him to play this well keep inviting me back Well he Im taking the credit Doug As well you should laughter Well he prides himself on his offensive rebounding And he cites Damontes Sabonis of the Sacramento Kings as doing it the right way And again it gets down to the nuts and bolts of the game Yeah its great to score but he does other things very very well Riley on the steel Attacks the big man Tries again No Basar has it again And here comes Carolina Four on three Bogots finds Vasar Fakes the pass Puts it up Cant get the roll And Emmauru grabs the rebound Careful when I like you just did want to take credit for a team in front of you playing well because you know what the flip side of that is Thats right And Majuru able to keep it in bounds Hes a beast Offensive foul Whistle came a little bit late and Jordan Riley cant believe it Im going to be at the JMA Wireless Dome that afternoon for the basketball conference opener between Clemson and Syracuse Ill be happy to be there as our alma moers go headtohead Thats right Where will you be for New Years I will be at the Spectrum Center for the Charlotte Hornets Goets have a game that afternoon Yep Against the Golden State Warriors I assume Steph will play at least hopefully Its bring your kid to work day Dell Curry and Steph both in the same building Im thinking about bringing my son with Terrence Oglesby Im Doug Sherman here at the Dean Dome North Carolina has led throughout Actually East Carolina took a two nothing lead A couple of free throws early but then UNC rattled off 12 in a row First bucket of the night for Kayen Evans the junior from Kansas City makes it 6028 Tarheelss What do you make of Cayenne Evans He had nine scoreless minutes in the first half His role still does not to me seem like its fully defined as hes transferred in from Colorado State Well starkly different And the system fit is very different than where he came from with Nico Medvet whos now at Minnesota coaching Tar Hill transfer Kave Tyson But I digress At at Colorado State he played with Nick Clifford whos now with the Sacramento Kings at Kings And Isaiah Stevens also in the Kings organization he was kind of this secondary tertiary ball handler that was playing off the catch in a little bit more of a motionbased offense Carolinas a much different situation Hes being asked to set things up By the way just people want free throws Crumble cookies for the fans and they get it Merry Christmas But anyhow back to Colorado State in the transition and style of play to here at Chapel Hill And the ball popped and he was able to find things inside their motion def motion offense to find gaps North Carolina calls their sets a lot more often than Colorado State did So there are differences and how these programs play Hes still trying to find his rhythm Last year he shot 44 from three Uh very much trying to pick his spots find where he can effective and be that primary ball handler that Hubert Davis knows he needs And again he was honorable mentioned all mountain west last year with that excellent shooting averaged over 10 per game and has played in the last two NCA tournaments He can play His stellar play alongside Meek Clifford won the Mountain West for Colorado State in the tournament last year in Las Vegas and they end up getting a win in the NCAA tournament He was a big reason why But now the flow of these two offenses are completely different Jordan Riley just has not had his way No he hasnt The senior from Long Island New York has just four points averaging nearly 22 per game He has the highest usage rate in the American Conference among the highest in the country at over 31 But it just has not been his night so far He was one of the many Pirates and with many visiting players when they come into the Dean Dome for the first time And for announcers and fans you immediately look up at the Raptors and uh in talking to Jordan Riley asked him who the players were he grew up idolizing And he said Well Kobe and then that other guy MJ And I said So when you walked in here Jordan Riley misses the shot said Whered your eyes go And uh he kind of just smiled Its like That was a dumb question Of course I looked up to the Raptors to see number 23 And there is Michael Jordans number And then my other obvious question of Jordan Riley were you named for Michael Jordan and he said No the mom and dad didnt do that but uh he does not mind having the first name of George Well hes a terrific player and a lot of what EC ECU does offensively they clear a side out and they let him go to work in the mid post Well today Carolina has been able to match his physicality and theyve been able to throw different looks at him There have been times when Caleb Wilson gets the switch and Seth Trimble has defended him in the post whos might not be as strong but hes right there and hes able to absorb the blows that Riley uses those broad shoulders for And because hes seeing so many different looks and so many different bodies it makes it really difficult for him to find any type of rhythm whatsoever And once they get to conference play which is coming up in their next outing against Tulain theyre not going to face the type of physicality of course that they are facing tonight against North Carolina The teams to look out for in the American Memphis was the preseason favorite Tulsa is the surprise so far at 111 but USF two lane That young man is a monster Not going to be pushed around by anybody 14 now for Emma Hes been the lone ranger for the Pirates And I was curious how it was going to work today because Carolina has all this length You see East Carolinas upcoming schedule Jordan Riley picked preseason first team allAmerican conference Going to have to find some kind of rhythm after today Well against Rowan Bruma in the Green Wave You can see that on ESPNU Brum the preseason player of the year in the American Coach Ron Hunter obviously terrific down there New Orleans Wilson to the rim and hell have a chance for three 11 points as he eyes a potential fifth straight 20point game Nice play off the roll And heres the difference there He catches the ball facing the rim ECU has been sending a guy baseline If he catches it in a little bit more space he faces the rim He knows with the the double teams coming if it ever comes at all But this freshman you know most double doubles by a freshman already in that category today with nine Uh he just processes the game so well He makes a mistake Its seldom you see it made twice during the course of a game applause Another double double today 12 points 10 rebounds He leads the ACC in that category And again the list of Tarheelss on that last graphic it catches your attention Absolutely Its all over the record book already Just 13 games into his career Another near rebound there for Wilson Majuru got himself into trouble Dixon took it away Tarheelss on the run Dixon still with it Cuts it up for Caleb Wilson Freshman to freshman Riley into the lane for two Quick timeout for the Pirates Just really good transition offense by the Tarheelss But Derek Dixon one freshman hes off and running And this Carolina team so good Hangs on to it just long enough He can throw it up And hey Caleb Wilson just place it music in there Thatll be fine And look at this When you talk about Vasar and Wilson what they are doing The last time two Tarheelss in the same season averaged 16 points and nine rebounds it was Lee Schaffer and Doug Mo all the way back in 1959 1960 What a onetwo combination inside for Coach Davis Anytime theres a Lee Schaffer and Doug Mo conversation happening were doing pretty well Also worth mentioning phenomenal flat tops by those two in the bottom right hand Think of the time Late 50s early 60s I mean if only Doug Mo had a Yeah You didnt have to worry about messing up your hair putting the sweater on Thats right Um but Doug Mo had a different look when he was an NBA head coach He did In the 70s and 80s Hair was a little longer Lapels were a little bigger Hes going to learn what the NBA life is after this year I would only assume so I I mean what he does well at seven feet what he does well at seven feet to be able to orchestrate an offense as the hub of the offense for this Carolina team Hes a good passer I Ive just been really really impressed by his ability and and the thing is too you know he comes from Arizona Arizona had him rim running and thats not where hes at Hubert Davis and what his has done for Henry has been phenomenal They let him stop at the three and then whenever he is setting ball screens and rolling to the cup hes doing so with speed because then he can use his athleticism He is a little slight of frame at 7 ft Narrow hips short but if hes attacking the rim with speed he can finish over the top and hes just been wildly impressive over the first few or the over the nonconference season cheering Bogots will have a chance for three Hes got 14 points Nice bounceback performance for the junior from Montenegro Luka Bovas Hes a foreign scorer Finally starting to get a little bit of rhythm The European hang and finish Getting music clothes for Christmas is a is criminal He was all about toys and other stuff And Seth Trimbles child partner agreed saying If I get clothes Im going to the North Pole and suing Santa So lets hope there are no clothes coming up for that child How funny is that But you know Seth has done all sorts of charitable acts both with the team and on his own He has been generous with his time Hosted a Ben and Jerrys holiday party at the Chapel Hill Boys and Girls Club and also handed out JBL headphones And again with these players making the money they do now playing college basketball they are able to be even more generous out of their own pocket along with the time that they give to those in their respective communities I dont think theres any doubt that Seth Trimble is a Carolina man That is big time stuff Well he comes by naturally Folks know his older brother more than a decade ago JP Tokido was a Tarheel and once a Tarheel always a Tarheel just like the entire coaching staff hired by Hubert Davis all former Tarheels And so very much what you said Seth Trimble follows in that Tarheels mold Did you go to his Ben Jerrys down on Franklin Street No but I was thinking about it after the game As a matter of fact might need a pit stop Hey he brings value on the floor too Thats for sure Doug I mean this guy defensively today has been impressive on Jordan Riley whos been on a heater getting to the free throw line a little bit Back comes the help Seth Treble back in the ball game Jordan Riley now with nine points North Carolina has held the Americans leading scorer some 12 13 points under his season average Kimble looks at his feet make sure hes not out of bounds And as he falls out of bounds able to get it back to Dixon Still 10 on the timer Caleb Wilson is fouled on the entry pass Its a reach in against Tybo Bailey his third We have seen this matchup all night Bailey at 62 trying to play post defense against the 610 in Caleb Wilson And the interesting thing about Taibo Bailey I I mean this guy was a top 150 guard coming out of high school Didnt play much last year Now getting some opportunities its just the size and athleticism Whenever he has to switch off on Wilson its overwhelming Riley was bumped by Trimble in what has been the most interesting and entertaining oneonone matchup so far tonight in this ball game So tough when you have to defend a player coming at you full speed You have to do your best to keep him on the side where the extra defenders are at But Riley I mean the acceleration for that young man out of this world And on top of that that foul on Trimble just his first So hes been playing lock down defense without committing fouls And thats what they missed the most when it went down with injury is that point of attack defender the guy who can cut off the ball and off the water quite developed that part of his game Hes always been a terrific transition athlete I saw him play in the Peach Jam Big strong body but the defensive part of what he brings to the table is outstanding And statistically you have been able to measure that growth during his fouryear career here at Carolina He tries to dunk everything He does He and Basar want to dunk everything Caleb already has three dunks tonight Basar steps out puts up an air ball Pirates basketball But Wilson came into the game leading the nation in slam dunks this year Its up to 39 and he couldnt quite get number 40 on that last sequence Majuru hes been good man Also the national leaders in dunks lays that one in Hes got 16 points to lead ECU Hes been the bright spot for this Pirates scene Ill say this Jordan has been a hair away from about five steals Thats a tough move And the the remarkable thing we get we had a chance to talk to him a little bit because hes led the American Conference in steals He went up thinking about dunk and then realized well the rims still over there right He tries to dunk Its unbelievable But Jordan Riley back to back to the point uh we talked like led the American Conference of Seals last year north of two We talked to him a little bit before the game He said You know I learned how to watch film at Georgetown Yeah Right And you can see it He tries to switch early get out in the passing lanes and he just has such good explosion coupled with that wingspan Just terrific find for Mike Schwarz and company who hasnt always played at this high of a level Well he singled out Robert Kirby one of Patrick Yuings assistant coaches in his two years at Georgetown as being instrumental in part of his development He said he he taught him how to watch film Played for Pat Yuing at Georgetown Played for Pat Yuing at Georgetown He said thats where he developed the most I have to make an impact to get on the floor Struggle to get on the floor Started to pick it up watch film asked him what he learned at Temple He said Not a thing laughter Well watching East Carolina tape getting ready for this game as Riley left it short again with the line drive shot The stick back by Reed Kase I kept coming back to a former pirate who played a couple of years in the NBA Elijah Hughes Elijah shoots it Much much better than Jordan Riley But in terms of the ability to get to the basket get to the midrange His body type similar I just kept thinking of him Basar off the pass from Trimble with the flush Hes got 16 points Draw two Dump it through Good hustle by VSR who waits for his teammate to come help him out Treble coming off a pick and roll Im going to hang in the air as long as I need VSR doesnt get much easier than that if youre 7 ft Its been a dominant performance by Carolina Hes talked about growing up in Estonia Swimming was his first sport even after having been afraid of the water But then when you go to be 7 feet although swimmers by long and tall but at 7 feet come on Well he never has to swim cuz his feet are always at the bottom Nice finish It sure was Jordan Riley getting into his bag He now has 11 points Yeah the game last Sunday in the historic come from behind win over Buffalo They were down 21 and came back to beat the Bulls He had 31 and just took over the ball game in the second half Well they were forcing turnovers He had three four steals that game He was able to finish Ty Boas in his head a little bit You get an open shot just take it Dont rush Uhoh Trimble gets it back Wilsons not going to miss this time fourth dunk of the night 19 points applause And Phil Ford who was sitting in the first row is very well aware of the fact that he was the last Tarheel 51 years ago the only freshman ever in program history to have five consecutive 20point ball games And the young man on the floor calling for the ball could get there with one more hoop Carolinas been on fire Caleb Wilson he doesnt look tired He keeps cutting Hes outstanding and finding gaps in the defense music It doesnt get much easier than that Seth Treble easy pass Caleb Wilson easy finish Has ever done that until Caleb Wilson who is five of 11 at the line tonight has a chance for his 20th point right here Is Phil Ford happy to share that title I dont know Theres some ego involved there Heres the deal Theres not a whole lot to pick at Were talking in the break Not a whole lot to pick a pick at with this Tarheel performance but you want your man to hit some free throws Got to knock down Got to knock it down from charity strap Well thats the other thing He gets to the line a ton too and he has made more than five free throws pretty much every game and continues with that So he goes out with his 21 points Dont know if well see him again Seven and a half minutes remaining in regulation as both coaches go a little deeper into their benches Jordan Riley around and out just into the game Jaden Young second time weve seen the Virginia Tech transfer on the floor He gets it up ahead to Powell Isaiah Dennis a freshman from Charlotte had bad intentions on that weak side rebound Couldnt haul it in and bang air balls it Man they theyve really struggled from beyond the arc Jordan Riley is a pest but it has not been his night tonight Carolina everywhere Hes picked up every possession Darcy off the mark And here comes Dennis out of Davidson Day School in Charlotte Out of bounds 631 to go Heres Davis going back to his bench to bring James Brown back in Riley has taken 22 shots so far tonight for East Carolina And Terrence hes made just four Like you said not his night No just so many bodies And you look at his game and if you watch the games before this Jordan Riley can score and he can really score you know 12 to 15 feet out theres just been so much length for Carolina that has bothered him And when you shoot a flat ball like he does like length is going to bother you even more And if I look at his game and what he can continue to improve on he he adds a quality jump shot to where he shoots it from 33 to 36 from three You know this is a guy who can go to Europe use those physical tools play for a long time just because hes wired a certain way and defensively you know we havent seen it so much tonight but outstanding on ball defender Yeah he led the American last year two steals per game Hes averaging that again this year He gets tripped by Powell I like how phys I like how physical Carolinas played defensively I mean youre going to foul Sure Youre going to have to live with those things But Carolina on the defensive end of the floor has been everywhere Jordan Riley nowhere to breathe Brown commits the foul and its a chance for three for the big fella Emuru now with 18 points 18 points now 13 rebounds He is a beast inside teams in the American Conference Giovani Imaguru Jordan Riley You better know who they are whenever you go to Greenville Yeah its a tremendous onetwo punch and uh if coach Schwarz can get the other guys around him to contribute in the manner that he needs them to they can make some noise in the American Nice find in the corner and Powell has a beautiful stroke Seven points for the sophomore and former West Virginia mountaineer Another thing about Jonathan Powells game he has only five turnovers this year in well over 200 minutes So hes got a lot of things going for him coming off the bench for UNCC Well thats what he does I I mean I want to say last year he had 18 turnovers in 963 minutes He had the lowest turnover percentage in the entire Big 12 conference at West Virginia And hes a guy the more you watch him the more you like him 20 points for Majuru Hey what a New Years Eve mens basketball rivalry double header weve got for you right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app beginning at 2 Eastern Ammani Hanssbury and the Hokes take on Tester Ritter and the 21st ranked Cavaliers of Virginia They won earlier tonight And then Wooden Award front runner Camboozer in the sixth ranked Duke Blue Devils will host Georgia Tech Nice way to get ready to ring in 2026 That Virginia team with Tester Ritter Johan Grunlo I I think Virginia a team that we havent talked about enough Ryan ODMs done a terrific job putting together a roster in year one They play fast which has been refreshing to the Virginia Faithful and they really attack the offensive glass That is a fun fun team to watch Tough shot by Riley Long rebound comes out to ECU Now Virginia beat American earlier tonight on ACC Network 95 to 51 Derritter had a careerhigh 27 points And when we talk about the tremendous freshman in the ACC you know who we dont hear enough of is their hometown point guard Chance Mallerie 10 points off the bench five rebounds four assists today a top 100 recruit who decided to stay home and they are so happy in Charlottesville to have him Yeah And he originally committed to Tony Bennett and decided hey I want to stay home be a part of this program and and theyre glad he did I mean you talk about a spark plug He starts now excuse me comes off the bench does a really nice job Good night for the ACC here It Chance Mallerie though small in stature not on game can really play And you know he is small in terms of height but he is thick He looks like a football player Thats right Mbang challenges Brown Out of bounds Pirates will keep 22 seconds on the shot clock Get a look at Zaden High Came out shot the ball a little bit today Hes got a nice looking jump shot Big kind of played his way out of the rotation a little bit A lot of natural tools Well he was a top 80 recruit a fourstar out of San Antonio and another one of the bigs Hubert Davis can go to Tell you what James Brown is not small and he is outsized thoroughly by Emma Jura Oh my goodness Nice move Yeah theyre both listed at 610 Brown is 240 lbs and hes given up 20 in that matchup with Emma Plays hard I I mean Emma Juru I just hard not to be impressed with him how hes constantly working to create angles for himself around the rim And talk about a young man thats put together Well until this year again this is his fourth school in four years He didnt put up big numbers at George Mason last year but two years ago for Carmen Maserella with Sienna he had his best statistical season up until now Averaged over 11 points nearly seven rebounds for the Saints But the young man England as you know very well Terrence will find somewhere overseas Oh theres no question And can play for a long time big guys like that have the passport and people dont understand sometimes you talk about well you got to go over and play in Europe and this that and the third youre only allowed a certain allotment of players from the United States having that passport its a massive plus move Isaiah Dennis on the other end freshman consensus top 80 player was a big time scorer in high Darcy missed it And itll be Pirates basketball When we come back to the Dean Dome conference rivals in unusual places Talk about SMU I I think thats another team BJ Edwards Boopy Miller Man those two guys And Jeron Pierre who transferred from Jacksonville State is a big time guy and hes one of the teams that talentwise can go step for step for with a lot of teams in this league And Cal is the biggest surprise so far in the ACC Another one of those top 60 net teams I think theyve only lost once still so far this year How about Isaiah Dennis coming off the bench getting a little run here tonight Freshman from Davidson right up the road This is a guy whos a big time scorer He Its going to take him a little time for Carolina fans to see the best version of Isaiah Dennis but the talent is there Hes 65 Hes bouncy He shoots a good ball Hes looking to score Its just some of these guys Carolina has guys like that that take a couple of years to get to their best ball I think he qualifies as one of those types of players if theyre patient enough Sure And thats a big question now But man he shoots a nice ball Exhibit A on Q Five quick points for the freshman from Charlotte applause Give him six points He missed half his high school senior season with a broken finger applause Taking advantage of an opportunity tonight Here he dribbles into the front court The burst to speed You see it though Hes hes geared one way Yeah I mean hes trying to get to the cup Hes trying to score When you have Bogavots you have Seth Trimble you have guys that are willing to play off the catch like Kayen Evans it doesnt necessarily mesh really well but he also needs time to add some muscle onto his frame I mean this is a guy whos got a lot of natural talent scoring ability And look freshman are allowed to be freshman I feel like weve lost sight of that with so many talented guys in the country Jaden Young a 20000 point score in high school has four off the bench tonight And now Coach Davis going a little cheering deeper into his bench And the folks here at the Dean Dome approved Mbang cheering No Out of bounds Back to the Tarheelss And with 152 on the clock here come the deep reserves Evan Smith John Hullbrook Elijah Davis Von Matt Lovichic Isaiah Dennis is the one player who stays out there And I know Isaiah Dennis is wired as you said to shoot but in this circumstance got your points Yeah you need to give it up here Matt Lakovich for the basketball Back to Dennis The coachs son Elijah Davis feeding the post Matt Lakovich gets double team Hes like What are you double teaming me for Smith with the step through No Come on Second effort

the stat sheet right now grabbing a rebound Carolina the reserves they play the same way Get out and push it Out of Archer Kell High School in Charlotte inside Matt Lakovich and he gets the roll The sophomore from Croatia puts a crooked number in his scoring column cheering Now the only question can they get to 100 Perkovich a three ball for ECU The Eastern block going at it here in the last three minutes Smith going to work Davis puts up the three COME ON COUNT IT 99 FOR THE TARHEELSS Coachs kid get you three cheering So Im out here with Hubert working on his jump shot the other day
