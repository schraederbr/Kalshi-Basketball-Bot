on Sunday in Columbus And a tough shot that was Oh it was Marcus Burtons threepointer Just a bit long and he and the Irish will have the first possession here today They go to Burton right away He struggled on Sunday overall Three of 14 from the field Now Carson Doubt 13 rebounds a game through four The transfer from Northern Arizona Burton on his way in Runs out of real estate Finds Tat on the inside and the shot fake is perfect Good move by Carson Tout right there And the last couple of games hes gotten a little more comfortable when hes caught the ball in the low post Uh showing that he might be able to become a capable scorer for the Irish down there Theres Brian Wadell going the other way for Bellereman He was a big time presence on Saturday matching Kerisinski with 23 points of his own And now at the line Ill have a chance to give the Knights an early lead Well Wadell has got uh some pretty impressive numbers so far this season shooting 61 from the the floor Hes got a lot of length and they isolated him down there on the baseline And thats one of the things that Bellereman likes to do is find some matchups get a lot of misdirection away from the ball and just attack you oneonone Shersbury lets it fly comes up short Notre Dame did not have many opportunities to fire from distance on Sunday Just 10 total attempts Tie game at two early Both teams scored on the opening possession And now its Kerasinski in the corner with Shrewberry Heres Wadell He walked and Notre Dame takes over on the turnover Well they got him the ball in the exact same position and you could see the movement on the backside sort of taking the help away and occupying the help when they tried to take you off the drive right there Lucky for the Irish Wedell shuffled his feet a little bit A stingy defensive game on Sunday for Notre Dame and it was the top takeaway for Micah Shrewsbury their thirdyear head coach They can play and be in games in a lot of different ways whether its offensively which they saw in their first three or on the other side of the ball Theres another turnover that gives it back to the Knights less than two minutes in Kerosinski backing down Burton Big size advantage for him and he converts His first points of the night Well he had Marcus in the mid post right there and he did not hesitate to try to to try to take him off the bounce right there Now Harelson the star freshman goes the other way Burton collects the loose rebound Jaylen Harrelson 10 for Notre Dame making his first start since opening night Hes the highest rated recruit in modern program history Burton the miss Tout the follow First one didnt drop and then hes fouled on the second chance You know you wonder with Tout sometimes if hes just not patting the rebounding stats just a little bit Well you remember he had 19 including 10 in the first half in the opener against Long Island but he didnt score at all during that 10 rebound first half So and that is a point blank putback that he misses but he gets the extra rebound Puts himself on the free throw line Theyll pull the Irish back within one at 43 Count now three of eight from the line this season which is surprising as physical as he is and as much as he ends up with the ball around the basket that hes not getting there a little bit more often Thats a two for two trip and the Irish have retied the game at four T already three rebounds We havent played two and a half minutes yet Kenyan Gooden Bellerman moving it quickly around the perimeter but now running low on time Well try a three from the right with Wedell Its short and tout one arms another rebound is fourth Now Harelson The Irish quickly in transition but they couldnt thread it through to Garrett Sundra Numbers now for the Knights But a wild miss coming down from Sam Donald the freshman And Notre Dame can get back into its offense cheering Tied up at four Just over three minutes in in the fourth alltime meeting between Bellereman and Notre Dame Ts got it up top Hell give to Burton Set a screen allowing him to fire from deep and Marcus Burtons got his first threepointer Well they went under the ball screen right there on Burton And uh Marcus is doing a much better job this season of recognizing that and not hesitating on the threepoint shot Well they actually are going to let it stand Some confusion there on the Burton three but theres Micah Shrewsbury Third season as the head coach at Notre Dame trying to get the Irish back in the wind column here before the big trip coming up next week to the Players era Classic in Vegas Itll be the second consecutive year for Notre Dame playing amongst a tough field to wrap up the month of November Well if these last two Bellereman possessions are any indication theyre really going to put some stress on the Notre Dame defense multiple sides of the floor Lots of ball reversal passing Thats going to going to really put some stress on on Notre Dames D Donald missed on the quick trigger three Notre Dame looking to go up by a couple possessions for the first time And theyll find Harelson He releases and cant get it to fall Kenyan Gooden the red shirt sophomore with the rebound for the Knights There are the starters for Bellereman It was Wadell and Kerosinski the two 23point scorers Saturday against Waford And they are moving it around quickly setting up a Donald look again but he misses from the same spot High tempo action early Theyre going end to end cheering Harelson coming off a 13point day Sunday Couldnt feed it through to Tout and the kickball will keep it with Notre Dame So a threepoint lead early on for the I The Irish held OSU to 64 points 31 below their season scoring average tonight Be sure to look out for scrappy defensive players like Marcus Burton and Jay Jaylen Harelson who led the team in steals and blocks Back to you Zory Thank you Notre Dame Already a couple of turnovers forced and already a couple of buckets for Marcus Burton So the Knights take over down five in the opening five minutes Theres Miles Watkins coming off the bench Senior guard from Texas Wedell driving finding the cutter Kerosinski 10 to shoot Deep three coming and its well off to the left from Darius Balden the fifth year guard Transfer from Wisconsin Stevens Point Well you can see it Uh the Irish handled it pretty well but every time there is a drive and those drives come quickly off a ball reversal you will see someone from the backside 45°ree cutting to the rim And Notre Dame was uh talking about that as they walk through the the scout this afternoon And so far theyve handled it pretty well High catch for Brady Kaylor Hes trying to spin free of Michael Wilson Jr whos a stingy defender and sir Mohhamd couldnt quite roll it in The sophomore guardmans racing the other way with it High pace between these two to start Now Wedell got it out for a three and Kerosinski wont miss from there Every time theres a drive theres going to be a backside cut and theres also going to be someone circling behind the basketball on the threepoint line looking for the kickback Jack Kerosinski in his second season at Bellereman Spent his first two years at William and Mary Hes been a huge asset for the Knights as they made the transition from Scott Davenport to now Doug Davenport in his first season as the bench boss Turnover by the Irish Watkins drops it off and this games tied up Brian Wedell lays it in Now Burton on the move Tough finish and he spins it in Burton an early seven points Wedell looking for that answer again Its been a battle between those two so far and a battle between a couple of relatively new head coaches tonight Micah Shrewsbury in year three for Notre Dame and year one for Doug Davenport He had been the head coach in waiting since May of 2022 Of course working as an assistant underneath his father the great Scotty Davenport and now an opportunity for him to take over and lead his alma mater Well Doug he played there grew up there and uh you know has been hanging around it his entire life So if anybody was ever going to be ready to take over uh I I think its him and hes hes doing a really great job The the the the record last year wasnt great but you can tell theyve got some pieces that are going to be able to compete in their league this year Wadells one of them Successful trip to the free throw line Hes got six of the 11 for Bellereman which has tied the game again Busy start for Marcus Burton Hell drop it out to Brady Kaylor Now Burton hell attempt the corner three and nail it Burtons hot out of the gate tonight 10 points for the Irish junior star preseason all ACC first teamer from nearby Mishawake Hes four of five from the field as Bellereman will keep it on Notre Dames end of the floor Thats the old hands down man down right there Uh it was not a lot of not a lot of heat that Burton put on him but he he wasnt ready to defend the three and might as well go ahead and tee it up Six to shoot for the Knights Theyll do it with Kerosinski and he continues to answer for the Knights Tied at 14 Same thing as we talked about in the open Kerosinski the Swiss Army knife Hes driving it Hes going to shoot it from the three Hes also going to post you up a little bit The stars are shining right away Burton for Notre Dame Kerasinski and Wedell for Bellereman Now another touch for Burton but Jai threw a foul away from the basketball And so the Knights will take it on the offensive miscue by Notre Dame They call it on Ke opponents arent as good as 42 And with a small sample size of four games uh he could be right And uh he may be able to start shifting those numbers a little bit tonight As you saw there both teams have already made a couple this evening Its Kerosinski whos got both for Bellereman Still out there on the floor three for three from the field to start He and Wadell have done all the scoring for Bellereman Now Kerosinski again That ones strong and the rebound falls to Kebai Notre Dame keeps the pace up and Mohamd had it ripped away The freshman Sam Donald with the takeaway cheering Adell working on Logan Ims as Bellererman tries to break this tie near the midway point of the first half in the night Sure do Kerasinski again doing it all He went body on ball away protected the basketball right there Real physical finish by Kerosinski Now Cole Serta excellent threepoint shooter Hell step into it and hit Serta was wondrous for Notre Dame in the season opener against Long Island made six threepointers and theres his first tonight as hed been quieter in recent action Now we well we talked about we talked about uh Braden Shrewsbury as lighting it up This is a guy that if you give him time and space you might as well you might as well count it Its certified Certified threepointer Notre Dames got the lead Serta didnt attempt a shot in that game against Ohio State on Sunday Scoreless in his last two hadnt been playing as many minutes but thats a welcome sign for Irish fans to see him knock the first one through tonight Well Ohio State really ran the Irish off the threepoint line Only 10 attempts from three for Notre Dame on uh on Sunday in that game And theyre averaging about 10 makes per game right Trouble in the corner for Notre Dame And this is out off the fingertips of Gooden Gish will keep it up one Notre Dame in the early going second in the ACC Threepoint percentage just above 41 Well Tyler if youre Bellererman the the formula for these kinds of games is you want to be in a ball control sort of mode And were really seeing that from them so far They are extending possessions every time they get the basketball If they dont have something quick in transition they are going to make the Irish guard for extended periods of time out here tonight And a lot of ball movement And that time Jai got locked into the tie ball after his miss Knights take over on the arrow Well its how you shorten the game right Yep like youre gonna youre gonna minimize possessions and uh and hope that youre hanging around at the end with a chance Its already the third match up against a power conference foe this year for Bellereman Trips to Georgia and Kansas State within the first week of the season and coach Davenport really felt like they played well at Kansas State were in the game most of the way Kerosinski just missed it long He is not hesitating at all He if hes got some space hes going to hes going ahead and putting it up from the threepoint line And that K State game which was 91 9871 loss I should say is the Knights take over on the foul off ball Another one of those instances where music the three balls may be a little bit unlucky if youre Bellereman Wildcats were 14 of 23 in that game Well the Irish got they the Irish got the mismatch in the post that time and Sundra just kind of overdid it Little bit of a uh little bit of a of a of an acting job Um which is what you have to do when when youre a when youre a little guy guarding a big guy you got to call attention to it That time I on Grant Whitakers run up the floor commits the foul Theyre starting to rack up against Notre Dame Knights are nearing bonus territory with still more than nine minutes to play in the opening half Whitaker and Ims playing physically there in that matchup And now Gooden goes to work on Serta feet in the paint and he traveled Well the the the Knights really like that uh that mid post up Theyre not really in the low post Theyre kind of in the midrange They they leave that guy alone have a lot of false action away from the ball and trying to exploit those oneonone opportunities How does Notre Dame account for that Well I think they cant get messmerized on the backside They they cant be locking in and chasing their guy whos really not involved in the action And because their cutting is so quick and so purposeful its really easy to try to just tag your guy And while thats going on the defense is getting driven on from the opposite side Colerta headed to the line for Notre Dame Just hit a three moments ago to put the Irish into this lead theyve got now and he rattles home the first free throw Got the shooters roll right there I was I was out here uh early today because I I was at the Bellereman shootaround and when that was over in walked Cole Serta a good hour and 15 minutes before the Irish workout just getting extra shots in today Well it pays off here Two for two from the stripe Hes got five points Notre Dames had the lead for plenty of the night already but it has yet to grow beyond a couple of possessions Michael Wilson Jr swerves in on Mohamd now has to recycle with six to shoot Itll be Watkins over Burton and the threes good Miles Watkins with his first threepoint make of the season and its tied up again Late clock Probably want to make him a driver if you can Thats a seventh Notre Dame turnover there Delmans defense has caused some issues especially in transition And Wadell with a crafty finish on the other side Timeout Micah Shrewberry and the Knights have got the lead with eight to play three games Hes scored at least 18 in all of them and appears well on his way tonight And now out of the timeout the Bellererman Knights go 131 The Irish try and beat it with Mohamd and Shrewbury Nothing there yet though Burton into Carson Tout And now Burton hes been the top scorer for Notre Dame No surprise there Only five to shoot Tout inside the free throw line Ties it up Good little floater It is a great time to change defenses though because you know that uh Notre Dames talking about things they want to do offensively and then all of a sudden they come out of the timeout and theyre seeing something completely different Here goes Kerosinski again working on the freshman Harelson and Kerosinski wins that battle A dozen points for the top night scorer Just a lot of oneonone opportunities for Bellereman where guys have too much space to operate Theyre allowed to theyre theyre allowed to dribble it two three four times before theres any help coming from the Irish Burton and Tout little twoman game and Touts laying was too strong Hell have a chance at the line though Theres the post up hits that little half hook over the top of Harelson And hes showed you every way you can score already uh in the in the first uh three quarters of this half Count strong on the first free throw Something to keep an eye on though Kerosinski just committed his second foul there He will remain in the game Carson Tout already six points and six rebounds in this one Cant hit either free throw Hes just better than a 40 foul shooter for his career So Bellereman certainly wouldnt mind seeing him at the line relative to most others in blue and gold as Watkins looks for a passing angle drops it off to Wedell Wedell into Kerosinski and he had it ripped out Marcus Burtons got 10 for the Irish Now Braden Shrewsbury still yet to score in this one Coming off three consecutive double figure performances Harelson spots the corner with Burton Hes really deep in there and from a crazy angle nearly floated it home It was hard to see from here but it looked like he was behind the back door I dont know how he got that anywhere close to the rim from where he was and where he started in that corner cheering But Bellerin remains with the lead just under six to play Now a logo three just misses but Mohamd fouled the threepoint shooter and Kenyon Goodens headed to the line for a while Well Sir Mohamd was in that gap ready to support that oneonone drive Little bit flatfooted not really not really active on the ball or quick enough back to to contest that threepoint shot and he ends up fouling Um not a real good not a real good defensive series right there for the Irish And with 546 to go in the half Bellerermans gone into the bonus already Gooden cracks the score sheet for the first time tonight Gooden started all five now for Bellereman 12 points He was a sharp shooter on opening night against Georgia Four of four from deep and was four of four again in the win against Hanover last week So hes a confident guy from long range Youve got to keep your eye on him Well whether the numbers are accurate or not Tyler uh you you just cant foul a guy whos shooting a three on a 29 threepoint shooting team Yep Foul on the floor against music Bellereman with Harelson making a move The Irish try and get their energy back where it needs to be Its been a sluggish start for Notre Dame coming off a heartbreaking taxing loss early in the season Sunday against Ohio State screaming Harrelson sees a lane and takes full advantage Thats a good place to drive it Youve got Braden Shrewsbury the sniper in the corner his guy is not going to help off and Harelson took advantage of that with the lane line drive all the way to the rim Haroldson 17 and 13 points across his last two games after he was banged up on opening night and missed game two of the season for the Irish Now hell see this one go out and a turnover on Bellererman gives Notre Dame a chance here with 506 to go in the half Well the movement has really flumxed the one possession so far and theyre theyre going to have a chance to win the ball game The the the flip side of that is the Irish have to make them go away People dont go away for you You have to make them go away Harrelson while stumbling fed it through to Carson Tout Well thats the value of Harelson He is he is a really really good basketball player in terms of vision and being able to set guys up and and create How about that ball movement but the three wouldnt drop from Wilson Yeah no holes in Harelsons game Now hes looking to find Kaylor another freshman but this one tips out off Bellereman And I thought that was a Well here we go Right here There theres Harelson on the post up gets tripped up but still has enough presence of mind to be able to find the open tout at the rim Heres Marcus Burton 10 points in his first eight minutes Now Shrewberry got it to Harelson and hes charging in Thats a dominant and confident finish for Harelson to give his team the lead cheering Well Braden turned down a three right there had the defense moving in his direction when he swung it back to Harelson Bellererman was a little bit behind and and Harelson was able to take advantage of that 60 run for Notre Dame Beller has not hit from the field in the last three minutes and that trend continues Turnover and I think youre going to see a lot more of that Uh Harelson sort of playing a point forward kind of position and taking some of the pressure off of Marcus Burton And Marcus Burton coming out of the break gets back on track Hes up to a team high 12 points and Notre Dame has surged into a threepoint lead Eight nothing scoring run And now an awkward try from Watkins and Notre Dame has numbers the other way Harrelson threw some contact Thatll be a foul on the floor And there you saw it right there Tout with the long rebound immediately to Harrelson and hes not hesitating Hes not looking for the point guard Hes going to take it himself and hes got the hes got the uh the Bellererman guys in a backpedal and just attacks with that athleticism Hes going to get to the rim every time in that situation He was looking for some continuation there on the foul Maybe at the next level Hes not going to get that Heres Harelson again finding an open man in the corner Kaylors going to take it down the baseline Tout had it stripped away at first and touched it last Bellerman ball Just couldnt squeeze it He was in a crowd right there Several guys got their hands on it Just couldnt squeeze that one Carson Town in his 128th collegiate game 125 starts now One of the most experienced players youll find and perhaps the premier rebounder in the game statistically Heres Whitaker Hes played physically when hes had the ball Notre Dame nearly took it away but Wilson keeps it alive But now between Burton and Kaylor he travels That was a much better defensive possession uh for Notre Dame You had multiple guys forcing the Bellereman guys to pick up their dribble because it was a second set of hands getting involved with the basketball And thats what its going to take They cant allow Bellereman to just isolate them for four and five dribbles in oneonone situations with space Its going to be a problem And youre starting to see that energy pick up for Notre Dame Kayla the freshman amped up forcing the turnover Now Harelson was trapped He found Burton though Swing to the corner Serta deep in it and the three short Harrelson gobbles up the rebound What a put back on his part Thats what we call a mans rebound in the in the game Tyler he he went up over everybody and snatched that one Six points for Jaylen Harrelson and Notre Dame leads by five Now Gooden over to Sam Donald His three does not fall and Shrewsbury colliding with Tal Thats not the kind of guy you want to run into but hes got the rebound Now Haroldson thought about the triple Now carves his way in ran out of real estate but another offensive rebound and finished by the freshman Just a strong physical drive and then he was had the the presence to just stay with it and knock that rebound back in This is suddenly a 120 scoring run from Notre Dame Bellerin has not scored in the last 420 Gooden tries to change that high arcer and it rains down Pretty good pull up over a good contest by Serta Now Burton tied for the game high with a dozen points He swerves his way into a midrange and is perfect with it Thats money isnt it If he can if he can get to those that 12 to 15 ft range and have a little bit of space to to to do the quick stop and up in the air he is uh he is radar from that range Now defending and fouling Donald the Bellererman freshman forward And with 45 seconds left hell have a one andone opportunity Burton 14 points and an efficient 14 Hes six of eight from the floor after a tough three for 14 day at Ohio State Well you know that was a good news bad news kind of deal right So hes not very good from the floor Although I he shooting the basketball he did a lot of other good things in the game Uh but youre still you know one possession from a win against a Big 10 team on the road So thats the good news And uh I think it also tells the Irish that you know theyre theres other ways that they can compete and win besides Marcus Burton having to carry the load all the time Donald the Columbia Illinois product goes two for two at the stripe And now Burton turns on the Jets and lays it in for two That happened fast 16 points for Marcus Burton in the first half leading all scorers Now the Knights with two and a half separating shot and game clock Put it in the hands of Miles Watkins Hell bleed this thing down with Burton looking on now with six Watkins makes the move Hell drop it off top of the key Wide open look and it falls short from Wedell Notre Dames got to hurry this thing Harelson with time winding down couldnt quite lay it home but still a sevenpoint advantage at the half for the Fighting Irish Well interesting is we talked a lot about uh how in Fuego my man Braden Shrewberry was only one shot in the first half Serta can heat up too and he has a threepointer just 10 seconds into the half And for the first time tonight Notre Dame has gone up by double digits Second triple made tonight for Serta Well Bellereman opened in that 131 that they showed a little bit in the first half Tyler And the shots that you get against the 131 is exactly the shot cert Theres Wedell Corner three for Bellereman and it misses out of the fingers of Donald Notre Dame trying to break this game open Harrelson can help them accomplish that Hes looked good tonight looking confident Ill tell you if you if you watch Carson Tout run the floor he runs the floor and makes the first defender back have to guard him and then he seals that guy off for drivers and it happens over and over again Its a really effective weapon for the Irish Double figures now for Harelson He has 10 on five of eight shooting Tough drive for Wedell and hes fouled on the way in Two shots coming for the Bellamin red shirt senior Indiana native from Carmel down near Indianapolis Uh coached by Ryan Osborne Uh great high school coach in the Indianapolis area state champion Uh twotime and and Brian Wadell they list him at 67 but hes got a 610 guys wingspan He is one long lanky dude and hes so effective on those drives because of his length Transfer from Purdue after four years three seasons there Boiler Makers were national champions two years ago I should say national runner up to Yukon He was a part of that team Didnt see the floor a ton but now getting a big time look at Bellereman Shberry trying to activate from three and thats a tough roll for him and a foul against the Irish on the rebound Well getting back getting back to Wedell whats interesting is he was going to go to Bellereman out of high school and very late in the recruiting uh in the recruiting cycle Purdue came in and offered him Uh his dad Matt was an excellent player at Purdue and uh he just couldnt couldnt uh resist the the boiler maker in him and now hes a now hes a knight Matt Wedell was Matt Painters teammate on those Purdue teams in the 90s Travel against the Knights and Notre Dame up 11 takes over And the big dog Glenn Robinson That was before you were born though laughter So you know I I forgive you for not knowing what Im talking about Just under two minutes into the half Irish have the double digit lead Its a 215 Notre Dame run and now 23 to five going back to the final six minutes of the first half as Tout lays it home Good seal by Tout and a great pass from Serta 10 points now for Tout Hes already knocking on the door of a double double with nine rebounds as well Well its uncanny the way Bellereman is able to find some of these mismatches Theyre forcing them with their with their movement and their action and then once they have him theyre able to just post that guy right away Particularly Burton they really want to go after him and make him guard on the defensive end Another turnover against the Knights Good job They they wanted to isolate Braden Shrewsbury right there and he sat down and and uh and made it very difficult for for Wedell Notre Dame really starting to take over A lot of game left though cheering Harelson Talton Bertner the three in double figures for the Irish Theyre all out there Braden Shrewsbury is still scoreless Now Burton with some help from Tout creating space and banking it home 18 points for Marcus Burton Hes just deadly when he has you isolated right there Just a myriad of little tricks that he can do to get his shot off Like that word myriad Marriott Marcus The Irish have it coming out of the break Bellerman was up 2621 late in the first half Its been all all Notre Dame since Burton steps into the three with tal creating space for him but it would not drop Now a push in down the baseline Shrewsbury with quality defense against Donald Now Harelson oneonone with Gooden and hes fouled Well we talked about it in the first half and and when Harelson has a head of steam in the open court youre going to have a its going to be really hard to stop him because hes a physical driver And here he goes Good push up the floor by Serta and its just one guy to attack and theres just not a lot of chance that youre going to be able to keep him from getting to the rim Harelson the top ranked prospect coming out of the state of Indiana last year Hes well into double figures now 11 points as he makes his first venture to the free throw line tonight Well he does so many things well You know hes a hes a dribble pass guy and an athletic driver and finisher And uh as he as he increases his uh threepoint shooting ability its going to be really hard to handle him Open three for Goden off to the left and Burton snatches down the rebound I tout tough catch there Now hes got to find somebody Did to Burton Shrewberry shot fake Got his man in the air and hes on the board Good patience right there Hes able to uh hes able to shot fake from the threepoint line get the get the fly by from the defender and just gather himself and knock that one in That was Donovan Hunter He got to bite And now a basket and foul A much needed one from Jack Caris Contact He might have gotten the call but then he has to step up into that space and try to keep Kerasinski from scoring and the foul ends up going on him Good veteran KGy kind of play by Kerasinski Uh puts him to the line for the threepoint play Hes a crafty guy down low and he cannot pick up all three The foul shot rattling out 14 points still for Kerosinski Hes the Bellamin leader tonight Notre Dame outscoring the Knights 133 so far in the second half And Burtons going to add on Put that on the highlight tape You know what Im going to say about that Tyler Wow Yeah Ill say Look at this spinama and then lay it home The spin move Hes able to protect the ball through both of the defenders and then just has enough balance at the end and length to stretch away stretch the ball away from the contest and finish it Man thats not easy Dont try this at home folks Its the nondominant hand too The lefty laying for Burton and he has reached 20 points on nine of 12 shooting and hes got all three Notre Dame leads by 20 Big night for Marcus Burton doing it at all levels of the offense Knights continue to probe that perimeter And now the drive comes from Balden trying to angle away from and he finds a way with the fadeaway That was a tough shot Sure was A lot of lanky bodies around him Balden gets on the board for the first time tonight Now theres a foul on the Knights as Notre Dame comes down the other way 18point lead again for the Irish as well see Baldens basket one more time Pretty good contest for Mimes but the fadeaway gives him the space to kind of knock that in Hes on his third different school Its been an interesting path for Darius Balden the fifthear guard as Burton carves in again drops it off to Sunder this time It popped out however Now a threeon one led by Kerosinski and eventually its Wedell Couldnt lay it in the first time Got it back however And now theyre scrapping away at him Itll be a foul against Notre Dame All three for Bellereman on that threeonone rush up the court Touched the basketball and it ended up being Wedell Little bit of a Yeah a little bit of a scrum down there and it looked like Shrewberry had his hands in there on the ball but I think Wadell moving it around just forced Shrewberry to grab him by the arm So the Knights keep it on this end Wedell makes his move on Kick out to Balden Now Donald travels again Thats been an issue for Bellamin when theyve been caught in between Irish defenders Well what what weve seen since about the 10minute mark in the in the first half is there is a second Irish defender right And thats putting a little more heat on the drives by by Bellererman that the Irish were having a really hard time with early in the game sort of deep three Its long and the rebound falls to Donald You saw the graphic there Turnovers were an issue for Notre Dame in the first half when Bellererman was up five as a tough bucket goes for Gooden Now its the Knights with the four turnovers among the first five to start half two and Notre Dame up 16 accordingly Harrelson swings to Serta Shot fake gets him down the baseline Back to Harelson Thats one heck of a give and go Micah Shrewsbury loves that foul as well against Bellereman Well it started with the with the great skip pass from Harelson to Serta which put the defense in a scramble and uh and allowed that play to get make Theres the skip pass Close out Serta take making the next guy play and Harelson just sneaking in front of his guy to get that layup 14 points for Jaylen Harlson He has found his game after the off schedule start with an injury Three consecutive double figure performances for the standout Notre Dame freshman leads back to 19 for Notre Dame but Bellereman will have a chance to shorten that margin as Michael Wilson Jr draws contact underneath and hell make his way to the line Well Belleremans pretty small out there right now and now Tout has to come out on the perimeter and handle that drive And you can see if he gets beat theres nobody there because everybody all the other Irish guys are chasing their guy around on the backside Olson hasnt been a great free throw shooter this year Now seven of 13 His first season at Bellereman coming over from North Greenville cheering hits the second and the deficits back to 18 Notre Dames going to hurry it up Count one rebound shy of a double double Itll be his second of the year 30th of his career Sir Mohamd out to Haroldson Three on the way and its long cheering now Watkins as Bellamin catches Mohhamd behind the play Well try and take advantage but he recovers for the steal Colerta three from Harelson left it short Rebound underneath and thatll go against Bellereman Keep it with Notre Dame You know doubt hes going to get a couple of those a game because theres such an emphasis on blocking him out Oh yeah That the other team is going to just have to be physical The twoman push in the back He didnt He didnt get pushed by one guy He got pushed by both guys Both Hunter and Wilson Not a rebound for Tout but it might as well be one Well on every scattering report its going to say you got to keep this guy off the boards IMS draws the foul Hell head to the line And what did coach Shrewsbury say Doesnt matter where Carson Touts coming from Northern Arizona into the ACC Rebounding translates at every level Rebounding is rebounding Some guys cant they could be big scorers at a different level and have a hard time scoring Uh but rebounding is about juice juice and effort and little bit of a nose You know Touts got excellent rebounding karma I call it You know he gets his rebounds then he goes and gets your rebounds and then the ball loves his effort so much The ball just comes and finds him He He is a really fun guy to watch just because of the energy that he expends Hed probably have 20 offensive rebounds a game if he was getting my rebounds laughter I Id have a lot of rematch You You would create a few more opportunities for him Im sure Oh you bet IMS was one of two Notre Dames holding that lead just below 20 as Watkins working against Tout tries to find a way through now Wilson against Kaylor as hes back in there Three coming from Watkins Missed everything but the rebound falls for Hunter on the backside Shot clock did not reset and Hunter drains a tough one from the short corner Step back 19footer with a hand in his face IMS releases the three and the high arcer doesnt drop Rebound to Watkins and the Knights and they will push threeon two Man in the corner Hunter again This ones wide right Tout rebound Hes got the double double 30th of his career IS the other way for two Theres Harelson with the with the push and the find And with Burton on the bench he becomes the primary ball handler for the Irish Notre Dame really stabilizing this game in the second half Watkins though draws Bellereman a bit closer Five points for Miles Watkins But another triple the other way about the impact of IMS in the second half Six points in less than 10 minutes played Well hes a physical defender and a guy whos going to be consistent every night Hes going to give you great effort every night And if he can get to where he can knock down that open three when he has it thats going to really help the Irish in his in his role off the bench Wilson draws the foul Hell be shooting free throws when we return as Notre Dame Tyler When asked about Carson Tout Coach Rubberry said hes quote max effort and plays really hard He talked about his effort on the glass on both ends and his physicality but mentioned that before the game even starts hes a big brother to his teammates and feeds their belief because of the energy and confidence that he gives them And weve definitely seen that energy and confidence in his rebounding ability tonight Back to you Yeah great stuff Zora Energy personified The verbiage coach Shrewsbury has used on tout Michael Wilson Jr at the line for the Knights and hes two for two Still an 18point contest with a little over 10 to go This has not been an easy one tonight for Notre Dame Bellerin led by as many as five It was a 2621 score with just under six minutes to play in the first half But Notre Dame late in the first half early in the second has flipped this game around Burtons been a big reason for that Active all night long getting it to Kaylor and the offensive foul turns it to Bellereman Its why you got to fall down Tyler Yep We talked about that earlier but Bellereman in that 131 again on that possession How difficult is it to tell a guy or even to just have the presence of your mind to to take yourself out of a play if you have the chance to stay on balance but you might be looking for that call Oh its impossible Its impossible Although I do think that he uh you know he might he he I dont know where he was if he was inside the charge circle but he was he was the primary defender So I guess you could still go ahead and take it Watkins traveled so Notre Dame takes over Irish at 60 from the field tonight Harrelson tough shot Tout offensive rebound cleaning up the glass Couldnt put it in Kaylor looking for a tap on the back end And finally theres a foul against the Knights So it looked like somebody got their hand tangled up in the net which which technically is a is a goalend Yep On Notre Dame Good call Tout had the first offensive rebound and then Kaylor came crashing in The officials Not sure the play had their their hand in the net Yeah tough to tell Kerosinski for three That one doesnt go And Shrewberrys got the rebound for Notre Dame Thats why were over here And theyre out on the floor cheering Notre Dame still working on that 20point edge And Bellereman continuing to have issues with the threepointer Kaylor lefty release Its long Harrelson offensive rebound and hell head to the line Boy Harelson has crashed that offensive glass tonight He is uh he is impacting this game in a lot of different ways Hes also got four assists at this point You can see him Hes going in Nobodys blocking him out and then just kind of forces the issue forces the contact here as he goes into the defender Notre Dame now out rebounding Bellereman 2714 in this one The Irish have got eight offensive boards Harelson having a balanced day 15 points three rebounds five assists He goes one of two and the lead is 21 for Notre Dame from up top Wilson for three Left it short and Kaylors got the board colliding with Harelson Bellamin now three of 18 from long range as the Knights continue their snake bit start from distance Notre Dame hasnt had a huge night by any means on the other side Six of 17 but the rebounding the interior play of Talton Harelson combined with the scoring of Burton have helped to open this game up Notre Dames taken better care of the basketball too Turnover there by Burton though So the Knights have it again with Gooden battling Shrewberry Less than 10 to shoot for the Knights as theyll swing it over to Wedell trying to reverse on Kaylor and he got it to fall Theres that ball reversal in that quick ISO Thats going to be really effective for Wedell And theres Shrewsbury the sniper that barely touched the net on its way down Quick release from Shrewsbury and an immediate answer Well thats one of the reasons the Irish want to play with pace because they got such capable threepoint shooters that if the ball gets pushed and the defense isnt set theyre going to let it fly And Shrewberry just a little bit here in the second half but Ive been really impressed with the way they play Theyve got a a unique style offensively and it works for them and they believe in it and I would be shocked Tyler if they uh if they dont finish higher than 10th in that league Kerosinski is a big reason for that Two for two from the line Bellerman will be in Charleston next week to take on the Citadel and Houston Christian in a backtoback Monday and Tuesday a opener for the Knights is New Years Day at West Georgia Shrewsbury the curl the three Its long Rebound kicks all the way out to where he shot from for Serta Now Burton with Kebai Havent heard much of him tonight but hes going to make his way to the free throw line with just under seven to play Well I think Keba we havent seen him a lot and I think some of its a matchup situation music with with all the movement that Belleremans showing Uh theres just not really a true center or anyone for him to guard out there So I I I think thats why we havent seen him as much tonight It just wasnt a good matchup situation for him in this game Ji a 30game starter last season for Notre Dame In his third year with Notre Dame senior year after starting with coach Shrewsbury at Penn State and he goes two for two from the stripe The Irish have hit 70 Well I tell you hes an interesting guy because they bring in a guy like Carson Tout whos just you know a rebounding maniac and that changes Jais role a little bit And a lot of guys might not be happy with that but the the practices and the shootounds that Ive gone to he seems like one of the most upbeat positive kids on the on the team and thats a real credit to him Wilson with the three on the other end And Bellererman trying to write the ship on this threepoint shooting to start the season Has its fourth triple of the night Michael Wilson Jrs had a solid second half up to six points now And theres a takeaway for Bellamin And Wedell had the leg swept out by Serta Foul on Notre Dame as well take a look at Wilsons trifecta once again Bellamin now four of 19 from deep cheering Notre Dames made seven And now with Bellamin into the double bonus Two shots coming up here for Wedell Well you saw Sera try to put that ball on the floor right there And thats an area where I think youre going to see him really improve over time uh the fact that he can shoot it from the three you know hes got to be able to go off the bounce because people are going to be flying at him to take that away And we saw that in Braden Shrewsberrys development Hes hes a much more efficient effective player off the bounce than he was two years ago And I fully expect that Cole Certa is going to going to really add that to his game as time goes on Marcus Burton working on a game high 21 points Somehow held on to that ball through a lot of congestion to lay it home Its kind of like a video game He He just gets in there and kind of snakes around three different guys and then puts a little spin on it on the glass and knocks it in Just terrific play Mohamd spilled over and hes in disbelief that thats a blocking foul against him Well see Burtons laying once once more between two guys back between two different guys and then spins it in with his left hand 10 of 13 from the field tonight Marcus Burton and gets knocked down Yeah At the end cheering Kerosinski at the line Meanwhile for the Knights hes closing in on 20 points He and Burton have had pretty similar days Kerosinskis six of nine from the field Well hes a hes a really impressive player you know at at 66 or whatever they have him at maybe 67 I dont think hes quite that big just he can do a lot of things on the basketball court from an offensive standpoint Seventh in the A7 in points per game a season to go averaging better than 21 through four games this year Eight to shoot for Serta in company And a takeaway a break here for Wedell and hell throw it down with two hands 15 for Brian Wedell playing a quality second fiddle to Kerosinski tonight The Irish lead is down to 16 Kaylor Bellamin desperate for a travel but Kaylor remains composed and knocks down the turnaround He tried to direct drive It was thwarted but was able to keep his balance kind of slide back and knock that little jumper in What Down the answer with a corner three Hes taken over the Knights team high with 18 points Coming off the careerhigh performance with 23 Saturday against Wford Sera was bumped and thats a foul Goes against Wilson with just beyond four minutes to play Serta heads to the line Notre Dame entering the double bonus Really good strong physical drive by Serta there He just kind of forces the contact Once youve got that once youve got that defender on your hip theres a tendency to want to try to get away from him And going right at that hip and being physical right there is the thing that gets you to the free throw line sort of if he makes both would have a double figure scoring night Looking to join Burton Harelson and Tout and he does Four to play in South Bend Notre Dame still leading comfortably They were down five at one point late in the first half but have kept the Knights at an arms distance since halftime Quick trigger three banks its way home Kenyon Gooden you got to call that Dont Dont you Did you hear it Is that Did they change that rule He was He was on our side Did he call it I dont know Did he call it Zora Zora would be the closest She was closer than me She would know And Im sure shes got better ears than I do too Jai from Harelson and hes fouled looking to go underneath Notre Dame holding up Yeah Coach Coach Shrewsbury was talking to us this afternoon about you know some of the similarities that he was feeling maybe just a little bit of a slow start trying to figure out a few things and hes uh kind of waiting for Marcus to explode and the game hes had tonight is about as efficient as you can be Its a great find of Michael Wilson Jr here as the Knights remain within 14 And of course Notre Dame hoping to keep Burton healthy this time around Remember it was right after those backtoback 20point games last year in Vegas Burton had the knee injury ended up missing seven games And of course Notre Dame goes back to the Players era Classic in Las Vegas next week for some big tests against power conference foes Shot clock winding down Mohamd of Shrewsbury He beats the horn with a triple Although Bellamin may want to take a look Immediate signals from the coaching staff Doug Davenport in company to check out the monitor and see if Shrewsbury did indeed beat the shot clock buzzer If I was a betting man Im going to say yes Oo I dont know That righthanded release have to take it back to where its in the fingertips there Got the red light I dont know Maybe not Is it on his hand right there Im inclined to believe so Obviously the fingertips are blurred there Mohamd gave him the extra pass hoping that Shrewberry could get it off but he did not The officials have reached their determination and so no three for Shrewberry and the Irish lead remains couple of touchdowns with 236 to play Wilson lodged in with Tout there and Tout is in disbelief that the fouls go in against him Its a basket and foul for Michael Wilson Jr who wondering what he could have done there on that foul against Wilson who is suddenly into double figures with 11 for the Knights Harelson and a tie up and he draws a foul Two shots coming for the freshman Jaylen Harrelson Well they cleared the side out completely for him that time And he just he just head down Hes going to get to the rim right there He makes both He would tie his careerh high of 17 But he will not make both This free throw is the last thing that that man right there wants to see down the stretch here for Notre Dame Harelson does go one for two and the lead is at a dozen for the Irish Wilson tries the three over tout and that ones good This is a singledigit margin of nine points Thats the mismatch And they got they went right to it to make Tout guard out on the perimeter He didnt want to he didnt want to get too close to get beat off the drive and was allowed him to just tee that thing up from three Harelson couldnt get it to go and suddenly there is noise emanating from that Bellereman bench Drive and finish from Miles Watkins Sevenpoint affair with just over 90 seconds to play cheering The Knights have got some belief Notre Dames trying to put this thing to bed Micah Shrewsbury is right in the face of one of the officials as the whistles blown for a foul I think they got it against Wadell I did not see that one Its a foul against Bellamin is going to send tout to the line and oh they got him off the ball on purpose uh because he is a 40 free throw shooter Pretty good pretty good move on paper See if TA can make him pay right here And he does Not the first one for an eightpoint game Little hacka shack as they used to say T three of five from the line tonight and two big makes for him here down the stretch Micah Shrewsbury trying to give his team a lift down the stretch Ninepoint lead for Notre Dame And the drop off does not connect Who to that touch The officials have not made their determination It is off Notre Dame Here was coach truceberry after tout made them both Coach Drew pretty fired up because I think what he wanted was he wanted an intentional foul Yeah Right And uh and he didnt get that call from the officials Now Wedell 11 against 11 with Shrewsbury and he couldnt put it in Just over a minute to go Notre Dame content to slow it down Bellerermans running out of time now cheering Harelson at the controls Now darts into the paint spins and was fouled and Haroldson went down hard and hes Grimace cuz maybe hes even trying to hold him up you know and he realizes and he realizes he cant hold him up so he lets him go but he hangs on a little too long right Ill give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was trying to hold him up Harlson now four of eight from the line Hasnt been his sharpest night there and he goes 0 of two So thatll be something for him to continue working on as the freshman season progresses Notre Dame by nine Bellamin running out of time as Watkins floats home the two Its a sevenpoint contest 424 to go Timeout T Bellerman has exhausted its timeout Notre Dame gets it into Serta you would think have got to be looking to foul at some point And finally theres the touch on Serta from Kenyan Gooden Well theyve got uh theyve got a bunch of ball handlers in the game right now The Irish do uh and free throw shooters which is exactly what you want to do Theyre going to bring in a little more size here with Harelson on the for this defensive possession Sertos an excellent foul shooter Four of four tonight Better than 94 in his career Pure on the first Bellerman will draw Wilson and Kerosinski back in there Asserts got a dozen points for Notre Dame A perfect six of six from the foul line Well you never know how its going to go So Cole didnt play a ton against Ohio State the other night and gives them good a good 20 minutes tonight Um a lot of times its matchups and and and whats going on in a particular game And thats why its so important that players uh stay ready to go especially on a team like Notre Dame where they theyve got a lot of depth all the way up and down the the bench Theyve added 810 of a second back to the game clock Bellamin looking for that three Its Wilson He was fouled and he will have three free throws coming as Shrewberry hacked him just kind of caught it Just kind of pushed his hand back a little bit there You know they kind of got they got hung up and they got into into oh no mode and hes flying out there at him and just overdid it just a little bit Wilson now five of six from the free throw line tonight There are the two Knights ready to check back in Balden and Donald 16 points now for Wilson Jr Harelson checks out for Notre Dame as Wilson looks to make it three of three and he does So a sixpoint lead for Notre Dame Just over 25 seconds on the clock Mohhamd inbounding probing the baseline He got it to Braden Shrewsbury and theyll foul him Shrewsbury about an 83 free throw shooter in his career Well they got the right guys in the game right now if theyre going to play if Bellereman you know they have to play the foul game at this point and Notre Dame counters with a bunch of guys that are shooting you know over 85 from the free throw line So um in theory Bellereman doesnt have a choice Theyre going to have to foul a good free throw shooter no matter who they foul And Braden lets him off the hook a little bit with that miss Shrewsbury makes one here to make it a sevenpoint game And youre Bellamin How much are you prioritizing a three versus getting the right look Oh you got to just get a bucket You just got to get a bucket Shrewsbury does make it a sevenpoint contest Time of the essence still for the Knights as Watkins will wait to play it Here they go Watkins nearly lost the handle in the corner Under 20 seconds to go He slips Burton nearly took it from him but it is a foul Well hes got Burton starting at the threepoint line He is ju literally just bullying him in trips on his own and then Burton gets called for the foul That was a tough call cuz theres no contact here and he slide he falls down and thats just not sure where the foul was You know when youre the official it kind of depends on your angle Youre looking through guys Oh why did this guy fall down Yeah Burton standing right over the top of him So Watkins makes both Its now a fivepoint contest 172 on the clock Mohamd into Burton And Burton breaks away killing some more seconds before hes fouled between Kerosinski and Gooden And Burtons a terrific free throw shooter Thats the guy you want Thats the guy you want up there Thats for sure Im uh Its fortunate that they filed him It looked like he might have shuffled his feet a little bit as he as he made that stop right in front of the Irish bench I think the officials were anticipating that he was going to get fouled Burton entered the night ninth in the ACC with the free throw percentage just below 89 make here would get him to 25 points Got them both Theyre free Hell take them The lead returns to seven for Notre Dame And now the final 10 seconds Watkins doesnt look like Bellamins going to be able to get it done here And Burton fittingly disrupts defensively Watkins threw it away And that is it Notre Dame hangs on Bellamin made it difficult but the Fighting Irish are 4 and one on the year
