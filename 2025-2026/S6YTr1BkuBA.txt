only division one basketball player averaging 24 and a half points and seven rebounds per game So Rayu and Cutral its the Hurricanes in the Phoenix Were underway on a Thursday night Well you know what Im going to say about anybody from Baltimore We just different over there Yes Yes You would know that all too well So the first possession of the night belongs to the Miami Hurricanes coming off that loss last Sunday against the Florida Gator up in Jacksonville The bucket is good for True Washington the guard out of Phoenix in the transfer from New Mexico If you look at Elons defense right now theyre packing the paint Nobodys guarding the threepoint line And thats one thing that we havent seen from University of Miami is shooting the three ball Theyre literally saying Shoot the three ball Well lose by the three if you make it Great drive by True Washington Got a early basket but watch Elons defense Theyre letting Miami shoot the three This is a game where Miami is going to say You know what Lets let it fly Let the chips fall where they fall Jawan Carr goes to the free throw line after he was followed by Trey Donaldson There is Ernest Uday Jr He is absent tonight with a lower body injury and the prognosis is good He is not expected to miss significant time for Miami But no Ernest Uday Miamis leading rebounder here this evening Thats a big loss for Miami right now You want a guy thats on the boards that follows up and block shots But this would be good for him to watch the game to maybe come back to his team to say You know what guys We need Mike to do this better Look at this Elon team Theyre not guarding the line Theyre backing up Theyre making Miami shoot the three Dante Allen got the start for the Hurricanes tonight He steps out of bounds So a turnover by Miami their first of the evening Look at this Miami program right now They started Dante Allen Great kid at the Mont uh Riviera Prep in Mont Verde They went small today They could have started the big but they went small See Car Pettis Clatch Coutrol Harold the starting five for Elon The threepoint opportunity is no good The Phoenix love to shoot threes making 12 a game averaging right around 34 attempts per game as well as Dante Allen is fouled One thing I love about Dante Allen he catches the ball and hes attacking the basket Hes attacking trying to get a painting touch Putting pressure on the defense is major at any level of basketball Foul line Harold his first team first coaching resume and to look at Billy Taylor the Notre Dame graduate back in 1995 Speaking of Notre Dame the Elon Phoenix are looking for their second straight victory against an ACC opponent They beat Notre Dame Billy Taylors alma mater a year ago on Saturday You know how that goes Its my alma mater Im trying to win that game I might get a couple extra years on my contract Billy Taylor in his fourth season 41 and 60 overall Shout out to Billy Taylor Pair of free throws good by Dante Allen Hurricanes leading by three A little over a minute into this one here tonight at the Watsco Center Theres Carr in the paint back up top Click the graduate out of Poland And theres a steal by Miami and Trey Donaldson But an errant pass had a little bit too much zip on it and Donaldson turns it over Miami second turnover Theres Jay Lucas in his first season at the helm of the Miami Hurricanes program taking over for Jim Larenga 14th head coach in program history Little too much zip on that pass but I love zip Like my best a lot of zippers Hes making his players and making his team sprint the floor and get a basket I like that turnover early by the Miami Hurricanes Well Miami will certainly pressure Elon defensively all night long Thats a staple for Jaylucass teams as cars tied up in the paint That was taken away by True Washington Nearly fouled Now a tie up and thats going to be a jump ball and its going to be Elon basketball I love True Washington on defense One thing that I know that coach Jay Lucas challenged True Washington be a pest on defense If you watch True Washington on defense hes on every ball hes on Hes playing a tremendous defense Watch him right now Great defensive player Know the jump ball favors Elon looking for their first bucket of the night And Carr with a beautiful assist in the flush down low by Coutrol again averaging 24 and a half points per game for the transfer from Purdue Fort Wayne Now an offensive foul Thats on Malik Reu That was the one Thats a beautiful find there And Cutrols got his first two points of the night He leads the conference He ranked seventh nationally with 24 and a half points per game Hes the CAA player of the week posted backtoback careerhigh performances with 28 and 29 points against Marshall and Gardenner Webb Itll stay Elon basketball Shelton Henderson being a pest Knocked it away I want to see a lot more out of Sheldon Henderson today You know last game against Florida you got in foul trouble early being very aggressive Hes going to be a key part of this University of Miami Hurricane basketball team if they want to be able to march in March Well Miamis turned it over three consecutive possessions A little over a minute and a half And that shot no good Bit too strong by Jawan Carr Miami leading 43 Were three minutes into play here tonight Donaldson looks down low for Ray New And that hook shot was blocked by Coutrol And now Drew Washington is going to guard Pettis When we get a chance can we please watch Jay Lucass coaching style when hes on the bench You can tell he was a former player Its almost like hes on the court and wishes he was on the court playing with this basketball team right now Well beautiful block by Malik Ray New Shelton Henderson with a three on the way and its good You want to see that early from one of your top guys fivestar recruit Henderson coming in shooting the basketball with confidence Thats what you want to see early on in the basketball game Its the first made threepointer of the season for Shelton Henderson Hey one thing about Coutrell Coulter whatever it is every time he shoots hes becoming rally Any person that I see that puts their hands out arms out big roll watch out Just got one in the face right there And now a three good by Drew Washington Miamiys transfer out of New Mexico Had 14 against Florida music Hes been in double figures in four consecutive games to open up the season for Miami Its 105 Canes down low Clatch hands it off Harold to Coutrol and he buries a three and he stares down that Miami bench Cruel is not wasting no time If you look at this Under Armour team anything anytime I think about Under Armour the first thing comes to mind is Steph Curry If you got Under Armour you better be knocking down some threes until a couple of days ago until they got rid of them or they got rid of them Did they get rid of him or did they get rid of them Shout out Steph Curry One great friend of mine one of the best shooters of the best shooter of all time Stephen Curry So after the bucket by Dante Allen its 12 to8 Miami And that three is good Thats buried in the corner by Randall Pettis II who leads the conference in threepointers made Hes 25th nationally And its a 121 game isnt it Very tempted You look at the defense theyre behind the threepoint line Thats been one of the biggest takeaways for this Miami basketball program is can they shoot the basketball Look for Elon and be behind the line to pressure Miami to shoot the basketball Miamis attempted a pair of threes Theyve made them both Heres Malovitz in the corner Fresh into the game for Miami 8 seconds on the shot clock Now Henderson will work on Johnson A kick out and a three by Marcus Allen is too short down with the rebound Bryson Kley whos into the game now for the Phoenix cheering Cout a point of emphasis Hes not out there right now for Elon but hes already got seven points tonight And now Claic being defended by Marcus Allen the transfer for Miami And heres a deep three by Pettis on the way Too strong And Allen will collect the long rebound Malovitz saw his defender leave his feet and now Si Altunas down low just scored his first bucket in college He scored his first point He kissed both his bottom lip and pointed to the sky Coming into this game he had played in 34 minutes in college He had accumulated 14 personal fouls and he had not yet scored a point Thats his first bucket made at the collegiate level for the Istanbul native Senator Hedo Turaloo his guy coming out here Bad pass by Claic And now a runner with one hand and a floater No good by Trey Donaldson And Altuna saw that slip out of his hands Now hes beating and banging down low Weve got a tie up Itll be Miami basketball And now checking in for Miami for the first time this season is Noam Dorvat a junior out of Israel as we get another look at the play down low Al Tunas had lost the basketball Look out for Durbat to be a perimeter threat Hes in the game early Great shooter Look for him to be a threat from behind the threepoint line Donaldson misses in the corner Elon basketball 1301 left to play Miami leading by three Canes are five of 10 early from the field Elon four of eight Both teams two of four from distance Demarco Johnson with the basketball And now Clachic into the corner for Kley Kley pulls up just inside the threepoint line and he makes it right in the faces of his defender Dorvette Back to a onepoint game now at the European transfers on the floor here for Miami A Dorvat Altunas and Movitz who just missed that shot Now into the corner Johnson hands it off Another three on the way Not going to count Missed it anyway Kley stepped out of bounds on the sideline And well get a couple of substitutions here for Miami Malik Ray Newu and Drew Washington will check back in And that means Trey Donaldson and Marcus Allen will step aside I think Elon wants to substitute and they will Chandler Coutrol whos been one of the best players in college basketball to start the season comes back Weve got Donaldson Allen Altunas Dovat and Malovitz on the floor for Miami And here goes Malik Reu back to work And his shot misses but hes fouled Hell go to the free throw line Great play I call that move to Kobe Shimmy He went left but like I always say I want to see Malik sit right Cut the left hand off See if he can go right You got to imagine if Coutrol is going to be the primary defender here for Malik Renu Miami might continue to try to get the basketball down low on the block and potentially see if they can get Cutrol into some early foul trouble Of course if you look at Jay Lucas one of the top coaches in the country and I stamp that not because I went to University Miami Ive seen the way hes been able to bring teams together being the head of defense at Duke Hes a great coach so he understands that Long rebound is pulled down by Dovrad Look for Dove to get a three coming up in the next three possessions And theres a whistle on the floor And thatll send to us All right Miami leading Elon by two 1153 left to play in the half By the way these two renewing a longstanding tradition tonight meeting for just the second time and for the first time since February 6 of 1940 when Elon came away with a 5830 victory Heres Malik Reu spinning in the paint finds a wideopen Drew Washington Great pass to Malik I would love to see him catch that ball off the top of the key and let it fly And a wideopen three in the corner for Bryson Kley is good He had a season high 14 points against Marshall just eight days ago a little over a week ago Now its back to a onepoint game now Tunas had it poked away down low but he was fouled Thats going to be on Bryson Spell the forward out of Virginia Beach and a Liberty transfer Dante Allen Trey Donaldson back into the game for Miami Doat and Malovitz are out for the Canes Doat was in and out like a basketball move Kane swinging around the outside of the arc Allen into the corner for Mik Ray New for three Thats no good True Washington pulls down the offensive rebound Hes got music himself an easy bucket True Washingtons an underrated athlete and hes a lefty I just had a daughter Shes nine months now She of course going to play basketball I want to make her a lefty As a lefty you have the advantage in basketball Well if she goes to Miami that McClinton names to follow If she goes shes going Shes going to be the first womens basketball player to play on the mens team All right You heard it first here hold you to it Two teams are exchanging buckets here tonight Thats taken away Cutral spun right into a couple of defenders Now Trey Donaldson will pull up for three and he buries it Great Great shot by Trey Donaldson when hes making the three This Miami basketball team is a different program This is a March Madness basketball team Elons made six of their last eight shots Miamis made each of their last three Kanees now have made three threepointers here tonight They have a sixpoint lead now Another three on the way They try 34 of them a game due the Phoenix And that one rattled in and out Shot was missed by Spell and weve got a foul Thats on Bryson Kley Heres the turnover Malik Grrey knew came away with it and it turned into a transition three You want to always get basketball in transition Miami is huge in transition and it shows you right there You can get in transition Your big mans pushing the ball in transition getting to your point guard for a three Thats the type of team you want to see when it comes to late March basketball Well Dante Allen misses the free throw attempt And at the moment I would imagine thats probably an area of concern for Miami because they were just 15 of 27 from the free throw line in their 8268 loss on Sunday night in Jacksonville against the Gator Free throws win games and you got to get back on defense You gave away a wideopen three Elon loves to get to shoot the three That three was made by Isaac Carroll the junior out of Jonesboro Arkansas One of just five returnees for Elon this season Theyve got 11 newcomers eight coming out of the portable And Marcus Allen makes that So 27 to 21 Now Pettis wide open and he gives it off to Clickek and hes being pestered by Dante Allen How about that defense To pass the ball and Clickek some way somehow found Pettis but he missed the reverse layup And now Shelton Henderson in transition No foul Itll be Miami basketball Baseline out of bounds here for Miami after the miss layup by Shelton Henderson The Canes move the basketball Wide open three No good for Trey Donaldson but he collects his own miss shot a little bit too strong I would love to see Trey be more aggressive behind the threepoint line Keep shooting That opens the basketball up for your team when you And now Dante Allen misses Miami missing a pair of threes Keeping Elon within six Little over eight minutes left to play Another three on the way for Harold And he came up empty Missed everything Its already the ninth attempted threepointer for Elon tonight But on the other hand Miamis attempted eight Elons made four Miamis made three And as we suspected this game is going to be played a long way away from the basket here tonight That was last touch by Miami And so its Elon basketball with 750 left to play 2721 advantage over the visiting Elon Phoenix with 750 left to play in the half Very close You look at this basketball game Elon is not too far away You want to see Miami take a big stride and get a big lead going into the second half Kley and Coutrol both have seven for the Phoenix True Washington leads the way for Miami Hes got nine Back to a fourpoint game now out of the timeout Click with his first bucket of the night Shelton Henderson working on the baseline Shot fake by Marcus Allen Hell drive That was tightly contested In transition comes Elon Now heres Pettis up under with the right hand Good Miami needs to be careful I I think you know when you when youre an ACC school and you play a team from a lower conference sometimes you think you know what at the end of the day were going to win this basketball game but when it continues to stay close end of the first half beginning of the second half you start thinking about you know what this is a real game you dont want to lose one early Elon Bench was begging for a travel by Malik Rayu and Rayu has the shot blocked thats the shot clock violation Thats thats what I was talking about As a basketball player in any position you must be shot ready when the ball comes to you Doesnt matter if youre a oneman a point guard a fourman you got to be in the stance ready to shoot the basketball Chandler Cutral will check back in now for Eli after that terrific defensive sequence in possession Teens have missed their last six shots Its a scoring drought now for Miami approaching three minutes Elon within two with a little over 6 minutes left to play in the first half Chance to tie it here or potentially take the lead Theyve already tried nine threepointers here tonight Theyve made four They make 12 a game while averaging 34 attempts And now Clachic down low Boy he had Harold open but he missed it Now Trey Donaldson with an easy bucket You want to get easy bugs in transition Great finish great composure Oh how about that look How about that look by Coutrol but you cant get back beat back door on the second play And now Malik Reu misses but flying in for the offensive rebound is true Washington And I think theyre going to tee him up Like I said before true Washington is a sneaky athletic guard No town foul just to delay a game See after he flew in for the music dunk he held on to the basketball Had something to say to somebody And so no technical foul but a delay of game issue to True Washington Elon basketball trailing by four and DeMarco Johnson being badgered by the freshman Dante Allen Coutrol for three and that rattled in and out James looking to move down the floor Allen puts it on the deck Malovitz to Washington to Henderson for three No good Thats great ball movement by University of Miami right there Thats what you want to see with a basketball team The ball should not stick Let the ball move Another three And that one is buried by Pettis the second One of the best threepoint shooters in the country Has Elon within a point And now Dante Allen flies in He had that blocked by Quick One thing about this Elon basketball team they are not afraid Theyre coming in thinking We can win this basketball game Lets let it fly Great defense And the bottom line too is when you come in as a supposed underdog Why not pull out every wrinkle and do whatever you possibly can Get up and down the floor and put a little heat on the Canes Thats exactly what theyre doing here in the first half 1 billion Heres Shelton Henderson The bucket is good and the foul Great play by Silton Henderson Hes very very strong around the basket He absorbs the contact and sometimes players absorb the contact but cant finish He can absorb the contact and still get an easy look at the basket And that all transpired after Rayu lost a handle of the basketball One of the most highly rated and touted freshman in the history of Miami Hurricanes basketball Shelton Henderson Hes got seven points Hell go back to the free throw line and he missed it too strong So the free throw problems persisting for Miami You know one thing you think about the word free throw its a free throw You must make those One of the things that got Miami in trouble last game against Florida is they went almost went under 50 at the free throw line You have to come in and correct those problems if you want to be a March team Boy good defense by Henderson Poked it away from Johnson Here comes Miami running with the ball Henderson goes coast to coast Great steel Great transition basket by Henderson Hes an amazing open court One of the top in the country Hes only a freshman Well Drew Washington has a team high 11 points but Henderson quickly approaching Hes got nine And thats a traveling violation Pettis walked with it Shelton Henderson Hes got 11 points and five rebounds in 11 minutes Miami leads by five A little under four minutes left to play in the first half than what we anticipated would be tightly contested It is Elon giving Miami a run for its money here tonight I would love to see and one and one at the end of the day I would love to see Donaldson step into that shot and shoot the three These are the games now Its not ACC play but step into that shot and shoot the basketball Put pressure on the defense That pass is always going to be there but I want to see him knock that shot down because now they got to respect it A 60 run for Miami Lead back to seven Casper Claw checks back in for the Phoenix He was held to a season low seven points his last time out Bucket good by Ray New So now the lead is eight Its the largest lead of the night for Miami cheering Little fullcourt pressure here defensively by the Canes and Demco Johnson will have to bring it across the timeline for the Phoenix Elons made four of their last five from the field but Miamis on a 70 run over the last minute and change On the wing is Carr back to the point and now Johnson had his pass tipped away Beautiful feed by Donaldson to Henderson and the finger roll at the rim is good Thats what Miami is great when they in transition off steals off rebounds thats when theyre a great basketball team Right now theyre not a team thats going to get in the half court run and set and score But in transition one of the top teams in the country Well Billy Taylor not happy with his bunch right now Thats a tough shot but a rain making fadeaway jump shot Good by Bryson Kley Great shot One foot stop Shoot up floater I dont know if it was luck if it was skill but it went in Nothing but the bottom of the net So Kleys got nine And now a three is good by Shel Anderson I love that you have a freshman catch the ball The defense is behind the line Obviously the scout report is let them shoot the basketball and you knock it down Thats what you want to see from a freshman So now Shelton Henderson with a team high 13 points for the Miami Hurricanes here tonight Carr open look for three He rattles it home Give one up and he gets one back Great shot I want to see somebody shoot another three right now Big time three there for Elon and Carr Hes got four Back to a sevenpoint game Two minutes left to play Marcus Allen beating and banging Malik Ray knew wide open for three No good Off to the left Offensive rebound down to Shelton Henderson Finds Trey Donaldson Threepoint opportunity No good Another offensive chance though Miami continues to pull down offensive rebounds and Shelton Henderson burries another Hes got 16 in the first half Hes shooting the basketball with confidence right now One of the biggest thing with being a shooter in basketball is stepping to the shot ready to shoot You dont wait and think youre going to shoot Youre thinking shoot before the ball gets to you Basketball stays with Eli Randall Pettis the second checks back in with a minute 22 left to play 16 points for Shelton Henderson Thats a new career high and hes got all 16 in the first 19 minutes of action Both teams have made six of their last eight chances from the field And now Marcus Allen is being called for a technical foul I think he may have stepped on the baseline So a technical foul and Randall Pettis the second is going to shoot and thats exactly what it was And Pettis hits the first and thats all he gets And itll be baseline out of bounds here for Elon Got to keep your tippy toes off that baseline And I think Allen has been instructed to back up maybe 6 to 12 in Neither team shooting all that well from the free throw line but that three is good Mandle Pettis with another Hes got 14 Pettis has hit a couple threes You You would You would think let me put my hands up so he doesnt get an open look You cant give guys that had a couple threes an open look Well and they knew coming in one of the best or uh I would say one of the 25 best threepoint shooters in the country to start the year Hes probably gotten a few too many open looks Now Drew Washington puts it on the deck with the right hand Shot is deflected away Another chance for the Canes at the buzzer The shot by Rayu is good but theyre going to take a look at it See if that ball was still on his fingers True Washington with 11 This is a Miami Hurricanes team coming into this one tonight Three and one on the season shooting 50 from the field as a team this year Jack told you if you look at the headtohead numbers coming into this one tonight very similar numbers Elon averaging a little over 93 points per game Miami averaging a little less Elon better from behind the arc Miami much better in the paint Boy beautiful move there Jawan Carr slipped in towards the basket laid it up and in with the right hand Great movie Look at Miamis defense They were going to play switch on that defensive possession Pick and roll switch but they didnt switch hard to guard They just switched to switch You got to switch to guard the basketball And you give up an easier basketball when you dont do it the right way Got a second difference between the shot clock and the game lock But for all intents and purposes Miami will hold it for the last shot of the first half Leading by six Trey Donaldson going to go to work on clockick There he goes right back to the left Oh he gets fouled Hell go to the free throw line Clawic got a piece of him and Donaldsons in some pain on the baseline Great move Great innout cross Tight innout cross Got to the basket Got to his body A little little hit Might have land on that hip Those hurt Those hurt right away I remember those Boy what a crossover move there that you talked about Great move It was a tight in and out A lot of times with the in out you get it outside your body That was a little set up I know I got this guy He cant guard him Let me keep it tight Cross to the basket So Trey Donaldson grabbing at his wrist a little bit there And hell go to the free throw line for the first time tonight Miami five of eight from the free throw line Elon two of three And Donaldsons first No good Too strong And coming into this one tonight Trey Donaldson a 76 free throw shooter And Elons going to take a 30 second timeout with 3 seconds left to play in the half So theyll take a time So his second chance kept it up in just a moment Well played first half Back and forth we go Its been uh a game that has featured good tempo Both teams getting up and down the floor at a pretty good pace Dante Allen checks in for Miami and Isaac Harrell the junior forward checks back in for Elon 16 first half points for the fivestar true freshman Chump Henderson Pettis the second got 14 for Elon Clock winding down Heres a heave at the buzzer Good if it goes in a bit too long So 20 minutes in the books here at the W Elon basketball to start the second half Back underway here in Miami Got a good one going here tonight Expected it to be and so far its lived up to the billing Elon has been doing a lot of shooting and well they have not been doing a whole lot of missing and that was about as easy as it comes down low for Chander Cutrol Thats a great play out of halftime Come in Lets get an easy basket Lets try to get easy basket Get into your bleeding score and you get an easy basket Three fivepoint game Oh man easy on the other end for Malik Reu Hes got 10 Three Hurricanes in double digit scoring tonight Drew Washington is going to get dinged for that foul Hes had a good night Washingtons got 11 points on five of six shooting Neither team found themselves in a whole lot of foul trouble in that first half And hard to the rack Oo that could be goalending Referees might get together and chat about this or maybe not Fouls going to be on Shel Henderson Maybe there was a continuation there and want and Henderson had a tough point Theyre going to send him to the free throw line but they never theyre going to say that that shot was shooting or if that was in the act of shooting Im not too sure why that was not goalending and the bucket count and then maybe just one more opportunity here but so it goes Maybe a tough break there for Jawan Carr and Eli Cars got seven and he comes up short on the second free throw Sixpoint game 50 seconds into play here in the second half Question for you Kyle What do you think Jay Lucas told his team at halftime Well I I I would imagine he probably was not thrilled with the defensive effort I think youve got to give a lot of credit to Elon but if youre letting somebody shoot 62 on you in the first half I would imagine there were some defensive areas in which he would like his team to clean up as true Washington hits another three Washington now with 14 Hes made a pair of threes Thats tipped away by Dante Allen Good defense active hands And now Drew Washington calling the shots Donaldson at the free throw line spinning Heres Washington Back up top Allen on the way Looks good and theres good A great shot Stepped into that pass was ready to shoot Thats the biggest thing in shooting You cant catch the ball and then think shoot You got to be thinking shoot when that ball is in the offensive players hand going to you Thats when you make a majority of your basketball shots So the true freshman Dante Allen has eight points here tonight Cutrol down low Layup attempt too strong Now theyre trying to rip it away from true Washington Largest lead of the night for Miami The advantage is 12 Here goes Henderson and he makes it And a timeout is called by Billy Taylor He has seen enough I could be better You look at this game right now here playing against Elon but at the same time Im coming in Im being aggressive Im shooting open shots Hes getting to the basket Hes finishing Hes making open shots Thats what you want to see from a fivestar recruit This is not a three or four star guy Fivestar guard Let me get in and get to it And a bounceback performance for Henderson who had just seven points on Sunday against the Florida Gator Thats taken away by Trey Donaldson No theyve got a tie up for it And its Elon basketball Great defense To other people out there Trey reed into that ball with his left hand the outside hand A lot of times you go with your right hand and you get beat He went with his left hand got a piece of the ball Almost got to stay back to Elon but you want to see that aggressiveness Youre up 14 right now but theyre playing aggressive is that theyre down 14 A fresh 30 seconds on the shot clock here for Elon And now foul on the baseline And its on Trey Donaldson And for Donaldson thats his third personal foul So hell take a seat in favor of Teimo Malovitz Trey Donaldson has been the spark plug defensively for Miami You saw it just a couple of minutes ago there in the back court But now Donaldson has to take a seat and now Elon having a hard time getting the basketball in Its rattling around and it finally falls into the hands of Malik Ray Newu but he had it taken away I think first to it was Randall Pettis the second Hes got a team high 14 for Elon Gave it up Here comes Miami Gave it up and came back and got a defensive play Thats what you want to see A lot of times guys turn the ball over and dont get back on defense Malik turned the ball over got back created a great block shot and got back on defense Thats what you want to see from one of your seniors Kley and Johnson back into the game for the Phoenix And Movitz will take it out of bounds on the baseline for the Canes it in quickly to Ray New Miami is six of 16 from distance tonight A little over 10 seconds left on the shot clock Washington down low Henderson wide open Dante Allen for three and its good Were talking about Dante Allen being a freshman coming in and shooting the basketball I came to the Miami Pro day and I asked the GM Shout out LJ Rose I said Whos the best shoe on the basketball team right now He said Dante Allen is shooting the ball at the highest clip right now Sometimes you look at Dante Allen shot Hes got a weird spin but the ball goes in cheering So for Kanes in double figures up ahead for Rayu but he walked with it and a turnover by Malik Rayu Thats the seventh turnover of the night for Miami Canes have forced 12 Phoenix turnovers and theyve turned that into 19 points Thats a big difference in this game right now 19 points for Miami off of 12 Elon turnovers Just two points off of seven turnovers for Elon Points off turnovers change games If you can execute off the turnover thats how you can win big games Man in the paint Miami doubling up Elon 32 to 16 So that is culminated in the moment to a 17point advantage Just a lopsided second half so far I dont know if I know basketball That look like a double dribble to me Was that on the floor No Teams effort here coming out of the break You got to be pleased with a topnotch head coach like Jay Lucas I guarantee his halftime speech was lets run away with this Lets run away with this basketball game And you see University of Miami basketball thats what theyre doing right now You want to look to see the Elon come out not play scared knock some open shots Well and if they are going to run away with it its going to start on the defensive end And thats exactly whats transpired Theres Claic and he fires on Altunas and he misses off to the left Dante Allen with the rebound Hes also got 11 points here tonight Drew Washingtons got 14 and seven Miami shooting 56 from the floor And that three too strong for Malovitz Boy how quickly things change too Miami was shooting 50 at the end of 20 minutes Elon was shooting 62 Now for the game Miami shooting 55 Deons 53 They have gone ice cold coming out of the half Basketball is a game of runs Thats going in right there Cash out then I already knew it in the corner Leave him open Randall Pettis the second Sounds like a running back or a defensive back 17 points for Pettis Elon will try to chip away Thats an offensive foul on Shelton Henderson cheering He didnt like it Yeah Put his shoulder right into his defender and sent him to the floor Its already six fouls by Miami in a little over five minutes here in the second half Elon is yet to commit a penalty here in a little over five minutes of play So Elons already in the bonus See if that makes a difference here Thats probably an area I would imagine Jay Lucas is not going to be thrilled that he has put Elon into a oneonone opportunity with 1432 left to play in the game Not going to be thrilled If Im Elons head coach Im calling a timeout and saying attack the basket Make them draw foul cuz not only do you get free shots the clock stops You want to have a opportunity to enhance this game Clocks not moving get to the basket make them foul you And he didnt want to but Billy Taylor was just forced to call a timeout Its a 30 second timeout on the free throws We get a one and one Slow the game down Lets get to the line knock down our free throws and lets prolong this game so we can maybe potentially get a win 15 on the shot clock and clock check tippy toeing on the baseline And that was poked away and stepping out of bounds was Caleb Middleton He did not get him two feet back on the floor He did not reestablish his position back on the court So a turnover by Elon Thats another one by the way their 13th of the night Miami out rebounding to Phoenix 234 in this game in 11 of those 23 rebounds of the offensive variety Anderson picks up his dribble Heres Washington behind the back in the paint Throws it up off the backboard and he got it to go One thing about Washington when the clock is going down look for him to attack the basket and make a shot at the rim Hes very very good at attacking the basket giving his team a chance to make a basket Finally went into the half leading by seven Now they lead by 16 outscoring Elon 15 to6 here in the second period Kane slowing things down working on the offense and Rayu is fouled Hell go to the free throw line Been a pretty quiet night for Malik Reu by his standards but he still got 10 points Youre thinking about double doubles True Washington the closest to that department was 16 and eight So Renew will go to the free throw line where hes an 82 free throw shooter this season Six of seven from the free throw line and two of three from the charity strike tonight And that one was halfway down and popped out Cutout and Hall are both back in for the Phoenix Doat and Dante Allen check in for Miami We saw just a couple of minutes of Noam Dorvat in the first half the junior out of Israel Oh after the misses by Rayu on the other end Elons again starting to chip away a little bit here That bucket was good by Kley Hes got 11 These type of games you dont want the game to be close You dont want to give a easy basket And Rayu gets fouled and he makes the bucket He was undercut and he kind of threw it up there and he got it to go Hell go back to the free throw line where he just missed a pair He was undercut but he made the shot Shout out to Shadow Waggle The best cut beef in Miami laughter Got to give my guy our shout out Whenever I be coming for the game I always get a nice little steak from Shadow Gets me going Shout out Shadow Waggle Not too far from the campus at all Have you been there before I have You like it Yeah Very good The hype is real Hype is real I agree laughter And Ru makes that free throw Renew finishes up that threepoint opportunity And now Marcus Allen will check in for him to a 17point advantage matching the largest lead of the night here for Miami Canes are looking to improve to 4 one on the season after a 14point loss in Jacksonville on Sunday night to the 10th ranked Florida Gator Miami was competitive in that game Florida was simply too good Nice little pick there down low on the block and it results in an easy bucket for Johnson Great dribble drive A lot of moving by Elon Swinging the ball get basket touches You look at this Elon basketball team on offense now theyre not selling for the three Theyre trying to get to the basket to make the refs draw the foul And now Dante Allen turns it over Here comes Kley Johnsons got down low for Coutrol Hes been pretty quiet tonight for a guy averaging 24 and a half points He gets fouled Thats the seventh team foul by Miami And this goes back to what you were talking about Jack How much can Elon stop the clock and get three points here in the final 12 minutes Stop the clock and get two shots You get one you make the first Thats what you want to do Elon coach amazing basketball coach Lets get the ball inside Make them trap Hes our leading scorer Coocho Hes having 24 points a game Theyre going to double Be strong with the basketball Make the free throws And he makes it Thats eight points tonight for Coutrol Hes got on the DeAran Foxes the Curry brand shoe the Steph Currys But once we said Steph Curry left Under Armour Wheres he going to go Jordan Brand Nike Active Dreamers Wheres he going cheering You know do his own thing Do his own thing Might as well What would you do Kyle Do my own thing Hey so Cutrol makes both Hes got nine Pettis leads the way for the Phoenix tonight with 17 This is an Elon team who came into the night averaging about eight and a half turnovers per game Theyve already turned it over 13 times Heres Dove Shot no good Created a little bit of separation but he couldnt make it Tough shot Great shot One of your top shooters on the 10 You wanted to see him shoot that ball early Not mad at that shot by him Kley to Johnson And Johnson down low now to Coutrol who spins throws it up gets fouled Hell go back to the free throw line Exactly what Billy Taylor wants to see Frequency I would come to Miami and every time I have an opportunity to come to a school Im picking Miami But thats just me Im not saying it because I went here Im just saying it from observation I live here I dont disagree with you But as you know in todays day and age if youre really good when you walk on campus somebody better open up a checkbook to make you stay Its all about the money Its all about the money But sometimes the money is funny You were 20 years younger Jack Instead of owning the four properties you do down here you probably own six in college alone right Instead of four I probably have 14 Yeah right You dont youd own blocks So 6655 That ball was tipped up Now Rayu in the corner for True Washington Back down low for Rayu with a flush with one hand Great flush Throw it down big man Throw it down Thats 15 quiet points for Malik Renu It doesnt feel like hes asserted himself in this game in which he has but hes got 15 If you ask me how many points Renu had and I didnt look at the scoreboard Id say eight Eight to 10 So yeah 8 to 10 Well that shows you the quality of a great basketball player You may not see it but youre going to see it after the scouting report Youre going to see it after the game I got 15 on your head Top three Phoenix in double figures Four for the Canes Renu in Washington along with Henderson Those latter two have got 16 Hendersons got it right now Finds a wideopen true Washington bombs away for three and he came up well short Here comes Elon after a oneanddone opportunity by Miami Kleys got it Gets a high screen from Coutrol Sets another screen for Johnson whos going to wave Kley through Little twoman game here Heres Coutrol and Drew Washingtons got the assignment Look at Coorol go Look at that fine Boy it was a beautiful bounce pass that got away from Bryson Kley I have no idea though Jack how Chandler Coutrol even saw that guy coming on the baseline You know what they call that The 66 You ever saw that movie Yeah I mean that youre right And hes got it because I dont think he ever turned his head He knew where to fire this Well thats thats pretty though You know what Shout out to my dad right now You see he always teaching me Hey son you got to know about peripheral vision You may be looking for it but you can see it off the side and he saw that on the last play Great inbound play Yes it was Look at this game Its a ninepoint game Demarco Johnson with the assist now Trey Donaldson is being pestered Demarco Johnson was all over him The bucket by Middleton And the shot is missed by Henderson And whos that off of Its off of Henderson So Elon basketball its 5968 with 939 left to play And that Miami bench starting to tense and tighten up a little bit Lets see what Elon runs right now on offense High pick and roll Look to get a paint touch Get to the paint Make the ref draw a foul Ah you dont want to see that Tough take away for Miami up top to Donaldson He was fouled One thing I love about Donaldson he knows how to create the contact If he doesnt have the layup hes going to make the ref see him initiate the contact You might have to call a foul Look at this replay Found the contact It could have been a steal but he made the breath See me Im jumping into the contact Let me get to the line Hes got to make his free throws right now Lets see what we got Two free throws awarded for Trey Donaldson who makes the first The foul was on Harold Thats his second team third Meanwhile Miamis committed eight personal fouls so far here in the second half This game is still close 9 minutes and 24 seconds is a lot of time All in all Miamis done a pretty good job defensively against an Elon team that came into the night averaging a little over 90 points per game Pair of three inone teams squaring off here in Coral Gables tonight Teams lead by 11 A little over 9 minutes left to go now Here goes Joawan Carr He got fouled Once again always we kept saying get a paint touch A lot of times when the game is close you know 9 10 11 12point game when you get in the paint and you draw the foul or you just act like you draw the foul the refs most likely going to call it The ref doesnt know you know right Its one and one Hes just going to call the foul Free throw is good for Jawan Carr Hes got eight points tonight Bryson Spell checks back in Miami nine of 15 in the free throw department tonight Elon eight of 10 now nine of 11 Thats keep it a minute a little bit Shooting 82 from the free throw line Nine of 11 Ninepoint game Nine minutes left Ninepoint game This is the big position by Miami right now And dont forget Elon remains in the bonus Miami did a lot of fouling in the first three to four minutes of this second half Here is true Washington with 16 down low for Alunas who nearly had it stripped away And now Trey Donaldson floats it up in the paint That is good Thats a tough finish going left float with the left but they call that flotation device Cant give him a three right now though And spell misses Another chance Bombs away Randall Pettis the second No good Now up ahead for Donaldson And that rolled off the rim but he was fouled Hell go back to the free throw line Once again the great thing about Trey hes great at drawing initiating the contact talking to the ref Say Ref give me the call Look at this fast break right here Initiate the contact Contact Boom Its a great play From where Im from in Baltimore we call out the body up You find the contact first You make the ref call the foul If he goes straight up the ref might not call that If I lean into you give me to the free throw line please and give me one Just had six ns then 11 Click and Allen back in for Elon in Miami Chandler Coutrol whos been kept in check here by Miami tonight averaging 24 and a half points Hes only got 11 He Hes out The lead is swells back to 13 A little over eight minutes left to play in the half and the game Pettis high pick and roll for Clatchic That was nicely done Good execution by the Phoenix Great execution by the Phoenix No sons but they trying to say these Bulls are my sons Offensive foul or defensive foul Bryson Spell is going to get called for the block in the paint boys music out when Elon is ready to play You just saw Shell Henderson hes got 16 tonight Came into the game averaging 11 this season Washington true Washington averaging 14 Hes got 16 as well Sorry to cut you off I really want to see Malik step into that shot and shoot the ball Just like I want to see Trey step into that shot and shoot the basketball that one Hes not nervous Hes stepping in Hes shooting the basketball and its going in the basket Third three of the night for Allen Hes got 14 And you said at the end of this beginning of this game you want to see Dante Allen be an offensive threat That would change the tritory like trifecta trek here with this basketball game and his basketball team Yeah Allen came into the night He was three of 13 this season from three Well hes three of four from distance here tonight Hes shooting the basketball with confidence One thing that I noticed as a shooter when the basketball spins a lot most likely you got a better chance of shooting the basketball I got to give a shout out to my brother Carlos Boozer Its his birthday today He turned 44 music Hes a Duke guy His kid should have went to Miami but thats my brother Shout out Carlos Boozer 44 years old Happy birthday know if he should take a look at it or not Well the whole operation got that one correct So Miami leads by 14 A little over 7 minutes left to play in the game after a successful challenge Miami shooting 56 from the floor Elon shooting 53 Both teams have made eight threepointers Miamis got 23 points off of 14 Phoenix turnovers here tonight Shot clock at five as Henderson bullies his way in Misses the first misses the second And following up third times a charm for Malik Renu Its all about the follow up You know the first time you might text somebody you like on Instagram she might not respond but when you follow up shell follow up too Great finish Another follow up by Fal She dont ask the first time Follow up 17 points for Malik Renu who is three points shy of his fifth consecutive game with 20 plus and theres a foul Theyre going to get Alunas for the foul and Kley and Allen check back in And Alunas will take a seat If you look at Tonas and if you look at one of the top shows of all time who does he look like in the show Tunas Uh I have no idea cheering Think about a little bit more One of the Im not going to say the name of the show Im just going to say Seinfield Oh I Oh youre talking about shows I thought you were talking about a player I have no idea how much talking about shows Oh Kramer Okay All right I dont know I dont even know what that is my friend I mean Ive heard of him A man like Kramer Great basketball player Thats a great show Thats a heck of a Thats a tough finish for Trey Donaldson Hes got 14 And now a tactical foul Oh a technical foul has been called on Elon Whos shooting the tech right now Uh I think Trey Donaldsons going to shoot it And I think Randall Pettis II is the one thats going to get called for it These are one of the most tough free throws you can have One is to tech Its still early Everybodys percentage is fluctuating You better make these cuz youre going to get the next ones Oh and Donaldson missed it And so its Elon basketball after the technical foul Id love to know what happened down there that initiated the technical foul It was just one shot missed by Donaldson And Elon gets the basketball Carr got inside lost it numbers for Miami Washington had it tried to throw it back up for Rayu and then it got tipped around Now the balls all over the place and weve got a mad scramble on the floor and Miamis going to settle things down and there should be 20 seconds on the shot clock Thats the whistle In fact I think they might actually give Miami a full 30 seconds back on the clock Dont look at the score right now What do you think the score is How do you think Miami is up right now Uh 18 laughter You know you know were so caught up in commentating in the game It didnt look like the Miami was up 18 right now but that goes to show at the end of the day theres levels there is So 26 seconds on the shot clock You know one thing that I think about in college basketball today look at a high level ACC basketball team you look at a team like Elon Do you think that the NIL budget for Elon doesnt equate to success to be able to compete with the University of Miami basketball team And I would venture to say it probably does not as Rayu missed the dunk but it ended up in the hands of Drew Washington and its going to be offensive goalending The basket was still shaking and rattling I mean this isnt the fair This isnt the fair call He dunked the ball missed it The ball was still rattling You cant call that He didnt hang on He let it go Well because Yeah because the basket was that I mean thats in the rule book The basket is still moving like that Thats going to be offensive goalending as Bryson Kley buries a three What do you mean the back I mean he dunked the ball and moved He didnt hang on it I didnt make the rules brother All right Sorry about that laughter And that doesnt go for Rayu but Donaldson takes it right back and he makes it at the rim He just put his body right into Bryson Kleys and a strong finish for Trey Donaldson Trey reminds me of Baltimore basketball players One of the good friends of mine Maurice Barkstdale started the body up basketball finish Find the contact put your body into him and finish 27 points off of 18 Elon turnovers Thats a crazy shot by Drew Washington He got bailed out Hell go to the free throw line Key word bailed out Were not talking about jail I dont know if I like that finish but he put pressure on the defense Made the ref call a foul Got a knock on your free throws Third time tonight Drew Washingtons gone to the free throw line He was two of three Now hes three of four Couple of substitutions here for Eli And Washington makes both And its the largest lead of the night for Miami 19point advantage Pettis thought about a step back three Heres Cutrol whos been quiet tonight but he got fouled again So back to the free throw line goes Chandler Coutril who was the only division one player averaging 24 and a half points per game and seven rebounds coming into this one Hes got a quiet 13 and four What you want to see by Allen on that play great defense Coo spit right went left Allen put his hands down It makes the ref blow his whistle In training as a ref if the hands go down theyre going up for a shot Most likely should call foul Keep your hands up Make the ref make the decision But when you put your hands down the ref is automatically knowing in my playbook hands down call foul and Coo missed them both and Reuse got his fifth rebound of the night Trey Washington is one rebound away from a double double Hes got 18 and nine and Donaldson lost it It ended up in the hands of Dante Allen Hey the ball slipped out of his hands on the way to the rim Deep three no good Here comes Malobitz Look at the Euro staff Great move Euro step for European in his mind coming down He said You know what Im hitting with the Euro Hes from the States Im from Europe He dont know whats coming Easy lay Great play Those were soft feet by the 68 freshman out of Slovakia whos averaging right around 15 minutes per game And this one starting to be rather academic as the Canes put this on ice Oh LOOK AT THAT BEHIND THE BACK TREY DONALDSON Look at that behind the back I gotta repeat that because that looked like Jack Not really I shoot threes Great play I mean the rest of the schedule I mean after this it only starts to get tougher right BYU and then youre in the tournament with Dayton and Georgetown Then you go to Miss for the ACC SEC showdown And then Miami will find themselves with three more nonconference games against Louisiana Monroe FIU and North Florida before conference competition begins on the 30th They got a couple more games to figure it out Yes this game I feel like if Im Coach Jay Lucas it took us too long to take this game out of reach You want to see your team come in and dominate from the start I dont think Miami came in and dominated from the beginning Took this Elon team for granted and let them kind of be in the game But you have a couple more games to figure it out Lets see what Miami does Dante Allen another three Came up short Well Dante Allens having a good night for Miami 14 points four of eight shooting three of five from three And Teemo Malovitz is going to get called for the foul Molovitz was held scoreless in 10 minutes against Florida Did not attempt a shot in that game Hes got uh two points here tonight Hes one of three from the field And this is Ekker Garmentia the red shirt freshman forward out of Barcelona and a transfer from the University of Illinois Chicago at the free throw line for the Phoenix deal that Phoenix is call Yeah the bird You know I dont know Im not asking you Only Phoenix I know is the sun Well Im not talking about a human Yeah I hear it Great pass Great shot Great shot Marcus Allen is an underrated shooter for this basketball team at Missouri last year He was very getting to the basket putting pressure on the defense but he can knock an open shot Thats going to be big for the University of Miami program going into the future And the triple try good by Jawan Carr on the other end 10 of 40 left to play and Dovats three no good and Carr gets his way into the paint Offbalance shot off the glass misses And now Dovat again out for Malovitz Too strong And Altunas going to get called for a foul We got three Europeans on the court right now We got Slovenia we got Turkey and we got Israel Shout out to the Miami Heat for building the roster on the European roster and they getting wins One of the big things for the Miami Heat let the ball move Dont hold the basketball Thats one thing You look at NBA basketball right now these Europeans are taking care taking over the league but letting the ball move and theyre playing the right way Look at Jay Lucas with his recruiting process right Let me get some Europeans on my program that play the right way 112 left to go Pair of free throws missed by Garmia Al Tumas Thats good on the foul Alumas signs field Sign me up And one Its a great move Great touch Great field by the basket Middleton had a handful of his jersey So after being held scoreless for four games to start his college career Sal Tunas hes got four points here tonight Hes going to make it five right now And his first trip to the free throw line is good Wait I didnt know he was lefthanded You know he was lefthanded Yes I swear I thought he was righthanded Wow The southpaw Southpaw This is going up Kley down low Middleton spins Shot clock winding down Fadeaway no good Another whistle And with 236 Six seconds left to play Miami will go back to the free throw line for a pair of shots No I want to show you a oneonone opportunity Has he made the first one If you were a betting man right now thats up to him If youre a betting man would you put on five bucks that he didnt make the first I dont think so Not betting laughter Well I dont think hes going to make it or I dont think so Im not betting Exactly Not betting Cash me out then Shout out to Turkey Its Thanksgiving Its Thanksgiving Thats why hes from Turkey Its Thanksgiving The energy is vibrating right there Miami has a lot to be thankful for here tonight 99 points on the board They have twice scored 100 points this season Does Elon shoot this ball right now or they dont shoot it No I think Billy Taylors telling him no shot So he says back it up If Billy Taylors my coach and I have 14 or nine Im letting this thing fly Thatll do it from the Watts Go Center here tonight Miami downs Elon 99 to 72 They improved to 41 on the season So
