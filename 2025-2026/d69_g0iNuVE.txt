on Khan hoops Tommy Moresy Leslie Jones Justin Porterfield have the assignment tonight Off we go Maryland Eastern Shore in the Maroon Virginia in the whites The Hawks coming off a loss on Saturday to American by 18 but they shot the ball very well in that game 62 Yeah backto back wins against quality opponents outside the friendly confines of JPJ Starting lineup for the Cavaliers has remained consistent throughout the season Tester Ritter the leading scoreer at 16 and a half points per game so far Heres Don Hall trains a tray Ask and you shall receive Right Yes sir The Cavaliers above 50 from three over the last three games Starters here for Maryland Eastern Shore This is Joseph Loandro with the ball coming off a careerhigh in D1 of 20 against American Cavaliers have been so unselfish in their play most of the season This is a Sam Lewis three They make it look so easy They share the basketball make the extra pass and the spacing is impeccable Well when Ryan ODM assembled this cast he brought in players who combined for over 600 threes in their career Penetrate and pitch Heres Michael Teal who runs the point for me And now the freshman Levi Beckwith Dorian Staples sees two Cavaliers continuing in their mantoman Now theyre going to double Locandro in the mid post Locandro tries to step through Nullified here Shot clock is winding down Staples just chucks one up Cavaliers ball And thats the side of the ball that Brian Odum wants to see improve cheering and thats a play he doesnt want to see Malik Thomas called for the offensive foul Thatll go down as a turnover for UVA Now the Cavaliers were great offensively against Dayton scored 86 points but they committed 21 turnovers the most in a long time Yeah they they shot the ball 60 from the field 60 from the from the three 74 from the free throw line and and just crushed Dayton on the backboard but 21 turnovers A lot of their production from a scoring standpoint over the weekend came from their reserves among the nations leaders in bench points Both these teams are teal goes up Teal cant hit to Ritter off the ricochet controls applause Virginia winning the glass so far this season on average by 11 per game as Johan Gruno will go to the line Brian ODM first year after a couple of years at BCU made the NCAA tournament in his second year at each of his last three stops Cavaliers right now ranked inside the top 25 Mac I would imagine this UVA team will go dancing in year one under his leadership Uh I I called you the very first time I saw him practice and told you that this is an NCAA team No doubt about it Why were you so confident Uh you know the the talent level was one thing but the depth of talent was the main thing And Virginia throughout the season setting up in a mantoman press not necessarily all the time with the goal of forcing turnovers just to slow down the opposition Yeah you know you have to play less time in the half court And some folks you can speed up like they did just there with Teal One of the best shot blocking teams in America Number one and number two shot blockers in the ACC Theres one of those big shot blockers Grunlow whos just a pest on the offensive glass as well 7footer 19yearold freshman from Germany Now Thomas the transfer from San Fran air balls it Yeah his numbers have gone down just a little bit as the team numbers have gone up Just one for his last 11 from three Now Staples out wide for Teal Had the screen Three ball goes up Three ball is hit Nice shot from Staples And kind of a stretch four at a not far away Fredericksburg Virginia 70 mi east of here Maryland Eastern Shore with a lot of newcomers this season 12 new players 10 via the portal Similar story for the Cavaliers A few points coming back from last year I think its been a similar story for every game weve done this season Yeah similar themes across the board Maryland Eastern Shore just one for five to begin the game Cavaliers getting some subs ready to go Loandro getting physical down low against Gruo and scores Yeah and he he has been playing well You pointed it out Careerhigh against American last time out of 20 points four rebounds Hes a big physical guy who can step out and shoot the three He has scored 16 or more in five of his last six Thomas no hesitation Thats a good skip pass Defense doesnt have time to react there and it helps out position You skip the ball and it takes them a little too long to get there And yet again Virginia succeeding from the threepoint line Three for five to start Teal to the rack Nice adjustments Really nice play Shot blocker there for the rim protector there kept his eye on the prize And Mackie mentioned it Virginia second in the country in shot blocks only behind Georgia About seven blocks per game And now Maryland Eastern Shore changing up the defense This is something Cleo Hill Jr Their head coach wanted to do in todays game Little two three zone action They match out of it Sometimes theyll shift into mantoman at a certain point during the possession Yeah Coach Hill was telling us you know we just have to throw them off guard They cant be comfortable Beckwith stops the dribble Now Dorian Staples who has started now the last five games Shot clock at five here TLC sees two Loandro is a threepoint shooter and showcases that skill Yeah Ball screen and Gruno stayed a little too long with the dribbler Couldnt get back to Landro in time Maryland Eastern Shore not too unfamiliar with power four competition This is their fourth big time game of the year And Hall gets bumped on the perimeter by Dorian Staples Nice start for Maryland Eastern Shore hanging tough with UVA beating Kyle Guys Virginia record music and he is just three threepoint makes shy of tying the NCAA record held by Todd Leslie making 15 straight for Northwestern back in 1990 Thats amazing I Id be as a coach I Id be like the no hitter Dont you know I dont know that we wanted to talk about it Sorry I mentioned it My bad Coach ODM Uhoh Heres White for three Oh man Come on Well well have to start a new streak There you go Certainly capable Fans recognized it here too They knew Now Sam Lewis applause got it back Offensive rebounding something theyre doing very well and the second shot pays off for three points Virginia just phenomenal from threepoint range and out chance Mallerie another one of those reserves Yeah And Maryland Eastern Shore here they are 10 points only three points behind They they only score 62 a game but they shoot the ball well Third third in the MAK in field goal percentage and fourth in threepoint percentage Turnovers though the issue They commit about 17 per game They do And theres another one right on Q Park Uh Onenso the backup center forcing the steel Now Mallerie the penetration Heres Devin Tillis injured to begin the season becoming more and more comfortable as games continue Mallerie tickles the twine and Virginias got five threes on 10 tries Yeah Tillis Tillis can do so many things Great vision right there 10 applause count It was Justin Mond trying to get across the timeline And there is that press for Virginia slowing down the opposition Yeah Mallerie with the good ball pressure right there And theres Cleo Hill second season coming over from division 2 Winston Salem State His father Cleo Hill Senior great basketball name scored nearly 2500 career points at Winston Salem State And Cleo Hill Jr played his ball at NC Central Singledigit shot clock situation for the Whos Onenso misfires on the three Transfer from Kansas State who has added the threepoint shot to his repertoire this year Trey Hall has also checked in for Maryland Eastern Shore Sixth year grad second year with the program Coopers three A little too short And theres Lewis plucking down the board Transfer from Toledo Grooving to the rack applause Just so versatile Can do so many things Hes a Hes probably an underappreciated defender too Can guard multiple positions And Mac weve been around this program for a handful of times to begin this season Hes a pretty laidback dude Doesnt talk all that much right But he just does his job and and and his job includes a whole lot of different things Lent the Mack in threepoint shooting last season with the Rockets 44 from long range Hell head out here as Don Hall returns Starting point guard for the Whos So many different lineup combinations that Ryum can use In the zone now starting to match up Hell put Tillis at the high post here White who is so electric off the bounce Tillis a line drop We talked about the diversity of his game One thing that uh that hes been consistent with he is a winner from Cal Irvine Yeah and he brought his team to the NIT championship game last year before an overtime defeat to Chattanooga But the Anteaters with 19 points in that game Staples cant get it to go Cooper one of the smallest guys on the floor Hes going to the line Yeah no fear Took it right to the rim Virginia scoring the last 11 points Cavaliers have made four of their last five shots Sam Lewis off to a phenomenal start Hes got eight and such a presence on the perimeter Enjoy a very happy life together Jaden Cooper out of the timeout missing the first free throw And yes even Cavman there to congratulate the duo Virginia has scored the last 11 points eight cheering so far from Sam Lewis And the run is over here Cooper making the free throw Maryland Eastern Shore Not a great free throw shooting team so far this season 64 and they dont get to the line a lot Im sure Coach Hill would love to get to that spot often this evening Okay the ring Lets zoom in on that Oh nice I think Chase has to work a lot more games though Virginia 7 for13 from the field to begin the game Three ball goes up from Don Hall Swish You know Hall is kind of a under the radar guy if you will but he does so many things and he you know coach Als last time talked about what a calming influence he has on the team on both ends of the floor Yeah players really look up to him as a leader Transfer from BYU Mario Hansen Jr in the post here sophomore from Charlotte Another late shot clock situation Turnaround shot and it does not go for Christopher Flipping applause Only three twopoint tries so far for the Whos Virginia taking a school record 27 threepointers per game to begin the season Timer at eight Mallerie weaves and he is held up here Its a foul on Teal T a little handsy there on that ball screen action Starting post come back for Ryan ODs butts and Gruno What have you enjoyed most about that duo coming in from overseas Well their diversity you know Grunlow is a a shot blocker but can shoot the three Theyre both outstanding passers and uh goodness gracious uh Tess is just an allaround really good player physically ready and theyre and theyre both youngsters in in terms of their eligibility And you are really bullish on Chance Mallerie this freshman point guard from Charlottesville Uh he he is a difference maker and you know they theyve let him kind of come along at his own speed but his speed is high speed A dozen points He fits his style of play so well on both ends He can get after you defensively He can penetrate and his shot is as pure as anybody and he hasnt been shot You know sometimes you get a freshman point guard and its like okay how can I facilitate for others and hes obviously worried about doing that and hes done a great job at that But when he has the ball in his hands hes also looking to score Well one of the first things that Ryan Odm told me about Chance when they when he committed was he is a really confident young man and it shows up Now something coach Odum wanted to work on as we move into final season here at UVA committing fewer fouls Committing fewer fouls and pressing more and doing it differently you know when they need to Long two goes and Maryland Eastern Shore finally snaps the scoreless drought of nearly five minutes Theres a really nice play right there And Justin Mond who averages just north of eight points per game so far Hes had six double digit scoring games to begin this season Hell take a big shot too Did so in the opener against Georgia Tech late in that game Thomas turbos to the 10 Yes sir And I like that a lot You mentioned hes one for his last 11 for three coming into this game Thats one thing you can do to make up for that Take it to the hole make some of those twopointers and get that confidence back At just four points only played 13 minutes against the Flyers in the 13point win on Saturday But he is capable of erupting at any time Had 24 a season high against Butler in the Greenbryer tip off in West Virginia a few weeks back Folks remember this game was tied early on 10 a piece Yeah since it was 10 Not good at math but it looks like 20 to three since then Yes Nicely done Bravo Elvis carrying subtracting It is finals time It is And this will be the the final test before those finals for the Cavaliers Yeah Final exams from Thursday through next Friday The next game for UVA is not until Saturday December 20th against an old rival in Maryland 11 days And uh we we talked to coach Odo about handling that and he said he knew what he was getting into cuz thats the way it is here at Virginia Ditter from the outside Wow They are nine for their first 13 from threepoint range They have nine threes in not even 11 minutes Back to backto back games like that 60 coming off 60 against Dayton Well cheering wants to get his assist numbers higher Only has six to begin the season but hes got the ball a lot in his hands in this offense Yeah hes hes made a three and made a nice post move but other than that been pretty quiet applause Now to Ritter as of four running the operation for the Caps Thomas tries to penetrate A lot of congestion inside Steel fores Nice job Levi Beck with the helping on the double team right there 67 freshman from Raleigh who has started every single game to begin his collegiate career Short corner Jay put it on the board Low Canro Yeah Seven points already Half their points from the big fella in the middle fourth different stop He was at Barton Community College in Kansas to begin his career Then two separate D2 schools Brumo asking for the ball Hall takes the screen Don floats to the rim and Gruo just pumps it in very nicely very softly Yeah thats good touch and a good find by Don Hall on the dribble drive Heres Trey Brown for MES a junior at 67 listed as a point guard Coach Hill was telling us theyre trying to find music his best position on the floor Yeah junior college transfer from Salt Lake Just suffocating defense from the Whos no paint touch and the shot clocks at five Beck tries cant hit One and done They just dont allow you into the house Thomas my goodness Got to find him Double digit threes for the Whos assistant coach over at for Maryland Eastern Shore said You got to get out there You got to find him in transition It feels like were watching UVA at its max potential offensively because they have the big bruisers down low and Derritter and Onenso and even Grunlo gets involved but when the threepoint shooting hits like this man oh man theyre tough to stop Yeah that thats uh thats asking a lot of any defense any team at any level Ditter drawing Staples out to the perimeter Thomas showcasing some strength Back cut and it did not find Lewiss hands Instead Mand for Maryland Eastern Shore cheering Maryland Eastern Shore just six for 17 to begin the game Four giveaways so far Ditter defends outside here against Mond who can shake Tries to bake Yes Wow Created just enough space right there Really nice move by Mond Very efficient in the last game 10 points against American on just five shots Pump fake to Ritter Piouette four to five pass Grumlow not there and Ditter called for a loose ball foul here Virginia 10 threepointers early on The Cavaliers making it rain here at JPJ But you know its cold out here So theyve made it snow 30 from that spot Yeah Just really efficient and uh and again a product of sharing the basketball great spacing running the floor well and always making that extra pass I mean this is a mosaic of the modern game Trey Brown right there with a little mosaic of his own over the outstretched hands of the second best shot blocker in the ACC Browns got long reach so hes got good shot delivery from different angles Onenso back in for the Whos strides his way to the cup Heres Zion Oandla who has provided some nice production off the bench Fifth year senior D2 Claflin transfer Nice pass down low from Brown and the extra shot goes for Flip It Good job on the backboard right there Good cut Lewis rejects too mighty on the shot On Yenzo always doing the dirty work Mallerie off the fine from Tillis Yeah Tillis was wide open made the extra pass again This time Mallerie didnt knock it down but thats been the exception tonight I was going to say did someone open up the door Might be getting cool in here Under four and a half to go in this first half Its hard to maintain 67 from beyond the arc I hear you Oanla high post jumper True Tillis lost his man right there Turned his head to look at helping on the post Well Ill tell you what Mac When we spoke with Coach Hill earlier today he said These noncon games are like a try out for us And Im sure a guy like Oanla is trying to prove something going into MAK play Yeah Try out to get ready for MAK play in January where they open with rival Morgan State Tillis a three Tillis gave up two on the other end but he got it back with three on this end In fact the Cavaliers have five different players who have made cheering cheering applause cheering Tillis from the corner And now the press is the little different This is a team that wants to play in the 60s Virginia wants to play in the 90s So they turn the pressure up just a little bit to try to turn them over or force the pace And of course Chance Mallerie leads his team in steals with 16 now 17 Yeah hes been brilliant defensively And look we were at shoot around this afternoon and coach ODM did tell his team Lets put pressure on them Lets ramp up the pace Theyre not going to be comfortable if we press them the way we want to press them Yeah And again thats the thats the beauty of this press is that you can do a lot of different things Most of the time its just designed to wear the other team down In this particular case they want to speed up So then lets flip it to Maryland Eastern Shores perspective How do you survive that avalanche Well you you have to be strong with the ball meet passes and keep your spacing Now Cooper tries his luck in transition and gets the deuce Very nice play right there Jake Cooper only averages four points a game out of Goldsboro North Carolina Well thats how you beat the press right You dont have to face it at all Exactly Now Lewis got off to that phenomenal start in this game Eight points three for four from the field Pick and roll Onenso absorbs inside the paint Oh Oanla confused but the foul is on him Ugana Onenso seven points per game just over four rebounds per game so far this season Yeah he doesnt get to the free throw line a lot but hes been pretty good there Eight for 11 Thats a nice looking shot as uh you witnessed at practice today Yeah ball went my way I have to give him a little bounce pass And he knocked it down Yes he did Syracuse picking up a big win in the ACC SEC challenge last week at home against Tennessee Yeah their men and women both won Very impressive music Adrien Autry few years at the helm now trying to steer that program back to the NCA tournament Thatll be a good test St Joes has some talent Yes not off to a great start but a very talented team with coach Donahghue who was you know many years at 10 Always a big time threat out of the A10 are the Hawks These Hawks in the MAC Maryland Eastern Shore picked seventh out of eight but theyve had some nice flashes to begin the season despite the 48 record Hung very tough with Georgia Tech on opening night And even though they got blown out against Kraton in a game a few weeks back they played the Blue Jays evenly for about a 16 17 minute stretch in that game Yeah they just have trouble doing that whole 40minute thing But Jaden Cooper keeps shooting like that Theyll have more good moments Onenso locks his eyes on the rim Hes going to go for it And theres Jakari White He is a leaper despite being a guard So athletic Gruno Why not Four Cavaliers inside the lane White cant come up with the loose change though Brown asserts himself to the rack and this will end up as a travel because Brown came back down to the ground with possession Yeah Thought he was going to draw the foul right there The defenders were straight up So the travel goes the other way for the Cavaliers So that wont go down as a block The Cavaliers only have one on the game so far Not every statistical category can be perfect but thats what shot blocking looks like inside How do you get it past those seven footers Thats why sometimes we just refer to it as rim protector not necessarily shot blocker They have the same impact But here you go You have the top two shot blockers in the ACC on the floor together in Bruno and Onenso Yeah I would suggest maybe jump shots Not going to the rim right here Okay Mallerie a little too short on the layup Maryland Eastern Shore trying to beat those shot blockers Teal does and he gets whacked So there you go right Grunlo and Onenso working back in transition Theyre not in the paint So Maryland Eastern Shore says You know what Lets go now And you and you could see the Hawks getting a little bit more confidence a little bit more comfortable with the with the style and speed of this game Don Hall called for his first Cavaliers now with five as a team A fantastic womens basketball matchup we have for you Sunday afternoon here on the ACC Network and music the ESPN app Number 12 North Carolina hosting number 22 Louisville at Carmichael Arena in Chapel Hill Coverage begins at 4 Eastern Kajiana Roberts for Louisville sophomore has played some good basketball to begin this season Laura Ziegler transfer from St Joes first team all music A10 last season Thatll be fun Yeah good good basketball Tough the league Not as many elite teams as as some years but uh but some good basketball and some folks that as they get the chemistry right will play better and better I think uh as I saw Duke Sunday and uh you know they they had struggled against a tough schedule but uh looked like the old Duke to me and Mack will also have an ACC MAK matchup tomorrow Womens basketball Virginia women taking on Howard Mallerie down the baseline Lewis trapped in the corner here and they say that he is shoved first by Mond Yeah Mond six for nine to begin the season Just about 80 on his career dating back to his time at North Dakota State Theres got to be some NIL uh potential deal there right Sure They follow their leader Wonder what the membership is I wonder they clearly its growing right Oh yeah Oh this is a budding fan base Under a minute to go here in the first half quickly so they can get a the last possession of the half You got to score in droves to keep up with UVA So more possessions the better Except they throw it away and it backfired on and now the Cavaliers can go two for one Oh check that Maryland Eastern Shores got the ball Mond in an exaggerated euro and Mallerie tracks it down Up and down we go Lewis to the rack Hes got two Nice threeon one Made the right decision cheering Hows your neck feeling going back and forth like that I like it Ive been to tennis matches before The US Open here in Charlottesville this year Just kidding Just kidding All right shot clock is off here 12 seconds to go Flipin on the reverse Its never going to work against the presence of Bruno Game clock at five Mallerie turns it over Speeding ahead Teal to the 10 Yes Really nice play by Teal Good way to end the half for the Hawks right there That felt like the Chargers Eagles game from last night with all those turnovers in the last minutes music Back and forth back in the early goings of this season with Mac McCarthy Cory Spectre So delighted that you chosen us tonight appreciate you being with us Virginia up by 14 but this is still a ball game Yeah Hawks hung around by by shooting the ball fairly well We told you they were theyre among the better shooting teams in that league that but they dont score a whole lot of points and they have struggled to stop Virginia Also shot 47 from the field in the opening half Shot clock at three here to Levi Beck with the freshman Staples just hoisting one up Nearly banked it in That was a little more like what coach Odm would like to have I I know he was not pleased with the half court defense Hall pierces the paint A little too much English on it Well we have finals week coming up here on grounds Virginia doesnt have another game for about a week and a half So Ryan Odin would love a good taste in his mouth going into uh this next stretch Oh Loandros wide open cherry cheering picking and Gruno called for the goalende So Loandro now with nine Any opportunity Gruno has to pace one on the backboard Hes going to try Yeah And that uh thats even worth something psychologically next time you go out Yeah Dont do that Seven blocks against Ryder in the opener most by a Cavaliier freshman since Jason Clark with eight against VMI in O2 Now Grulo tries to go to work on the offensive end Hes stripped here Michael Teal with the ball Teals a good help right there knocking the ball away cheering Tele provided this team with a lot of energy in the first half I thought it was pretty notable Cooper on a fade Cooper but very impressive Under control knows when to shoot it Columbia transfer first season with the program Leads the team in assists Thomas on the turnaround No dice there And Landro on the outlet Here is Koopa Jaden drives Circus shots Uhuh Thomas in transition Thomas to the baskets Grunlo cleans it applause Three missed layups to start the half and then Thomas with the stick back We use the word mosaic in the first half Maybe not the first couple of minutes here Yeah more like a puzzle So Gruno with the put back there putting Virginia up by a dozen Teal locates an open player down low Its St And Maryland Eastern Shore down by 10 points here Yeah Running running their offense a little more uh efficiently And another point blank shot this time the finish by Ritter That was a violent attack of the rim It was It was You know its interesting Mack You go back to that game on Saturday in Charlotte against Dayton Coach Odum took Der to Ritter out within the first three minutes of the game because he was taking shots from the perimeter And thats fine and thats a part of his game but he wants to see Tess in go mode all the time Yeah And and he thought he was just standing a little bit too much on both ends of the floor and he got the message and cleaned that up And theres a message sent by Grunlo Yeah Johan creating a mess for three Thomas Ditter offensive rebound Thomas slithers hesitates Ditter capable from three doesnt get the kind home bounce Virginia such a dominant performance over Dayton Won the game by 13 but had a lead as large as 21 in the second half of that game Dayton went on a 14 nothing run late Yeah Anthony Grants got another good team Picked near the top of the A10 Locandro spinning against Bruno Airmails the shots rush that just a little bit of killing again though that thats what that shot blocking ability will do to you Lewis theyre going to give him the continuation Its an A and one Yeah a little more generous this year A little more liberal interpretation of what was shooting the basketball if you will But I I think this one would have been uh that regardless though Lewis has been a very impressive player tonight on both ends of the floor the last time he played on this court Virginia played Queens Black Friday Lewis had a season high 15 on nine shots Sam sprinkles one down Virginias on top by 15 Four minutes gone by here in the second half Cavaliers facing the Hawks for the fourth time in school history Virginias won the last three including a game back in 2022 Won that by 27 Mallerie with yet another steal causing somebody He didnt have to take the ball Just caused him to go too fast Ditter a little too speedy maybe on that layup But yeah Chance Mallerie I I cant believe hes a freshman No no no Its a confident talented young man Hes got a young face young looking face but he plays like a seasoned vet Cooper penetrates challenges Onenso and Ugana just gobbles one up White releases back rim and off rebound Cooper rebounding Virginia by five Teal on the double clutch Good effort here from Teal to sprint back in transition D Yeah theyve done pretty well getting back Virginia does have 10 fast break points but so does Yeah exactly And theyve both got nine points off of turnovers Turnovers have been about even Rebounds are too close to even from a Virginia perspective Virginia outrebounds teams by about 11 per game 15th in the nation Flipping to Ritter an easy rebound Continuous action here at JPJ Mallerie spins it out to the perimeter Lewis the runner with the right hands and hell go to the line applause UVA wants to improve on the defensive end This is these are two ways that you do that blocking the music shot Gruno and Chance Mallerie has been very good with pressure on the basketball Calls in the turnover by Teal music Terrific ball movement on Saturday against Dayton Yeah this is what Ryan ODM want Ball goes inside back outside quick reversal all the way around back to Ditter Thats what Coach Odm would like music to see And here we got a high low pass to Ditter down low and back to action with Sam Lewis When Virginias got the ball cooking around the perimeter right thats what feels like the recipe for success Thats what makes you feel like okay this is a team that can compete for an ACC championship Yeah And and in their defense actually Maryland Eastern Shore has run them off the threepoint line in this half Theyve gotten all the way to the rim They just havent done a good job of finishing at the basket Yes And look after relinquishing 10 threes on the first 15 tries for UVA had to do something to stop that perimeter attack And again theyve done nicely to thwart it a little bit Mallerie tries to step into the passing lane Mond absorbs the ball and gets it to go Yeah a good decision maker Mond is seven points so far in tonights game Youve seen a lot of different pieces for Coach Hill Just trying to find the ones that are consistent On Yenso with six hands swarming him It did not matter Yeah that was nice patience on Oenos part He was very honest after the game against Hampton early on this season that he wanted a bigger role in the offense Thats why hes here at UVA and he is thriving so far in it Yeah he he hes going to get a lot of time and we saw the two bigs play together even a little bit in the first half Now the two littles creating a steal Mallerie and Jakari White who jams one down Mallerie has a net doesnt he applause Chance has four steals in this game Now 20 in the first 10 games this year Staples gets the switch down low on the smaller whites Yeah that that was a a a mess up in communication on the Cavaliers part They did a nice job of switching but didnt see the basketball Easy basket for the Hawks Had been a lot of those Mallerie creative move applause makes his case to the official and goes back to play it Just let him know how he feels And then Mallerie pushes off here on Mond And now Mallerie the culprit of the whistle Easy baskets after turnovers Mallerie gives it up Its White He was doing it from three in the last game This one a little bit closer Love that angle And yes the Jakari fired up I need a shirt I need one of those You got to follow them on Instagram I think first Are you on IG I am You are Follow a bunch of people Okay Flipping tries to go high low to Oanla down low They do get it to Zion eventually Oanla sweeping through the lane Nice Used that size advantage right there 68 over 64 Don Hall cheering Coach Hill was telling us today they are waiting on it to click for Zion OM They think he can be pretty good White triple drive Oh Yenso cant finish The shot chart for Virginia is going to look pretty good The made shot chart not so much especially in the second half flipping post ISO Onenso twisting off of it and took too many steps So a turnover for Maryland Eastern Shore The Hawks with 10 Virginias got a 17point music lead Letters I know you just purchased a home back Yeah I I take you as someone who uh is going to light up their house Uh my wife does light up she does light up the house And uh and the Cavs with another missed layup just been a little bit off in terms of finishing on the inside They were so lights out from the perimeter early in the game Nice adjustment there from Trey Hall earning some minutes early in the second half That was very nice right there Took the contact Started his career at Evansville Moved on to Utah Tech Second year with Ditter unleashes Grunlo falls down tightropping the baseline It will stay with the hoops Virginia with now nine offensive rebounds in this game Uses with only three Cavaliers entering today top 10 in the nation in offensive rebounding with 15 per game Long shots long rebounds Right M Exactly Uh these have been short rebounds but they havent been able to to get them back Jakari Whites hes back on the board Thats really nice execution on the baseline out of bounds Shot it right in rhythm Jakari missed his first couple of threes in this game snapping a streak of 12 straights Maryland Eastern Shore finally floats across the timeline Oh Banla You can see why coach Bits like him Coach Hill likes him Pretty shifty guy at 68 Had a great talk with coach Cleo Hill Jr today was his father a legend the first HBCU graduate to be drafted in the first round of the NBA Yeah Dad was drafted by the St Louis Hawks in the 61 NBA draft to Ritter applause Couple of threes tonight for Tess Ritter on four tries Virginias made 13 as a team from beyond the ark Made 10 in the first half of the first half Maryland Eastern Shore playing its fourth power four opponent out of six Theyll have games against Virginia Tech coming up on Sunday and then a visit to Texas Monday December 22nd The Cavaliers were just down in Austin and beat up on UT Yeah some good wins for the Cavaliers here And that was a good win in recruiting getting Titter here to Charlottesville from Belgium Yeah huge win We just saw him shoot a three this time Realizes he has the mismatch Plays through the contact Hes so strong and look at that agility Only three points Mac in the first half for Ditter And still Virginia had a nice cushion Hes got seven early on here in the second Yeah And you know he averages 16 over 16 and over six rebounds a game but he defers a lot And they want him to be aggressive right Yes they do I think they want to be I think hes trying to uh fit in if you will Hes fitting in darn nicely He sure is And hes such a good guy Really approachable as he tips this one out of bounds here Oh itll go to the Whos last off of Teal applause and cheering Ditter calls that turnover Couple defensive stops here for Virginia Starting to get that spread out there You know we were interested back He wears the number 28 Its a very unusual number So before the game we went out to him We asked him Why are you wearing 28 Hes like Normally I wore 12 or 11 excuse me growing up but with the Belgium Lions his national cheering team he was given the number 28 and so hes just sticking with that And he hopes to make the NBA I asked him You going to keep that number He said Yeah Im going with 28 the rest of the way I like it Nicknamed the tank Yeah I can imagine Hes got much more agility than a tank though Got a little too handy that time and admits the mistake Coach ones on me Sorry Sorry I know youve been telling us Stop fouling so much They havent fell much here in the second half Neither team has Just five combined fouls here in the first 11 and 12 minutes Jumper goes up Mond cant hit in a corner for Taps Lewis lobs it up and Gruno mashes it down What a cheering weapon What a record if you could just throw it up to him or Ono Either one The catch radius cheering Mallerie Jakari White Mallerie combined again on the steel Dont know who gets credit Oh my goodness Mallerie cheering again I know who gets that credit That would be Valerie But again the point that we made earlier Mac right Like when you make shots you can set your defense Good penetration in transition Center has to come up Grunlo at the rim Beautiful pass by Lewis Isnt that impossible for Loandro Yes But you have to stay at the rim gets some help here from Jakari White Gets the layup to go Okay Virginia sets up the press and then Mallerie right up in the grill here of Justin Mond This play has been reviewed Okay So we appreciate Tommy Moresy for providing us the explanation there So Ryan ODM deciding to challenge here and in the end they dont see anything conclusive to overturn the call Hawks ball Yes sir Virginia making six of its last seven shots Maryland Eastern Shore meanwhile has heated up offensively Five of their last seven But some turnovers here for the Hawks have plagued them Heres Jaden Cooper Seven points seven rebounds two assists tonight Showing his coach something Locandro They empty out the floor here for him Locandro goes to work and he sees Johan Gunlo the ACCs best shot blocker Yeah and we talked about his shot blocking but he was physical on that play Thomas no conversion but theres Grunlow Mallerie the hesy gruno gets hammered low by Mario Hansen Jr go they would be in the college football playoffs Yeah thatll be a tough game for UVA Missou with three of its four losses against teams that are in the CFP but both teams have really good ground attacks Jamari Taylor has had a brilliant year for UVA Yeah really had And Aman Hardy for Missouri has been maybe the best running back in the SEC From the grid iron to the hardwood it has been such an enjoyable time for fans here on grounds over the last couple of months getting to know this fresh face Virginia team Cavaliers bringing in so many newcomers under their first year head coach and Ryan ODM And you can feel the connection between the players and the fans every time you call a game here I think I think the fans cheering are going to enjoy these next couple months 24th in the country coming out yesterday First time ranked since February of 2024 Final year under Tony Bennett Ron Sanchez the interim head coach a year ago And Ryan ODM back in a spot in which he was raised Seven years of his childhood with his father on staff Coach Holland Maryland Eastern Shore playing some zone here We expected them to change up the defense as the game continued tonight Thomas against Teal and Malik is swarmed Good defense there from Jamie Cooper Yeah kind of started the action a little bit late there against the zone and then made a nice play on the ball You know its been a mixed bag for Maryland Eastern Shore when facing these P4 opponents Losses by four in overtime on the road against Georgia Tech Then a 65point loss and then a 19point defeat Down by nearly 30 here but theyve had some flashes Cooper steps into an open jet Yeah Coopers had a very nice night Nine points now season high of 17 in a double overtime win against Longwood Lets see if the Cavaliers can figure this defense out from Thomas tries from the outside It was partially deflected there by Mario Hansen Fantastic womens basketball match up we have in store for you coming up on Sunday afternoon here on the ACC network and also on the allne ESPN app UNC and Louisville a ranked match up at Carmichael Arena in Chapel Hill Coverage begins at 4 Eastern Coach Bangart music Coach Walls getting after it here both had a kind of a mixed bag but both ranked teams and certainly visions of playing in the NCAA tournament more than the opening weekend for both those programs Coach Bangar always has a really good defensive team Turnaround shot goes flipping on the reverse Most of the regulars still out there for the Whos No lookie from Lewis to Tatillis Moving around Hall Find an open shooter Jakari White Tillis on the blockout foul right there Just the fourth foul for Virginia in this half And thats what Ryan Odum wanted to see Fewer fouls but better defense Yes He wants his cake and eat it too doesnt he Yeah I hear you laughter I got to be careful with all the cake coming up with the holiday season Yeah you work out too much Youre in good shape Okay those hotel gyms I appreciate them Cooper bounces down to flipping again challenging onenso and it takes a lot of arc to get it over Ugana and he got it back to back nice plays with the Louisiana native Maryland Eastern Shore in all likelihood will come up on the losing end but I think Coach Hill for the most part will be pleased with his teams effort tonight Did some good things and shot the ball at a decent rate Of course theyve done that all year but they battled on the back board challenged the Cavaliers at the rim here in the second half Here we go Here we go So Virginia goes back to the line Cavaliers 10 for 13 on the game Only committed seven turnovers this evening forcing 14 for Maryland Eastern Shore And here is Ugana Onenso the sevenfooter senior from Nigeria third stop in college Couple of years at Kentucky and then Kansas State These are this weeks ACC Network features Cavaliers will go 11 days in between games before they host the Maryland Terrapens on the 20th of December You show those games the league off to a much better start than a year ago Yes you look at the net rankings Virginia 17 as of this morning fourth in the ACC Better performance in the ACC SEC challenge Fans displeased here on Yenseno a little too physical for the officials liking Take a look at that reach in there and the fans may have something to argue about Oh yo he was up close and personal and he knew he didnt foul cheering So now Flippin makes the first Players will claim they dont foul But yeah but he was correct And you cant challenge fouls of college basketball We can talk about them though We sure can They give us the space to do that Chance Mallerie 48 from the field 48 cheering from three A nuisance on the defensive end Magnificent start to his career Just over four to play Cavaliers 47 from the field UMes actually better 49 but again double the turnovers for the Hawks as compared to the Whos Don Hall up top Tillis that balls moving around quickly on Yenso couldnt devour it instead Teal and of course the big difference 10 less threes for the Hawks The difference of 30 points on the scoreboard in a 22point game Twoman game Teal and flipping Mallerie defends on the outside Flipping scurries down the baseline and sees Onenso Hansen on the followup cheering Very one of the few offensive rebounds for the Hawks tonight You know a little something about Mario Hansen Jr I know something about Mario Hansen Jr Since I coached Mario Hansen senior at Chattanooga his dad was an outstanding player 15 point per game scorer Won a couple championships with Mario Hansen Tillis he gets it to go Does Mario resemble his father at all the way he plays No His dad was a 65 230 kind of guy Okay His dad wishes he was long and lanky like this Okay All right at the Cavaliers 80 points again and anytime they score 80 There are good outcomes Yes contested jumper that time is off the mark from Trey Brown And now Tillis runs the show here in transition Devin to the outside Jakari Whites If this game were in Charlottes would have made that one He was seven for seven against Dayton cheering a few days ago who was also nine for nine from the field Flipin fakes and then its whacked away by Oenso All of us and again we appreciate anything that you can give Just south of two minutes to play here in the second half Virginia on the road to win number nine of the season Jaden Johnson has checked in and commits a shot clock violation for Maryland Eastern Shore Turnover number 15 Yeah Cavs havent really converted a lot of the turnovers but they have forced 15 versus seven of their own So thats thats a nice number that coach Odum can take to the bank Speaking of ODM there is Owen Odum his son checking in Cavaliers send on some of their reserves Carter Lang is also in Desmond Roberts as well Here is Martin Carrer along with Elijah Gertrude So fresh five here for coach OD Little 131 trap First time weve seen that out of the the Hawks And usually these are the guys that simulate the different defenses in practice So lets see how they attack it OWEN ODUM HES GOT IT cheering Points three and four on his career And you can see the reaction from the bench as you would expect 10 different Cavaliers have now scored out of the game Another 80point effort from Virginia Cavaliers now with nine 80point efforts in their first 10 games Different philosophy with that man running the show hoping to steer this team back to the big dance Good pass by Trey Brown Talked about he has point guard skills at 67 Certainly an advantage if you can have a big point guard with great vision And Id imagine a lot of MAK teams dont have that size especially a point And uh there not many teams in any league that have that kind of size at the point Very true Here is Brown Takes a three Offensive rebound and the stick back doesnt go Couple free throws here from Mario Hansen These will be cosmetic at this point but still good effort from heres Elijah Gertrude Suffered a freak scooter accident couple of years ago Missed the entirety of last season Good to see him back in the fold Maryland Eastern Shore has only been to the free throw line six times tonight And its a Hawks team that usually does not get a lot of free throw shots ACC PM Monday through Thursday from 600 to 7 Eastern And Friday a special 2hour football focused edition 5 to 7 Eastern hosted by Kelsey Riggs music Cuff right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Lot of bowl game discussions to talk about Bulls have kind of taken on a different air if you will So with the expanded college football playoffs thats uh some talk show fodder for us later on Yeah Sure itll mean a lot to the Cavaliers football program Double digit wins just the second time program history Gertru on a turnaround and the bench loves that too Grew coming back from his injury like you mentioned cheering and had some success two years ago when pressed into action as a freshman Was expecting to red shirt Came in and did well He had a really good game in a game we called against NC Central at 13 And Maryland Eastern Shore content to just let the time come off the clock Virginia cruising to another win The Cavaliers through 10 games have nine wins 84 60 over as the Cavs now dive into finals week Yeah I think coach
