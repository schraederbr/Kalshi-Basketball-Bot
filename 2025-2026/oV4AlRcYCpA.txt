Jaylen Bedford Absolutely love this kid He can do it off the pick and roll He can do it off the pick and pop He can knock it down from all over the floor This should be a good one this afternoon Shell fight for that opening tip And it comes to the Seinals and Robert McCrae the fifth at the helm once again for the Seinals The senior from Columbia South Carolina one of the better lead guards in the Atlantic Coast Conference cheering From the corner Chanty Wiggins has Florida State on the board first I love that big guy goes inside You play an old school 90s basketball A little inside out action You find the shooter on the perimeter and he knocks in a triple Great start for the NLES There you see the starting five for the Hokes Ben Hammond at the point He has had a marvelous breakout season as a sophomore here in Blackburg He gets the ball back puts up the three Were tied at three Oh baby Students fans everybody in this sold out arena love that action right there Both teams off to a fast start cheering McCrae Jones Bong Wiggins and Steen the starting five for Luke LS the first year head coach at his alma mater who has really adjusted Florida State on the fly And as you alluded to Scott they have won four of their last six And the formula that he came into the season is changed because well I I I think they want to play faster but they also want to take better shots Like theyre 300th in the country in threepoint shooting They were firing up threes He said off the bounce off the dribble oneonone action Now theyre helping one another being a little more selective in their shot selection Thats why theyre playing better Yeah they seem to want as we take another peek at Neo Abdales being followed by McCrae first year head coach with an NBA background He had been an assistant for a number of years after his playing days were done Former guard with Florida State under coach Leonard Hamilton And for a first year coach at the college level to be able to assess on the fly and look himself in the mirror and say you know what we are taking too many poor quality threes Id rather have good quality twos Now its not like theyre not putting the threes up but its just different and it has worked out in recent weeks Yeah when you got Klay Thompson and Steph Curry and youre Golden State assistant under Steve Curry Yeah you want you think shoot a lot of threes right Thats what the analytics tell you But you got to have GUYS THAT CAN SPLASH INTO THE BASKET and get to the hole uh provide some opportunity to score inside as well So on the fly he has made the uh adjustment He took a hard look at what they were doing We saw him play NC State They got beat by 50 in that basketball game So hes made some adjustments Theyre competitive every night Even their two losses theyve only been on one possession games Bedford denied at the rim And by the way on the last trip down this way Toby Lwal had his head above the rim to get the rebound For the first time today were going to keep track of how many times he is looking down at the cylinder That is Toby Lwal whos as good a leaper as there is in college basketball Number one for Virginia Tech Yeah can I just add that hes got the highest ever recorded vertical leap at the NBA combine at 49 and a half inches and he tried to thunder one down there and a good thing they fouled him cuz somebody would have ended up on a poster Well Mike Young the seventh year head coach at Virginia Tech says of Toby Lwal hes the best athlete I have ever coached And coach Young has been around a long time 62yearold native of nearby Radford Virginia about 20 minutes southwest of campus and grew up a big Hokes fan and just living a dream leading his hometown school Yeah All I got all that guy does is win They have not lost to Florida State here in the last six years to try to keep that streak going Well one thing that Virginia Tech did very well at Clemson to knock off the number 20 team in the country Wednesday second half especially they defended Clemson Well yeah Gave Clemson a taste of their own medicine right Normally thats what Clemson does is put the clamps on teams defensively but uh it was the Hokes that were the tougher team defensively and tougher down the stretch I might say uh mentally as well to hold on to that victory on the road Yeah Bedford scored 23 Hammond had 19 Four steals as part of that defense and they shot it really well 11 of 21 from deep Le Jones off the pronounced up fake able to get himself free along the baseline Thats my guy right there Hell boy I tell you what I like that Hes just constant motion He does all the dirty work Hell set the picks Hell roll hard Hell chew glass And like he got like a nice little midrange game People forget hes lefthanded He likes dribbling that thing hard to that left baseline Well his coach told us after shootound today that he needs Le Jones and Chanty Wiggins to bring it every single night And if they do Florida State can play with anybody in the ACC Jaylen Bedford off the window for two Wow Jaylen Bedford showing the bunnies going high over the top of that hope that Nullles defense there delivering that little righthanding running hook off glass That was impressive Well he made four out of five from beyond the threepoint line at Clemson Wednesday but he shows you hes not just a perimeter jump shooter Wiggins has it poked away And here comes Neo Abdales Takes the contact missed the shot but there to clean it up Ammani Hensbury who our own Seth Greenberg says he is the X factor for Virginia Tech Yeah he he does a fantastic job Hes kind of that straw that stirs the drink for this Hokes attack Again another one of these guys that does all the dirty work Chews the glass runs the floor plays the deep Another corner three This time its Martin Somerville the sophomore transfer from UMass LOL whos putting together a really nice season for FSU Yeah hes fantastic This guy comes off the bench Hes their threepoint specialist Again another lefty on that Nulls lineup Pulls a lot of guys He will drive it to the hole Has a little midrange game as well Ben Hammond as Wiggins didnt close out fast enough Now has six points on a couple of threes Well you know its a balmy 55° outside so I think these guys were ready to go as we see come down and he knocked in a triple How many triples have they already canned here in the first 4 and 12 minutes of this game Ive got five on my chart right now It is a total of five You see three for four for FSU two for two for the home team Abdollis inside Hanssbury over the left shoulder and he lets everybody know that the defender is just too small to hang with that AJ Swinton tried to keep with him Lal may have gotten a piece of that one Here comes Virginia Tech Up Dallas with numbers Finds the trailer in Bradford Lal turned down the three He made a couple of threes in the win on Wednesday over Clemson but didnt put it up there Now hell try from out front and bury it How about Toby Lewis Only seven for 33 on the year but hes made his last three Well go Jung loves this start right Hes got his team playing good defense Theyre getting out in transition Theyre moving the balls not sticking in anybodys hands and theyre knocking down triples left and right cheering McCrae uses his off hand to find the open man in the corner Swinton Another rebound for Lwal Tech off to a terrific start shooting the ball Six of eight from the floor Now six of nine off the miss by Jaylen Bedford the graduate transfer from UNLV Good screen by Swinton Another good look This time though Somerville a little too strong And weve got ourselves our first media timeout here at Castle Coliseum Well it is raining threes here in Castle Coliseum And whether its on the right side of the floor or the left side of the floor both of these teams get behind that arc getting on balance the passes are on target and the shots are true Known as Seth and Stephs father but uh he was drafted twice to Major League Baseball once out of high school and then he came here to Tech with the intention of playing both sports Finally did pitch his junior year got drafted again but I think he made the right choice going to the NBA Back after this screaming After the timeout called by Mike Young were back at it with Virginia Tech and Isaiah Posasha on the floor here early in the ball game The Delaware transfer who originally signed with Rick Patino at Iona and then Martin Inglesby at Delaware Big quick two points Yeah Nolles came out of that time out tried to give him a different look with that zone defense but a big driving lane right down the heart Kobe McGee into the game left his first shot short Aay Jones leaves his feet finds an open man for the three ball Its McGee again Tapped back by Abdullah Yeah Tech cant get their own defensive glass cleared Going to give the Nles a third opportunity to score Well trying to snap a 70 Hokes run This is the largest lead of the ball game and theyre able to get it inside to Alex Steam the 69 transfer from division 2 powerhouse Florida Southern College They steam this morning at 800 in the morning This kid was ready to play He was a bundle of energy when some of his teams were teammates were still trying to wake up that early shoot around time Well he wasnt above the rim but Toby Lau gives you a taste of just how good he jumps What do you want THE KIDS HERE WAS UP BY the top of the rim when he was throwing that thing down He could have dunked him with his elbows Youre a tough man to please there Sherman Well hes got six points early here layup missed and the rebound grabbed by Christian Gerak the freshman big out of Gonzaga High School in Washington DC Virginia Tech but tell you this team has already knocked down three triples in this basketball game Yet at the same time they got eight points in the paint So doing a really nice job mixing up the inside attack and the outside attack Martin Somerville how about that The lefty from Buoie Maryland now with five points I told you this kid wasnt It was more than just a threepoint shooter and hes that specialist that generally comes off that bench but hes also has ability to slash to the basket A careless turnover by the Hokes Toby Lau and the Hokes with a sixpoint lead as we head back to break Well I love this one right here Anytime these guys can go inside force that defense to the ball you leave a high jumper like Low to get up and throw it down there as well And you said that during your fairly brief time together in Milwaukee that the boys would come and hang around dad a little bit Yeah Every now and again mama would bring them up and they would you know be on the court before the game trying to grab balls and get up some shots And we back when we played with our back to the basket sometimes Id be working on drop steps and next thing I know I got a little Steph hanging out underneath my big side my Nike size 17 So it was fun to have them uh around and great to have seen them blossom into uh you know well Steph being a Hall of Famer and his brother aint no slouch himself Played more than a decade in the NBA And Dell was a great teammate I would add that as well Just a great person to be around Kind of taught me a lot about what it was like to be a professional in the NBA Heres Ben Hammond with a rebound He just committed Virginia Techs first foul called this afternoon The reason we got down that rabbit hole with Dell Curry as a former two sport athlete here at Virginia Tech is that both of these basketball teams have football players wide receivers freshman both on their benches So there could be a growing number of players as multisports standouts at both Florida State and Virginia Tech The Hokes receiver Snook Petin actually did play in games and scored a touchdown against Virginia this past fall While Jason Lopez has joined Florida State in January and is still with the Seminals basketball team we got ourselves a fourpoint ball game Florida State hanging around in spite of the hot start by Virginia Tech Yeah well you got Steen inside protecting the paint You trying to stop some of that uh 10point explosion that Hookies have enjoyed points in the paint Hes grabbing bows although he gives up offensive rebound underneath Oh no And a put back lays it in off the shoot miss Yeah Kerak he whipped him on that one An offensive rebound specialist himself got on and chewed that offensive glass Midpoint of the first half here at Castle Coliseum in Blackburg Virginia Terrific point guard matchup Hammond trying to hang with McCrae despite giving up a couple of inches Swinton from the corner Well then again you see why this guy McCrae is so important to that Nulls attack His cord vision is tremendous Closing in now on 150 assists on the season Hes third in the ACC at over six assists per game behind a couple of really good ones And Cuadia Copeland of NC State and Boopy Miller at SMU Point blank look Gerak couldnt get the ball to go through the cylinder Well I thought Gard took a lot of contact on that shot at Tim but these officials I tell you what the ACC this last month have really started letting these guys play And its a its a joy to watch big strong young men play like big strong young men as Ben Hammond comes down the other calls his own number knocks down that triple Coach Locks called him a poor mans hoopy Miller And you can see why because he meant it as a compliment This young man can fill up the scoring statute All nine of his points this afternoon have come from distance You see a perfect three for three McCrae gets loose inside Going to try again over the big boys Able to finish Well thats where McCraes got to use his advantage Hes not only got a height advantage on Hammond hes got a poundage advantage on Hammond as well Hes got to put him down in that torture chamber down in that pain of air and make Hammond pay down low cuz out of this perimeter on the offensive end you sure that Hammonds going to try to do the same Hansbury out to Pasha back inside Hansbury high low pass comes back to him on the deflection with three on the shot clock Hanssbury trying to gather and get it up able to beat the buzzer but he missed the iron so its a shot clock violation Can I just point out that that was fantastic defense by Florida State as were going to break Five guys strapping for that basketball They were 10 of 15 to music get things going but have missed their last three but weve been going up and down Its been an entertaining start to the afternoon Scott Yeah I think I might have jinxed them I was talking about how great these teams were shooting but it was really the defense on both sides now starting to wake up you know these two oclock tips Sometimes it takes the players defensively a little longer to get going sometimes than it does offensively Again Florida State has won four of its last six now 11 and 13 overall They have played better this month Started in late January with a win at Coral Gables over Miami Wiggins able to get to the rim with the shot clock down to two Hey that was mans work right there You could put a men working sign over there on that right side Wiggins just powered Lal right into the basket where Toby was looking up through the rim when Wiggins went up for that shot I love that action That was just strength Im guessing Shanty learned a thing or two about playing the post from his mom Lwanda Dawson Wiggins a 511 center back in the day at Missouri State where shes an athletics hall of famer Also spent time as an assistant coach at Duke Dads a pretty good baller himself Hammond goes inside Hes got 11 The first to get to double figures for Virginia Tech How about the little big man I talked about He cant go inside He said Ill show you Williams right inside amongst the trees And then this guy Jones hes my guy on the Simols that I love the most You got McCrae some of Wiggins and those guys but uh Le Jones is the hardest working no on the floor every time hes out there Hammond lobs it up Lal comes down with it draws the contact and he will shoot two Every time I start talking good about somebody something bad happens to him as Jones picks up that foul But look at this one more by Hammonds from the left side of the floor He uses the rim as protection Gets to the right side and then Jones the other way the lefty going to the right hand because they were taking away his strong left hand dribble drive So he showed him he could still put the ball on the floor with the right and get to the rack That foul was on Le Jones Hes the first in our game this afternoon to get to two personal fouls Well here is next weeks womens basketball double header Number 21 North Carolina takes on Virginia Tech right here at Castle music Coliseum 6 Eastern And the Miami Hurricanes host Stanford and Coral Gables on ACC Network and the ESPN app Lwal now with eight as he makes a pair of free throws And again he did not start playing basketball until he was a little bit older growing up in London And his skill level continues to grow NBA scouts know who he is based on his athletic ability But if he had played enough games this year Scott Lwal would be fifth in the ACC in rebounding at nine per game and fifth in block shots one and a half He has a tremendous upside That is tantalizing for pro scouts Yeah there goes Jones again That time he uses that left hand with a devastating spin move down there in that paint Left the defenders flatfooted So Leg Jones now cuts that deficit down to a a single possession But youre youre right about everything about this kid is on the rise Even his free throw shooting hes up to almost 75 now from the line And now hes knocking down his threes The Nolles have made their last four There is Toby Lwa The numbers on the year Missed a couple of ACC games missed some time in the nonconference but he continues to get better Yeah And last time we were here he had a great game against Georgia Tech and we had a chance to sit in the interview with him and I like his basketball IQ He speaks real well understands the game real well and like you say for a guy that hadnt been playing a whole lot the skys is the limit for this young man Hanssbury makes the first And I tell you what Toby Lals bounce reminds me of Michigan States springloaded Cohen Carr And especially since coming back 100 from that foot injury that had Lwal sideline missing nine games between November December and January while fully seems like he is back and has a big impact for this Virginia Tech team that is right on the cutline for the NCAA tournament At the start of the day Joey Brackets had him as team number 69 the first team out of his projected field Yeah thats a tough foul right there for the NLES as McCrae picked up his second personal foul with six minutes to go in this half So theyre going to have to try to hold on here and uh keep that deficit down to a single possession and they certainly will be able to do the Bongs knocking in triples We got a onepoint game here Parts Tomas Bong the freshman from Paris makes it 3231 The nullles hanging with the Hokes Hey Im telling you these nullles some they found something here in these last two three weeks since we had them down in Miami Even their two losses were by just one single possession Jaylen Bedford coming off his 23point performance in the upset of Clemson on the pullup Now has four Its back to a threepoint lead for Tack I love guys that still shoot the midrange game You know it reminds me of Devin Booker You know you can you can get that little rhythm dribble into your spot You work on that shot so many times you can hit it for about 65 But I love this one here Jones with the draw and kick to Pong for the triple And then this one by Bedford Thats just a a a play that he works on time and time again We used to do that with a folding chair stick it out there in the dribble from the sideline around the chair using that as a screen and knocking that down So hes shot that probably four or 5000 times So now both our point guards have two fouls but the difference for Tech is that Ben Hammond stays on the floor on defense while McCrae is on the bench Hammond gets the rebound and will dribble up Under five minutes to go Look how Ham how quickly Hamming gets the ball from one end of the floor into the attack area Puts a lot of pressure on that Simols defense Dallas has had a quiet game so far A skip pass finds Hansbury Van pulls it down and here comes Florida State down by three with the basketball And I like Hanssberrys ability to knock down a triple but I dont know if Coach Young wanted it right there Come back the other way Was that Bong It is Bassong who ties the ball game at 34 apiece His second made three Young man out of overtime elite in Atlanta Wow Ill tell you what I told you these NOS were going to be ready to play We saw it at 800 this morning They have something brewing down there in Florida Off the flare screen Bedford drops the three A beautiful setup Give the assist to Ben Hammond Yeah but thats why you shoot that midrange jumper the time or two before because it gives you a great visual of seeing that ball going through that basket You work on your stroke and your balance Your next outside shot is more likely be the two true than not The flare screen is by far my favorite screen in basketball Yeah you were working on your shot after shoot around today too werent you Part need more work You know these rims need more work All right were going to break Take a look again at the player screen that allows Ben Hammond to find Jaylen Bedford I love this when guys will help one another score You get that triple on one end and you come right back the other way and you get that back screen by the big Watch his teeth clack and you knock down the triple Thank you Taylor With Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman back at Castle Coliseum Ben Hammonds who you see there the point guard for Virginia Tech Certainly getting recognition for how much he has improved this year Hes got 11 points music to lead all scores so far today And if it werent for the guy at Wake Forest Junior I would say that Ben Hammond would have a real shot to be named the most improved player in the ACC this year Yeah I dont know if hell get most improved but he is much improved If there could be two awards he would get the second one for sure Theres no doubt about that The kids playing with a ton of confidence which Coach Young likes as well And he takes care of the basketball 10th in the league in assist to turnover ratio Everything youd want in a point guard if youre Mike Young AD Dallas back out to Bedford Five to shoot Under three minutes remaining And thats an air ball Yeah I talked so much about his midrange game that he stopped on a dime He lost a defender but youre right He never really got his body moving back towards the basket fading away Thus that shot came up short Can I just ask answer Taylors question Tarhill Nation is crying without Caleb Wilson Off the takeaway Twoon one in the lob handled by Hanssbury but the pass from Bedford was a little bit behind him and so unable to finish A missed opportunity for Virginia Tech Yeah Jaylen Bedford probably had the mustard come off the hot dog right there He went for the spectacular play rather than the the basic true just let we have a twoon one Lets make sure we get a high percentage snorts shot Tried to go for the high handoff That wasnt Toby Lal following that one You know theres a difference between he and Hanssbury and how high they can jump and he could not finish that one And in a close ball game Coach Young hes old school He doesnt like to see that early on McCrae back on the floor playing with those two fouls Now has seven points Oh theyre rolling the dice bringing McCrae back in here with a little over two and a half to play But obviously they know what theyre doing cuz he rewarded him with a bucket uh on the offensive end But hes got to stay out of foul trouble here If he gets just slightly beat hes going to have to let the offensive player go cheering Hanssbury works into the lane Little too strong off the glass Jones the rebound for Florida State The Seinals with a chance to take their first lead since it was three to nothing Yeah Jones is doing a nice job on that defensive glass He has got on the offensive glass as much as hes used to here in this first half but they go Florida State It could have been a charge Instead its a block And so McCrae will stay with two fouls Its a blocking foul that allows for McCrae to go to the free throw line Yeah Well I dont know I think that was just the fourth team foul wasnt it Youre right Nonshooting foul So theyll take it out of the baseline I stand corrected Yeah fourth team foul And this is what we saw I was wondering they you we were at shootound this morning They worked on these Bob plays for about 5 minutes They did the sideline out of bounds as well I wonder if they can get a high percentage shot coming out of this uh look here on the baseline Wiggins trying to use that height to his advantage Kicks it back out Swinton after the hard close out by Abdales No call And here come the Hokes again This time Lal was filling the lane but it winds up in the hands of Neo Abdales His first made field goal of the day Yeah Hasnt taken many shots I wondered when this kid was going to come join the party And that was a nice little setup by Bedford He kind of shoveled it right over to Madalis and he he canned it in Another rebound here by Hanssberry Tech is six of 10 from threepoint range Florida State six of 15 Bedford No Lwal grabs it with the right hand but then I think Jones might have gotten a piece of it on second effort Yeah Jones is a tough customer down there now Just one minute to play here in the first half And then Nolles are going to take a timeout Timeout called by Luke LS and well step away as well in this final minute of the first half This first half action has been absolutely fantastic I love that one by Bedford No hesitation and a cans the triple Welcome to the party pal You want me to explode Yes Thats what Ive been waiting for Okay Ill try It has been a challenging first season here in Blackburg for Neo Abdales the 20yearold from Athens Greece Turned pro as a 16yearold played for Greek Power Panathan And he got here as a projected first round pick His goal stated is to be a lottery pick but his play has not been what he has hoped And so now the latest projection has him as a possible second round pick Theres Toby Lewis up to the rim to throw it down cheering Thatll drive that Florida State coaching staff bad You come with a timeout to draw up a play and your team turns it over Live ball turnover that leads to a jam the other way But Tim Wiggins he steps back and knocks down a triple Is that his second of the day It is his second Hes now got 10 points So its back to a threepoint score on this final possession of the half in the hands of Abdales cheering 6 seconds five Posasha trying to create picks up the dribble and gets denied by Swinton who gives a heave but a highly and Florida States not been able to turn Virginia Tech over Theyre one of the best in the ACC at over eight steals per game But I tell you what Tech has not turned it over at all Just three turnovers compared to uh two for the other side Virginia Tech with the basketball to begin this second half Pass intended As I say no turnovers There is a turnover on the pass from Hansbury to LW Yeah Florida State no steals so far in this one What they have done is shot extremely well better than we have seen most of the season Scott And theres one of the guys whos been leading the way Yeah Im afraid of those two fouls cant afford to pick up a third one early here in this second half Only eight combined fouls in that first half Florida State has yet to go to the line although right on Q We may have that if its a shooting foul It was indeed McCrae just put his shoulder down right into the chest of the defender They play so hard on his left hand right Everyone says they get up on that that left shoulder take away his left dribble drive away and both he and Jones have been able to go to the right and then gain an advantage And at a lot of time right there McCrae just so crafty at drawing that foul and getting to the free throw line but he could not knock it down All right the drama in the building now is if McCrae misses his second free throw those wild cheering people will get free bacon Ah meat candy cheering No bacon for you At least not yet They get the whole second half to try to get that But I love that promo because you know obviously now games come down to the second half and a lot of times it comes down to free throw shooting So what a good promo to get the fans loud making some noise to try to uh distract that shooter at the free throw line Now McCrae gets one out of two He is now eight shy of 1500 career points in a career thats taken him from Wake Forest to Jacksonville University He closes out on Bedford who misses off the front iron Saved inbounds by Hanssbury but Florida State now has numbers Fleger Jones crosses over Abdales and able to finish Wow what a drive by Jones Coast to coast and finished over the big shot blocker Low as well Well you know over the last eight games he has really upped his performance Jones now with eight points averaging nearly 13 during that stretch Bedford took the contact The whistle does come and so number zero Jaylen Bedford the grad transfer from Austin Texas will shoot two Gastine cant believe it He thought he was in pretty good position The whistle came on the latest later side of the action Uh but I think it was the correct call You can see Steen in that restricted area He tries to stay high but when youre a foot down there in that restricted area and youre back and and I agree 100 right Like yeah he Hey I I know I got to get the shot blocker up off me And Bedfords got bunnies Not like he cant this kid cant get up off the ground but he knows that hes given up a huge height difference uh to Steen So yeah I got to clear him out just a little bit But unfortunately you like I say he catches them on the mouth uh or the chin area But thats just part of basketball And at the end of 35 games or 40 games whatever they end up playing you got to hope that you dished out as many as you have received Two free throws for Bedford who now has nine points today Virginia Techs lead is back to two Im interested to see right here what the Sims do after that extended timeout So who they going to go to now to try to answer the other end Le Jones thats who of Dallas called for the foul And so Jones will shoot a pair I know were not supposed to sit over here and have favorite players but Im watching this kid Jones now the last two or three games preparing for this one I just love the energy of this kid I asked uh coach about Jones specifically singled him out and he he said he loves what he does He does the dirty work He plays hard He gets on the glass He can stroke it from the outside Uh he can run the floor well So he also realizes how important Jones is And I didnt even mention the rebounding aspect that he provides That foul was on Lwal his first cheering Jones joins Wiggins in double figures Hes got 10 This is our fifth tie of the day Ben Hammond the sophomore from Fairfax Virginia listed at 511 gets the offense going for Virginia Tech Neo AD Dallasi Hensbury Good defense here by the Nolles Jones assigned Dallas off the up fake going to take the three and bury it Well that offensive play had four guys on the right side of the floor Thing was going nowhere and uh but just bailed him out as Jones was not able to get that shot to go underneath Hammond with a great look Hsbury blocked but fouled It looked up top like perhaps Tomas Bon got it cleanly but he picks up his first personal I love the look to find Hansbury in transition Look at this one more time And you got Jones on him and Jones just bites on that first one trying to recover Over recovers Crafty uh move here by the young freshman to beat the shot clock and knock down the triple Thats his second triple of the day Well again Abdales has played professional basketball the last four years for a powerhouse in Greek called Panathan Nakis And other players who have been with that team are Dominique Wilkins Jimmer Fet Byron Scott Dino Raja I mean that is a professional basketball player we are watching in that last move under control calm patient get the defense off you thats a pro move Dino Raja make me break out into a cold sweat when you mention his name boy he used to just give me fits when he was on the Celtics as a young NBA player I could do nothing with that cat cheering of course Dominique they got Dominique when he was kind of on the back side over there but uh yeah thats one heck of a program is that in Athens I think thats Thats that squad might be in Athens as uh I was over there this summer Remember they had two teams in Athens Wiggins dumps it off Jones with the dunk along the baseline Its 4946 A dozen points now for Leger And a great pass by Wiggins who hes had it stuck on automatic himself Hes been fantastic in this first half but he passed that one off to his partner You can just see these adults they got something cooking and then playing together enjoying playing together I know theyre 11 and 13 but you would have never known it by the spirit this morning at 800 in the morning Hanssbury little bit of a wild shot able to get it back but his pass deflected and taken away by Florida State Quickly up ahead Robert McCrae the fifth and at Dallas whistled for the foul to the chagrin of the folks here in Blackburg Yeah but thats big Rob right Youre talking about a senior crafty player Hes playing a two different programs He caught that ball didnt rush You think hes going to go up with the right hand here but you got to remember hes a left so now he brings it back kind of behind the defender and gets that body contact in that painted area Crafty move going to the line to try to shoot too Remember he missed the front end last time he was at the line You better believe the fans are going to make some noise trying to get that weak candy cheering here here in the second half Well McCrae makes the first Coming up later at 6 Eastern the Nothing But Net Crew will break down the day in the ACC music with highlights and analysis of every mens game right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app McCrae cheering he is the leading scoreer and assist man for Florida State this season Able to get the roll Doug are you a bacon guy Ill take it or leave it I dont mind it If its in a sandwich Im okay with it Uh if its on the breakfast plate Im okay with it but Im never seeking it out I dont care if they say Hey its an extra four bucks for bacon Im like Throw throw it on there We used to go We used to go in Idaho there was a spot called bacon and theyd have about five different ways that they would do bacon It certainly appeared from our vantage point that Martin Somerville should have been called for a foul Well he had a lot of contact going for the steal And there it comes The whistle was laid up Dallas took it And so Somerville youll watch number music one come in and he absolutely fouled him Yeah thats a Sorry Doug I didnt mean to cut you off but thats that whole deal where as soon as the ball comes over half court theyre going trap once Theyre going to try to force that turnover or force you to shoot the ball quicker And that time Somerville a little too aggressive ran right into a Dallas And that was kind of a nasty uh way to get hit there from the side Yeah they call that a blitz these days Hanssbury along the baseline Kick it out Abdales Hes got a good looking stroke Just not shooting at the percentage you would think he would in this his first year of college basketball Yeah but hes got a couple down and that one looked right on line We had a pretty good angle from where we are here to follow that path to the basket And I think the kid just needs more confidence shooting it from behind the line cheering Wiggins lot of dribbling able to connect and he gives the Seminals their first lead since it was three to nothing Yeah youre going to have to put some more air in the ball as much as Wiggins was dribbling but nobody came to help Hansbury down there and he was finally able to get his spot on the floor and like you said we got our first lead change in a long time Hammond gives back to Hanssbury Bedford going to work on Wiggins Hanssbury draws that second defender Tries to protect the ball and the whistle comes Its a held ball and the possession arrow means thats a turnover The fifth of the game as we head to break as an upper classman he and Leonard Hamilton music as they were building the Florida State program to what it became under Coach Ham And so now the program is in the able hands of Luke LS who comes back after several years working in the NBA his team with its first lead since three nothing and the basketball their point guard one of the best in the ACC Robert McCrae the fifth a little bit short and here comes Ben Hammond again Hammond off the glass quickly to the other end we 24 seconds left on the shot clock and they already got the ball in the scoring area tech no made buckets in over three minutes that stretch will continue off the Hammond turnover heres Somerville who does not turn the ball over for Florida State cheering And thats going to be a blocking foul Call goes for Florida State cheering These NLES have got something going And now an opportunity to take a twopossession lead with a free throw here But I love this you know after the live ball turnover trying to step in there and take that charge looked like pretty good position but just able to knife to the outside shoulder there of that defender Picks up his third personal foul And so Tomas Bon will look to add to the eight nothing Florida State run He has started the last nine games for coach LS and that has coincided with this improved play for Florida State You know it also improved when they took 15yearold Trace Thompson and his mom on his first road trip from Tallahassee down to Coral Gables And uh we highlighted Trace that day He was diagnosed with leukemia Loves to play ball Hes not here on the trip with his beloved seinals today cuz hes deep into his basketball season But I cant help but think there was a little good karma on that plane ride down to South Florida that has helped the Seinals over the last couple of weeks Theres Somerville knocking down a jumper Im telling you right now I asked Coach Ls about the chemistry Is your chemistry starting to take hold He said Its not my chemistry its our chemistry Theyre just playing gritty and uh gutty and grimy basketball And there they find themselves now with a fivepoint lead on the roll trying to take it to Virginia Tech who this is you know I dont know I say its a must win but they got to have this victory here They want to keep their hopes alive of getting inside of Joey Bracketts uh first four in or last four in I guess Kobe McGee forces the turnover Heres Martin Somerville whos gone two and a half games without turning it over for Florida State cheering And even though hes a sophomore on a team of veterans hes one of the lead voices and he strokes the three Its now a 13 to nothing Florida State run KY know your personnel Thats what Somerville wants to do The little lefty wants to step out behind the arc and shoot that rock And he is one of the better at it in the ACC Shooting about 75 excuse me 35 from behind the ark Lal goes to the right hand and snaps the 130 run Yeah And thats what you got to do when youre getting taken to the woodshed You got to find somebody thats going to put on their hard hat bring their lunch pel and bang out some points inside Lets see if they can get a stop Yeah just the second made bucket of the half for Virginia Tech Back to within six Ah Jones throwing it down My that was on Toby Lew A hard drive on the baseline by Le Jones and he left no doubt Well you got to make half a 209 start to take the lead And I like the way theyre letting everybody kind of get involved in this thing A couple pluckets music by Somerville And I love that one there the outside shot And then Leger Jones hard to the rack and finishing off with some power around the basket I tell you what everybody in this sold out arena is stunned Reaching foul that goes against Martin Somerville Thats a second one on Somerville or you I know theyre not in a penalty situation but no sense in going out there and just giving them a fourth taking your fourth team foul now and theyre having trouble scoring You dont want to start putting them on that line free throw line too early in this second half Hammond with the basketball out there with Gerak Hanssbury and shoot cheering Hansbury dribbled it off his leg and he falls out of bounds with the basketball Its another turnover and you see the frustration on number 13 as the Hokes are down by eight on their home floor Life premieres Monday night and youll get unprecedented access into the lives of the student athletes coaches staff parents and fans 7 Eastern right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app At halftime I made a big deal about the fact that the Hokes had only two turnovers in the first Well theyve already coughed it up five times in the second half and Luke L seinals have been a big part of that again today Yeah theyre putting a pressure on them We kind of saw something happen in there towards the end of the first half and theyve continued it right here in the second half And look at this Another hard drive into the basket Their game plan here in the second half is try to attack uh inside against the Hokes and see if they can get themselves easy opportunities or to get to that free throw line Somerville mixing up the inside attack and the outside attack just beautifully Well over the last eight games before this one Martin Somerville had put up 23 assists and turned it over only four times And now over the last two and a half games it is 140 assists assist turnover cheering No bacon again one for two for Somerville at the line Quiets the crowd for the moment but the lead is nine for the NLES And look at the NLES again A little backcourt pressure See if they want to trap here after this first pass over half court Bedford little floater Good looking shot 6053 Yeah And thats a tough one right there Right You you try to get that little backcourt pressure but you left yourself vulnerable in the offensive end And Jaylen Bedford you mentioned the heater he had against Virginia where he had 23 points He made him pay Somerville buries the three A huge shot for Florida State to make it a 10point ball game I want to know what this kid had for his pregame meal He has come out here smoking now with the 14 points Hes mixed up the inside attack Hes mixed up the midrange game And that time thats his second triple of the game isnt it As a team Scott Florida State is nine of 18 shooting the three Yeah Somerville he he he couldnt score against Virginia Hes making up for lost time as Hansbury goes inside and he draws some contact Florida State Well this dude right here Somerville is just giving the Hokes fits They dont know whether to play back off of him for the drive or or get up on him for the threepoint shot But if you get stuck at mid uh midpoint there Somervilles going to make you pay with the outside bucket Yeah along with Wiggins Jones and McCrae Somerville the four of them are all in double figures for a Seminals offense that has been humming The best they have shot from three in a game this year 47 They are at 50 so far in this one Yeah And theyre like 316th in laughter the country Uh and just over 31 on the season So Im telling you throw all those numbers uh that you had on the Hokes throw them out the window This is a completely different squad these last three weeks Antsbury with a couple of big free throws Hes in double figures now And by the way fresh off the presses Joe Lonardi has sent out another missive after the noon games And Virginia Tech has actually slipped the spot They are the second team out Oh no For whatever that means now in the middle of February But this is such an important game if Virginia Tech wants to keep itself a on the bubble and b try to get to the right side of the bubble and try not to counteract that big win they had last time out against Clemson with a loss here at home to Florida State You think they look past the Hokes No Looked at that record say Hey theyre 11 and seven 11 and 13 Just came off a big win and they looked past him I dont think so You would think a coach Youngs uh team would would not be focused but were not seeing the focus that we generally see out of this uh Virginia Tech team here on their own home court at you know Castle Arena Gird with the foul his first Still plenty of time on the clock 10 minutes to go in regulation see in the second half Jones and Somerville have been as a pair outdoing the Hokes as a team Bedford tries to change that strong finish Hes got 13 points Yeah hes got the last couple field goals cuz hes been able to get into that painted area once with the floater uh off of the press break and that time kind of off that free throw just fast to the other end Jaylen Bedford doing all he can trying to keep these hookies close cheering Tech trying to get it done at the defensive end Bedford with the close out Somerville even better Martin Summerrville is the man right now for the Seminals and they are riding the hot hand I love when a team realizes hey we got a guy stuck on automatic Lets just keep feeding them the rock Hes got a game high 16 points Bedford uses the Gerak screen Tough shot Florida State with another stop The offense for Virginia Tech has stalled here in the second half And it wasnt just a shot right with Truffleman to a tough shot but then McGee with the tough board along the baseline as well Somerville for three He knows where the camera is Yeah And he let everybody along the sideline I dont know if he was talking to us or some people behind us in the first couple row but he says Im that guy As hes knocked in shot after shot this afternoon Bad pass too tall Lal turns it over with 817 remaining And time continues to dwindle down This is the largest lead of the ball game as Florida State is looking to pull the upset here in Blackburg Its been really fun to watch I mean you get me out of bed at 700 in the morning to come over for for a shoot around and to see these guys and the energy in which they had that early in the morning and didnt have it translate here this mid afternoon as Ben Hammond gets a little deflection But they are down 11 Virginia Tech has come unglued here and is up against the ropes with just over eight to play Hanssbury back in Gerak goes out hits a uh low five from his head coach Mike Young And if Virginia Tech is going to stem the tide theyre going to have to do it at this end of the floor Their defense has picked up the last couple of defensive possessions but they have been outscored here in the second half by Florida State 2915 Yeah they had Virginia on the ropes as well Um and they let their foot off the gas They stopped playing snow We talked to coach Louds They didnt score the last 6 minutes and 30 seconds He doesnt want that to happen again as Summerville again banks it in 7057 Yeah the crowd wanted travel ball They thought Somerville slid his pivot footed Hammonds gets erased by Jones at the bucket Abdales lw kicks it out Hammond Extra pass Bedford looking for three himself off the back iron and up over the top of the backboard And that will take us to our under eight media timeout But the Hokes are letting one slip away here Well its a balmy 55° out there Feels like a summer day here in Virginia And Martin Somerville has been the man knocking in shots all over Castle Arena Scott in the second half Somerville alone is outscoring Virginia Tech 16 to 15 They kind of stuck it automatic right He was two for his last 19 field goal attempts coming into this game And I love the fact Florida State has recognized that theres no ego involved with his teammates They keep getting him the basketball and he is delivering eight of 10 from the field here in the game Well his careerhigh was 26 points a couple of years ago or last January as a matter of fact for UMass LOL 21 now Big answer coming out of the timeout for Chanty Wiggins and Florida State Wiggins Somerville this Leay Jones theyre all just sharing the basketball Its not sticking in any one persons hand They come back with a little zone defense as Hammond cracks up the triple Well we havent heard from Hammond since the opening minutes He had three early threes Thats his first of the second half Virginia Tech back within 13 Yeah you can see Virginia Tech realizes hey were getting down to crunch time here We got to start speeding this game up Try to get some more possessions maybe try to get Florida State to get some of those live ball turnovers Theyre picking up their pressure cheering McCrae gets it back from Somerville Five to shoot The natural lefty gets back to his strong hand and the fouls called with 29 on the shot clock Ah Coach Young cant believe it Both of his hands laced behind his head there They played such great defense for 27 seconds and then McCrae I talked about how crafty this senior is up against the shot clock He takes it to the rack and and draws that contact Chance to go back to that free throw line Maybe a chance for Florida State to catch their breath a little bit too because Virginia Tech is slapping that pressure on him Second foul on Jaylen Bedford as Robert Milton McCrae V shooting one and one And you know hes got a brother named Milton Robert McCrae How about that Robert Milton and his brother Milton Robert I dont like it laughter It confuses me over here One out of two for McCrae I do like his game though And I will I will say that this young man knows how to lead a squad And we saw him down in Miami make the gamewinning free throws down in Miami when the game was tied And he is delivering here Hes got his team running real hot and fast And here they go again Well Florida State playing with two point guards together and it has worked beautifully as Bon lays it in But you tell me McCrae uh Robert McCrae and Martin Somerville couple of lead guards working in tandem Somerville off the bench and it is been beautiful to watch here in the second half Yeah Somerville with 21 You got three other guys in double figures Uh the offensive tag theres no way for Virginia to know where its coming from down 16 The biggest deficit the Hokes have faced today Bedford I know theres six minutes left but you almost felt like Bedford needed to make that one now with the 16point advantage and doesnt seem like anybody else can get anything going Bedford be the only guy here in the second half to provide a couple field goals Wiggins bulls his way into the lane and draws the foul He was going against Lwal and Abdales and he earns a trip to the line The personal is against Toby Lwal You see the confidence here and what were watching out of these Simols players We saw Wiggins in that first half uh put Lwal up underneath the basket with some hard pound dribbles to the bucket That one again Strong physical shoulder right into the defender playing through the contact the concentration Now step to the line here and make a first free throw Well here is Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header number 20 Clemson is in Winston Salem to square off against Wake Forest beginning at 700 Eastern followed by 15th ranked Virginia against Georgia Tech Both available on the ESPN app Wiggins makes a pair He is one of four seminals in double figures now with 17 points Well like I said they need a fast and furious run right now if youre Virginia Tech or Virginia Tech Nation to get something going as Hansberry goes inside He cant get that right hand hook to go Were down 18 with 515 to play You can turn the lights out on this building here as far as their uh postseason NC2A tournament chances If they lose this game if they cant find a way to fight back into this thing thats it Its over Joey Brackets will be done scouting this squad the rest of the season Wiggins off the lob from Somerville This match is the largest deficit faced by Virginia Tech this year Its 80 60 and part of the capacity crowd here in Blackburg is headed to the exits Yeah unfortunately they have just not had an answer for this offensive punch here in the second half A 55 my math right here 45 point explosion here in the second half after only putting up 33 points in the first half So what a what a game here by the uh the Simols They Im not sure exactly what adjustments they made other than turning Somerville loose on them Somerville just picked up his fourth foul You know this really started to turn the season for Florida State January 20th at Miami They are on their way to winning for the fifth time in seven games They won at Miami won at Notre Dame and then swept the California schools 8260 as McGra again back inside All the attack its been inside You cant stop us well score If you do stop us well throw it back outside And at the other end Virginia Tech is just having bad luck every time they go inside McCrae will head back to the foul line after his strong take You know one of the things Mike Young has always said during his seven years at Virginia Tech we dont turn the ball over here Well they didnt in the first half and we had a ball game They have turned it over a ton in the second half and that has been one of the big differences Yeah thats the big difference And they theyve taken care of the ball Florida State has been the more aggressive team here in this second half and theyre going to get their first win since 2000 in this building Not 2000 2020 Excuse me Florida State is 31 of 51 from the floor including 1519 in the second half That is 79 their shooting against the Virginia Tech defense here in the second Just an incredible performance by Florida State Yeah And they have gone inside for buckets Yes But even their outside triples have been uncontested for the most part And thats not something you see generally Virginia Tech let their opponents do to them So they got some work to do here If they going to try to salvage their season and make a a run coming off of that Virginia Tech win it has been just as big a disappointment here this afternoon for coach Youngs Squad Hammond gets the bounce 8462 Hes got 16 points as Virginia Techs lead scorer But even Hammond right like he he was he was great in that first half 11 points leading all scorers Hes been quiet here in this second half Besides that bucket there hes only had one other field goal Three and a half minutes left in regulation as we head to break The Seinals looking for the upset Introducing Sports Center for CC As we headed to break Virginia Tech challenged an out of bounds call It was unsuccessful So the Hokes have been charged with their second timeout But with the way the seminals have been playing Luke Ls team its not going to matter 8462 The second half has been challenged from V Virginia Tech by successful It will remain Florida States ball They have outscored their music opponent in the second half 4520 after trailing by three at the intermission and again shooting 79 here in the second Yeah I mean 11 points in the paint Uh 11 points off of turnovers rather 16 points in the paint They cheering just have really just taken the fight right to the Hokes McCrae no and Geraks going to be called for the foul got a handful of the jersey of Tomas Van Well this is why they play the game Scott I mean Florida State just a few days ago went to Clemson and beat the 20th ranked team in the country And now especially here in the second half they have not looked like a team thats worthy against a Luke LS team that has really hit its stride Yeah and Florida State Give them credit Theyre coming off a tough loss where they had um Virginia on the ropes and just couldnt finish the deal to lose by by three points and they could have hung their heads and realized oh were 11 and 13 squad but theres been no quit uh in this Simols team and they came back here and have taken the Hogis to the woodshed and just busted them all up Low And again that Florida State defense making it tough Theyve done a really nice job on the perimeter of making sure anytime Jaden Shoot has the ball they close out immediately Hes only been able to get off two threepointers and has missed them both And collectively they have turned it around And Ill tell you what Martin Somerville said earlier this week Im learning how to defend with a purpose cheering Jones 43 Why not What do you take from Somerville saying I and we are learning how to defend with a purpose Well it it like I say it sounds like that buyin uh culture for coach LS is the roots are starting to grow deep and and theyre seeing success They want to When a team struggles early and suddenly starts seeing success this is what the result You get a team playing hard at both ends of the floor theyre playing without fouling Theyre taking care of the basketball On the offensive end it doesnt stick Nobody cares who makes the shot as long as they get the good look Gach with a takeaway Here comes Hammond up ahead Abdales throw it up and Low does what he does Well thats a cheering beautiful break right there Get a live ball rebound and then off to the other end Picked it ahead I love that high hand off by La We just didnt see enough of that here at this second half and Florida State was able to put this game to bed with almost 330 to play I mean this has been a dominant dominant second half But you see that theyre shooting 79 for the most part in this second half Thats crazy 79 Somerville now with 23 three shy of his careerh high Hes been the story in the second half when a decisive 13 nothing run put Seolles out in front They trailed most of the first half and into the second half but it has been all FSU since the break Can we get Somerville over here after the game I want to talk to that young man and find out what he did to turn around a two for9 performance to come out here and light it up the way he did That dunk now gives McCrae 1500 points in his college career at Wake Forest Jacksonville and now Florida State Its the exclamation point on whats going to be a huge road victory Lau with another dunk at the other end Hey 1500 points is a fantastic college career but a lot of guys that have played D1 basketball that have not scored 1500 points So can tip my hat to that young man I tip my hat the way he ran his squad here in the second half and to come out and get this victory Florida State is putting a a lot of teams on notice Dont look at our record You better be looking at the way weve been playing these last three weeks In a very NBA like move Luke LZ tells his team dribble out take the shot clock violation and give it back to the Hokes for the final 10 and 12 seconds His team has gone on the road once again and this could be their most impressive performance of the year Its the most points given up by the Hokes this season And Virginia Tech on the bubble coming in may have just had its bubble burst today by Florida State 9269 your final score tip my hat to Coach LS and
