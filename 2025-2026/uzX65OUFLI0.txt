Struggling Panthers music look to pull a big time shocker against a Duke team coming off that loss to Carolina Malip Brown making just his second start in Duke Colors Wins the tip for John Sherss Blue Devils Brown is in there for Gungbo with Caleb Foster lobbing it up and getting Brown an early touch and he tips it in on the first possession Smart play by Malik Brown really just to guide that into the basket not trying to force the dunk and get the highlight Panthers coached by Jeff Cable in his eighth season Its a very thin pit team due to injuries and absences They only have eight available scholarship players Couple of walkons and a red shirt as well Cameron cheering Corin their leading scorer on the court with Brandon Cummings out has the first two for Pit and the Zoo can throw their confetti at this point after the first made field goal of the game for the Panthers Cameron Cord getting to the midrange and Pit going to need a cheering big performance from him to be successful here tonight Whos the freshman Dame Sar short on the three and heres Pit with the freshman Omari Witherspoon cheering West Thank you very much Great win for Miami over Carolina And now the other half of Saturdays Duke UNCC thriller The Blue Devils on the road here in Pit Theyve got buckets from Malik Brown and Isaiah Evans Kevin Brown Cory Alexander here from the Pete The starting five for the Pit Panthers Demarco Miner Omari Witherspoon to the guards Barry Dunning Roman Seal Cam Corin for a pit team that has been bruised and battered this season but has a couple of early buckets This one from the senior Dunning and a strong offensive start for the Panthers attacking the basket able to get two baskets to go early Cameron Corin getting involved and having of course a lot to deal with in this game on both ends of the floor The starting five for Duke Foster Evans and Sar the guards as Foster misses a three Cameron Boozer the likely national player of the year is next to Malik Brown Theres an injury for Duke well tell you about momentarily which means Brown is making just his second start in two years with Duke Heres Caleppa A three for the freshman from Australia And you got to imagine Roman CPA looking forward to playing in this game the power forward matchup between he and Cameron Boozer playing against one of the best in the country if not the best in the country and having an opportunity Well hes on Boozer who immediately got rid of the ball to Brown even with a oneonone against Caleppa And then Malik throws it away Witherspoon ahead for Denny John Sh with the timeout early as the Panthers have gotten off to a perfect start Jeff Cable excited about the way that his team has approached this game versus his alma mater kicking ahead Barry Dunning taking off on the turnover The Panthers flying high up five with a left wrist injury John Shy told us he suffered it in the North Carolina game even though he only played 16 minutes and fouled out So Malik Brown the start for Duke but snaps his 70 run with a dunk of its own The first bucket for Cameron Boozer second leading scoreer in the country And thats the advantage the Blue Devils have Whenever theyre struggling they have a guy they can throw the basketball to whether its on the perimeter or on the interior And Cameron Boozler normally delivers Has started out four for five The stitched together Panthers team down its leading scoreer in Brandon Cummings has just three straight with ankle issue Seppa his second three just a 30 threepointer and Pit is five for six and Seales biggest game of the season 28 points for him against Pit State Pits last nonconference game but he was five of six from three in that game Now he does the job defensively with the steel taking it away from Boozer Theres Miner off the takeaway Miner see in and out Halfway home to a third But right now Jeff Cable thinking to himself dont fall in love with the three even though its going well Isaiah Evans answering once again after take getting his second field goal of the game Evans rises over Demarco Miner second leading scorer for Duke at 14 a game A fourpoint lead for Pit which is five for seven and has turned Duke over twice Heres the freshman Omari Witherspoon out for Corin Not a typical threepoint shooter only hit nine on the year but thats eight more than what he made last season So thats improvement Thats trending upward Nine for 28 Foster wraps it around Evans in the corner hits a three But those are the shots that John Sh wants to see more of from Isaiah Evans Shots that are catch and shoot that his teammates are creating for him in comparison to taking many shots on the move And Caleb Fawson with a nice bond to the corner allows Evans to pick up his seventh point It extends by the way the longest streak in the nation for Duke which has now made it three in 1288 consecutive games Evans will fake a three Hes got the last five for Duke and misfires at a deep two Will stay with Duke with 1440 to go in the first half Good start for Pit up a point ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance Bundle home and auto and save Visit progressivecom Okay Even in a game where he scored 24 points Well North Carolina did a tremendous job of double teaming him and often times on the catch And when the double team is 610 and seven feet it makes it difficult Four turnovers which is uncharacteristic for Cameron Boozer Hes had four turnovers in three different games this season And also music 10 of 21 from the field which for him is an inefficient day for a young man who shoots over 57 in ACC play So North Carolina was able to make life difficult for Cameron Boozer Not many teams have been able to do that throughout this season Its pretty amazing We see make and they made life difficult He still scored 24 but his worst shooting game since nonconference against Florida Four turnovers for Boozer Were nitpicking because hes Cameron Boozer Were nitpicking because he scores 23 10 rebounds four assists a game this year And screaming hes the second leading scoreer in the country Also leading the ACC in rebounding and is top 12 in assists Hes top six in steals And more importantly hes probably the most valuable player in the country to his team And right on Q he blocks a shot of Miner Dunning recovers and misses a three Did I mention hes also won the nation defensive player of the award Feel free throwing into the accolades Backtoback seasons It appears Duke will have a freshman national player of the year Cooper flag a year ago Boozer is tripped up in the lane Theres the games first foul nearly 6 minutes in Its whistled by Tony Henderson who is joined by Clarence Armstrong and Courtney Green And its on Roman Caleeppa So yeah thats Cameron Boozer Only AJ Debansa the better scorer leads Duke in scoring rebounding assists and steals 583876 the shooting splits Times his brother Kaden Boozer who passes up a three Dame Sar missed it And John Sh told us today Kaden needs to be ready to shoot Well everyone needs to be ready to shoot Thats really been the struggle for the Blue Devils throughout the season Only made seven threes against Carolina in that loss but theyve struggled shooting the basketball They do much more of their domination in the painted area Indraitus has it knocked away by Brown See Aleppo with three to shoot Feeds Dunning Hes got to get it up Indraitus will and he hits it Larence Armstrong immediately whistles to see if Indraitis got that shot off the fingertips before the expiration of the shot clock Its interesting from our vantage point You were able to see and it looked like it was good in live action Possible shot clock violation When Dunning had the basketball at the top of the key I thought there was no chance that they could get that shot off and thats correct Its still in his hands I had to review Theres no basket Shot clock violation Duke basketball So what we always look at in live action is the red light around the shot clock but that is a split second late So when you consider the fact that the officials have the opportunity to go over and look at any made bucket and they got that one absolutely correct So itll go to Pits second turnover and the Panthers have now missed their last four onepoint Pittsburgh lead as Kaden Boozer brings it up the floor Freshman brothers from Columbus High School in Miami share the floor together And here is Cameron Kaden Camerons got the switch on the 64 freshman Witherspoon but they were unable to get him the basketball in the painted area Nice fas The shot clock was not correct yet Clarence Armstrong looking at the shot clock still saying 15 seconds And that was a very long long possession for there still to be half of the shot clock remaining So real time youll see the Boozer driving There 15 seconds on the shot clock at this point too Game clock shot stops as well So theres probably another 10 seconds of game action that happened that wasnt accounted for Unfortunate for Duke and was noticed right as they were going to get an open look for David Sar Felt like we were in old times four corners offense there for a moment as John Sh pulls his team together Well Im sure the Panthers are wondering why they havent to guard so long laughter Jeff Cable going up against his old school which he said is not a big story really at this point Maybe a little different when he goes down to Durham where he had such a stellar career as fouryear starting point guard for Duke Was part of a national championship staff as an assistant He shared time with John Shy on staff They were on the same staff from 2013 to 2018 under Mike Shasheesky Duke and both coaches well within the margin of error Cory Alexander laughter So Duke will draw something up here Darren Harris who did not play against Carolina is going to inbound this ball to Cameron Boozer Two strong dribbles Boozer gets Corin into the air and thats a pretty good play out of a timeout Great play and you get Boozer an opportunity really just to play oneonone in the painted area Cameron K the senior strong defender however you got to be even stronger to defend possibly the national player of the year onepoint lead for Duke Pit going on nearly four minutes without a point and Omari Witherspoon throws it right to Kaden Boozer Kaden missed Nicholas Amenya and then Harris couldnt grab it Duke turns it over for the third time There are weaknesses for Duke offensively There arent many Theyre not a great threepoint shooting team and they have a little trouble with live ball turnovers 211 in the country in live ball turnover rate They get a live ball turnover of their own Caleb Foster on the kick Amena short from three Got his own rebound Missed it again And the third shot for the freshman from LA is good But Jeff Cable immediately looking at Roman Ceppa and Clap encouraging him to get a defensive rebound Cppa a great offensive rebound rebounder but has more offensive rebounds than he does defensive rebounds on the year That time giving up one that allows the Blue Devils to pick up second chance points Nine in a row for Duke Andas cut off bit deep in the shot clock again Gets a hoist from Witherspoon Not close Foster can run for Duke Foster kicks it Amena way short cheering Important possession right now for the Panthers They need a score in the worst way Theyve been stuck on 12 seems like forever Theyre no longer stuck And Jeff Cable wants a timeout He wants to talk it over to make sure that music he does not let the Blue Devils get any separation in this first half Nice three ball music by of the year 212 A small dent in what is still an amazing resume Cory 10 and2 in quad one to lead the nation And the question for John Saturday its all about how Duke responds to that tough defeat as Darren Harris misses a good look from three And when you consider the fact that in Dukes two losses theyve held double digit leads in both up 15 at one point versus Texas Tech up 13 vers in the loss on Saturday And John Sy made it very clear to us they have to finish games better And this one they didnt defense didnt really get off to the start that hes normally used to seeing from his group The Panthers were able to get pretty much everything they wanted offensively to start the game but Duke has been able to settle in since Four turnovers in the last six pit positions before this one as Dunning misses a difficult shot near the rim The one thing you got to look at during this game is Cameron K gets in there picks up the foul Darren Harris attacking the basket without Gumba Theres very little front court depth for the Blue Devils So Malik Brown now most likely will come in and give Cameron Boozer a spell No hes going to get him any Cameron Boozer has yet to go out of this game Itll be interesting to see how many minutes he plays throughout this one Of course they rely on him for so much both offensively and defensively but playing 40 minutes in the ACC game is tough That was actually charged to minor So he and Cilep had the only two fouls of the game No fouls whistled against Duke for nearly 10 minutes on the bounce Cruiser feeds Foster in the lane Caleb Foster scores his first bucket And Caleb Foster at 65 able to take advantage over a much smaller guard and Miner trying to defend him once he gets into the painted area You mentioned the loss of gun but this would be the game to do it because Duke the tallest team in the ACC is facing pit the smallest team in the ACC Miners on a step back strikes a cord from deep Now how about four threepoint field goals now for the Panthers shooting the basketball extremely well on their home floor cheering and able to take the lead right back Kaden Boozer into his brother Cameron out of the double A cutting Kaden will finish And once again the positional size Kaden Boozer 64 against Miner whos listed at 6 feet maybe a little smaller but Boozer able to finish right around the rim And the assist to Cameron whos got a couple of assists on the last two Duke buckets Brown switches on to Witherspoon Boozer cheering against Caleppa whos hit three threes already Gets a bat from Dunning Caleppa drives on Boozer and couldnt bank it home cheering Brown on a cut for Boozer who banks it in with a left Im not sure which one was more impressive the pass or the finish Great finish by Kate Boozer attacking and using the rim as a shield Also going with the left hand off the glass Witherspoon scores it with a foul The first Duke foul of the game puts the freshman from Buoie Omari Witherspoon in a threepoint position Witherspoon hearing all the conversation about freshman in this game wants to make sure his name gets mentioned Amari Witherspoon able to go off the bounce An opportunity for three at the free throw strike You think hes hearing us I think hes heard it before Maybe not this not not currently I think hes just heard it before A little quiet at times in here Its possible Mari Witherspoon 16 starts Hes had to take a bigger role Brandon Cummings your leading scorers missed seven games with an ankle injury Witherspoon out of Buoie Maryland will not complete the threepoint play P has some good young players They had a great freshman class coming in next year but theyve had trouble supplementing it Theyre out two players in the front court Pashawn Jacksons been out the whole season And Papa Amadu Kante another big man had knee surgery yesterday Only eight games Off the deflection by Corin Here is Pit with Dunning Corin a little slow to get back behind the play Clarence Armstrong will whistle the play dead Corin immediately grabbing for that left ankle after getting a deflection and which results in a turnover Korn going down and we mentioned playing 40 minutes is difficult in an ACC game Cameron Korn has actually done it this year One of the top 10 players in the league in minutes per game Jeff Caper relies on him so much and probably even more so in this contest here this evening Horns got a couple of assists early One bucket He sets a screen for MIT into all kinds of traffic found Dunning and Corin cant grab the offensive rebound Foster Sar back on the floor for cheering Duke which is without both boozers at the moment cheering Theres Brown operating as a point center A tough catch for Evans and he couldnt grab it Fifth turnover for Duke 10 in SEC with 10 a piece the ACC with eight including the Miami Hurricanes who got a huge win tonight Cory right before us against North Carolina Yeah one of the things that you when you think about the Duke North Carolina rivalry you always look at the game after who has the hangover and again when you consider the Seth Trimble the struggles from Seth Trimble and Derek Dixon in that game maybe there was a little hangover on Carolinas part Dunning bricks at Trimble and Dixon who of course connected for the gamewinning three combined for just six points tonight and Miamis home win over UNC Hurricanes thats a big win They look like a tournament team obviously with work to do under Jay Lucas who was an assistant at Duke a year ago Great catch by Brown off a wayward pass Heres Evans short on a three and Dunan grabs a rebound Little bit of a hangover for Duke maybe as well or something else in the slug No I believe Pittsburgh has brought the fight to the Blue Devils early in this game and when you lose you its hard to have a hangover because youre trying to get back on track as John Sh told us theyre just trying to win some games as if he hasnt won all but two this season Wo is him at 212 Hey Saturday night Huge day of mens college basketball And theres a signature womens game with college game day at 8 Eastern Over on ABC it is South Carolina ranked third in the country LSU ranked sixth to national championship and national championship caliber programs Again that game is on ABC Malaysia full widely playing against South Carolina where she was a season ago Weve seen it throughout college basketball all season long players playing against their former teams But its going to be interesting to see Malaysia going up against Don Staley and Joyce Edwards who has been absolutely balling without Khloe Kits in the lineup this season End of the shot clock Calempa all air Miner tried to save it with two ten of a second to go He was out of bounds By the way the foul last foul was on Malik Brown Hes got both of Dukes fouls Well and Malik Brown who got in foul trouble in the first half versus UNCC As a matter of fact between Malik Brown Cameron Boozer and Patrick Gumba they had seven fouls in music the first half of that game UNCC only had six for the entire game So and but John Sh did not make an excuse about that though He t his team needed to put the pressure on the officials attacking the basket not setting for jump shots to get to the free throw line And remember no Patrick Guna for Duke tonight with a left wrist issue Foster difficult drive and finish for Duke Nice finish going to the left hand on the reverse layup Thats where Caleb Fosters had so much success during the season attacking the basket His 16 second half points versus Louisville The majority of that came from getting to the rim And a guy that was a elite shooter in high school really hasnt found that touch from beyond the arc Miner driven backwards by Jimea and the Duke defense Miner on a bounce in Sidus denied by Dame Sar and Duke did not have possession So that is a shot clock violation The second the Blue Devils have forced tonight But that is the true calling card for this Blue Devil squad Its their defense Lead the ACC in scoring defense One of the best defensive teams in the country And a lot of it has to do with the fact you have guys like Dames Sar who can contest shots on the perimeter and more importantly they finish each and every possession with a defensive rebound Duke one of the best rebounding teams in the league as well Foster into Boozer missed it against Caleppa Rebound down to Dun You see Lepa with this rugby background up for all the physicality that that Cameron Boozer brings to this game Leads him on this side with nine Seppas held his own Cameron Boozer only four points one rebound Witherspoon floats it out for Dunning his second three But everything for the Panthers is assisted They continue to share the basketball extremely well Seven assists on their nine made field goals in this game 2323 cheering The ACCs first place team against one of the teams tied for last Foster will shoot it Boozer cant grab the rebound but he does knock it out to Foster Ebanss up and Duke will reset Cameron Boozer buries in for Situs and spins it home Tim Oul who coached at Duke and also coached with coach K at Army up on the sideline wanting a travel on Boozer on that last possession First three by Miner is grabbed by Boozer Theres Foster into Dunning Foster gets fouled Caleb Foster draws the Dunning foul Its his first Duke has taken the lead back Cameron Boozer did he or did he not I think its legit He kept the left foot down and music more importantly he laid down the law in the paint Hasnt been Cameron Boozer its been Caleb Foster in the paint Its been Isaiah Evans at one point in the paint Kaden Boozer in the paint But its 20 to 25 Also with no Patrick Gumba Im sure John Sh is trying to have make sure he manages cheering Cameron Boozers minutes as well as how much of his usage he has to take care of on the floor throughout this first half knowing theyre going to need much more of him in the second Theres G out with a left wrist issue He and we just saw the first free throw made by anybody today Caleb Foster So Duke has done all this work in the paint but thats drawn more than three fouls And thats just the third foul committed by a Blue Devil Its Kaitton Boozer But that also goes back to coach Greenbergs point Duke is not drawing fouls because theyre playing five out And the guys doing the majority of the damage in the paint are their guards And so you know they have two elite passers in Malik Brown and Cameron Boozer at the top of the key But if you give Cameron Boozer the basketball in the painted area hes going to get to the free throw line and hes also going to go point is the only pit player to come off the bench so far Dunning lets it fly A couple of threes for Dunning Hes in the double figures and Penn has retied it And to my Oak Hill Hall of Fame brother Ron Slay in studio says the threepointer is the great cheering equalizer and that has been the weapon of choice for the Panthers Boozer off the miss by Foster got it back Was knocked away from Foster should say and then Cameron Boozer draws a foul And side is driving and Dunning Jr just relocating Great footwork going straight up straight down able to knock down the three ball And the most important part of it all giving credit for it to his teammate for finding him for three Eight assists 10 main field goals now for Pittsburgh cheering And here is Cameron Boozer screaming cheering So now heres the thing Did you hear the overrated chant from the zoo There are bears in zoos Correct In many Yes Okay You should know Dont wake the sleeping bear Okay If Cameron Boozer is chilling in this first half seven points for him thats chilling cheering Dont wake him up by screaming overrated Because the last thing you want him to do in this game is show off why he is the front runner for the national player of the year which Im sure at some point he will but dont encourage that to happen earlier I I think bizarrely for a guy who is the best player in the nation and playing for Duke and the son by the way of a great Duke player Carlos Boozer as Dunning hits another three puts in the lead I think bizarrely Cameron Boozer is actually underrated I I definitely believe hes underrated and you know we had a conversation off air about he hasnt received the attention that Cooper Flag did a season ago as his twin brother is able to get the bucket in the painting area off another nice find from Cameron But a lot of that has to do with the fact that Cameron has much more competition in the freshman class than did Cooper flag last year Coopers primary competition was on his own team with Kad by a point Pit has hit seven threes in this first half See Apa breaks a potential lead And one concern for the Panthers you cant fall in love with that three Fosters had a terrific first half Hes got seven points three rebounds a couple of assists and another dicing drive And this is the best version of Caleb Foster when hes attacking especially in transition before the defense can get back and get set able to attack the rim and get a quick buck Three in the final 80 seconds and a half Very similar first half for Pit to the one Saturday against SMU Wrapped in to Corin has the size advantage on Harris Couldnt finish Rebound to Cameron Boozer Give Darren Harris a lot of credit Standing his ground against the stronger taller Cam Corin forcing him to take a fadeaway jump shot Theres Kaden Boozer Harris with a three That is pure And that is only the second cheering made threepoint field goal for Darren Harris in ACC play But that is what he does John Shia made it very clear to us he was going to get an opportunity this evening and taken advantage of it on defensively and now offensively as well January 24th against Wake was his only other made three in either of his first two seasons in an ACC game Largest lead for Duke Witherspoon cant cut into it And then a foul is going to go against Harris of Duke to keep the possession with Pit Niner team is close to the bonus The guards stepping up for the Blue Devils Caleb Foster with a nice crossover attacking going to the left hand finishing high off the glass And then Darren Harris spotting up knocking down a huge three And of course looking back to his brotherhood on the bench to celebrate St Paul the sixth and team takeover standout Darren Harris I cant believe Im the one to say that at this broadcast Uhhuh Not a second between shot and game clock Pit can hold for just about the final shot Miner against Boozer Miner over Boozer over everything So Pit battled had the lead for much of the half but Duke scores the last seven Cameron Boozer just starting to get going at the end of the half Had eight points Duke dominated in the paint Dunning and Caleppa combined for six threes and 22 points for Pit but the Blue Devils lead by six after 20 minutes The confetti was flung up The Pit crowd had a lot to celebrate but music Duke leads it by a couple of threepointers Kevin Carters in the gang in studio Take it away All right Okay So I got to reset Well we are not going to halftime just yet The officials realized that the well the shot didnt hit the ground till there was 610 of a second It was first Cameron Boozer talking about that as Darren Harris will get the heave Unable to get it to go I thought they were going to go with the old Christian Lightner play Throw it to Boozer full court But now were at the end of the first half as we go back to the studio And uh Kevin three threes at the end of the half could be a factor for pity here Cory They only use one substitute in the first half Neyas and Dracitis not counting the 610 of a second K here in Mullen played at the end How much energy do you expect the shorthanded team to have I believe theyll still have a significant amount of energy especially here on their home floor This Im sure the biggest crowd theyve had at a game this season Everyone gets their biggest crowds when the Blue Devils show up A bucket by CPA that could have absolutely helped the Panthers to get on the board first here in the second half Unable to go down Well Darren Harris starts the second half on the floor for Duke along with Kaden Boozer No Malik Brown to start the half And no Isaiah Evans as cheering Kaden Boozer is swatted by Cameron Corin Well maybe John Sh felt like that Evans as well as Posby Brown had the hangover from the rivalry game this weekend But Malik Brown going back to his usual role coming off the bench where hes been so successful all season long Harris has never started a game in two years Not sure if he started a half before this Selea flanks a three But as you mentioned before against this Pittsburgh team as Sard gets away with a little bit of a travel and it wasnt called and Darren Harris trying to get in for an offensive rebound but against this Pittsburgh team its actually a pretty good size matchup because youre not playing against a very tall team So for John Sh to shake it up a little bit and recognizing that hes going to need to find that energy that the Panthers may not have with only having eight available players Not that Duke is terribly deep either but the den at least play three off the bench Heres Dunning Had the last nine of the first half for Pit The shot is followed up by CPA who can pick up Pits first free throw Panthers were 0 for one in the first half Speaking of first thats the first offensive rebound for Roman Cepa who has had 34 offensive rebounds in his last six games is number one in the ACC during league play and third nationally as far as league play games go and offensive reboundings at 46 per game in ACC action Well the numbers have just shot up for this freshman from Brisbane Australia He struggles here though 49 at the line and he missed both So Duke had a 70 run coming into the second half and neither team has scored in the first nearly two minutes Has defended really well today Team that is the worst by defensive efficiency in the league has held its own as Foster travels because he grabbed his own shot which didnt hit the rim wasnt deflected and Duke turns it over for a sixth time Are you aware of what that used to be called in a pickup game Oh my gosh I am because I did it a bunch and laughter I cant cant remember it now Do you remember up and down Up and down Yes that was the name of that when you That was the call in the pickup game Never an official actual call in the game of basketball Yeah just sadness was the call on the mean streets of St Christopher School Baldwin poked away by Sar Heres Harris on the run out for Duke Darren Harris at the bucket will score the first fast break points for Duke tonight But how about the confidence that John Shers inserted into Darren Harris by starting him in this second half This could be a a turning point for Darren Harris on this season Not just for this game but for this season as well allowing him to establish more of a role with this Blue Devil team Witherspoon on a hard charge gets fouled Kaden Boozer called for his second One thing to play for John Sh youve got to do the job defensively This time Darren Harris coming up with the steal off a nice deflection by Sar and Harris turning defense into offense using that left hand to finish over Cameron Korn to build the lead to eight for the Huda Dunning off a screen got a great look Aiden Boozer collects it picks last game Saturday They were down 3432 at the half to SMU Then the Mustangs started the half on a 90 run Dukes got the first five here and its starting to feel like deja vu all over again for Jeff Cable on a Cameron Boozer three Its a pit timeout Cameron Boozer continues to music impress his shooting his passing everything about his game has been impressive all season long because when you look at the email that we get daily from Joey Brackets Stanford is still considered I believe number 82 on his list Oh you brought receipts but we got them over in a pile and not even at the top of the pile Right next to BC who is not considered and underneath Syracuse who was not considered Pit turns it over Meanwhile Panthers just trying to catch their footing Two and nine and came into today tied for last place in the ACC Their only wins at Georgia Tech and an overtime win at home against Wake Forest Now whats so significant about that now with the new ACC Three teams will not make the ACC tournament And so it is right now five teams battling for those last two spots at the ACC tournament in Charlotte which was new for last year once the three additional teams were added with SMU Stanford and K I tell you what the world word battling is doing a lot of work there Once again I hope people recognize your voice and compares to the mine Corin snaps the throbo Duke run with a bucket just his second of the game cheering I mean the league is genuinely so much better and deeper Last year four teams made the tournament Duke was the only one to win its first round let alone more And of course they made the final four That three is bricked by Sar John Sher has still not gone into his bench here He started the second half with Darren Harris and Kaden Boozer in the game for two starters Isaiah Evans and Malik Brown Well it was a 120 run spanning the two halves the end of the first half coming into the second half as C Leeppa gets a three to go his fourth three on the evening and is able to make it a sixpoint gain Roman all of his points from beyond the threepoint arc cheering Again you love to see the freshman making shots but dont fall in love with them a cutting Harris found a lot of contact and a foul right at the rim and hell have free throws when we come back but Pit is lingering Roman the Aleppo who knocked down three first half threes He really over the last 13 games stepped in and made his presence felt in Pittsburgh He averaged 19 and N in that World Cup last year He was really good and we asked Jeff Cable about him today He said Lamar Patterson who played a pit 2009 to 14 Hes been in Australia since 2021 He had seen Caleppa So it was the former Panther Patterson who helped get Caleppa on Pits radar Caleppa was his teammate Thats right Harris by the way just missed two Duke is three for six at the line Pit is 0 for three Fundamentally sound basketball This has not always been but Pit has mucked it up to stay within six of the nations fourth ranked team Witherspoon breaks a three And Malik Brown now back on the floor in his reserve role which hes been in the majority of the season Got the start with the absence of Patrick Dumba in this game Harris cant hit a three Cameron Boozer offensive glass lost it and then Brown comes flying in to deflect the ball which ended up deflecting back off of him And now Isaiah Evans will get his first second half minutes replacing Harris for Duke And now youve got the starting lineup for this days game on the floor for the Blue Devils as the Panthers go to the bench and bring initis back into the game Thats Pits first up of the second half And you can see there Pit has not had a bench point initis in 11 minutes And then Kieran Mullen played one second actually 610 of a second at the end of the half Sixpoint lead for Duke Big favorite on the road Struggling with pit Miner down to see back for Demarco Miner Indraitis The deep one is way way short Caleppa saves it to Brown Hes in the crowd Dukes got a five on four Foster into the paint Little bump and scores it Once again Caleb Foster attacking the paint in transition before Pit can set their defense and taking advantage of that 65 frame and has really worked on his body Much stronger than he was coming into Duke and showing it off at the rim Sele has taken 27 threes only 10 twos Season high for the Panthers from 338 Still 13 minutes remaining Im sure they will get close to that as Dunning Jr comes up with a nice turnover Intritis puts it home with a foul Barry Dunning Jr starting the fast break defensively sealed up the body Andrew Sidus was able to finish through the contact over the top the two points and an opportunity to make the first free throw of the game for the Panthers At Iowa State a year ago as a bit player anditis will not make the first free throw of the game but see has the offensive rebound Anditis misses a three But to beat Duke those are the buckets you have to have And it ends up turning into two points the other way for Isaiah Evans But the offensive rebound that could have been a fivepoint possession for the Panthers Unable to take advantage of a great look off the offensive rebound by Cu Potentially devastating swing for Pimp Corin will roll it home Get back to within six Nice touch from Cam Corin who weve talked about his minutes played Jeff Cable leans on him so heavily on his senior cheering Brown nearly threw it away into the post Boozer spinning inside Boozer in all kinds of trouble He turns it over Another tough night for Boozer by his standards And Cepa got another great look from three You dont mind that shot again for a guy thats been as hot as Cepa has been You get him in transition Boozer having a hard time getting back and locating Cupa Got a great look Hes unable to get it to go Foster and the switch with Corin Foster cant shake him Deep three for Evans and he sticks it in front of his bench Huge bucket on the road for Isaiah Evans as the Panthers starting to make a run The energy the juice is in the building And whats the best way to kill that energy Its knocking down a huge three causing the timeout by Jeff Cable And just like that the Blue Devils build the ninepoint lead What a swing You have Pits best threepoint shooter by percentage wide open on one end you have a one on three on the other And these are the little moments where Pit needs a few things to swing their way to try and hang around against this behemoth of a Duke team which has now gone as you can see five for its last seven Pit has really struggled in the second half One for nine three Corin misses near the rim And heres Evans whos got 12 points in 13 minutes and then turns it over Miner for Dunning First points of the second half for Barry Dunning Jr Strong finish by Dunning Jr attacking the basket and I love how he didnt settle on that possession Putting the pressure on the Blue Devils to defend him at the rim Foster off the screen Boozer is all alone and bricks hit with 13 assists on 16 makes but only shooting 37 28 from three and 0 for four from the line Miner stripped and thatll go to Duke off of DeMarco Miner Great hands once again by Malik Brown who 56 six deflections per game but the deflection from Dunning getting in the passing lane knocking the basketball away and then finishing on the other end of the floor Great possession defensively and turning it into offense for Barry Dunning Jr who has 15 points on the evening Duke is shooting it at 53 Doesnt feel like it because they have 10 turnovers and theyre only four for 15 from three Boozer out of a double team airmails it Thats similar to one of the turnovers we showed earlier in the first half when the trap comes and but more importantly youre considering Nicholas Himemenia who has to stay put If Jimea stays and he can absolutely knock down the three if he stays home he gets a good look in comparison to trying to crash and get to the rim You think thats as much on the potential receiver as the passer It is definitely on the receiver He has to be there to give Boozer that outlet Dunning into Corin against Boozer Lawson on a careless dribble How many times have we seen the Panthers get to six get to five and then squander a possession allowing the Blue Devils to come back down the floor and try to build a little more cushion on that lead The fourth foul as Foster went in on a drive Just the second foul I should say for Pit Sunday the softball season has begun The Shriners Childrens Clearwater Invitational Dozens of amazing matchups all weekend long Missouri NC Statem NC State and Duke Missouri on the ACC Network Friday Saturday Sunday Another three for Isaiah Evans who has found the touch Three for four from deep three for four inside the arc and Duke stretches it out to 10 And how about our conversation with John Sh earlier where he talked about shot selection for Isaiah Evans and how much that made a difference in his percentage Short for minor on a three John said Isaiah Evans his percentage is way down The percentage on open shots is very similar to last year but the contested shots he said hes somewhere in the 20s in terms of percentage And tonight the shots have been much cleaner looks Miner bumped it away from Foster So no backcourt violation but Miner is all over Foster who has just five to get up a shot into Boozer who lost it again Miner bounces ahead for Dunning He turned it back over and back and forth this pendulum swings underneath out of bounds play Americas play in screen to screener Isaiah Evvis actually fakes it and gives him enough space and then just a little just a little wiggle on the sideline over there celebrating with his friends Tyler Thornton assistant coach up wanting to celebrate with him Forgot he was coaching at that point You call it Americas play the screen play Yeah But he didnt actually set the screen It was a It was a fake and that was what forced Dunning to give him a little bit of room thinking he was going to have to help And Isaiah getting right off to the corner Able to knock down the three Doesnt need much time Maybe cannabis play then No tweet Nope cheering Nope Was a variation on the American was not Heres Boozer from Boozer short Duke has not been able to run away Pit has not had a sustained run to get back into it Just been an arms length game pretty much the whole second half Miner from Intracitis Pits taken two3 of its shot from three and Indraitus throws it to a cameraman This is a game biging for a timeout It will get one Duke up 10 16 four turnovers Cameron Boozer a quiet 11 and nine tonight He has four turnovers as well What do you look for for Duke CA in the final eight minutes Well youre going to see a heavy dose of Boozer And when you consider that regardless of the four turnovers hes still the guy that can deliver at the end Malik Brown getting his shot blocked at the basket off a nice find from Kaden Boozer Tom Sar sticks it from the corner Nice find from Evans And this is the largest lead for Duke Sar starting to exert himself on the offensive end Had 10 points in the first half versus UNCC on Saturday His 13 points were tied his ACC high as hes becoming more of a factor on the offensive end Brown look like he got poked in the face in that possession Hes I think Brown from Virginia be tough Dont worry about that He had a ton of injuries last year He played through No doubt to his toughness Indraitis misses a three at the end of the shot clock Caleppa offensive rebound and lost it Away by Brown Pit still doesnt have a second chance Isaiah Evans attacking off the bounce and makes the nice find the left hand pass to Dame Sar who knocks down the corner three and all of a sudden its been the threepoint shooting for the Blue Devils Four of nine in the second half where it was a area where P a was able to dominate in the first half Cuppa got fouled by Boozer who just reached in Thats what Jeff Cables been waiting for from Cuppa Even though the threes have been going wants to see him more aggressive attacking downhill catching on the run as Boozer reaches in slaps him on the arm Caleppa able to finish with this first basket inside the painted area in this game And Pit has still not hit a free throw came into the game tied for 347th in the country at 667 Regrettably theyve gotten worse Theyre 0 for five tonight Boozer to Evans trying to get free off a Brown screen Evans sticks a top of the key three It doesnt take much And youre talking about a young man who did not start this second half received the message from his head coach John Shire of the way he needed to perform in the second half of this game I believe theyre going to get Malik Brown on that foul trying to bust through the screen Malik still a little bothered about the friendly fire that he took earlier on the possession that has him checking his lip for blood during the breaks Its his third foul Hes the only player in any foul trouble today Remember Duke without Patrick Gumba out with a wrist injury was questionable coming into today They hope it wont be a longterm absence Witherspoon out of bounds off of Evans who has 11 of his 18 in the half And you see Cameron K swinging through with that We didnt swing with the elbow Malik Brown catching the shoulder And so great job by our officiating crew not making a call on that one That was inadvertent Not making the call and not going to the monitor for long review Lawrence Armstrong Tony Henderson Courtney Green have been all over the game tonight Miner got it cheering Just the second three of the half for Pent But inside out getting Seal up an opportunity to play in the post Has a mismatch vers Sar forcing the help and allowing Miner to relocate to the corner for three Five and a half to play Duke trying to get to 11 and one in the league as Evans throws it away and its finished on the other end by Dunning It was Sar who turned it over looking for Evans Dunning with a fast break bucket and Pit is within nine Duke will take its second timeout John Sh perplexed Were back Counts for extra points Thats a threepoint layup Should be not reflected No did put it on the put it on the score Will Wayne last night the NC State take up legend Louisville said it was one loss it doesnt count for three though it should so he can make up the rules as we go along here in the lead Theres a bucket for Cameron Boozer who has had a quiet second half and out of the timeout a chance for a threepoint play But where did the Blue Devils go when they need a bucket They find 12 on the interior and he delivers a nice left hand finish off the glass through the contact An opportunity for a threepoint play Second foul against Cameron Corin cheering And Boozer two for two from the line tonight And a threepoint play is converted to stretch the lead back to a dozen Zoo has not had much to howl about tonight especially in the second half Duke led by six at the break Theyre plus six since the break Theyre going to get Malik Brown once again trying to impede the progress of Cameron K going up to set the screen which is his fourth Its going to be the fourth foul on Malik And remember with no Patrick Gumba Maliks going to have to be careful down the stretch here Hes an important member of this team Often finishes games whether he starts or not Caleeppa driving it into Boozer He finishes through the contact Roman Caleppa with another threepoint play opportunity And now Roman Caleeppa attacking off the bounce Weve seen him much more aggressive in the second half trying to get to the rim Able to get his shoulders past Boozer A little bit of a chicken wing but lets see if Caleeppa can make the first free throw once again for the Panthers in this game Hes 0 for three They are 0 for five And Pits long national nightmare is over Yes Virginia Pit can make a free throw cheering Foster on the handoff from Brown has the switch with the big Corin Foster goes right at him Now we talked about Caleb Foster using his size advantage over smaller guards That times he takes on a much bigger challenge of Cameron K but still able to finish through the contact First double figure game in his last nine since he had 20 at Louisville January the 6th Witherspoon Its a tough one And Foster had a good allaround game 11 points five rebounds four assists Big step up this year for the junior from Harrisburg cheering Best scoring year best field goal percentage best passing year of his three at Duke Well hes hes got a permanent role Hes their point guard on the season and this is really where he can help this team Shooting the basketball This young man was an elite shooter in high school Has not truly found that confidence in a Blue Devil uniform but now stepping up making big plays at the end of game Five straight for Foster and Duke is trying to put the finishing touch on this late night Witherspoon spinning and missing Foster with his sixth rebound Its been Caleb Foster to seize command of this game down the stretch The third year Duke guard senses an opportunity Kicks it for Evans off the shot fake Hits a dagger Isaiah Evans and Caleb Foster have made this building their SVB asking a question that has never been asked Do we have too many pitchers Do we have too many arms How never asked How much time can we spend discussing the merits of Tommyuki Sagalo in course field next year That will boost our ratings here in America in Japan globally The fight for the American League East is on court Kovich be a big part of it Roman CPA is fouled on the drive Duke has really closed this game well Six straight field goals made for Duke It hasnt been Cameron Boozer necessarily down the stretch Isaiah Evans with 21 in 22 minutes Caleb Foster with 146 and five Again we thought Duke went without Patrick Young but would still have enough to beat Pit It took a little longer for them to pull away as Malik Brown fouls out but this has been an impressive close to the game Well lets talk about the first thing that John Sh told us earlier We didnt close the game We didnt control our controllers And so when you consider that theyve done that in this game but theyve gotten it from other pieces outside of Boozer this is something that can build confidence for this team When you have Caleb Foster knowing that he can play like this at the end of games and then you get Isaiah Isaiah Evans knowing he can play this well in the end of games You dont put as much pressure on Cameron Boozer to do everything for you down the stretch Boozers passes kicked And lets lets also add life does not get easier for the Blue Devils Theyve got Clemson coming into the building on Saturday A Clemson team that only has one loss in ACC play great basketball And Brad Brownell has tremendous depth with that group And so a challenge lies ahead for the Blue Devils on Saturday at noon in the next two Saturdays the Clemson game you mentioned and then a little out of conference John with Michigan next Saturday 630 and the Saturday after that Virginia Yes So again once when you get after the Super Bowl the second half of the season for the Blue Devils is always going to be strenuous The Saturday after that by the way is North Carolina and then the Saturday after that maybe the ACC championship Caleb Foster driving and he got fouled with four and a half to shoot Well tomorrow night in the SEC a Florida team that went toetotoe with Duke at Cameron this year lost by just one is playing its best basketball of the season The defending champs go to Athens to take on Georgia followed by Tennessee and Mississippi State And dont look now another elite freshman starting to come into his own Nate Ament from Virginia by the way getting the job done Three straight 20point games for Nate in SEC play Boozer hard charging in for another and one possibility Cameron Boozer with 16 and a chance for 17 at the line But this is what makes him a cheat code This is unfair At 69 250 lbs the ability to handle the basketball and go past guards And once he gets into the painted area with that physicality theres nothing you can do about it 169 of four Did have four turnovers for a second straight game but 36 minutes played May I ask you do you know who the alltime leader in turnovers is in NBA history Apparently you dont I mean Im just going to go guess based off of total minutes played Is it LeBron It would be LeBron James And when you have a high usage rate as does LeBron as does Cameron Boozer youre going to have turnovers Theyre going to be games where you have turnovers But more importantly when youre making positive plays more more positive plays than negative plays coaches trust you with the basketball Youre what fourth fifth on that list Uh no not quite and and not and its only because of the minutes played not because of my turnover rate because that was high Final minute of the game Scott Padpelt is coming up Scott is watching this final minute attentively and I know that not just to see if were going to talk about Andrew Kitridge Foster has it knocked away Heres Sar That three is short and Boozer will save it to Foster applause and cheering Duke seven for its last nine Pit has not hit a field goal in the last four And that rebound will go to Boozer which gives him his 13th double double of the season Foster has been the man tonight That ones way too strong cheering Heres Witherspoon Im just asking out loud has Scott Vanpelt ever started the show laughter with a bad beat that immediately preceded his sports center He said big mans in the building Thats my guy Steve So Im sure it will come up Duke wins by 16 here in Pittsburgh Not necessarily pretty but John Sh didnt think it
