A Florida State team that went 17 music and 15 8 and 12 in the ACC Leonard Hamilton a legendary career gives way to the fresh face Luke LS Alorn State has the ball in purple moving left to right on your ski Early on the attack its Davian Williams He pulls back fires the three in and out no good Rebound It is Robert McCrae the fifth Starting lineup for Florida State is an alley hoop to Alex Steen gets us started Hes in the lineup McCrae to Ste McGee Jones and Wiggins A lot of experience on the court for Florida State A lot of veteran transfers and what you would expect from Steen running the floor sucking it down getting it over the top for McCrae Great pass by the veterans working together Aria Mashudi Jacob Ryan Hower our entire crew here on opening night college basketball Welcome back Bump fake into the corner Three ball launched Corner three Yes sir That is Davian Williams 27 last year Hes got the capability to shoot it but were going to see a lot of threes shot tonight But with Luke LS wanting to get 33 up with his team a night on average were going to see some threes flying McCrae to Wiggins midrange attacks floats it high off the glass and off to the left Rebound collected by the Braves Williams Jones Roberts Woodard and McDaniels cheering Im not shocked to see some jitters sort of for Florida State Its a new situation Everybodys in a new gym cheering But Steen the veteran right there making a play wrapping it up Seminal team that wants to run Green light Wiggins back iron No good Offensive rebound McGee and he throw it into the back court Its going to be a turnover either way McCrae lets it go out Early action three2 Alhorn State out of the swack Theyve made six NCAA tournaments the last coming in 2002 Theyve been Swack regular season champions in 2022 and 2023 Kobe McGee the sniper was trying to be a team player and get that ball up to McCrae in the back court but he kind of overshot his man and threw it back there and got the turnover A near five second count but the Braves able to get it in Williams from Vixsburg Mississippi Averageaged six points a game last season Retrieves the ball Guarded by Wiggins low post to Woodard Three on the clock Two Woodards got to get something up One attacks and count it off the glass He drops it in And Alorn State an early threepoint lead The Braves are not intimidated going in strong not thinking twice about putting that ball on the floor and attacking the the rim Talking to Coach Morton earlier today he said he felt like there were opportunities at the rim for his Braves team against this seminal defense McGee firing and were tied Threepoint shot is good for Aobe McGee The transfer from Drexel a lethal sniper Laps is talking about he wants pressure put on the defense So theyve got to make a decision whether to leave one of his shooters or stop the ball A foul called here early on Officiating crew is Ron Groover Mark Schneer and Claire Aubrey Shes there on your screen Foul on Florida States Robert McCrae wearing number six Mure take it Sher taking it out of bounds right here He officiated in Luke Gls first game in Jacksonville back in 2008 Early substitution Martin Somerville the transfer from UMass Lel Hes into the game the American East Rookie of the Year one season ago A sophomore who can line it up Nolles and Braves tied at five early in Tallahassee on the debut of Luke LS as a college head coach Turnaround jumper Oh baby Nick Woodard Woodard is not intimidated Hes putting it up soon as he gets it And so is Somerville Martin Somerville tickles the twine He rips a three from that right wing And Somerville who shot over 40 from beyond the arc last season has Florida stayed ahead by one Coach was talking about his game and how hes hes got a lot of confidence Hes a leader verbally and just loves to be out in front and talking about being out in front McDaniels Tyson McDaniels the junior transfer who began his career in the Jo ranks Played at Alorn State one year ago wasnt used much The Braves are back on top by one Lot of buckets They continue to pour in Wiggins from the right block and the Nles back on top McCrae did a good job bringing the defense to him Threw the pass right over the top Could have lobbed that thing up for Wiggins and dunk it but he got it to him successfully Travis Roberts air balls offensive rebound but he stepped out of bounds That was McDaniels A lot of action early It will be a frenetic pace and that is the way Florida State prefers to play it They played Alabama in an exhibition game to begin the year Both teams scoring over 100 points but Luke Locks wanted to play Nate Oats squad whos known for having the top tempo in college basketball year in and year out That was a wise move cuz he wanted his guy to see where hes trying to get to with his tempo and pace and physical conditioning How about McCrae scoops the ball with the off hand and the Siminals extend that lead to three McCraes a phenomenal penetrator and can really make decisions at the rim when he gets inside whether to kick it out or not Hes unselfish for a guy that can score so well Woodard jab step fires off to the right No good Wiggins cleans the glass He can rebound the ball The transfer from Clemson will push The Nles will allow everybody on the court to push the ball forward Wiggins quick trigger three off to the right Rebound clean by the Braves Speaking of quick trigger L said yesterday when I was meeting with him after practice they want to get the ball up in 8 seconds on the clock in right there 8 seconds Wouldnt even 8 seconds Alorn State playing the same frenetic pace Ara Davian Williams All three of those The Braves are two for three from beyond the arc Alorn State coming a play 1212 We are in a media timeout zone Wiggins uses his body block shot Foul called McDaniels guilty And Wiggins will be at the line when we return Oh boy F but forced him to be prepared So thats why he feels so prepared and he said hes such a mentor for him and a leader And if anybody questioned Luke Clauss recruitment you saw his lovely bride Stevie LS in that photo Luke knows what hes doing He can pick players Well he told us before the game he said I probably will be a little emotional Im not nervous but seeing my wife Stevie and my kids my entire family being here it will be a little bit different than stepping on the court for the first time as a player He said I I recall we scored only about 50 points against JU in my season opener as a player I sure hope we have more points than that here tonight He was joking But Coach Ls thankful to be in Tallahassee He has been everywhere at football games on sorority row fraternity row trying to get the students engaged Absolutely Last night after they had their team meal they were out had the players had his starters out with him recruiting the girls at the sororities to come by and support the team tonight You got to love a guy that wants to engage the students and thats what it is A new era and a new time on Florida States campus where you got a new guy in the in the mix Young guy with Steen right there getting caught for that foul on the penetration That was Shane Lancaster with the A and one So were tied and 14 Wiggins did hit both of his free throws on the other end And thats one of music the things Steens going to have to shift from because hes a the former division 2 player last year Phenomenal kid with a big time resume But Steen has got to the simple thing you talk about down low is help over not up And he helped up He took a step towards the defender which caused the collision and gave him the and one opportunity And Lancaster the junior from Bowie Maryland who Jake Morton called a tremendous leader Said hes got all the intangibles has given the Braves the early lead Coach Mortons from Maryland in the DC area and there tons of hoopers from up there and you hes going to recruit that base We saw last night in the swack bthoon gave Auburn everything they could handle and more taking the Tigers to overtime The swack whos got some talent at that level The seminals played FAMU in an exhibition game and the swack as Tomas Bang cant connect How about Ste Count it and one He will have the hoop and the harm Steen will go to the line for one more Mr Hustle The penetration here by the young Frenchman couldnt quite finish but Steen stays tall with the ball And you know you got to just keep that ball up high Thats a big time move for a guy at this level not to bring it down He didnt corral it and bring it down Let the defense come to him and he got the foul Stain twotime conference defensive player of the year at Florida Southern the D2 level Averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds one year ago He had over 70 schools interested in having him And Mr Christine chooses Tallahassee and the Nullles are thankful You know hes hes a lot like the D2 transfers And here as you see theyre getting this 221 zone Thats what theyre going to do that a lot especially on free throws A 10second call I believe So itll be a turnover Florida States press works Its a violation I hear some students booing Lets get back to Steam The the D2 transfer thing is really working You saw recently with Isaac McNeely at Virginia had a lot of success bringing that perimeter game in place it And last year Auburn going to the Final Four with the Alabama Huntsville transfer and Cheney Johnson And I think you can get a little bit that out of steam as a big boy down low that can make things happen Miles baseline fouleds It will be on number one J Morris the junior And the NL will take it underneath the baseline on Steen How does that help this Florida State team and what they want to do this year Well hes a veteran right So hes had success I dont care you know its when youre recruiting kids you want winners Kids that have won championships kids that have won trophies and and cut and collected hardware like Luke Clauss did in 2012 you know and so thats what he brings to this team is a championship winning CALIBER MINDSET TERRIFIC FEED AND A JAM Tomas Bassog and one you know its hard right now and thats a big time play Good look with that inbounds pass But when you talk about Alcorn State situation they have no idea what the out of bound under plays are And right there just a good clean pass Bant just going up strong playing through the contact and just hanging on the rim baby You got to love it Number 12 Hamilton with the foul right there He Hes got to stay tall You know kids kind of bend over He came over with his hands If hed have kept his hands straight up he may not have got the foul Bong off to the left on the free throw Something Florida State practices a lot You and I had some chances to go to practice Luke LS made him run for every miss Fullcourt gassers He said Look misses have consequences Nolles by four Shot blocked by Steve Offensive rebound collected by the Braves Pass picked off Here comes Miles Showtime Cam Miles SLAMS IT HOME TIME OUT All of State Jake Morton seen enough He wants to slow this thing down but hes had some quick fouls quick run outs turnovers just what you need Well its a 70 run for Florida music State They lead by six And then all defense to offense And it all starts on defense with Steen the music transfer staying tall blocking that shot and then just shooting the gap in the open floor and taking it home for basketball and Luke LS taking over for Leonard Hamilton the legend Coach Ham and Coach Jones who built the foundation for Florida State here over 23 years A phenomenal job paved the path Another defensive pressure leading to a turnover by this Nulls defense That is turnover number four for Alorn State The pressure the chaotic pace that LS wants to play with with his team is whats going to cause turnovers And this especially in this game for Alorn State they havent played at this pace yet Late whistle and a foul as Le Jones Jones will go to the line for three Jones number 10 on your screen is the transfer from St Bonaventure out of the Atlantic 10 And hes a shooter Hes a winner Hes a tough guy I was talking to assistant head coach and general manager Michael Fly about him on Sunday and hes like a because Michael Fly was at Jacksonville and hes familiar with the area and and Le Jay Jones is from Neptune Beach and you know hes a local kid over there Fletcher High School He gets to come back and finish his career 2 and a half hours from the house You know thats a pretty special time It is indeed and he brings that experience right shooting ability He has shown in the scrimmages and the exhibitions that hes got great offensive game as he knocks down the second of three free throws He had 15 against Alabama in what would be an unofficial seminal debut but he scores from all three levels Absolutely And and the ultimate level that Louch loves is 40 from three last year And thats whats key to this team is getting those threes up and getting it done But yes he can put it on the floor And you know you mentioned it the MVP of the National Junior College Tournament That doesnt happen every day So Jay played at Barton Another 10second violation The nulls defense the pressing and the trapping cheering Luke Laps told us him and Michael Fly whos been in charge of putting in defensive principles and assistant coach They want to create havoc on opposing offenses Exactly He said it He goes Eventually its going to look reckless right now and its going to feel reckless to the fans and to the players as they learn to play at this pace but eventually reckless will become normal Especially thats his goal once he gets to the Duke game and the Carolina game that are coming up early on in the ACC season N0 run for Florida State over the last minute Back door cut Bog No but hes fouled and the Frenchman headed to the line What a feed from Steve Oh you got to love hes cutting to the rim strong and hard for a freshman You know hes overtime elite last year He comes off that screen and just attacks and you cant catch up with him Theres no helpside defense there to slow it down And so hes going to the rim If the help side comes theyve got a shooter over here waiting to shoot a duck on the pond from deep Nles want to play with pace and they want to create space for spacing All he believes everybody on the roster can shoot the three ball Theyve got the opportunity and the ability to make teams have to think about it when you have to honor it And thats the thing where he his thing is at the rim you know pay play at pace pay play frenetically go till they stop you and then spray it out as he says or kick it out or penetrate and pitch whatever you want to call it Attack the rim and swing the ball back out if the defense closes Bang knocks both free throws down A member of the French Youth National Team this summer He played in the FIA19 World Cup in Switzerland for France Of course the French coming in second in the Olympics A near backcourt violation How about this seminal defense causing a lot of chaos Oh a cheap foul He got steamed Didnt get his feet there quite fast enough Got to let him go sometimes Thats thats like kind of a young mistake right now You got a lot of energy You got plenty of guys on the bench Thats his second foul So hes probably going to sit down for a little while especially since hes got such a deep roster He leads Florida State with five points in the early going Has pulled down a rebound as well but hes got those two fouls Got the other the other returner coming in Ara Maluke whos as we watched in practice hes improved his jump shot since last year He came up to us as a turnover forced Did it touch the out of bounds line It did on the sideline Its Florida States ball So another turnover but Aar Malu comes up to us and goes I cant wait for the world to find out how well I can shoot the basketball Absolutely And thats where he is Hes come a long ways Last year he shot 55 but everything he did was at the rim or kind of like a five or 10 foot window there in the paint but this year he can pull it from deep if he wants to Robert McCrae the veteran the senior has the basketball hands it off to Jones Jones swings it around Basson High post midrange kick out Jones three off to the right left and short Rebound collected by the Braves and Nick Woodard Alorn State wants to run Funy with the basket Vault is Williams Nullles areounding on defense Switching everything Baseline drive looking for the extra pass Feed high off the glass No Rebound collected by Bassog Nullles want to push Here comes McCrae on that right side Crossover dribble Nice pass to Maloo turns high off the glass Count it McCrae brought that defense in Brought that defense in with McCraes penetration and Maloop just stepped off short corner waiting on that pass and got another foul with a trap That is the fourth foul on Florida State for hustle And thats what hes got with these kids like Kobe McGee especially 44 threepoint shooter He is an absolute shooter from deep Home fake cheering deep three left and short 15 on the clock Collected there underneath the basket by Williams And the Braves will reset Here is the sophomore Florida State working on a switch Jones picks him up 21 Firing block shot Nulls can run Fed up court Malook Yuro high off the glass Oh he missed it Bong attacks through some trees Cant get it to go Rebound Jones He picks up the loose ball Crosscourt pass and the nose will reset Never mind McCrae fires the three Yes sir Catch him sleeping Hey if youre open and you got to look with Luke LS you can shoot it But you cant give it to the big fellow in the open floor There was one more pass that should have been given up that then they could have lobbed it to Malute Giving Maloo the ball at half court Its a turnover waiting to happen with any big man Robert McCrae twotime a first team member at JU just west excuse me east on I 10 to Jacksonville Floater counted Thats a nice play there by Woodter How about that And Jake Morton said hes one of the most consistent performers weve got He really feels like the Braves will have to lean on him in swack play this year as they foul a handshake call The pitch from Cubby McGee and McCrae just doesnt even think twice about it Woodards right there closing out on him and just look how he rises up Hes a shooter first Hes running the point but hes really a shooter and a scorer Hes showing you right there McCrae is what he can do with the ball in his hand He showed well against Alabama and FloridaM 21 points per game nearly in those two games when you average them A careerhigh at JU was against Stson a couple of years ago He had 36 of them Luke LS telling us hes a beer scorer and hes become such a good facilitator for his teammates in his college career The Columbia South Carolina native can absolutely sky So at some point to see him launch and go up for a dunk Expect that in these games this year if youre watching Florida State cuz he can get up for his size and just shock you He had 26 against Alabama as he knocks down the free throw in the first exhibition and a seminal team that surprised a lot of folks nationally with the way they played in that game They put a ton of pressure and led Alabama by nearly double digits late in the second half They were right there you know and and and speaking of McCrae he gets to the free throw line This is what he does Hes nine of 13 in that game in Alabama Eight of 16 from the floor Luke L said theyd have to lean on him a little bit and the leadership is the null We are close to forcing a ton of 10second violations here The Braves a couple times have just gotten it over with one or two seconds left You can see the chaos causing the spinning of the minds of the Alorn State Braves They foul away from the ball Two hands on a perimeter player youre going to get that foul every time And McCrae right there picking up another one And its just so natural especially early in the season to put your hands on them because thats what youre doing in practice Youre playing aggressive in practice every day So its hard to break that in the game And they will leave McCrae out there Coach L was telling us earlier this week that hes going to trust some of his guys right to play with two fouls He said Ill have to feel it out Some guys I got to take off some guys I got to leave on As a three ball is cans there by number 30 Travis Roberts the senior You know and a neat story on that one is Jake Morton signed him at Jacksonville State originally and then got him through the transfer portal to bring him at Alorn State Its an 11point advantage for the NOS McCree working there against Morris Crosscourt pass McGee fires away from three and connects Thats what he specializes in area when his feet are set and hes got a clean look at the rim Its one of those he makes you think of like a JJ Reic guy from deep cuz he can just drain that ball once he shoots it Third team all Colonial Conference at Drexel where he averaged 14 points per game a year ago He was third in the Colonial in threepoint shots made last year Another turnover forced that being McGee who is having those prolific numbers from beyond the arc seminal team Now though Jacob has forced eight turnovers here in the first half Excuse me seven turnovers as I look to my stats Theyve only committed one turnover themsel and thats thats a good number and thats whats going to make coach wild because he was concerned about turning the ball over just from a perspective of you want to limit them in A DEEP SET feet launch deep Are you boom baby Is that NBA range Has Luke Lock seen that a time or two Yes hes been watching that for quite a few years now and hes not afraid to let his guys shoot from that deep when they practice and practice every day Kobe McGees in the gym 247 it seems like Threw some contact Tipped up No good Offensive rebound Alorn State Kick out Three ball Thats good Its Nick Woodard who buries it from the right wing and Woodard Hes got six points Stats update Hes got nine Hes made four field goals That is his first three Hes got two rebounds as well Alorn State shooting it well from beyond the arc early Four at from seven Oh baby Le Jones a hammer on a Tuesday night in Tallahassee Hey heads up Stop penetration if you dont stop the penetration Leg Jones is coming to the rim Highlight from Jones streaking down the middle of that lane 3923 Under eight to play in the first half at the low block Shot is up A foul called going to go against Jones working against thats Woodard who looks to be a little shaken up but the seminals bringing the fireworks early here in tally turns it down goes down the middle and just rises up over the defense to flush it on down Hey also hes got some great experience working for coach Schwarz at East Carolina and Ray Harper at Western Kentucky He worked for Hath at Miami but he was on Coach Hams team from 2000 to 2018 at at 2002 at Miami as the point guard and he was a pretty good little point guard He was telling us taking the job over He said Look its another can of worms being a head coach Hes trying to figure out the NIL space trying to figure out how to put a roster together He said I had to sift through what we had Guys want to get into the portal Im adding people late in the game to my roster He said Were going to learn throughout the first couple of weeks before Swack played He said What a juggernaut were going up against in our first one Oh he he told me he said If I had known I was have to play this pace of game I dont know if I would schedule this game because its so different than what you play against And thats what coach L is trying to do Long rebounds Braves Swinton with the block HE PINS IT AGAINST THE BACKBOARD NULLS now on a return in transition Steen crosscourt pass deflected but its picked up by McGee Pace stays high Somerville kick to the corner Swinton tries again Three ball That one off to the left back iron and its cleaned up by Woodard I like that aggressive offensive rebounding by Florida State but also great box outs by Alorn State Its a battle down low Its been a battle here tonight Another foul called Is that one offensive It is Well two different refs have two different calls Swinton comes out of nowhere and he just got such a leaping ability to go up with both arms and not make contact and slaps that thing off the glass and Steen wraps it up and pushes it So great job defensively there from Swinton but a foul called on actually Florida State Two different officials One called offensive foul to illegal screen The other called the foul on the NLES In the end it goes against Chanty Wiggins And now the Braves are in the bonus And they will be for the next 6 minutes and 45 seconds until halftime One and one Rattles out No goo Rebound Swinton One of the returners from last seasons team for Florida State Swinton from Cabin John Maryland 66 A lot of length athleticism Shot over 35 from beyond the arc one year ago WHAT A PASS DEAN FLUSHES OH its McCrae to Ste and the Nullles are hyped Court vision is what you have right there going through the defense McCrae but Steen doing what you got to do Staying right there in the attack zone short corner and was great pass Steen leads excuse me second on the team in points with seven McGee leads Florida State with nine points Its a 17point advantage cheering Active hands from FSU Trapping and switching feed to the interior torquing his body connecting J Morris soft touch and just laid it in It was a tough break with the defense right there over there trapping in the corner and no one was there to help on the weak side Wiggins calls his own number for three Left it strong Florida State now five of 11 from beyond the arc Shooting it well though 45 Luke Ls telling us they would like to attempt at least 32 threes per game because last year that was the top mark for attempts by UNF who led the country Contested jumper good defense cleaned by Steve I call them the Osprey games last year and they would just fogg it from everywhere Wiggins talk about coming from everywhere Wiggins down the middle What a finish Another timeout taken by coach Morton and Alorn State Its a Florida State team now riding high Theyve got the fans up on their feet and the defense again leading to offense Such court vision once again McCrae showing us throws it over the defense Wiggins baby up strong Just doesnt it the one power dribble strong finish Not trying to do too much Just what you want to see Eight assists already for McCrae coming in with that opening night You got to love that out of your guy thats running the point for you If hes got that vision going youre going to have a pretty good year LS is over here talking to him about keep doing what youre doing Keep the pressure up You know were doing what we want to do Keep attacking You know thats what hes working Hes got to be happy with what hes seeing And Coach Mortons over here just trying to get his guys to settle down Well Luke has to be excited about getting Robert McCrae the fifth here in Tallahass He averaged music five assists per game last year for JU Hes got eight of them already in the first half He got like a young Chris Paul on the court for the Siminals but a lefty version Hes from South Carolina And BJ Mackey from his hometown Another phenomenal player The same similar skill set Uh but but theyre both big time athletes for guards Good ball movement for the Braves Pump fake leads to an open shot from beyond the arc Too strong Rebound Thats McCrae Hes got it Hes going to push one on three McCrae dribbled it and it is off his own leg Out of bounds Off to the races with three guys in front of him He could have turned that out and left it cuz he had two more nles running right behind him Under five minutes to play in this first half Theres been plenty of action Nolles press the Braves able to beat it and now theyre going to pull it back out Morris and Alorn State will get into their offensive set Another foul calleds And we figured early on in the season this would be something that happens in college basketball If you watched opening day yesterday there were a ton of fouls and a ton of free throws There have been some different rules added this year freedom of movement type of rules that have gone into place and youre seeing teams trying to adjust early on Expect a lot of whistles early in the season especially for sure And youve got these officials Arya that theyre just trying to to to to enforce what theyve been told and emphasize They have meetings before the game They get they get directions from their supervisors of what is important and what they need to key in on And you always see the new rules this early in the season theyre going to be called and and youre gonna theyre gonna try to train you in the middle of the game Well Florida State and Alabama in that scrimmage in Birmingham combined for something like over 70 free throws between the two schools And thats one of the hardest things We mentioned it earlier in the broadcast is youre going against each other in practice Youre basically fouling each other in practice and your coaches arent really calling the fouls because they want you to play hard and so you got to reel that back in and not foul during the game McCrae using the right side of the lane The NLES are in the bonus as well And the foul called on the Braves So the Nles will go to the line for two Actually it will be a one and one as thats only the eighth team foul on the Braves It will go against Lancaster So McCrae will go and try and earn the bonus Robert McCrae last year against Queens in a game attempted 14 free throws connecting on 11 of them And like Jacob said he can really get downhill in a hurry cheering as hes got one more and has the ability to put pressure on a lot of opposing defenses at the rim And that with his athleticism is what makes that pressure even more of a problem for his opponents because hes got the ability to elevate and finish over bigger stronger taller athletes down low And hes not intimidated to go at you and try to go right through your chest Hes now got eight points eight assists in the first half McCrae who began his career in the ACC at Wake Forest Florida State 4528 They lead Alorn State here in this opener The Nolles will actually play two swack teams to tip off the season They play Alabama State on Friday night right back here at the Tucker Center Jake Vana will have the call And its its something you really want to do as a new coach because you want to get your guys some reps against teams that you your talent level may be a little higher You know it gets you some sort of comfort level The trap there able to relieve that pressure LANCASTER ATTACKS SHOT BLOCKED OH foul called on Somerville before the block Boy Maloo came flying from the weak side Hey you know in games like this everybodys trying to get their block shot and Somerville runs past him Kind of could have done a better close out and he wouldnt have got the penetration Hes got to slow down and tall up in front Thats what coach Clouts sitting there You can see him with his hands Hes telling him close out on him Dont run up on him Thats a thats kind of a rookie mistake at this level Uh and I know hes a hes coming from UMass L but the ACC is not UMass L Lancaster misses the first one Have one more Lancaster who began his career at Niagara cheering actually came to the state of Florida for junior college basketball played at Miami Dade He was a 35 threepoint shooter a couple of years ago Was a McDonalds AllAmerican nominee when he was in high school at St Johns College High in Washington DC And coach Morton was saying he need big things from him this season Wiggins three ball Thats big And the null is looking for big things from Chony Wiggins The Clemson the Clemson transfer here in his senior year Hes been on some winning teams at Clemson A contributor on teams that have made it deep into the NCAA tournament Active hands for Miles Bong dives on it looking for a teammate Gets it to Maloo Nulls want to run Miles sticks waits and connects Nice patience from the freshman They really like Cam Miles Cam Miles played against some bigtime competition out in Arizona and hes not new to him to to be against high level athletes Luke LS telling us he brings some swagger and attitude to this Florida State team Another foul on the NLES That is the 10th of the first half but its all Florida State early on opening night here in Tallahassee Well be right back on two years at JU Twotime a son first team performer Jake what have you liked most about the way he has operated Florida States offense in the tempo that Luke LS wants His unselfishness jumps off first Nine assist to one turnover His shot selection Hes two for two from the floor one for one from three from threepoint line three of four from the free throw line Hes just a consmate leader in what you want somebody with a transfer Thats what they got out of him And people forget he spent two years at Wake Forest played half the season and then red shirted before he transferred to Jacksonville He is an ACC caliber athlete Nice feet inside Steed shot blocked from behind McDaniels rising high to get it 19point advantage for the NLES Kick to the corner Three ball launched and connected Oh that was pure from Shane Lancaster A good close out by Somerville too Didnt phase Lancaster Under three to play in the half Florida State looking for a strong finish And talk about the middle eight in basketball Final four minutes of the half First four minutes of the second half Not a good sequence for the Nolles as a jam Thats a terrific sequence there for McDaniels Coach said he was the best leaper on the team and he just showed us with that little windmill dunk Tyson McDaniels the junior from Columbus Georgia Under threehour drive from Tallahassee to get to Columbus Sure hes got some family and friends Im with you right there Im looking over there trying to see whos cheering for him right now Miles through the contact and he lays it in Oh if you blink youll miss him Cam Miles really brings an attitude to this Florida State team as just a freshman from Chicago Thats how they play in Chicago isnt it Youre right about that They they call him at 62 He doesnt look that tall But just like that threes are getting fired up from everywhere here Arya How about this Braves team Fearless And another three from Lancaster Got a couple here in the last few moments When you close out you got to close out beside the shooter You cant Thats a Thats a young freshman mistake Flying straight at your shooter to contest it You want to fly right by him and wave at it You intimidate him with the pressure of flying by You cant run into a shooter screaming That is on Bong his first teams 11th of the first half but hes young and coach Lax thats what you see him right there in the corner of the screen Hes coaching him up right now Thats what he does in practice He is a players coach and he is all about the relationship and the relationship allows Le Jones to pull from threepoint land There he connects The NLES now six of 12 and as the stats update now seven of 13 from beyond the arc Its a Siminals team that wants to shoot the three ball hoping to nearly double their attempts from one year ago 5539 turnover traveling violation That is the ninth turnover of the first half for Jake Mortons Braves Pressure makes you make bad decisions and thats why you pressure people to speed them up and make them do something they dont want to do and they kind of get nervous and hence you get the walk right there and thats thats a a check box for Luke L and his squad McGee straight away three off to the left rebound collected there violently from McDaniels Hes going to push Big step he lays it in off hand That was pretty How about the talent from Tyson McDaniels timeout takqucoin Davis against Miami when he had 10 back on January 8th and youve got nine right now in the first half by Robert McCrae Its not like hes going to quit passing the ball Wiggins straightaway three Its pure Oh Chanty Wiggins can let it fly Hes got 12 Hes in the double figures to lead all scorers and Florida State pushing nearly 60 points in the first half But ultimately what you love as a coach is to draw your play up and your kids to run it properly coming out of that time That was a really good action to get that open look for Wiggins Final moments of this first half maybe one possession for both teams Three ball counted Oh that is nice That is number 30 And Travis Roberts has shown pretty well here in this opening stanza And a good close out by Cody McGee He flew right by him Did what you want him to do but just just such the poise from Roberts to sit there and just drain that three How about Alorn State on pace for almost 90 in this game The Simol team who will try and run this shot clock down as much as they can There is some time difference Wiggins fires a three straight away No long rebound Miles five with four Hes fouled with 44 on the clock And that should be free throws It is Its a one and one as that is the ninth team foul for the Braves About 20 total fouls in this first half Whistles Well theres a lot of a lot of activity on defense right And and the way Florida State plays they keep the pressure coming So youre going to get the fouls that theres no way around that But then the pace and the attacking from both at the rim is getting us a lot of fouls Miles not going to get the bonus Theres some time left Half court heave in the air off to the right and an entertaining first uh at pit Adrien Autry at Cuse as well And so youve got this brotherhood of ACC guards and ACC players coming back to their alma modders or at least in the league coaching here over the last few years And thats because theyve got experience at this level They feel like they can help And its a its a age group where these guys are Theyre at that age now cuz theyve already played that theyre ready to lead these squads into this new era of NIL basketball Nice pass from McCrae Collapsed two defenders and he fed it to Sting for the bucket You can just see McCrae his entire skill set on display So crafty the veteran 6244 Florida State leading by 16 points early going on the turn The shot It will rattle home for Woodard Hes looked really good Hes got 12 points in this game That leads Alorn State The teams trade buckets Wiggins He attacks off the glass the hoop and the heart And Wiggins to the line for the and one That is not what Jake Morton wants to see but its definitely something Luke L wants to see first possession here attacking like that and getting that foul But its smart He just rips it and attacks You better move your feet defense cuz those guys are going after the rim And Wiggins nice soft banks shot off the glass We talked about his experience earlier at Clemson He brought a lot to that squad They went to the lead eight You know he was a key contributor up there And its ACC experience for coach L Hes got 15 points on his seminal debut officially Wiggins that Clemson team last year 182 in the ACC They got upset by MC State in that first round as the trap comes from Florida State The Braves break it This will lead to some chaos there for the Nullles defense They get away with it on the missed short shot JONES OH he nearly blew the roof off the building Now he shoots from three Why not Right in the corner with his teammates He gave him a pump fake like Are you going to do something about it And they just watched him and he just said Pull that thing right in their eye Woo Baby shoot it JRod I thought you and I were going to be on YouTube for the next couple years I was going to come unglued I was about to jump over the table and high five somebody 20point lead for the NLES and Lay now with 10 Hes in double figures Florida States got two players in double figures and a few more who are inching and creeping towards it Ive enjoyed watching McDaniels play here today He sticks with that one and he lays it in High energy from McDaniels Hes done a lot for the Braves Steve able to lay it in And you know what youre going to see happen here in the second half is the conditioning of Florida State is at next level where Alorn State is Alorn State has not had to push the ball in practice They hadnt got these many reps Turnover there for Alorn State Quick correction by me That was McCrae who had the layup not steam Nulls lead by 20 How about Jay Jones here Hey its a really fancy good missed highlight reel right there But then he just says I got your highlight right here in the corner Boom Deep The teammates fired up Got the bow and arrows out Like Im watching watching archery over there Wiggins back to the line there on the foul That is on number seven Woodard That is his second foul Two different three different players have two fouls for the Braves One has three Thats Amari Hamilton Foul trouble for Florida State McCrae does have three personals and two fouls a piece for Jones and Steam Heres Wiggins Triggers knocks down the first one the senior from Atlanta who actually scored 22 points against Florida State in two meetings last year for Brad Brownells squad His careerhigh is 19 back in 2023 for the Memphis Tigers Hes pushing that here Hes got 16 with one more free throw on this trip You mentioned that Elite Eight as he connects there and has 17 What does that experience do for Florida State Well you know its we talked about it earlier about winning championships and collecting hardware and collecting rebounds for McCrae But its like you want a guy on your team thats been there and done that And thats what he brings to you Hes talked about it He can talk to his teammates about it Long rebound there for Jones Got caught in no mans land and bailed out by the foul on Jeremy Ellis And Ellis couldnt believe it But both guys went up I think both a little prematurely didnt know what they wanted to do And Jones will take it I dont think Jones was expecting Ellis to jump that high And and Ellis is such a long athlete And thats something Jake Morton told us about was how long and lanky and athletic Ellis was And so contest there and its it just looked funny So something had to be wrong Somerville lets it fly Nothing at the bottom of the net Nothing funny about Somerville right now I dont mean to step on you Im rusty You know its early No problem at all Somevilles got a couple of threes And the Seminals now in the double figures double digits on threes 10 of 19 for FSU That ball deflected out Its a 130 run for the Seinals as we take another look Its that step ball fake one dribble step to the side Thats this is a patented move right there for a shooter to clear space and set himself Davian Williams on the attack Long pass to Lancaster A hand check foul on that drive put his hand on put his hand on somebody penetrating Like we talked about earlier theyre going to call these fouls early in the season Once you get deeper into the season in the league in the ACC its a little different situation but now theyre calling everything trying to get everybody in the mindset Near interception for McCrae leads to some open passing and an open jumper And McDaniels knocks it down Tyson has 12 points Tied with Woodard Jones kick Somerville three off to the left Rebound for the Braves and theyll push it forward quickly into the upcourt into the front court there on the attack through contact No staying with the basketball and a kick for a midrange jumper They got nothing but air Pace picking up yet again McGee will let it fly That rims out We expected this from LAS and his Simolles They got the green light to shoot it anytime anywhere This is a good looking shot for Kobe McGee He can make that shot Tell you what JRod you and I are both preparing for NBA games at some point in our careers with this type of pace Really teaches you how to get your calls and your stories in efficiently Thats right These guys are moving Three ball top of the key That ones good Nice looking shot for Davian Williams Hes not intimidated He scored 15 points in a game last season for the Braves against FloridaM Another in town team in the slack Had 13 against OU Wiggins straight away he likes that spot Hes confident He pulls And Wiggins with a new careerhigh 20 points And not just with Florida State but in his career between two schools Both ACC school Talk about highflying Jeremy Ellis We we talked about his contest a minute ago Hes going up to the next level on the elevator folks Just throw it up and let him catch it We asked Coach Morton for adjectives and when we got to Jeremy Ellis he said dunker right I said Oh thats efficient Youre right Wiggins wrapping around creating space Thats pretty Chanty Wiggins he just took Jeremy Ellis to school Wiggins is like Hey hes riding back Hes on my piggyback right here Come on give me a foul But not only can Was shoot threes but he can finish down low too with the contact Chantys got 22 Florida State leads by 23 Williams ball fake hop step pivots You cant do it that way Two feet cant land at the same time If youre going to pivot you got to one land both feet opposite Well its a Simol team under Luke Lox that wants to launch from beyond the arc They want to do it early They want to do it often And thats going to be a change from what Seminal fans are accustomed to The NLES last year attempted just over 19 a game Tonight theyve got already 22 and he wants to get over 30 And we talked about the goal at least 32 a game attempted is what Luke L would like to see He told his team in film review that earlier this week in practice while we were there and theyre on pace and you can tell when they bring it down he wants them shooting in the first eight seconds if they have a good clean look and they are pulling the trigger when they get it and moving the ball freely too and not taking erratic wild shots Hes got to be happy with the 50 mark 11 to 22 from his team He felt like in the exhibitions his team didnt shoot as well as they were capable and he told him that as that move back iron told him in that film review he said look guys were getting clean shots were getting open looks you got to make them as Bong on the attack hes fouled aggressive drive to the rim for the Frenchman Tomas Basson and thats what he does hes a athletic he wants to attack hes got to work on his jump shot thats coming along and thats going to take a little bit as a freshman thats not a big setback but he rips it and Hes not afraid to go in there with the contact and its like he couldnt really explode there cuz he got hit down low but thats what he does and hes hes going to bring an asset on that because youre so used to the guy on the perimeter being a shooter and hes ripping it and going right by you So its really confusing for the defense But you know and you talk about this this Alorn State team and you got to be kind of excited if youre Jake Morton where youre at Youve got youre getting to the free throw line is something he want to do but hes in the rebounding battle it right there with Florida State He shouldnt be happy back His assistant turnovers are pretty fair and even Miles is three Thats not going to be there Offensive rebound Somerville Now a tie a ball is loose Braves come away with it Coach Mortons got to be happy about that The guys havent give up And thats what he said He wanted him to compete and run his system He has a system Theyre breaking down the press when they dont turn it over Baseline drive and all Taking his eye off the ball was Roberts Thats a hard move Arya When you drive baseline or when you drive anytime with the ball you rather have a shot or a good look because if you leave your feet with nowhere to go with it its a turnover And and right there we just saw that Roberts was right there waiting on it but my man left his feet and couldnt get it to him in a clean pass Would have been better playing off two feet and trying to draw a foul Yes he should have set himself off of two feet to then go up and make a play versus a floating one jumper flying out of bounds You could turn into a coach Ari I like it Oh Im learning from you Mike Polishing you up Bung three ball He cant connect there That was from the right corner Terrific look A leak out and a dunk That counts I heard the rim rattle Theyll take it I thought Bang was going to block that thing from behind I think Dave Williams would tell us No I dunked it That is indeed what I did Thats a jam 7857 Williams in double figures now with 11 floater No ste stick back blocked a scrum underneath the bucket and Alorn State will have it going the other way Strong move to the basket leads to a foul I like Le Jones right there They talk about how tough he was in practice the other day and he made an aggressive play on the ball to not just foul the guy and let him get an and one He wrapped that thing up doing what you want your guys to do when a guys got a layup If youre going to foul it foul it So 10 points five rebounds for Jones Hes also picked up his third personal foul Theres a nice move to the basket by Lancaster Coach Morton thought itd be an X factor for the team as hes able to stick that free throw there Coach Morton comes in in late April after Landon Busy the former head coach goes to Chicago State cheering after a really nice couple of years for Alorn State for Coach Busy where they won two regular season swack titles And coach Morgan Jake was telling us I call him Jake just from our relationship from last year with him in Tallahassee cuz its a whole new ball game man Its brand new trying to organize trips meeting the needs I told you earlier he talked about NIL is that we dont get any And so I got to work with some businesses in the state of Mississippi to try and find these guys some stuff But hes optimistic about what he can do in the future here for Alorn State A team picked 10th in the preseason swag polls How about Miles Cam Miles in his bag Jab step attack And now theyll reset Williams crossover working against Somerville Picked off Jones into the front court Foul and a smart one from J Morris to stop the break and probably a highlight dunk for Jones Cam Miles and the NLES flying high here on this Tuesday night The young fella putting it on the floor getting by the defense baby high off the glass softly as the pillow between the pros and the college music ranks He said I got to be way more patient He said he had Steph and KD and Klay Thompson who knew the mistakes they were making But Im learning with these guys you got to coach them then recoach them and have some more patience AS JONES DOESNT MISS THAT TIME It doesnt take a lot of patience to watch Jones finish at the rim Woo My goodness LJ Jones A human highlight reel 22 points for Jones First seol since 2018 in a season opener to drop 20 PJ Seavoy in that game in 2018 Nice step back three by Wood Woodard says I see your two with a three Miles dribble drive fade away jumper Miles Oh thats pretty Cam Miles showing you the full display of talent here on his debut Hes got 10 Hes into double figures Four Nullles now into double figures Led by Wiggins with those 22 points Midrange jumper How about that That was impressive Henderson showing you what he can do William Henderson the junior and Jones with an assault at the bucket here just moments ago Just wide open No defense He sees the promised land and takes it to finish it cheering Miles three in the air Too strong Offensive rebound Bang And he sticks it in Cleaned up by Bong And now he has six points Florida State running away with it You wonder if this pace and tempo will start to tire the Braves as they continue They played hard and some individual talent from guys like Tyson McDaniels as that foul will go against Ay Maloop Tell you what the Swax maybe need to be on alert a little bit Dont be too asleep on what Alorn State has under coach Morton in his first season Hey hes handling the pressure of this game and the style that LS has installed with this the squad he has And he and Lukes getting a lot out of what he has You know he said he wanted shooters and athletes and he was conceding not to have a phenomenal big man because its so hard to put a roster together in this NL NIL space without the bank you know so to speak But hes done a good job putting a good roster together to be very competitive with his style of play Morris working against Swinton Stops swings the ball to Williams Two on the shot clock One Williams got to get something up offbalance heave in and a fantastic defensive performance from the nullles there on that possession Defense you know they want to get stops Three stops makes a kill They want to get eight kills in a game Thats kind of the theme now in college basketball is and everyones kind of nicknamed it the same thing Its getting those stops to create what they call a kill stop JONES DIPPING A REVERSE Le Jones how do you do Such a tough kid He goes in there and hes nonchalant every time he makes a play Its like it didnt even happen Hes just getting back on defense And that assist to McCrae as a foul is called Lets take another look at this No look Its just take what they give you Thats what coach Lox is trying to get his kids to do Whatever the defense gives you they give you a baseline drive Go take it And thats a heady move by a veteran to use that protection with his body and up and under and use the rim as protection 13 assists for Mcrite That foul was on Swinton Thats a new careerh high His previous was nine when he was at JU in a game against South Carolina State back in 2024 Shout out good buddy of mine Austin Bezy former manager here at Florida State as well Hes tuned in Hes locked and loaded ready for a new era of siminal basketball as well Oh Im sure hes fired up Hes at a its its you know not everythings going perfect right now in null nation Hes just hes happy to have something that he can report on 8864 the nullles on top of the Braves Timeout taken by Alorn State and were going to step aside as a couple of other NLES are stuck on nine points Its been a good night Theyre going to double them up And this was 13 assists in 21 minutes Thats a key stat for McCrae with impressive man And theyre getting it from everywhere You look at bench points and then holds up 24 of those Robert McCrae theres just been a steadying presence hasnt it Oh yeah And its going to be a committee situation where everyones going to contribute Going to get a different guy kind of stepping up every night because so many guys can score and whoevers got that mismatch on the perimeter is going to get to shoot those threes Under nine to play on this opening night McCrae with those 13 assists McGee on the catch Now McCrae ball fake Swinton calls his own number for three Left it too strong Loose ball rebound breaks McDaniels was wary of the trap was able to dribble hand off to Williams Woodard McDaniels working against McGee Double jab steps kick out quick launch three ball left it short cheering Its good offense Just got to make that shot He got the defense to commit and pitch it to the corner for the open look Swinton terrific feed to Maluke and a reach in foul as Wood just grabbed him Its a great interior pass around the defense Maloop diving to the basket Young fella got to go through that contact He go ahead and get those extra two points Its its kind of frustrating as a coach sometimes youre like dont just accept the foul go through it and get up and strong But Maluks a kid that shot the ball really well last year from the free throw and 71 is really good for a big fella knocks down the first and he had some big starts one year ago as you see some subs for Florida State but Maloo got starts at Duke and Cameron at the JPJ at UVA and you saw flashes of immense athleticism at that size a hustle a tenacity was an elite rim protector for FSU and remember talking to coach Hamilton at a couple of different shootounds last year when I did the Nullles games as he misses the second ball is loose cheering Ill save the story Somerville ball fake lefty trigger You bet And its all key by everyone connected Diving on the floor Alex had a big time season his last year in college at the point guard position for Florida State Thats storytelling at its finest Nulls trap here leads to a turnover Somerville just rips it away Nulls in transition Somerville thought about the three of Wiggins Midrange Jay turns pops ribs out Wiggins isnt passing that bad boy up The night hes having I wouldnt pass it up either Alioop too strong It goes out of bounds But you remember that 2012 ACC tournament run You were a part of it Luke LS hits that shot against Duke in the semifinals The step back Everyone knows about it Earlier that season he has the no look pass to Mike Snare in Cameron for the gamewinning three the shot heard around the world for Florida State fans everywhere He has been a part of some seriously big moments for Leonard Hamilton and Florida States history He has and even going back to like when he was even coming off the bench backing up Derwin Kitchen whos sitting over there an assistant coach on his staff and its like he could had that calmness about him He was never nervous and always just had this ability to be in the moment and not get worried And you can see as he stands on the sideline hes stoic He doesnt have the Darth Vader look of Leonard Hamilton but hes got his own look And right there is his banner he hung up there You know Derwin Kitchens was part of building that as a player also And right beside of that was one of his other assistant coaches Justin Linder His banner with the 2020 team Theres a siminal flavor in there to this staff everywhere Underneath the bucket Shot blocked Oh Sham Mohamd who just entered the game for the first time Number four on your screen the 611 junior from Queens a burrow of NYC of course played at UMass last season Elite rim protector got called for the foul there And then a welltraveled young man too Hes had a couple different schools under his belt but UMass was his last stop and he played against these NLES last year We played against the NLES last year not these NLES cheering but hes a nice addition for his athleticism and his length down low cuz youre going to need that body and what hes got the ability to do in the ACC play and and shoot in a week at Florida Yeah youre going to need him No doubt his fourth stop in college and that has become the norm here in Tallahassee Theres the block Oh they call it goalending Its worth it though He lets everybody see the leaping ability Yeah he just let everybody all the know the fans in the crowd know Im about to block some shots I look over to the siminal bench and Lay Jones had surrender cobra two hands behind his head How about a press here from coach Morton and the Braves that leads to an open three off to the right and Alorn State tiring out You can see the legs starting to fall as this drive McDaniels torques his body Rebound Wiggins The bodies wear you out and and and the and the athleticism wears you out and the quick decisions wear you out and but I do like Jake Morton still coaching and still executing Game has gotten a little sloppy at the frenetic pace over the last few moments Woodard ball fake jump stop hangs Count it and one I tell you what Nick Woodard going to be a force in the swack this season Hey hes another kid from making Georges right up the road Hes excited to be here Hes down there just ball faking in the paint staying settled getting all the nullles up in the air with the ball fake Its a smart play Woodard was at Stonybrook one year ago before that a thousand point scorer at Southwest Tennessee Community College in the JU ranks He was actually a top 40 Jo recruit a few seasons ago Not able to connect there A rare turnover for McCrae and the layup is good Its Morris whos able to convert A little sloppy from Florida State over the last few moments A six run from the Braves Three turnovers for the nullles in the last two minutes Still just seven on the night 9270 Smiles organizing now offensively Jones ball fake doesnt use the screen Reverse layup blocked McDaniels able to pin it against the glass Jones got that shot off on McDaniels earlier McDaniels not letting him get away with it twice And a foul on the drive Itll be away from the bucket but that will be the bonus free throw One and one Seventh foul on FSU What have you noticed over the last two minutes that either Alorn State has done well or a teaching moment that Florida State will have in film review Well Florida States gotten a little out of control Like theyre theyre not playing the same game they were a little bit ago and and Alorn Alcorn State has not given up Jake Morton is still coaching His team is doing a good job and fact this early in the season hes got to be excited with his execution now He doesnt like a result Hes down 22 points but his teams doing what he wants him to do And that was one of the keys he told us for him to feel successful when they got on the bus tonight to leave the gym I think coach Morton will like how his team has at least played 35 minutes or so into the night They 30 since cheering But I appreciate and that just shows you his teamwork uh supporting his guys and coach Pru played with Coach Morton back in high school growing up They grew up together on the hoop circuit Thats a good note there by you Jacob Hey man You know homework opening night man Pace yourself You got some good stuff for Friday for us too A Massudi Jacob Ryden our entire crew Its been a fun night in Tallahassee so far Luke Ls debut as a head coach has the Seminals pushing 100 points here with just under five minutes to play Well see if they can get to the century mark That is a turnover there for the Seinals Its a 70 run from Alorn State but we were a part of some of the film reviews that Florida State had last week as we prepared for this one He said Look if you guys execute the offense you can score dang near 100 or more on anybody Well hes on track and he hes got hes close to his threepoint attempts and theres a lot of time on the clock So these guys are not going to stop shooting it Bong active hand showing you the athleticism coast to coast It was tipped from behind Itll stay with the seminals The young Frenchman The way he shot that gap right there without fouling He never made that full contact Kept his arm in the passing lane and kind of tipped it out so he could go get it Its a good good play You love seeing something like that from a young guy especially in game number one I think one thing that has shown as Bang lays it in on a Oh he missed it That was a terrific pass I just assume hed make it Now Ste hell show you the threepoint stroke Thats too long Offensive rebound Jones and the Siminals reset Now McCrae on the attack Another nice pass He has been a complete distributor Complete control and command It has been Robert McCraes night That is yet another assist for the transfer Hes got 14 of them As a floor general you cant ask for any more Like and hes unselfish And he can give it to the He knows who hes giving it to and where he needs to deliver He knows Stes not above the rim He puts it right in Steams chest so he go up strong Midrange jumper back Steen fouled as the under four media timeout Its been all Florida State here tonight and an FSU team primed for yet another win here on opening night The leadership right here with the penetration and you know Steam doing what hes supposed to do as a big man with the finish Former staffers and support staffers and coaches Michael Fly Chris Kent and Pin Foot He hes let hes left the foundation kind of in place so hes got similar culture and he can bring the new vibe to it with Luke LS the coach here at Florida State Is Luke aware of your talents I dont know like like Lukes a little young to know all my secrets you know but Michael Fly over there hes seen my sketching Hed start laughing if you told him I had a sketch Theyll see it when they watch film Theyll get a chance to talk I like what you were doing there I could really feel the essence of that art on a true Picasso Just need some wine and some cheese and shakurerie board and we really got it Lets go baby I got a few more at the house Got to put it in the Lou It might get stolen there Is that too soon Im not sure yet Thats Tomas Bong They about to get that ball stolen if theyre not careful And Steen with the takeaway Speaking of the French Vang Jones you know what he can do Hes throwing it down with mean intentions His expression is so stoic I love it He just makes big plays and just runs back down the floor to play defense cheering Oh and a hand check there by Basson Ron Ger was letting him play Smart move right there Kind of let the game go But back on Jones he just goes at the rim you know and just just turns around jogs down the floor Just look at that attack twohanded slam Hes a great leader They said he toughest guy on the team I could see it This expression just reeks of toughness He was a Jo AllAmerican back at Barton Community College a Kansasbased Jo And whats cool about that is his dad Jackie was also a junior college allAmerican at Barton Wild isnt it So the Jones family has multiple AllAmericans at the same school And now the fans are happy to have Jones in Tallahassee where he comes after a year at St Bonaventure where he was a true star And he really does have an NBA type game when you look at the three and D Long athletic shoots it at a high clip and has enough offensive skills to be able to play off of that And you you nailed it right there His skill set and his game the smartest move he did was come to the ACC Hes going to get experience Hes going to get exposed And if he delivers hes going to put himself in a position to get paid next year at the next level And check Still getting the checks baby Everybodys working through the rust man Refs players you and I here on the call But you got a veteran crew here and they know to control it Dont dont let the checks get out of control because you let too many hands get going off Next thing you know people knocking each other down And so its a bonus opportunity now for McCrae You know talking to Luke LS he huddled his team today at shootaround And he told him Look were going to be the best condition team in the United States He said Youre not there right now I promise you youre not And you can see that in spurts I think tonight The are still trying to work into game shape And he said there was good shape for normal humans good shape for athletes good shape for basketball players and then good shape for what I need you to be to play at this tempo and at this pace And it may take a month for Florida State to really get their legs under Yes And he wants through all that he wants them to stay efficient patient play at pace play in space Hes got all his little key phrases and hes so smart about Look at this running in practice right there Lukes right there with him Hes like Hey Im not going to ask you to do something I wont do Hes written down the size that he didnt run that fast in 2012 Whats he doing right here in 2025 He finds every avenue to create a mental edge right They miss a free throw and hes talking smack to them as theyre shooting free throws Him and Justin Linder really get into it at these guys If they miss they got to run They have competitions Loser has to run as McCrae into the open court BEHIND THE BACK PASS JAM and thats going to cap off a beautiful night here in Tallahassee Robert Mccraine an artist on the court and feeding the young fella following him Bang right there No better way to get a freshman fired up than to get a good twohand dunk in his first game The century mark for the Seminals here tonight on Luke Laxs debut A taste of whats to come Turnovers into fast break McCrae Jones ARA I WAS THROWING THE PASS FOR HIM AND YOU COULD SEE IT COMING AS theyre running the floor Blocked shot by Ste and hes mean mugging after that one and that rejection How much fun has Robert McCrae the fifth been here tonight Hes got 16 assists the behind the back through that traffic to corral that ball and not really lose balance and then just wraps it up Such a team player with a freshman finishing and then the lob over the top Man thats a beautiful sight to see for a coach A block shot there but a foul on Maluke and Bang was there with him You think the teammates are letting him know hes got 16 assists I bet that young fellow is counting Hes too smart Hes on top of it And thats how he is He tells you hes unselfish Theyve had to tell him to be more aggressive And thats you know the fact that you got to tell one of your best players to step outside the box sometimes thats saying a lot about the character of Robert McCrae the fifth He has been appointment television here tonight Those of you who didnt make it to the tuck you got another chance this week Come watch this team play Alabama State Im telling you if you like the three ball if you like fast pace if you like dunks and you like pressing trapping defenses in the full court and this Florida State team is for you You wont get bored And as coach L said its going to look reckless early but heck he hadnt had a lot of turnovers Hes got to feel good about his recklessness tonight McCrae was looking for assist number 17 I love that he gets to the rim and hes passing up on the shot to try and run that assist number forward You know and hes one of those guys he can make a play when he has to Aloopier Maloop with the absolute twohand jam And a Maloops the kind of guy that can make a play too when he has to But McCrae hes going to keep his team involved and then when he needs to hell take the shot Polling was Williams not there But McCraes a kid too Talking about the next level Hes got to be able to distribute the ball to play at the next level because hes not that tall to be a shooter McCrae will do it himself there That rattles out And he was mad at himself You could see it What a night for McCrae 12 points 16 assists Hes tied the school record for assists in a game And a foul 45 seconds to go And you take McCrae off here and let him get a standing ovation If youre Luke Locks thats about whats about to go down 100 There are fans already on their feet anticipating And I see Jaylen Crawford getting set to check in Tallahassee native from Mcclelay High School son of Adrien Crawford Florida State former Hooper and now radio crew member Well Crawford came in but not for McCrae And Bogs going to gladly take cheering and applause a round of applause the freshman making some big time plays here Getting everybody excited about his his youthfulness cheering Theres a seminal team thats going to move to 3 and 0 all time against Alorn State First meeting since they played back from 2005 where Al Thornton had 31 points that night And Luke LS CRAWFORD THREE COME ON NOW And cheering dad is loving it RIGHT TO MY RIGHT The young fella off the bench Just great penetration and awareness of your teammates to pitch that ball to the young fell off the bench Robert McCrae new program record with 17 assists cheering What a night for Florida State cheering A note that I really loved about FSU coaches and their debuts is you see McCrae a hug from a former point guard himself and an electric night from an electric player who is poised to send Luke Ls to 1 and0 on his debut to join Don LS JK Kennedy Hugh Durham Joe Williams Pat Kennedy Steve Robinson and Coach Hamilton All seminal coaches in the history of the program have won their first game 10876 A Tuesday night they wont forget in Tallahassee Robert McCrae shines Luke LS has his first win in his first game as a seminal head coach And hes got to be happy Arya with what he saw
