two guys from Europe get us started in Dallas tonight Bill Cington Jr ball in the air and away we go Here is Kevin Boopy Miller Hell play with Cory Washington and BJ Edwards and Giron Pierre Here is Miller on the drive Got it knocked away They hit the deck and out of there comes through and a Louisville pickup of an SMU turnover starts the ball game McNeely a three from the front and right away Isaac McNeely too easy in transition Good job playing behind the push up the floor When you run the floor hard ahead of the basketball good things happen on the top of the floor Now three of his last eight from behind the line Hes given the Cards an early lead here Debbie Gigu missed the jumper against Hadler and Conwell whos as dangerous as Brown And we get a whistle stopping play And I believe this has to do with the shot clock I think it reset to 20 and not 30 And heres a look at the SMU lineup We mentioned Miller Edwards Pierre Thats kind of the big three Cory Washington and Yigolu the two bigs if you will for Andy Infield now in season two Both these coaches are secondyear guys at their respective campuses Kelseys got 46 wins Infields got 41 Weve got 10 players on the floor that average in double figures We expect this to be a highf flying game Conwell makes it 5 nothing Look how fast SMU gets the ball to Pierre up the floor Hell scoop it up and in with a right hand Pierre had nine points IN THE FIRST MATCHUP WEST The only time this season he has not been in double figures I expect him to have a big game today He said 20 or more nine times this year Pru has been terrific as of late for Kelsey Heres Brown right back for Sander Pu And thats his first miss in his last 15 shots Debbie hes been very efficient around the rim Three ball off the line for Pierre Good box out by McNeely and it freed Brown to pick it up and he stepped on the end line out of bounds Pat Kelsey 49 years of age from Cincinnati went to Xavier won 75 games at Charleston 186 at Winthre Hes won or tied for the conference regular season title six times in 13 years as a head coach I watched Pat Kelsey at the College of Charleston with 31 wins win with two NAI guy NIA guys a JO guy a D2 guy and an Australian Washington a three He can coach 35th three of the year for Cory Washington from Little Rock Mustangs have tied the game And were a fast two minutes in arent we My goodness Brown And its a moving screen called on Sandanda Fu First on FU Itll be the first on the cards Louisville comes in Theyve won five straight Seven of their last eight Debbie They beat Baylor over in Fort Worth on Saturday by 11 shooting 56 from the floor And they hit eight threes despite not winning the rebound margin or the turnover margin in the game against the Bears And theyve been in Dallas since They spent some time yesterday over at the Mavs workout facility Theyve had a a good time to get themselves together if you will Yep Hadley the rebound of the Eagle miss Cards push it Trying to free McNeely Isaac skips it out Conwell thought about it cheering Look at Hadley getting all the way to the basket Hes going to draw the foul I believe its on Cory Washington Good crew tonight Ron Groover Bill Cington Jr the whistle there and Greg Nixon Its on Cory Washington transfer from Witchah State his first First on SNU and a couple of free throws for Javon Hadley who is 68 on the year Well Pat Kelsey will tell you the more they pass the better their offense is They got a couple of sides and they get great penetration down the lane line Louisville is hitting 77 against the conference Theres Andy Enfield 15th season as a head coach 302 wins He and Pat Kelsey both have gone over 300 here in the last month or so in their coaching careers Looking to take his third team to the NCAA tournament Andy Enfield One time with Florida GF Coast five times at Southern Cal Hadley missed them both And heres Pierre against Javon Hadley spinning on Fu at the post and will draw the foul from Sandanda Fu And that was a concern coming in for Pat Kelsey Its always an issue when youve got 72 at the rim and Pat Kelsey calls him a mountain Now you got to push him up the lane off the block but you cannot give up baseline You got to push him back into help where at least you can contest 21yearold sophomore from Istanbul knocks the free throw down Cement is 54 at the line And with two fouls Sander Fu has to come out and Ali Khalifa will come into the lineup now for Pat Kelsey You better be ready to rebound And the second one from Yigatu bounds away Onepoint lead for the Mustangs and Hadley to work Khalifa excellent passer for a big man Brown very quiet here early Khalifa three back rim miss Pierre the rebound You will only see Khalifa playing in the middle third on the top of the floor He will not roll to the rim He is an excellent facilitator and decision maker Miller going to work against Woodley whos coming into the ball game or Willie rather transfer from Kennesaw State Theres Washington Second field goal for Cory Washington Hes the fourth option and when he plays well SMU is a highflying offensive team Cards have gone almost three minutes without a basket Out of the corner Conwell left it short Hadley the rebound skips it back Khalifa quickly in the corner here is Adrian and a three for Woolly ties it at eight Its an automatic offensive rebound kick to the threepoint line Here goes Miller baseline on Hadley and score So crafty and such a great finisher Look at Conwell tried to get to the basket lost the handle on it Heres Pierre the turnover Hell try and split the twoman cover Tap follow No good And we go the other way with Brown Hadley a three Got it Its a two Theyre going to check it right now Its a two for Javon Hadley It only takes Louisville about two seconds maybe three to get the ball into the scoring area on the other side of the floor Not just cross midcourt into the scoring area Washington throws it up AND IT SPINS IN AGAINST Adrien Woolly Seven for Cory Washington Khalifa Heres Conwell against Pierre Step back three and Ali Khalifa cannot reach the rebound of Cory Washington Miller streaks to the basket Khalifa the rebound Heres Brown with Washington to beat Hell score What a fourpoint swing That is the two at the rim That poofy misses and then Brown on the other end quickly striking to the rim This is fun Wes This is great Its 94 ft is what it is I mean shot clock hadnt been inside of 10 much at all It barely gets there on the Edwards three Its just a great lift playing off the post Back the other way Heres Woolly into a double team Gets it to Conwell Hell shoot to tie It spins out Hadley got it Hell kick it for Khalifa Brown And now Woolly trying to beat Miller 10 for Brown Thats a long three My Brown rings the bell from near the tail of the Mustang Going to have to break out my tape measure and go measure that one at halftime laughter Wow that was deep Sure was Here is Miller Shake and cant get the jumper to fall Boy Hadley is aggressive on the glass in the corner Brown Another one Spins off Yugu the rebound Were almost 7 minutes in Starters are at the table and no dead ball yet Inside of 16 minutes YIGOLU HAD IT BLOCKED CONWELL YOU GOT TO DUNK THAT with some force I dont know if theyll go to their benches or their neutral corners when they get to a timeout Woolly scoops it up and scores Somebody needs a timeout There we go Mike Brown And I mean so deep at the three line it might have been four from the S My goodness 1715 Morning wake up call You know as soon as his feet hit the ground hes ready to go Well we get substitutions now for SMU All five Mustang starters have already scored Jason Priors coming the ball game So has Zuberus And theres a three by Tombs out of the corner The rookie from Amarillo How about Tombs A 28 threepoint shooter and doesnt even have a sweat going and fires away Yeah 63 of the year for Tombs Good looking player 610 230 playing about 18 minutes a game in ACC action Woolly trying to lob to Vellis Zugurus who will draw the foul That play happens because Isaac McNeely plays off two feet and the fill behind and then the high low look to the rim Very well done coming off the timeout by Louisville The three for SMU off the timeout and free throws for Louisville Jealous Zugurus is from Paris in Greece Now 11 of 16 at the line this year Hes only got three made field goals in ACC play averaging less than a point and a half in conference play knocks them both down comfortably Both coaches getting into their benches early I think thats a key for SMU So these guys are fresh The games going to be close all the way to the end in the second half Its going to be about possessions In the corner this is Sam Walters junior transfer knocks down his 123 Mustangs back by two Kobe Rogers gets it to McNeely trying to get around Edwards Take on Tombs Reversed it up Wouldnt go Subarus knocks in the field goal Ties it at 21 Thats three offensive rebounds for Louisville early Yep Edwards attacking Woolly Heres Tombs against Zuberus who lost it on the dribble Now they battle for it Miller the fall away Got it Boy Boopy Miller now with a pair of field goals Broken plays Boopy can make a play Woolly trying to dig by Edwards Heres McNeel Three off the screen Knocked down to the deck No whistle Last touched It will belong to SMU here Poopy Millers at it again Debbie SMU by two here Heads up music smart high IQ understanding goes to the ball and recognizes they are second in the league in scoring right now at better than 85 points a game laughter Well we get back to action Joe But heres the bottom line We said at the top this might be a really big game for SMU In your world how big is this game for the Mustangs free cheering Joe what metric on SMU are you looking at right now that makes you feel strongly theyre a tournament team out Joe we just flashed up the uh the brackettology for today Eight teams you have posted for the tournament three on the outside looking in Of the three on the outside who can make the most road here in the last couple of weeks of the regular season Hey there Joe appreciate it Thank you very much Have a great night and appreciate it as always Yeah thanks a lot Joe By the way the turnover on Yigatollu a moment ago for three seconds And theres a three ball off the hand of Conwell Ryan Conwell has got five now Thats his first triple of the night He is eighth in the ACC in percentage And Miller back the other way I mean if he sees a matchup he can win and he can get his hips and shoulders past you in transition hes going to the hole Brown to pull up too Too strong Walters whos hit a couple of threes for Andy Infield off the Mustang bench Heres the outlet and Pierre to the rack I was just getting ready to tell you Wes that SNU leads the ACC in fast break points and they HAVENT HAD ANY UNTIL NOW TRANSITION DEFENSE being tested by Louisville right now Forces a timeout One of Pat Kelseys biggest concerns was a ball coming off the glass and going the other way Here is Brown on the kick and then you see the way it ends with Conwell knocking down the music three Back to Dallas in a moment Defenses and can get to the free throw line They have a variety of ways that they can beat you off the bounce They have multiple players like Boopy Miller and Muel Brown who can make the defense wrong WHICH MEANS NO MATTER HOW YOU GUARD THEM THEYRE GOING TO SCORE Theyre also a combined nine of 16 from three here in this first half Inside Khalifa travel Turnover will be the fourth of the half on the cards That set had the SMU defense all spread out Thats exactly what you want to to do Its a break for SMU that Khalifa traveled Remember Pat Kelseys got Sander Fu over there with two fouls So Khalifa and Zuberus have to go big minutes here in the first half off the Louisville bench Pierres got six Largest lead for the Cards or for the Mustangs at six Yeah backto back baskets for Pierre Conwell had it knocked away Back for Brown Six nothing run for SMU Theyve hit their last seven shots from the floor Khalifa three from the front and it bounds away somehow or another Conwell got in there and pulled it out of the frame Look at Brown on the glass My goodness what a move Great fight on the glass And yes Muel Brown broken play he gets to the room you want the ball in his hands with the clock running down SMU lead cut to four Louisvilles got 10 second chance points here in this first half Theres Germaine ONeal Jr with a soft touch from the front Heres a leap for Hadley Conwell right by Walters and Sam Walters the transfer from Mak Yep Sure is By the way good comment on Matt Able too Coach Roberts because Matt Ael is on a list of guys quite frankly Heres Conwell a three Matt Ael were seeing one tonight in Jaden Tombs of SMU guys that potentially behind Caleb Wilson behind Cameron Boozer behind Mike El Brown theres another line of firstear players in the ACC that perhaps being overshadowed a little bit by that big three nationally I call them the other freshman that dont get all the pub that they should get They are valuable components to their team success Yeah we saw one last Tuesday night in Miami for sure Shelton Henderson kick into the corner and the three ball away Thats Javon Hadley Well he had 20 on Saturday over in Fort Worth Hes got five in the first half SMUs lead cut to four You know exactly what youre going to get from Hadley 56 from the floor Hes a 42 threepoint shooter Consistent every game Heres Pierre trying to wind Hadley or rather Canai Roose into traffic And hes going to draw the foul on Roose And its going to be Kennais first Its the third on Louisville And Debbie heres the other list if you will Heres these are the other guys If we were doing first team second team freshman these guys would be right there I mean Matt Ael has as coach mentioned in the studio Jaylen Harelson has had a great year Shelton Henderson to me has been the most impressive on that second list Yeah I agree Geron Pierre at the line SMU pushed it back to five on the first make Hes had 20 or more in four of the last six shooting 51 from the floor and 41 from three for the senior transfer from New Orleans who has had a circuitous college career Southern Miss Witchah State Jacksonville State last year and now here at SNU and hell spin that one in Eight in the first half for Pierre Thats one off the total he had in Louisville in the first meeting lead back to six Woolly trying to sneak baseline Got it blocked And that was blocked by Mitchell Holmes the big red shirt freshman from Fort Worth Whos coming into the ball game Holmes is a load on the drive Edwards fall away on Pru whos playing with two And BJ Edwards knocks down the field goal But West THATS WHY YOU PUSH AND run the floor hard because you get mismatches IN TRANSITION AND BJ EDWARDS RECOGNIZE IT AND TELL EVERYBODY GET OUT OF THE WAY BROWN strokes another three Hes just so smooth when he is going 10 for Mikel Brown Its a big basket right now for Mike Brown the last couple of games Yeah the eightpoint lead cut to five on one swing And now the steel Washington to beat Hes got Willie trailing and Brown will score again 12 in the first half five in a row for Mikel Brown Boy what a shift that is for the Cards Heres a three by Pierre Washington inside the rebound Knocked over the end line out of bounds It will stay with SMU Watch the defensive effort and the acceleration When youve got your defender backpedaling youre taking it to the basket And a crafty finish by Brown Crowd here at Moody Coliseum thought it was a foul No call Brown scored a couple of times on the uh left side of the basket with his off hand Miller against Conwell Holmes trying to help Whoopy Lost it And were going to get a foul called on Conwell Ryan Conwells first four on the Cardinals Thats a tough one You got to call it So with that BJ Davis Ray checks in for SMU Yigu is back for Holmes Miller Cory Washington and BJ Edwards on the floor for Andy Enfield And heres Miller against Conwell 10 to shoot Davis Ray and through the rebound from in front of Yigu The Davis Rays on the floor to play D and to screen and run the floor Conwell a deep three Knocks it in Were tied Eight in a row by the Cardinals Conwells got eight in the first half SMUs got to do a better job of their transition defense Theyre leaving the top of the floor open for Louisville Davis Ray for Yigolu Fu can only go straight up Yiglu couldnt finish it Hes got to stump that back door Davis Ray Yigu the follow SNU got enough cracks at the glass Mustangs in front again Woolly a three Got it Adrien Woollys got eight My goodness the shot making ability out here is fantastic Louisville in front now Defense optional Wes Yeah Miller his seventh lead change in this first half Boopy Millers first three And a little too fast Almost threw it away Hadley saved it but to the Mustangs SMU by two Yigu against FU trying to find room Hell throw it for Davis Ray And into the back court SMU turned it over Jigatola who lost Well Andy Enfield trusts him Zone by SMU off the timeout McNeely on the floor So is Kobe Rogers Theres a screen by Hadley Now Conwell whos also been really good in this opening frame And Ryan Conwell pivoted around far enough to keep it alive Missed the shot Pierre and the Mustangs ride into traffic goes Pierre lost the handle on it Out of bounds It will belong to the Cards Dont forget Super Tuesday rolls on tonight 9 Eastern over on ESPN Georgia and Kentucky in downtown Lexington at Rup Arena You can see it on ESPN and always available for you on the ESPN app Cards the ball Theyve hit four of their last five from the floor Zone again by SMU Watch Khalifa work on the top of the floor He is really good from slot to slot Conwell the skip Kobe Rogers with six to shoot Back for McNeely High catch shot Good I mean you practice it all the time Drive baseline Phil behind Very well executed SMU now behind after the triple from Isaac McNeely Miller trying to find a spot Washington right back to him The cut and Washington the bucket Theyre putting McNeely in ball screen action as much as they can in the quarter court offensively Really making him have to guard Khalifa for Conwell Quick launch here Front rim miss Miller the rebound SMU turns Lead is Pierre Layup good 10 first half points for Giron Pierre Jr lead to three now for Andy Infields club The average time of possession is like less than 10 seconds for each team It seems it is quick cheering Rogers a triple Locks it down Ninth three of the year First basket for Kobe Rogers My goodness 47 all now and the fifth different Louisville Cardinal to hit a three Theyve hit 10 of their last 12 combined in the first half And then Rogers knocked it away and saves it to Hadley Kobe back for Hadley Now Khalifa Brown waits at the table Heres Conwell on the drive off the glass and in Beautiful 10 for Conwell Cards back in front Were under a minute to go Wes I love it And a foul on McNeely Kobe Rogers affecting the game at both ends Every possession Its what we said at the very beginning Every play every possession in this one Great finish high off the glass McNeely caught the foul It was his first Its the fifth in this first half on Louisville Four for SMU And heres Pierre Brown does get back into the ball game to replace Rogers Heres Washington Hes fouled by Khalifa and one That is great footwork Excellent job 11 first half points for Cory Washington Ali Khalifas first foul Six on the cards Look at that pivot practice that every day also Great finish inside Handles the contact Keeps his eyes on the rim Fu is off the floor with the two fouls Kase Prior has come on for Louisville He and Khalifa for what will likely be the final 448 Washingtons got a a 12point first half here Debbie 5049 I thought Louisville might consider a two for one based on the pace of the game but looks like theyre not going to 11 ties 11 lead changes in the first half Amazing So fun Conwell thought about it Digs down on the dribble Heres Prior and it bounds away Shot clock off 23 seconds left Andy Infield says hold for one Pierre spins Going to scoop and score He ran right through the green light cheering Andy Infield held up one John Pierce says No coach Weve been going like this the whole half cheering Brown tried to scoop it ONeal blocked it at the horn BJ Edwards What a 20 minutes Somebody asked me at the break did anybody guard anybody Well we saw Kobe Rogers make a play in the mid four So SMU shot 60 in the first half Louisville shot 53 Yeah Mustangs had 52 points Thats a season high first half The other part about this is Louisvilles now shot 52 or better in six of their last seven halves Conwell out of the corner to get a start and air ball Goodness So lets see what happens Is that some sort of notion of things to come Pierre against McNeely Yiglu Fu plays with two Cement strong to the basket Got the roll Eiglus got to be aggressive like that at the rim When he catches it that deep he needs to finish And he doesnt have any fouls so he can be more aggressive here in the second half To work try to get it back to McNeely Miller right with him Back door cut Hadley Boy Cory Washington really gets after you defensively but Hadley is equal there What did Pat Kelsey tell us When they need a bucket they throw it on the block to Hadley Its a pretty good offense I mean he just works his way into the scoring area where he can go over that right shoulder Hes equally efficient left and right Third field goal for the sixth year senior from St Paul Minnesota Three ball bounds away for Edwards And the Cards trailing three Hadley again Miller And theres a reach in on Boopy Miller Kevin Miller his first and the first of the half on SMU for the senior from Chicago It was worth a try You know like you said no fouls Give it a go See if you can get a clean one Conwell for Brown Mike Brown Impressive in the first half How about Pierre drawing Brown out of the manto man for Andy Infield here Crew trying to help with a screen Brown toward a double team Threw it away on a bounce pass for Fu Couple of turnovers by the Cardinals Pierre the spot up three Giron Pierre with 15 now Big game Yep we called it We knew he was going to play well Sixpoint lead for SMU Conwell in the corner Hadley see if he can take Washington in traffic Does scoop Wont get there Through the rebound kick for Conwell Three over the top of Edwards bounds Third chance for the Bills Give it to Mikel Brown Back for Hadley Three ball Got it Javon Hadley Smart cuz Brown attacks the drop coverage draws the help from the weak side right to the pocket for a three 13 second chance points now for Louisville And theres a foul on Conwell with a forearm as Washington was riding him into the lane Thatll be two on Ryan Conwell First of the half on Pat Kelseys team music Oh spot throw in on the baseline for Poopy Miller And Edwards left his feet Thats a travel Dont forget we got more basketball coming your way Wednesday night on ACC Network 700 Eastern Joel Coliseum and Winston Salem Clemson off the Duke loss tries to regain a step against Wake Forest And then in Midtown Atlanta well close the night with number 14 Virginia visiting Georgia Tech Its on ACC Network always on the ESPN app And theres a foul on Yiglu as Brown dumped it for Fu I believe theyre going to get cement Yiglu with his first Sophomore from Turkey gives SMU their second foul Mike Brown saying he was in the act of shooting Theyre taking a having a conversation about it right now Theyre going to inbound it on the baseline Mike El Brown hard litigation Ron Groover not having it So were going to put that in play on the baseline zero and Brown will head there out of the lineup Jaden Tombs the freshman back in as FU traveled with it Tombs wasnt given much ground for Sandrew Debbie listen to has gotten better every single time he steps on the floor Just a really good job and and boopy bringing some help as well creating a turnover Threepoint lead for the Mustangs and Miller to work Foul line area Pierre hanging jumper Knocked around Hadley the rebound Hadleys been fantastic on the glass McNeely wanted the quick trigger on the dribble Hell be bumped and fouled by Miller Second on Miller third on SMU You call that displacement on one end you have to consistently call it on the other end Its the same call that Conwell picked up a foul on Boopy Miller picks up his second McNeely slides out with Fu Cany Roose in the ball game with Conwell Khalifa also quick check in for Pat Kelsey Khalifa for Brown Hadley Another three Yes sir Javon Hadley now eight and a half 13 in the game Hes got all eight Louisville points Debbie you work so hard to try to keep Mike Brown out of the paint He does such a good job of making you play in the gaps And Pierre continues 17 for Geron Pierre Jr Brown Long three Sure Another one That one standing in the U first half standing in the S for Mike Brown What a week of basketball that freshman has had What a week Its eight days now Were gone past the week Four minutes gone Second half Tombs leans in Too strong Crowd wanted a foul SMU bench cant believe it cheering Brown back for Khalifa Hadley feeling it Working against Washington Into traffic goes Hadley Had it blocked now Recovered Miller Mustangs Twoon on two Boopy hanging Good Seven for Miller Fast break points pressure on your transition game He converts from defense to offense very quickly Brown cheering and a foul going to be called on Edwards Thats going to get us to a timeout BJ Edwards on the reach Louisvilles ball trailing a point to SMU in a rockus Moody Collison Just incredible basketball skills and IQs and aggressive playing with force Both looking to get downhill and Brown doing a nice job of distributing the basketball Skipped it to Khalifa Now McNeel a step and a shot fake and a three that bounds away for Germaine ONeal Jr to grab the rebound Back for Pierre and he picks up on the dribble Got to get rid of it Quick hand off for Tombs and back for Pierre Three ball away and Khalifa got the deflection off the hand of Adrien Woolly You think we might get one shot clock violation tonight Not a chance maam No chance All the way through Brown Tried to squeeze it through in traffic Ended up turning it over to Tombs A lot of traffic in there Yeah Too many bodies for Mike El Brown to fight through Onepoint lead for SMU Were almost 6 minutes old into the second half Miller in a kick to the corner Pierre lines up and the long rebound scooped up Kana Roose ahead for Willie Back for ROOSE AND PIERRE BLOCKED THE DUNK He is everywhere tonight Miller against McNeely winds and fires They just clear it out for poopy 6360 10 to shoot for Brown Baseline Roose against Walters Kana up strong Lost it Got it back Tried to kick it out Heres Pierre cheering Now Miller thought about it against Khalifa He says get out of the way Step side three Nope That ball had zero rotation on it Yep Heres Woolly and Louisville trailing three Cards have been three minutes without a point Brown fixes that and one Michael Brown gets the basket and a foul to the nail high off the glass A little bit of a patient whistle and an and one opportunity First on Germaine ONeal Jr the freshman from South Lake Fifth of the half on SMU Debbie And I bring that up because Louisville is the third best free throw shooting team in ACC play at 77 And the Cards tonight are four for six as Brown tries to tack the threepoint and the free throw goods 6 and 12 for Mel Brown And those are fellas from the next level putting notes in their phone on zero in the red tonight He has been really good going left Yep Brown out and Kobe Rogers who really gave him five strong minutes in the first half onto the floor for Pat Kelsey Walters one dribble hands to Miller through trying to help Bounce pass cheering the catch and dunk Seven for Smith Boopy stretches that hedge waits for Igatou to get to the rim cheering Conwell back for Fu Put it up Blocked Igatou Now Woolly off the chance Spins out the three and last touch by Pierre One more look at the SMU bucket a moment ago for Yigolu here Watch Boopy go at the hip out through and then drop it off to Yato late on the tag from the weak side And thats the kind of real estate that I can eat up And then on the other end he just makes a great defensive play Sixth block of the night for SMU Willie almost had it knocked away Miller didnt knock it away Germaine ONeal wants a replay and the bench calls it off goes right up his back Yeah music And there is the long time NBA star Germaine ONeal Must be what a thrill to watch his son

get close to a shot clock violation Yeah but the ball is in the right guys hands for Louisville Hes going to go to the free throw line when music we come back You bet Foul is on Walters Twopoint lead for the Mustangs as we play on tonight from Big D on ESPN 2 After the foul on Walters got us to the uh break in the action Browns been terrific What an eight days hes on Knocks down the free throw is now two of two at the line Brown and Hadley or a combined five of seven from the floor The rest of the team is 0 for seven in this second half And Brown knocks down a couple of free throws Just as a reminder to you postit note if you will tie the game at 65 SMU had an eightpoint first half lead I remember that as if it were like weeks ago right Yeah exactly Heres Walters gunning for the lead Missed everything Out of bounds Air ball will send it back to the Cards You can certainly get a better shot than that If youre going to take that deep of a three you dont need to take it that early in the shot clock And the shot doctor coaches the Mustangs Exactly Former NBA shooting coach Andy Enfield Yep For the Bucks Its fun to watch you guys talk about getting shots up today Neither one of you accomplished that Theres a travel on Brown trying to come to a jump stop against Germaine ONeal Jr Thats usually the first question I have for Andy music Did you get shots up today Get shots up today How many does he shoot normally I know how many you get He went 491 out of 500 a couple of weeks ago with his son I know that Okay thats pretty solid Hes got his son Markham Pretty good shooter I

Itll be his third It is just the second on Pat Kelseys team here at half two Miller Mustangs by a point Gets it to ONeal Fall away Good Germaine ONeal Jr This is where Boopy is so good He knows that

up a step inside Eigatu had it batted away McNeely the takeaway Fu saves it for Brown Heres Conwell all the way to the basket Tap follow Onepoint game again About the time I think theyre starting to smooth things out They rev it up Miller leaner off the shot fake Heres McNeely ahead for Brown Layup good What a look ahead from Isaac McNeely Backtoback buckets in transition SMUs transition defense because of their shot selection breaking down 22 now for Mikel Brown Louisville in front Three ball Edwards and Hadley steps in front on the knockout Heres Conwell by Miller off the window Hadley

rebounds Theyve scored 20 points on their ability to play with force on the glass SMU trailing three Now heres Miller coming to a stop back for Cory Washington who had 12 in the first half Hes scoreless here in half two Miller is not Theres a hand check on McNeely Mustangs an old familiar refrain They drive it right at McNeely Well thats Cory Washington doing a good job forcing the switch

is tough Watch this play right here Wow that is close He has no fouls at the first half Yeah hes been much more aggressive in protecting the basket in the second half but hes picked up a couple of fouls at the rim And Fu at the line one of two Hes 66 on the year And the first one good for Louisville Javon Hadley plus 12 in the plus minus has the best plus minus for Louisville Thats why you see him on the floor I dont think hes come out in the second half And second one good Sandanda Fru 22 years of age from Berlin Ties us at 76 Miller Foul line fall away over McNeely is good They just run a little brush Clear it out Let Boopy go to work 15 for Boopy Miller cheering Heres a nice pass Brown for crew And he traveled Boopy Miller has no problem calling his own number in a late game situation And Andy Enfield trusts his decision making and his shot making in a late game But Jeron Pierre has had the hot hand for them most of the game He has been consistent all game long at being aggressive He got awarded the 2000 point basketball at the beginning of the game for his career Yep And remember he only had nine points in the first matchup against Louisville He knew he was going to play well Miller Heres Washington BJ Edwards skips it back for Washingtons three Got it Cory Washington with 18 now A pair of threes in the second half WHEN THE FOURTH OPTION IS PLAYING WELL SMU is playing well and a timeout taken by Louisville in the first matchup And Louisville played really well in the second half in Louisville and their defense is going to have to step up right here 540 to go out of the Kelsey timeout Cards trailing five and Conwell for Brown attacking on the drive Fu the follow of the miss again Fu on the weak side because Brown gets to the rim and draws help Opens up the opposite side of the rim Kobe Rogers pretty good defender for Pat Kelsey off the bench now along with Conwell Roose and Pru round out the order They try to go back door to Eago Son of Pu the foul just his third Remember he got too fast tonight early in the ball game Had to ride the bench in the first half Fu didnt get many minutes at all And now all of a sudden hes picked up just his third foul Thats his first since the two early ones And now Yigolu to the line Oh no theyre going to put it on the baseline Just the uh six foul on the Bill Edwards Heres Pierre against Roose and a foul there on Canai Roose Debbie for a guy that has played very very well in the last couple of weeks in particular Canai Roose had four points last Monday night against NC State scoreless the other day in Fort Worth against Baylor Hes got no points here tonight His impact on the game isnt just about scoring though He has got great length on the defensive end in the gap and at the rim Quick reminder to you NBA
