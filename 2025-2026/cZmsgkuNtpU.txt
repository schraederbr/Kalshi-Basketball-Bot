Stanford has lost three in a row Florida State after starting one and five in conference has won two out of three and Leger Jones gives this game an emphatic start Why not open it up a little cheering Starting lineups for Stanford We told you about Okori Jeremy Den Smith D2 transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hes been their number two scorer in conference play And then AJ Roi down low an ACC high 10 points last time out at Miami Shot clock down to five Dent Smith off the window and over the 610 Wiggins And thats what made Dent Smith a D2 AllAmerican His ability to be patient when he gets into the paint Takes his time plays off two feet nice shot over top Robert McCrae six in white leading scoreer for Florida State second in the league in assist And on Q he finds Alex Steen who last Saturday went for a season high 14 Hes a division 2 transfer Comes over from Florida to Southern This was a guy that was a Sunshine State Conference defensive player of the year Hes got a little offensive game too but he was highly recruited highly sought after And now in a Florida State uniform this guy is bringing a different element to their defense with his switchability Able to get going a little bit on the offensive end 69 from Panama City Florida And the free throw is not there for Steam 67 at the line Luke LS first year head coach at Florida State Great player with the seinals And this is a team that is going to want to push tempo today play fast and they shoot a lot of threes They absolutely do And might I say this looks fantastic in a suit Lets bring the suits back Anisha No he was at shoot around knocking down corner threes like he was still a player We played against each other when he was here playing for coach Leonard Hamilton I was at Clemson Really good shooter Had an excellent career as an assistant in the NBA And Ryan Uggerwall beats the shot clock A little hesitation Red shirt junior from Texas He had 20 points made that win against North Carolina earlier this month I really like Uggerwalls game Good size shoots the ball well His efficiency has taken a step this year but Leger Jones has been aggressive as well This is a guy hes got good size from Jacksonville or right outside of Jacksonville Has some talent with the shot clock running down They get Den Smith with his first foul Kyle Smith now in his second season as Stanfords head coach He was telling us the loss of Chisum Opara has really impacted this team on multiple levels You lose your number two score You lose positional versatility rebounding and also physicality And Abukori has had to deal with that His usage rate way too high is what Kyle Smith told us And I would have to agree Theyre using him a lot in screen and roll situations trying to get him in the half court to be that main guy And there he is right there Chisum Opara lower leg extremity is what theyre calling it Uh really talented player strong as an ox Theyre going to miss his presence mightily 68 240 Great pass Corner three Not there for Jones A follow and steam there A fresh 20 Theres Wiggins And the rebound snagged by Donovan Young Hes been starting in place of Okara Now Okorei so good getting to the rim whenever he wants Its not just that they switch a like ball screen and he changes direction so well And if you ask me Anisha and not many people do but him and Muel Brown Jr Their ability to change direction and not lose speed this guys not bad either Now Robert McCrae who began his career at Wake in the ACC twoyear sojourn at Jacksonville before coming to Florida State with the answer with the left hand Our catch and release Batted around Theyre letting them play Rahosi kept it alive A clash of tempos today We told you Florida State wants to play fast Sanford comfortable playing late into the shot clock Rajosi active on the glass He was a walkon for Kyle Smith at Washington State for two years Then had a fantastic season at D3 Claremont Mud Scripps a California school last year and now getting some major minutes with Stanford Almost 20 a game steam through a double team Craig thats just terrific ball on both sides I thought Stanford really converts towards the ball well But FSU when theyre spraying that ball around the perimeter and the defense is scrambling thats when they can get going And if Robert McCra is hitting threes hes such a tough cover because his athleticism is second to none That means you got to go over those ball screens Jeremy Dent Smith at the other end He scored at least 18 in three of his last four And with Opara out theyve gone to him as their number two scorer Heres Somerville Hes been Florida States most consistent threepoint shooter And we get a foul on Somerville And the ball moves and Florida State plays even better They love threes sure but whenever youre playing catchup against the ball movement of the Siminals youre in trouble Robert McCrae thats a lefty And thats three Get up and get loud One of the nobles to the threepointer winner

busy day in the ACC Only the third meeting between Stanford and Florida State The Cardinal won the first two back in 2022 and in 2025 almost a year ago on this very date Stanford comes in on the bubble on the wrong side of it One of Joe Lonards next four out This technically qualifies as a quad 2 game for Stanford but their resume is fascinating Theyve got four quad one wins They also have three quad three losses Donovan Young that shot is not there Tipped around and it comes to Somerville America East Rookie of the Year last year at UMass LOL I like Somervilles game Hes got a little shake Change of pace is the name of the game for him He can really score it but this guy can really shoot it One in and out Kobe McGee Offensive rebound keeps it alive Tomas Bong the 68 Frenchman Bon cutting to the basket muscles it up over Oscar Hilt I love Tomas Basson And heres the deal Hes not going to be a guy thats going to average 30 points or have a 30point game but hes going to do all those other things Hes earned the start over the last five or six games because hes the hardest playing guy on the floor The Frenchman pretty good Great feed from Ugger Wall to Donovan Young on the inside Seems like so far Stanford has been intentional in attacking some of these mismatches And now Stanford going a little two3 zone Ball gets to Florida State attack Ball to the high po post You automatically convert to man McGee way off and Bong stepped on the line A terrific Bong is a guy thats just going to survive on effort And this was a terrific cut to the basket Better pass strong finish I saw the the young freshman play for the French U19 national team at the World Cup in Switzerland and he was a guy that brought it each possession Not the most skilled but he gets out in transition He uses his long arms Hes a guy who can finish above the rim Its all effort The offensive games going to catch up Yeah they love his upside They think its NBA upside And I agree This has been the biggest difference with FSU over the last three games four games even Theyve defended at a much higher level Benny Geler knocks down the three He had a 17point game Wednesday at Miami where he knocked down five triples The senior from Palos Veries Estates California You see right away triggered a man after the ball goes in the high post Wiggins on the catch and release Thats what he does And thats the value that Chanty Wiggins brings to your team as a bigger player who can guard fours and fives on the defensive end in college And space it out from beyond the ark Cameron Grant off the Geler feed and Stanford has knocked down eight of its first 11 shots Florida State threepoint heavy Thats not a surprise Thats a two from Wiggins whos picking up where he left off Wednesday You see the difference when Chy Wiggins is decisive on the catch Hes looking to score immediately and that increases his effectiveness dramatically big fan of what he can do whenever hes decisive on the offensive end Young against Wiggins down low Grant leans into a long three left and short and thats all Cameron Grants going to do You have to know where hes at on the floor Im not sure Someville No hes mostly been a threepoint shooter 83 of his shots from three Now O Cororey number two scorer in the ACC behind Cam Boozer of Duke a master of angles Shot clock down to seven Okorei raises the rim We mentioned of late more of a burden on Okorei Hes had some tough shooting nights so far today one for three in the early going Get ready Florida State For the first time ever PBR is taking over DO for a two night comics the beast major Bringing the toughest bull riders on the planet together with two of regions biggest stars John party Tickets are on sale now And its time to leave behind all kids recent childrens hospital giving up her 10yearold for each weekend childrens hospital tonight Im your Indian show Today Im here with Jenna Jenna how do you feel about tonight How are you feeling about the water Im ready Shes ready Everybody Okay everybody Congratulations Stanford has been a tough team to figure out Four quad one wins They beat St Louis on a late three by Geler They beat Louisville won at Virginia Tech beat North Carolina But then some improbable scars music on their resume They lost to Seattle and UNLV Josh Basser was ready for him He was also lost to Notre Dame in a game that I would never recommend rewatching laughter It wasnt a good one Neither team broke 50 points That is Oh yeah I remember that was a rough one But I will say this Stanford team if they shoot it well and Okore is playing as well as what weve seen not many teams in college basketball that they can at least compete with Now can you win some of these games is what it comes down to And thats a nice move Le Jones coming to his left hand I I love the patience And this is how you can see an older player sometimes playing off two feet not in a rush And really whats impressive its not just him but like a lot of the freshman that we see in this conference Ibuko Cory Kim Boozer maybe not so much Caleb Wilson because he just jumps over everybody but the level of patience whenever they play and they get to that ACC logo in the middle its so effective And Lay Jones I mean this guy scored a lot of points Yeah Luke LS told us at shoot around what he wants to see from LJ Jones and Chanty Wiggins play to your size Jones is 67 Wiggins is 610 He said they sometimes get in trouble when they play like theyre 61 But over the last five games Jones averaging almost a double double and hes also averaging more than a block and a steal per game Cameron Grant meanwhile all he does is shoot threes All but four of his field goal attempts this year are threes and hes knocked down two today And Steveled Heres the thing Sometimes confusion leads to open shots Just a couple of fakes around He looks confused So does Florida States defense While Im here I might as well shoot it 54 shots on the season for Grant of which 50 are threes Father Chris former GM of the Cleveland Cavaliers Guy knows how to shoot He plays hard understands his role Theres another three going up At least I thought Well he better shoot it instead of traveling What would you pick I think I would go with the former coach Kyle Smith big nerdball advocate heavy in the analytics and fascinating but not surprising So are a lot of his players Batted around and we got a foul on the floor applause and cheering Good possession by both parties and and sometimes the bottom wing at this two3 zone will get stuck a little high You got to find the corner and Aiden Camman number 52 really active as the middle guy in the bottom of that two3 zone He has to go out there and cover it in this game Whos going to hit shots Sure But you have to be able to cover the shooters Nice slip and one A chance for a threepoint play for Sting The previous foul was on Oerwall Terrific slip They know theyre hedging the screens Thats music a scouted play right there You know Camman is going to reach outside A little lean is all you need And Alex Ste knows how to finish Its the second foul on Cam Chanty Wiggins back into the game for Florida State AJ Swinton gets a breather Swinton starting to see more minutes of late now Pressure by the Nolles Interesting to see Okorei checks out Pressure comes What a move And Roosi drops it in So Stanford not a team that likes to push tempo They play at one of the slowest paces of all ACC teams So Florida State pressed and they take advantage of the early offense Oh right away And you see whos pressing and thats a good move Thats a good call right here Moving screen But if youre Florida State you understand you might get pressure to win a 40s out of the game Attack pressure and get the ball inside AJ Rozie who was playing fraternity ball his freshman year in college at Washington State now hes starter at Stanford in the Atlantic Coast Conference He had some D3 interest out of high school Auburn offered him a chance to walk on decided to attend Washington State as a regular student was in a fraternity spent his first year at Wazu playing some wreck league ball and then went to an open gym try out essentially and Kyle Smith saw a guy who played with a relentless motor and said Hey why dont you walk onto the basketball team And now hes followed Smith to Stanford Loose ball out of bounds to Florida State Got to give Robert McCrae credit Theyre trying to attack a mismatch but Robert McCrae is not a little fella So strong physically He can guard fours and fives at times as long as his activity is high Just a terrific athlete out of South Carolina When you are the fifth of nine siblings youre used to fighting Youre used to fighting They got a scrap right Matchup zone Stanford keep going back to it Just changing up coverages You have to communicate Now switch back to man and guard into in isolation Wiggins in the high post I tell you what Brad Brownell might be watching that and thinking where was that at Clemson Ill tell Ill tell you what that was at Clemson That was a turnaround fadeaway jumper Thats Chanty Wiggins being assertive with his back to the basket getting to his left hand Hes got the skill Its been potential Now its turning to production And you see the results of his work Skip pass Shot fake Raosi Thats on the jump hook Not there Robbed down low Bassan nearly lost his balance Good ball movement Wiggins The corner three and a rebound to Grant Ill just go ahead and say it Anish this Florida State teams playing well Theyre sharing the ball Theyre defending at a much higher level than they started out the season Uh you got to make the shot but the shot probability Im sure is up there Lets put it that way Good shot selection and they continue moving the basketball And then when shots like that go up they might as well be a turnover You can get out and play quickly This team lost by 44 to Enson State as Jones hammers another one home We get a timeout by Kyle Smith They had a coming to moment after that loss to the Wolfpack And Luke Lou said there has been a rededication to the defensive intensity Now this team is really good when theyre able to play fast music and the defense is scrambling trying to get back into a two3 zone matchup Well the problem with that is if you throw up a tough shot everybodys having to find the ball and get to their spots And thats just really good management from the point guard position Robert McCrae attacking bringing the middle guy up and a nice bounce pass for the dunk Michael World We welcome those of you who just watched Cal knock off Miami in an 8685 thriller Stanford and Florida State playing to a stalemate thus far Stanford led by Ibuka Okori the ACCs second leading scoreer Hes one of the top freshman in all of college basketball One of the best players in college basketball And Florida State struggled out of the gates They started one and five in conference play Theyve won two of three since and theyve done a lot of it with defense Absolutely right And I think the big message coming in for a lot of people with Luke L stepping in as the new head coach at Florida State after years and years of Leonard Hamilton Well were going to shoot threes Were going to play in NBA style And that kind of music works You need the other end of the floor right The defense has really turned up a notch So far this game for those of you new here Florida State music has been terrific on that end of the four so far How do you continue to stack good defensive possessions so you can get out and run Yeah and this Florida State team they had a 44point loss to NC State There was a coming to moment after that Luke L said Were going to play the guys who commit to defense Well their last four games much more competitive In fact all four have come down to the final possession This game very balanced so far between them and Stanford A Stanford team thats dealing without Chisumakpara for the rest of the season with a lower leg injury and theyre much better with Ibuko Cororey on the floor right there in your screen Number one this guy is outstanding He changes directions so well And in my opinion theres two guys in all of college basketball that move in that way Its Muel Brown Jr from Louisville And its Ibuko Okori Their ability to change direction without losing speed is special Hes a big time scorer but this Florida State team can really get hot from the perimeter If Okorei is Batman then Okara was Robin and past tense because as you mentioned hes out for the season That was their number two scorer He was a guy that gave Stanford positional versatility rebounding toughness and theres not one player who fits all of what Oaro was able to do I dont think theres many humans that are 67 250 lbs I mean just that alone made him so valuable He was terrific scorer too O Jones going over Ryan Underwall and then draws the foul on the follow So Jay Jones taking advantage of some mismatches in this first half inside Hes 67 220 lbs At least thats what hes listed at Id give him a pound or two more That is a grown man move in the paint If youre Ryan Uggerwall you have to do a better job of positioning before he catches it Force him out away from the rim because when Le Jones is aggressive to the hoop hes a low strong player Transfer from St Bonaventure Free throw good And Jones with six points now for Florida State in this first half over his last five averaging almost a double double and thats with a steel and almost a block and a half per game in that span Theres Oi only Cam Boozer averages four points per game in the ACC cheering the Duke freshman He wants a pick now Young sets it Corys so good at getting to the rim at will Picked up the bounce Shot clock at five Rahosi Hes got to put it up over Wiggins and he gets the friendly roll now They may look at that Moving on to the basket Its time for a subsial review Theyre going to look at previous play is under review to see whether or not a shot clock violation occurred Yeah theyre going to see if Rahosi did indeed beat the shot clock Might have got away with a couple of steps but he clearly it Well you know what Tough because the backboard light did not go off Be tough to see He did get away with steps That was a travel laughter thats for sure Thats tough because the light around the backboard isnt going off See if we have one more angle Wow thats about as close as it gets But AJ Rajosa heres clock Youll see on the bottom right hand corner of your screen Shot goes up Really close It is ruled a made basket Jones using the shot fake on Grant McGee the three He was a 44 threepoint shooter at Drexel a year ago Just a terrific extra pass too by Le Jones You get the paint touch to a kick out and then the rotations begin McGee a terrific shooter as you mentioned able to just line it up in the corner They are denying Okorei Finally gets the ball with seven to shoot Long three Dent Smith No Out of bounds to Florida State Part of what Luke LS wanted to do to Ibuka Okorei today Wear him down go at him defensively and then deny him the ball on offense And thats a huge point But as Okori is trying to set up the play offensively Tomasz Bong is doing a terrific job with his shift activity behind the primary defender closing off some of these gaps to where Okore can drive So you have to show your chest to a player of Okoris ilk and discourage some of these driving lanes and Bongs doing a terrific job of that Jones bullies inside brass knuckle plus one more Thats absolutely what that is Listen at 220 Im calling a lie right there strong physical aggressive easy up quick under and one And for a Florida State team that is built around the threepoint shot thats their fourth and one opportunity today Theyve taken advantage against some of these Stanford bigs on the lack of size on the inside And theyve been aggressive whenever Stanford switched up pressures as well right Every time Stanford shows a two3 theyre getting to that ACC logo and being aggressive either for themselves or their teammates Donovan Young knocks down the three Just his fourth threepointer of the season Really like the idea of using Tomas Bong as a screener early in the clock Bong blocked at the rim by Hilte Thats the seven foot Belgian B Song is controlling this game on the defensive end when he doesnt have the basketball I I mean would you say his wingspan is seven4 74 Thats what Oori does better than maybe any player in the country Gets to the free throw line Just so tough off the bounce right His ability to get downhill But heres the thing It finally opens up and hes able to attack and thought Kobe McGee did a nice job playing straight up Got to have legal guarding position and Okori as good as anybody in drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line Anish and hes had eight games where hes had at least 10 free throw attempts We remind you Tuesday night on the ACC Network a mens basketball double header 7 Eastern number four Duke hosting BC at Cameron Indoor and then Pit heads to JPJ to take on 17th ranked Virginia We know Duke right now on the projected one line according to Joe Lonardi Virginia with their two bigs Fantastic They have created so many matchup problems Groom low comes out They bring in the next guy Its two sevenfooters Both among the ACC leaders and blocks One of the best shot blocking teams in all of college basketball And theyre old which seems to be the goal of every existing head coach right now Get old stay old You can do that in the Portal era Switcheroo by McCrae He lost it Now O Cory cheering step back three too much Hell take the offensive rebound threads it to Geler Geler catch and release in and out Offensive rebound Young Okore wants it and throws it away Just hasnt been sharp Thats what really stands out right now Stanford theyre trying to make the right reads but its been Florida States length on the defensive end their activity level that has forced passes to go a little bit too high a little bit offtarget and its ruining the flow of their offense And that was the key point for coach Luke LS We have to be better on the defensive end with our activity level Its been outstanding so far Anish Yeah they have And this was a defense again they gave up 113 to NC State We get a foul on the floor Theyve had seven games all of which theyve lost where theyve given up 90 plus this season But the seminal turnaround spearheaded by defense music Virginia I think theyre right there at it And thats a great point I I think Virginia just because of how old they are It could be a different guy every night North Carolina is going to be in the mix especially they go up to Virginia and get a win doing Carolina things running the floor playing hard music defensively Now I will say about Carolina struggle guarding the point guard position a little bit as fast against a fast point guard whether its Nate Cales and Wake We saw what Okorey did to him I think its between those two Dont forget about my alma mater Clemson and how good Brad Brownells been this season I I mean could be up for coach of the year consideration Yeah Total roster reset and Clemson right there in the middle of it all Le Jones has had a big first half for Florida State Nine points He and Wiggins lead all scorers and Okori the ACC second leading scorer held to just three points Really impressed with Jones so far and how aggressive hes been to use his strength And this was a guy last year shot 39 from three at St Bonaventure Struggled a little bit with his three ball this season Only 306 but its there I like the assertiveness of Im going to get to the basket first and maybe my three ball will fall Florida States been really tenacious on the defensive end of the floor They are denying Okorei whos yet to touch the ball Geler with a deep three He can do that He sure can They had the buzzer beater against St Louis in Palm Springs earlier this year That was a quad one win McCrae off the window A good Robert McCrae a Robert McCrae whos not turning it over is dangerous Such a quality athlete on the floor looks like he could be playing wide receiver I mean that kind of athlete cheering Somerville the steel McCrae wanted Wiggins and gives it right back And thats the flip side right He does have a tendency to turn the basketball over but this is what hes really good at getting into the lane using his wide shoulders to get up over the top and a righthanded finish for a lefthanded player Tough around the basket Hes second to Boopy Miller in assists in the ACC That was his first turnover of the game Thomas Basson or Tomas Basson has been spectacular defensively so far Somerville devoured and were going to get a foul Looks like its going to be on Bong Bong fantastic on the defensive end creating the turnover This is when you got to pull back out if youre Somerville Theres three bodies right there on in front of you Youre getting good shots on the offensive end of the floor If you dont think you have a oneonone get the ball out run some offense get a quality look Youve done well on the half court Let the ball work for you Yeah Tio if youre Stanford you got to be thinking hey Okorei has not been much of a factor offensively Youre only down four Guilt lost it but it was knocked out Somerville making the case that I dont know Thomas Moresy referee Thomas Morrisy had a better look at it Went off the chest of the offensive player And Stanfords tried to be intentional about attacking mismatches but the guards for FSU when switching over have displayed some toughness some real physicality to make it difficult on some of these entry passes So the call gets changed McCree through the contact Hes their leading scoreer at 14 a game And look at the second defender Theres always another guy waiting in the lap of Oore Thomas Bong number three has been excellent in terms of this today Look at the activity Always a player there Strong recovery Shot clock inside of 10 again cheering More against the 67 Jones Grant the corner three off the side of the backboard Luke Lou needs to save that possession for film tomorrow That was terrific defensive work Guys swarming to the basketball communicating switching just really good Bong to the tin He is relentless on both sides of the ball sees the mismatch changes direction Terrific finish Meanwhile Stanford has turned it over on three of its last four possessions cheering Four out of five Florida State on a 6 run Wiggins No Now right now the question for Stanford if its not Oori who else Thats exactly right And youre going to have to either try to initiate some switching to get the matchup you want If its not ORI cheering you got to find something And now Stanford keeping it simple Going one flat Theres the matchup Okore and Bang Grant from the corner No Young the rebound The put back not there Rebound Jones 5 seconds Theres Somerville Hes their best threepoint shooter And that one no good as time expires on Oy How does Stanford get on track offensively if its not going to be just ORI Well theyre going to have to continue to try to find mismatches and move the basketball but you got to have somebody in the post that can score because right now its been difficult for Stanford on the offensive end of the floor Can Jeremy Den Smith get going They need him to Raosi fighting over Bassong and able to draw the foul This is something weve seen through the last four or five games with Florida State coming out of the half Theyll show a two3 zone and as soon as a point guard crosses half court they jump the ball handler And thats for no other reason than to set a statement of how youre going to play in the second half Make them un make the opposing team unsure of themselves and then you can live with the consequences That is a rare free throw make by Rahosi who came in shooting 33 from the line and for his career prior to that make 17 out of 52 So one out of two that ups his career percentage and and somewhat considerably somewhat unorthodox shooting motion as well but he he provides so much value to Stanford Hey great pass Wiggins had a good look Steen had it knocked away And theres the motor by Rahosi And if youre Stanford get some stops and then try to play quicker Yeah this matchups been fascinating Now they get a switch But Bang with that 74 wingspan against O Cororey and Donovan Young went over that 74 wingspan Donovan Youngs a unique player Hes 68 Hes 215 lbs played at Link Academy in Missouri which is a highly touted prep school with a lot of highlevel players Ill say this McCrae is passing his backside off right now Thats Wiggins again being aggressive on the inside Something we didnt see a whole lot of when he played at Clemson Should have dunked it I say that in justest but this guy you see the skill level at 610 Can you continue to be that guy for this Noles team cheering Second foul on Roi Coming up next on ACCN its the Nothing But Net Crew Theyll break down the day in the ACC A lot of highlights to get to a lot of analysis to get to plus a look ahead at the week ahead February begins tomorrow That much closer to March Thats right The Kalins of February Heres your mismatch but look at the activity behind Theres Ryan Uggerwall Shot clock down to four and Rahosi turns it over Florida States defense has upped it a notch Uh but theres another element of that too If youre Stanford and you see a mismatch for your teammate O Cororey who had Steen on him that ball needs to jettison right back to him on the wing and open up some space He struggled Florida States done a nice job of cutting off angles man And theyre playing well And Im going to be honest with you the leader of this Florida State team right now has been Tomas Basson And its everything other than scoring And scoring is a part of it sure but his tenacity on the defensive end of the floor has permeated through the rest of this Nles team Yeah hes been the primary defender of late on Ouri Otherwise three not there Bang on the glass Another turnover Jeremy Den Smith ahead of the pack and thats a goalender Den Smith last year helped Cal State Dominguez reached the D2 National Championship game Averaged 19 a game a division 2 allAmerican And hes had some big games of late 20 against Cal 18 against Duke six threes 20 points against UNC Jones from Wiggins too strong Hell snags the carum Need to find a way to get Okorey the ball Continue swinging it and stay out of his way Dont dribble hand off because theyre just going to switch Exhibit A Thats a contested shot Thats tough And the thing is if you dont dribble handoff and you just pitch it ahead hes got a oneonone with Le Jones the dribble handoff allows McCrae to get right in front of the ball and that gives him no space How about the moves by Bang Everything but the finish crashing to the ground kept it alive Wiggins and he knocks it down Tomas Bang never quit cheering Hes becoming the story of the late season emergence for Luke LS and company Yeah a team that struggled mightily on defense for the first few months Starting to turn it around Now you need to get out There it is And the thing is is even so much as cut through the lane to take your guy with you Give him more space to operate He struggled to find any today WIGGINS HAS BEEN FEELING IT Hes got 15 They have been so decisive on the offensive end of the floor Easy look after easy look Oh Cororey gets in the painted area Off balance Cant get the roll Wiggins with the rebound and the turnover cheering cheering 10point lead Matches the largest of the game OH CORY THROUGH THE CONTACT amongst the trees Thats a big time finish We talk about freshman that can play around college basketball Ibuko Cory one of many Look at this move Let me get right sweep underneath the defenders arm Ill take that one plus one more when we get back Deckerhoff cheering And please welcome back Hall of Fame head coach Lion Hamilton Lets welcome back all these great seinals And its time for tonights truest seat upgrade Congratulations Stanford enters today very much on the bubble One of Joe Lonards next four out The ACC vastly different this year where theres plenty of quad one and quad 2 opportunities and they still have Iuka Okori despite the injury to Chisum Okara But have teams figured something out over these last three games where its been just Oori and no par Well theyve been taking away his space And before those three games it was the 369 assist explosion against North Carolina And North Carolina gave him too much room to operate Since then teams are crowding his lanes making him see multiple bodies And its an adjustment process for a freshman who has always been a really good player and facilitator but being the primary scorer Im not going to say is new to him but a little bit different How about Wiggins continuing to play physical He wanted to play a little bully ball that time Able to draw the foul Its on Hilt Hilt is not small I I realize hes a freshman Hes got wide shoulders and hes got a big build And Wiggins took it right to his chest to get the foul 15 points a game high for Wiggins Make it 16 An excellent free throw shooter Thursday its a womens basketball double header Its the play for K double header here on ACCN UNC Clemson at 6 Florida State in Raleigh to take on NC State All to honor legendary head coach Kay Yao who won 737 games in her career Florida States done a nice job today of changing their look showing pressures different kinds of defenses When we talked to coach LS about that are you going to change things up and make things difficult He said We have to vary up our coverages against a player of Okoris ilk So far today its working And there have been a number of possessions where Okori hardly touches the ball or doesnt touch the ball right And a lot of that is recognition where his teammates need to realize like hey this guy has a mismatch And hes one of the quickest guards in college basketball when he has that mismatch But you better guard Benny Giler Geler hit five threes Wednesday night Misfires applause Jones aggressive in the first half McGee he can shoot it and he knocks it down Thats what he does Drexel transfer can fill it up from beyond the arc but terrific pass by Jones Oh Cororey gets space on the step back Left it short Battle for the board to Somerville Id like to see Stanford space it out a little bit more Give him more of an opportunity to get downhill Hes settled for a lot of jump shots AJ Swinton whos seen more minutes of late no good The activity level is terrific That was not close and Stanford shot it well early on Not so much since seven of 22 now for three as we get a whistle I I mean but its not just the primary defender Its everybody else behind it as Geler tries to get in front Need to take that to the chest Not legal guarding position Good job AJ Swen being aggressive cop But everybody for Florida State knows exactly where the ball is The attention to detail on that end of the floor has been spectacular Benny Geler as he told us at shootound today is up for the Heisman Trophy which is the honor that goes to the top Jewish collegiate athlete in the country And you know we asked him about it and he said Hey would love it if you could pump it up on the air It would mean a lot to my mom So the award is sponsored by Manise Chevitz And there are two prizes if you will One theres a 10000 cash prize Benny said What matters to his mom though is the other part which is the winner gets to be on a special limited edition Matza box And I was hoping as we were telling the story that would have been his LA Heisman moment Wheeler misfires on both Gets it again Hes not shy No hes not shy I think he heard us Here comes Somerville Heads up cheering MCCRAE FOULED Head or neck situation And I would be shocked if we dont go and take a look at this for a potential flagrant one Were going to take another look at it right now Terrific in transition as Den Smith comes across the top And they are theyre going to go back and take a look at it And I do think going for the ball initially but Den Smith doesnt quite have the vertical ability to contest that one Previous play is under review for a potential flagrant foul And I think this ones going to I think this one does is necessary to call the flagrant one And it and its not intention to hurt Thats not whats under question here I think it is excessive It is head or neck To me this should be a flagrant one called It didnt really seem like there was anything malicious about the No But how about back to the original point getting a stop and running They take off down the left side of the floor The quick cross puts the defense in a bind And then the ultra aggressive and ultra athletic Robert McCrae able to attack the rim as the Florida State faithful not happy with how that looks And the officials Tommy Morsy Justin Porterfield and Trey Styons all talking about it Paul on the floor stands It is a common foul Common foul to So you got the explanation from the officials They say the cause of the shot to the head was a result of him trying to finish on the other side of the basket So not sure I agree or disagree right there Leave that for the viewer to decide I thought it was playground I cant even do that No cliffhanger I was waiting laughter I was waiting and Im saying All right you know youre a social media guy in traffic and decibb Cant help myself No but I I love the aggressive mindset of Florida State Theyve been assertive Theyre taking the first best shot not passing up good looks but its been this side right here Tomas Basson Look at him on the ball And his defense has made a difference Hell take doubled and they get Somerville on the reach His second foul I love the activity level And those are fouls sometimes youre willing to live with Youre swarming to the basketball The offensive player turns his head Meanwhile Stanford 0 for its last six all of them threes And now the inbounds pass is tipped Seinals running McGee Its a 100 run by Florida State and theyve got their largest lead of the game at 17 And look at everybody behind Steen right now Look at the bodies Look where theyre looking Everybody focused on Okorei closing down to his airspace Another three Dennis Smith need it Threepoint shot has not fallen 7 for 26 And Stanfords offense in hibernation here in Tallahassee A 100 run for Florida State And theyre getting it like this out in transition And Kobe McGee starts on one side ends on the other A little spin cycle before the break Introducing Sports Center for you Personalized Introducing Sports Center for you Personalized every single day Now available on the ESPN app Powered by your favorites Florida music State 17point lead is the largest lead theyve had in an ACC game this year The great Chuck Walsh longtime Florida State sports information director walking by our broadcast position letting us know he skipped over here Anish he is as good as they come Theres only one guy like Chuck and its Chuck One of calls me before every game Got your hand Alex Steen cheering heard the call The lead is 19 And this Florida State team the last four games all came down to the final possession Theyre sucking the drama out of Stanford and the Civic Center for this one Up by 19 and 28 points in the paint The Cardinal just not able to get to the inside of the defense But there is Geler 43 threepoint shooter a former walkon turned captain Valadictorian of his high school with a 48 GPA If I would have mentioned the words 48 GPA when I was in high school my dad would have just told me to shut up I didnt think you could cheering do fractions and decimal points Le Jones with a chance for another threepoint play Say this youre Florida State When it rains or it pours or when its when it snows outside its raining in here though They are moving the ball so well Cutting hitting throwing guys open And Steen at the five spot gives them a little bit of something different as a passer and a decision maker Now its Luke Ls first season and we talked about the profile for Florida State They have taken the second most threes per game in the ACC They have made the fourth most threes per game but their percentage is near the bottom of the league 17th out of 18 Only BC is worse Thats the style that he wants to play And first year head coach he got a brand new team as Rahosi dunks at home Takes a little while Tio sometimes to get guys to buy into your system get guys comfortable in your system Too easy for Steve I mean they are just operating at a high level on the offensive end of the floor But I think a little bit of that too Anish is Luke LaS adjusting to the college game cheering right Hes been at the NBA level for so long and I think theres some standards at the NBA level that you just kind of come to expect the effort on a nighttoight basis These guys going to be pros every single night And its one of these things where in college you have to push for some of these things You have to demand effort on the defensive end of the floor And theres a bit of an adjustment process for a guy coming down to the college level And I say coming down because not everybody hears pros A lot of them are going to get paid like those Right now Florida State is living at the rim Its been matador defense from Stanford 17 assists on 26 made field goals for the Nolles Everything right now for Stanford too Theyre catching and holding Conversely Florida State knows exactly where to go to ball where to go with the ball on every possession Thats deep Ander knocks it down If youre Florida State though thats five on the shot clock Theyre out of options You live with that dont you A thousand Now the challenge for Stanford going forward is you know Faki has an off night Tio how do they compete Thats exactly right And you better be careful if youre Florida State right now because Stanford starting to get some stops and the floor is going to open up Great defense Heads up Another dunk for Florida State Its turned into Dunk City and Tallahassee He is so good at that O Cory a chance at a threepoint play Hes got 11 with a chance for 12 A number two scorer in the ACC This was a kid who was not anywhere near the top of the recruiting rankings as you see what Florida State has done Thats the story of the game off of the Stanford turnovers 18 points to five points off turnovers Thats the story of the game for Florida State so far Theyve been outstanding and they have the athletes when they get going to really finish I mean this has been a clinic on the offensive end of the floor Luke Laos I told you before this game I bought stock about when you and I did the Syracuse game five games ago Its heading in the right direction Theyre looking at a third win in four games after a one and five start to conference play That was bouncing our way I was ready Tio You had your hands ready I did N youre a shooter Uh laughter more of a lacrosse guy you know back in the day Okay I was the guy where I I could knock down a shot or two from the outside and then somebody would say D up on shooter Yeah And then you wouldnt hear from me again There you go Wow Thats as physical as Ive ever seen Chanty Wiggins play And hes done it multiple times Absolutely And the thing is his confidence grows He hits a couple of threepoint shots the defense closes out just enough and he turns into the assertive player And when hes that it changes his outcome dramatically You mentioned his potential Are we starting to see it in his senior year go kinetic cheering Took a while but yes Tuesday night ACC mens basketball double header Duke BC at seven pit at Virginia at 900 pm at JPJ Virginia those two great bigs and test Ritter Its a really fun team to watch It is and Ryan ODM all of a sudden you know theyre scoring 80 90 points Theyre playing with Yeah on the regularity on the regular I didnt think that was possible in Charlottesville And thats where they used to cheer Shot clock violations They still do that They do that Old habits die hard So first look at Jaylen Thompson coming into the game Kyle Smith looking for a spark somewhere O Cororey beats the shot clock Hes got 15 Thats his second three Wiggins from the corner Another long three by Geler And theres a rebound by Wiggins Now Wiggins when he played at Clemson played almost a hundred games at Clemson never had a 10 rebound game That was tipped Hes 610 Hes had a couple of double doubles this year Jones is fouled And if thats Cam its his third Dunk City in Tallahassee Giving you a reason to come inside folks I know its snowing a little bit outside but Florida State dunking everything today Moving the ball finishing above the rim and playing in transition Hey Robert McCrae show me what you got Florida assistant coach Michael Fly became a father yesterday at 2 pm to a beautiful baby daughter Julianne B One of the staffers was telling us that nobody drinks more coffee than Michael Fly Maybe 10 music cups a day Exaggeration sure Heavily caffeinated Im sure hes heavily caffeinated today But congratulations to the Fly family What a great name Julianne Be fly I suggested super laughter That didnt that music didnt go over Its not as nice No No A beautiful name Beautiful baby girl Lost in the suggestion box Yep Beautiful name Beautiful baby girl Congratulations Congratulations to the fly family How good is Lier Jones applause You were talking about in a break Anish when you watch Florida State to see a bunch of the teams in the ACC most of them this year Chanty Wiggins starting to figureing figure it out Le Jones finding his role as a doit all guy who can shoot the three take the ball to the basket McCraes been steady at the head of the snake and then the continued emergence of young players like Bong if Cam Miles can get going again And then you got Kobe McGee can shoot it Steam gives you energy Im not saying this is a tournament team Tio but theyve got a chance to make life miserable for maybe some of the top contenders down the stretch dont they I I think thats a great point I I do want to also emphasize the fact that Stanford without Chisum Makara they they dont have an inside threat So their biggest weakness interior defense hasnt really been tested as much today But I think the sheer activity level of what Florida State has out on the perimeter has really been exhibited And thats a tough shot and a tough make And it almost feels like thats what Stanfords going to need Theyre going to need Okorey to wear the cape every night to have a chance You know the insane part about this whole thing is you look at it and its like oh Cororey is he having an off day Maybe Hes got 18 points Yeah Six of 14 Most of it in the second half Nice set cheering Curl screen for a flare Big time 22 for Chanty Wiggins which matches a careerhigh Ugarwalls been quiet today Another three attempt by Geler Hes four of 12 from the field All of his shots from threepoint range Good decision And that thats kind of been a consistent so far at least this game for Florida State Wiggins open off the front rim Uggerwall cleans it up You were big on the pronunciation of Aggerwall today Listen I appreciate that Hes been cheering called Aggerwall for the bulk of his career And thats not how you say his name And when weve talked to him he made it clear Yeah its Auggarwal He was polite Didnt want to correct everybody but it is Ugarwall not Agarwal as its been said I had a little inside track on that one Yeah you did Yeah you did Our little dip and the basket is good So off night for Ibuka Okorei Hes almost on his average with 20 points 17 in the second half Thats kind of been the deal with him so far tonight though I mean over the last three games hes gotten big numbers but they havent been efficient to the tune of what Stanfords needed But I I mean hes relentless in his attack of the rim and we say Hey hes having an off night Hes seven of 15 three of seven from three but hes started to generate these points over the last 3 four minutes but such a special talent His composure when he gets to the rim is so good for a smaller guard Is there another guard college or pro that he reminds you of You know its difficult because hes pretty narrow but he gets to spots so well We talked to coach Kyle Smith about this exact thing and he says Jamari Buouay whos with the Suns organization now but I mean he has put up some monster games Oh WOW MCCRAE ALMOST BROUGHT down the house Hell get two free throws He caught a body almost How about the move beforehand And I appreciate Benny Gelers defensive intensity but look at this quick spin step back Might have been a trip Lets go up and try to finish this play I love the aggression from Robert McCrae the fifth How many brothers and sisters you say He is number five out of nine Got to find a way to stand out with that big family Exhibit A Attacking the rim 64 guard from Columbia South Carolina Thursday womens basketball double header Its the play for K double header UNCC Clemson at six Florida State in Raleigh to take on NC State at eight 14 points for McCrae right on his season average He made quite the opening statement for Florida State 17 assists a school record in the season opener against Alorn State Donovan Young wide open I like that action for Stanford You have Geler on the other side so you cant quite show as far as you would like but got to be able to knock it down Nice shot I think Robert McCra is interesting Hes always been a terrific athlete Its about cleaning up the finer points of the game for him man cheering welloiled machine today What is it about the Florida State offense Because weve seen back door cuts dunks at the rim open looks from three What is it thats making it go today Theyre so decisive I I think thats the one thing that has stood out today more than anything else Luke Lock sometimes it takes time like Hey guys Im going to give you some freedom but its not just when you have the basketball Its freedom as a cutter Its freedom to get open on the perimeter And then the decision needs to happen quickly And today theyve been really good with this And Luke Lows I Ive said it before Ill say it again Im going to continue to say it Buy stock now in Florida State cuz its going to happen Hes a terrific basketball mind Now youre starting to see it come together Steen one out of two The foul on Roi his fourth And remember Stanford doesnt have a ton of front court depth McCory so good at splitting double teams and he splits through the defense and a chance for a threepoint play If Stanfords got one last push its going to be Ibuka Okori to will them back 11point game 354 music to go Well get it to you after the game You know what I want to know from Taylor She went to Florida State Whats the last time they got snow flurries in Florida My question is music this Anish did she get any studying done at all Because when I got to Tallahassee yesterday and I looked out my hotel room window there was an EDM concert going on so loud Uhhuh that my sleep noise maker did no damage whatsoever You travel with a white noise machine No they had one in the room Oh they had one in the room So they knew better from the beginning Taylor did no homework No not a chance Iuka Okorei at the free throw line has messed around with 24 points and all of a sudden Stanford has closed to within 10 Florida State led by as many as 19 in this half I think Florida State they need two or three more quality possessions Do they have to score No But cant turn it over and open up the floor for Stanford They get it to single digits might be in trouble Young could not keep it in bounds Nine to shoot Wiggins has been the man of the match 22 points for Florida State Four threes McCrae with five Great pass Bass battle for the rebound and Wiggins able to draw the foul Crashing the boards A physical Wiggins Something different Hey nice pass though Robert McCrae Hes an Upward Stars kid Ill get to that in a second Goes baseline drive Baseline drift to Thomas Bass or Tomas Bassong A guy whos going to continue to improve But Robert McCrae the fifth this guy from Columbia South Carolina played for the Upward Stars for Kurt Wheeler and my main man David Bentley Uh this is a guy whos always been a terrific athlete And while Chanty Wiggins is a huge part to what Florida State does in my mind it all rides on how Robert McCrae plays He is handling the ball so much for this Florida State team and hes really improved Started his career at Wake Forest didnt get a ton of playing time under Steve Forbes transfers to Jacksonville in the AON and was terrific and now gets his shot back in the ACC And you see the best version of him is really really good Just a terrific athlete starting to put all the pieces together Geler fading away left it short and rebound to Florida State Jaylen Thompson in there for Stanford 24 in red Somerville Turns it over Here comes Okorei Hes got Geler on the wing Okorei blocked by McCrae McCrae stayed with him all the way Now Wiggins its been a career night for him 23 points cheering and McCrae will lead some more clock Shot clock down to six Turned over Thompson the steel hits the turbo boost and uses the window and Stanford within single digits Less than two minutes to play Got to take care of the ball Close out this game This is the next step for Florida State right Played really well over the last four Won two out of their last three If youre Florida State you need to close this one The last four games for the NLES have come down to the final possession Theyre up nine with 144 Time out Luke LS cheering cheering for a guy music it seems like weve been waiting Anishh to explode and put his game on the map Chanty Wiggins has finally found his rhythm as a basketball player His senior season were seeing a lot of different elements of his game Does he knock down threes Yes But its been his ability to play music with a certain physicality that has really stood out today Always been a terrific shooter Its been his assertiveness music getting to the cup We know he can do this but he has been good attacking the rim on the glass as a switchable defender And today with music 23 points on an efficient six of 13 shooting hes been terrific And he is tonights player of the game brought to you by Hardies Still 144 to go and Florida State has not made a field goal in more than 4 and 12 minutes Worth mentioning Hardys best breakfast biscuits in the game Okay for me anyway Ill have to try him out Good save cheering You got to get something good here Four to shoot McCrae able to draw the foul And its going to be on Okorei his third And one of the trends coming into this game Stanford fouls at the highest rate of any ACC team And theyve had some games where the free throw disparity has been massive In fact you look at their loss to Miami on Wednesday a game where they led by nine early in the second half Miami took 31 free throws Stanford only 10 plus 14 in the free throws made department today Florida States been to the free throw line 26 times about to be 27 Stanford only eight times Its a big difference And I think one of the big things is when youre undersized in the post and youre not the team to hit first youre going to get called for the most fouls And a lot of times like explain that hit first Well I mean if you look at someone like Jaylen Thompson meanwhile lost his shoe Hes trying to get his shoe on Theres Thompson That shoe was in all the way If youre the aggressor is kind of what Im getting at You have to be assertive to the rim You look at teams like Duke everybodys like Well they get a lot of free throws Sure its because Watch out MCCRAE STAND BY for Oklahoma That flight hadnt been cancelled Hes played above the rim a few times tonight Oh Cory on the cut so smooth Hes got 26 Hes got four 30point games this season He needs four more to get there music Florida State less than 43 seconds from another win Seven dunks tonight by Florida State Thats part of one by Robert McCrae I I mean talk about an athlete Parting of the Red Sea My man getting downhill Youre seeing some of the best versions of Robert McCrae tonight His athleticism his explosiveness with the ball and the game comes down to the bottom line right here Free throws 22 of 27 for Florida State Six of eight for Stanford Stanford settling for a lot of threes And out of those eight free throws Okori has six of them You have to find other ways to get to the foul line And I think Florida States going shotgun right here A quick trap Its a triple team and McCrae back to the foul line I think another part of that you said it was their seventh dunk right Like thats another part of the assertiveness that Florida States played with today to go along with all those free throw attempts Weve come to know them as a threepoint shooting team The most attempts this that and the third Today theyve taken 23 threes to Stanfords 34 It changes how you have to guard this team We also saw a bit of a shift in how Florida State approached this matchup Florida State takes more than half of its shots from three Yep Today it was almost a 6040 split in terms of twos being the majority of shots versus threes Well I mean 38 points in the paint and thats a huge deal for a team that likes to shoot the three You have to be able to collapse the defense and if they dont you have to make them pay And hes quick Oh Cory about the follow by Hilt And a timeout will take one two 305 remaining in regulation Seinals music by 10 Heat Heat to our earlier point This is what we talked about with Florida States profile as an offense Heavy threepoint shooting team and not necessarily the most efficient threepoint shooting team but today we saw a little bit of a philosophical change Well I think there was a general respect for what Kyle Smith and Stanford does from a coaching perspective right They understood coming in this game Florida State they shoot a lot of threes and I think Florida State countered hey theyre going to attack us on the perimeter Were going to be able to find gaps in the defense to get around the rim right And we talked about it 38 points in the paint Not typical of what Florida State has been this season mostly relying on the three 55 field goal shooting tonight You said it at the beginning of the broadcast This seinal stock was one that youre buying The price buy low just went up again Thats exactly right Get it on the way up music Im not saying Florida States crypto but Im not not saying it laughter Almost looked like Stanford was in between whether they should foul leads to a turnover Wild shot Geler The put back by Heiltece the freshman from Belgium and a chance for a threepoint play Its simply amazing to me Anish how a team can play so well and yet at the end of the game always give a coach some film to go through laughter I mean Florida States played terrific basketball today Defensively theyve been outstanding on the offensive floor up to these last what two two minutes and change have been really really good But theres some things to work on today especially when dealing with a lead cheering applause Kyle Smith wondering if is that a play that he can challenge He can Thats not a reviewable play Ball out of bounds but looks like they got it right 136 to go That should do it McCrae dribbles out the clock Clear the spear Florida State has now won three out of four Theyve won backto back games
