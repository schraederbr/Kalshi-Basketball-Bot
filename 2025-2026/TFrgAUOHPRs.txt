Hes also coached at New Mexico State and Cal State Northridge Ready to go on this Thursday night here at the Watskco Center Nice crowd filing in And the first possession will belong to Bethun Cookman HDI Willoughby Johnson and Rusen the starting five for the Wildcats Donaldson Washington Ray Newu Henderson and Ud Jr out there for Miami Hurricanes led by their first year head coach Jay Lucas First shot of the ball game is no good The attempt by Daniel Rousan First possession here for the Miami Hurricanes One on Monday 8669 I want to see Trey Donaldson be a little bit more aggressive on offense Last game hes such a team players team Oh my goodness I couldnt even finish my sentence Malik Renu with authority to start this one for Miami Like we said last game dont let him go left Went left bang on your face Renu had 20 points on Monday He was Miamis leading scorer 15 shot No good Off the back of the iron Rebound down to U Udays new name for me is about to be called Pogo Stick The way he gets up and down for those rebounds is crazy Now Rayu backing down his defender into the paint Draws a foul That is on Rousan Boy heres another look at the dunk Scatter report should always be do let do not let Renu go left Theyre letting him go left He can go right but dont let him go left Shoot that right away Three in the corner is good Five nothing Miami See last game we didnt see Trey Donaldson step into his shot right away and letting it fly Hes such a team point guard Why he wants to get his teammates involved He needs to let the ball fly because when he makes a shot it gets the team going Miami was just three of 14 from distance in game one Already one for one tonight Out to an early five nothing lead on the Wildcats Theres Willoughby working on Uday Little bounce pass to Rousan whos working on Drew Washington who had a terrific game one for the Canes One and done Uday down with the rebound Miami will come up the floor with tempo Heres Washington into the paint off the glass and good An early timeout by Reggie Theas He has seen enough I love true Washington and fast break He can get the ball Seven nothing Miami early after the 32nd timeout by Reggie Theus fifth year head coach and the 13year NBA veteran Not happy with his team just a couple of minutes into this one Here is Hedi working on Shelton Henderson the true fivestar freshman Offbalance floater no good Offensive rebound by Rousan Second chance opportunity and Jordan Johnson the guard out of West Palm Beach is fouled Hell head it to the free throw line So here is a look at the head coach fifth year Reggie Theus Also coach told you New Mexico State and Cal State Northridge Hes coaching in his 353rd career game tonight The ninth overall pick by the Chicago Bulls in 1978 a twotime allstar in 13year career and he amassed over 19000 points in the NBA You know one thing I love about these hires at these levels is you get a guy like Reggie Theas great player but also a great networker You know you want to hire guys that have a great network You look at Bthoon Cookman If you look up you know Charles Balkad a million dollars to this program not because he loves Bthoon Cookman but he loves Reggie Theas Thats what its about You want to get guys that have a huge net worth Your net worth is your net worth And right now were talking about basketball but net worth is in basketball the same way it is in business Looking for Reggie Theus to do big things for this Spoon Cookman team this year Reggie Theus not happy with the officials The officials tonight Ron Guber Bill Cington Jr and Joe Schwitzer So they say on the foul that there was no attempted shot Shot clock will reset here to 20 seconds 1737 left to play in the first half Just underway Miami with a seven nothing lead You know one thing you look about this University of Miami basketball team youre thinking about Jay Lucas you know being the associate head coach and being the head of defense He has this University Miami basketball team playing so hard on defense Its almost like they love defense more than they love scoring the basket And that breeds champions When you love defense thats how you win He was extremely complimentary of his team after the win on Monday He was asked though for a defensive grade He gave him a D said theres a lot to work on The D you know hey look when youre when when you specialize in defense no pun intended the defense starts with D but he knows how much defense affect games and he understands Hes thinking about late in March when its tournament time Hes not thinking about right now Right now hes still trying to figure out his team but late in March defense needs to be an A or an A minus A Thats how you win games Malik Renu was just issued a delay of game warning Bthoon does indeed inbound the basketball 15 seconds left on the shot clock Johnson in control Goes left into the paint on True Washington Theres a foul bucket is good for Jordan Johnson The transfer in from the Swack Institution of Southern Louisiana You know what they call this layup right here for all the basketball junkies Thats called a inside reverse Going left Youre thinking youre going up with your left No were going inside with the right hand Shout out Raphael Chilis for showing it me and Derel right Former Miami Miami Heat player the inside reverse layup cheering Great layup Great shot for any guards out there looking for some skill work Bun on the board Jordan Johnson had six points in 24 minutes at Auburn on Monday He did draw four fouls He was in foul trouble 7 to3 Miami nearly 3 minutes into the contest To the basketball junkies watching that first offensive play of Miami We had Sheldon Henderson coming off an Iverson cut Two screens at the elbow Guard comes across Its called Iverson cut Im giving you guys game tonight Theres a beautiful hook shot for Renu whos got four early points Two of two from the field Now Johnson back inside Johnson with a little scoopy whoop whoopdedoo scooped West Palm Beach Florida native cact connected on 35 of his threepoint attempts over the past two seasons in Baton Rouge at Southern Donaldson up top for Uday A little bit too strong and unable to collect his own offensive rebound So back in transition here comes Bethoon Thats a wild shot that time And Jacobe Hedi the senior out of Chicago wanted the foul didnt get it And now Trey Donaldson in transition Stops Henderson to Washington for three Too short Great swing Great extra pass Didnt make the shot but I love the ball movement by the University of Miami right now Deep three from the wing Good Jacobe Hetty Jacobe Hedi Great rotation on that shot from distance Started his career at Wabash Valley College in Illinois Played there for two seasons before transferring to BCU That shot is good Count the bucket and a foul for Trey Donaldson Its great to see Trey Donaldson getting it going early We watched last game He was being a little tentative on offense wins games and Draymond said defense wins games So at the end of the day I think Jay is on Draymonds side Defense wins basketball games Trey Donaldson to the free throw line coming out of the TV timeout before we took a break He connected on a shot up close and he was fouled So he connects on the threepoint play I love to see Trey make his couple first couple free throws If you watch last game a lot of his free throws were short He got the ball over the rim knocked it down As your point guard you need the ball to go in the basket from the free throw line Shelton Henderson nearly had himself a takeaway Okay And now Bethun Cookman has numbers Deep three no good for Saka Willoughby Trey Donaldson with six early points for the Kings Six of the 12 Half of them Rayu fades away just inside the free throw line That shot no good Now back the other way quickly is Bethon Cookman And the shot was good by Rousan Great pass in transition Throw it up Let the big get it Finish Trey Dennis is playing with a different type of bounce today You could tell he wasnt happy with his performance last game Not saying that he played bad but hes coming with some some more girth this basketball game Thats what you want to see from the starting point guard He had a slow night on Monday 11 points four assists and four turnovers Got himself in a foul trouble Never really got into any type of rhythm as Rans got another pair Hes got eight already tonight Look for a 20 plus game from Trey Donaldson tonight About two minutes into this one Reggie Theas called the timeout when Miami raced out to a seven nothing lead And the Wildcats have had a lot more energy since as Donaldson is fouled again Hell head back to the free throw line And youre right thats a different Trey Donaldson out there so far about 6 minutes into this one Super different Hes been very very aggressive Once again Trey Donaldson has always been the ultimate team point guard and and it varies depending on what team youre on Right now University of Miami basketball program needs their point guard to be aggressive Needs to get shots at the basket Hes being aggressive Hes got to make these free throws Lets see what happens right now You cannot fall short in the free throw Hes a perfect three of three from the field Now hes a perfect two of two from the free throw line as our Morris the Richard Jr guard out at Dallas checks in for Bethon Cookman And the true freshman Dante Allen who had a slow night on Monday Well check in for Miami I really love Dante Allens game Strong defender understands how to play basketball played at Riviera Prep before he played at Montford won a couple of championships under Tony Shabbaz Great player great athlete Well Jay Lucas said on Monday after the game he used the words heartbroken when talking about Dante Allens night Said he had such a good preseason wanted to see something fall He was held scoreless Heres a really D3 This is NBA territory And Jacobe Hedi buries it Jacobe Hetti is shooting that ball with confidence He from hometown of Chicago You know all the Chicago basketball players have supreme confidence and you see it right now early from Jacobe Haden Kathun Cookman within one Rayu spins in the paint Hes got another pair at six Did he go left on that shot Did he go left Yes he did I have to understand or I have to know if youre a coach whats got to report Send him left He can go right but hes strong left A little over 13 minutes left to play in the first half And Morris got Allen off his feet but then he had it stripped away Drake Donaldson with 10 early points That shot was blocked Here comes Johnson Another deep three Too strong Shelton Hendersons got the rebound Si Alt Tunas also into the game for Miami Henderson foul Hell go to the free throw line I love how Son Henderson gets the ball in transition Hes so strong and he goes downhill He doesnt go east west when he drives to the basket Once again Im giving on a young Bucks game You cannot go east west on your basket Go north south Go downhill Get to the basket Draw the foul Shelton Henderson played almost 22 minutes in his collegiate debut on Monday Was six of eight from the field Had 15 points Ricky Mitchell Jr and Ariel Bland check in for the Wildats And Marcus Allen is into the game for the first time for Miami So Malik Renu will take a seat Henderson missed the front end Makes the second Miami leads by four Shelton Henderson on Monday was one of 13 true freshman nationally to score at least 15 points while shooting 75 or better from the floor For the people out there watching I want everybody to watch Antonio Morris Hes at cheering Kansas and was at Texas Supreme Guard Look for him to be super aggressive early Another deep three is no good Petty has got unlimited range and he is not scared to shoot Dante Allen looking to get on the board for the first time in college and he does Great move Cut the ball went downhill One zero Fin with left hand Hes learned to play basketball the correct way No wasted moments Caught the ball straight to the basket Fin with his left hand Layup Now weve got a tie up underneath the basket And I think theyre going to get Elutas for a foul going over the back of Quenton Penny who is the younger brother of Jacobe Henny Look at this catch Catch rip layup Thats how you play basketball the right way Once again Jack Clinton getting the Young Bucks game Catch the ball rip to the basket finish You dont need to dribble through the legs behind the back Catch the ball and rip Smooth layup Great move by Dante Allen Real coach Ernest U checks back in for Miami Baseline out of bounds here for the Wildcats And the lob was nearly taken away by True Washington Deep three and Artario Morris came up terribly short Shelton Henderson trying to go coast to coast Kicks it out Dante Allen deep free and he bar Great move You know one thing as a former basketball player I always say try to get your first basket at the basket for a layup and opens everything up You get a layup the next shot is a pain three makes a three Great driving kick Great shot Its an 80 run for Miami over the last couple moments Catch the ball you dont have a shot you swinging Catch the ball you do have a shot shooting Artario Morris to the free throw line for Beth coming out of the timeout It was Morris who drew the pivotal foul on Monday night at Auburn He made all three free throws to send the game to overtime A halfcourt heave He got fouled He made six points in the final 5 seconds and Auburn did hang on for a 9590 victory But Morris makes a pair coming out of a timeout So its 2417 And now the Wildcats will pressure Miami a little bit Tim Malovitz in the game for the Canes wearing number 88 Shout out Michael Urban to number 88 You got it One of a trio of Europeans and newcomers for Miami Drew Washington drives hard Hes got it I love Drew Washington going downhill Super athletic and hes a lefty When youre a lefty you got a tricky finish Theyre not used to somebody going up with the left hand Foul on the floor That was not on the shot but Artio Morris draws the foul Heres that tricky finish by Drew Washington All the finishes that weve seen from the wing from University of Miami have all been off one dribble The key to basketball less is more Keep it simple When you make your shot you pop it like a pimple Im rhyming now but at the end of the day finish keep it simple Limeys committed five fouls Bethun Cookman has committed four Miami leads by nine Three on the way for Johnson is short An offensive rebound And it was Hedi who tried to throw the ball off of a hurricane The Canes come away with it Dante Allen running the point now out there with Malavvic Washington Uday and Allen underneath for Dante Allen Hes got seven Great play Swing upstream come down find your man Easy lift Great basketball with University Hard drive and a block by U Great defense by U He got beat off the crossover but the help defense allows the offensive player to switch his hand so they can get back for it blocked Great team defense Ariel Bland who challenged the Miami defense and he ended up right in the arms of Marcus Allen and Ernest Uday Jr blocked by Uday Thats his first is inbounded down low in the paint and Rousan puts it up Shot was missed Second chance opportunity for the Wildats That shot too strong A second offensive rebound That was by Rousan the 68 senior out of Las Vegas And thatll send him to the line for two shots Sali Altunas back to the scorers table ready to check in for Miami So Rousan to the free throw line an all swack player last season cheering averaged 143 points per game and 63 rebounds in conference play Trey Donaldson and Alumas backed into the game for Miami Dante Allen will take a seat but he was greeted by his head coach Jay Lucas who had some encouraging words for him Thats what you want to see as a player when you come out the game You dont want to just cheering come out of the game and just sit on the bench You want your coach to say something to you Build your confidence sit back down When you go back in game youre ready Ran makes half of them Miami leading by 10 That was poked away Here come the Wildats with numbers Here goes Jordan Johnson Kicks it back out for Morris who misses the three And here come the Canes Here goes Trey Donaldson HES GOT 10 THAT WAS swatted away but theyre going to say goalending So give Donaldson two more Hes got 12 I thought he was going to bang out on that one Sneaky athletic player And Paul did hit the backboard first And heres a fabulous look at Yes indeed Goending 308 Miami Under 10 left to play in the first half Good look down low to feed to Jordan Johnson but he was blocked Great defense Now a three by Ricky Mitchell Jr is good Thats what happens when you make a great defensive play You dont get the rebound Offense gets it back You give up an open threepoint shot Boy before that shot was made by Beth Cookman They had not made their last 10 shots from the floor Miami responds with a pair Malik to the right Maybe I was wrong You say send him left He finishes with his rights One thing about Malik he has a very very soft touch around the basket And Jay Lucas said pretty unequivocally postgame Monday night hes probably going to be our leading scoreer every game all season long Thats a guy that theyre going to lean on Theres going to have to be a lot of other supporting cast characters but Ru is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting as True Washington steals that from Artio When youre not strong good to Malik Let him finish right on Q Give me a bucket Malik And hes fouled And hell go to the line Should I sing it again Great boys laughter Nice steal there by Drew Washington Great steal right there He kind of set that ball out Toriel Morris kind of set it He kind of knew he was going to go left to right Thats my boy Dante Drapers move Left to right cross He cant beat me oneonone but thats my boys move First time tonight to the free throw line for Ray New who had 20 points on Monday He was Miamis leading scorer He attempted 12 free throws on Monday Made 10 of them Great free throw shooter Yes he is When youre fouled as much as he does in the post you want to be able to make free throws and thats what he does Thats going to be a major plus for the University of Miami basketball team Shelton Henderson back into the game for Miami They lead by 12 Largest lead of the night Theres six of their last six from the field And Cookman just one of their last 11 from the floor Donaldson with 12 Ray New with 10 22 of the 34 points If you watch this game looks like Miami is up by a lot more Theyre only up by 13 points right now The game is still in grasp Good look down low and Ricky Mitchell Jr was fouled So theyll go to the free throw line Its going to be the seventh team foul already on Bethu Cookman and theyre under the bonus for the final 8 minutes and 27 seconds One of the things you want to see as a big man when a guard a smaller guard goes in you want to keep your hands straight up A lot of times when the ref sees your hands go straight up and go down theyre automatically going to call the foul If you just keep your hands straight up you have a better chance of not letting them call the foul Thats something Ive seen coach J Lucas preach in practice Keep your hands straight up The foul was Altunes and hes going to take a seat Its his second foul of the first half Marcus Allen backed into the game Mitchell made the first Hes got four points cheering The coaching staff was very very high on Marcus Allen last game Looked to be looked for him to be like a Swiss Army knife You know how Jay Luke was said in the press conference that Marcus Allen similar to their Draymond Green He had seven points in 23 minutes three rebounds and three assists Swings it to the left for Donaldson Heres Shelton Henderson beating and banging on Ricky Mitchell down low and he floats it up Too easy for the true fivestar freshman Too easy The fact that they ran a play for Chelton to get the ball in the post and go oneonone that shows you how confident they are in that kit Boy 15 points in his Miami debut Al Morris with a crazy shot thats going to get pulled down by Marcus Allen Here comes Trey Donaldson with a little bit of space Now Marcus Allen back to Donaldson into the paint Allen wide open three misses off to the right but Hendersons got the rebound Now Trew Washington will give it a go and he buries it Second chance opportunity for Miami One thing you see about Trey Donaldson he could have easily shot that three for the kick out but he found his teammate got his shooting guard going Chewy Watson lefty lucky lefty nothing but the bottom of the net Its the first offensive rebound of the night for Miami They had eight on Monday They had 16 second chance points Cookmans got six offensive rebounds Six of the 10 have been of the offensive variety Theres another Thats seven And heres a three And that is no good Ball rolling around the cylinder Its pulled down It was Johnson who missed the three in the corner 16point game Miami shooting 75 from the field Henderson misses Johnson with the rebound Thats something that scouts want to see Henderson do Knock down open three Hes still young Hes still having fun but thats the thing thats going to get him to the next level Oh boy Malik Renu just swatted that away You know what he said You know who Chris Brown is Give me that 625 to go The third block the night by Miami and give Ray knew another handle Look eighth out the gate Youre rhying Im Youre Youre picking up on my freestyling Yeah I play this Miami 10 can be a little higher than eight Well and theyre going to have to prove it And thats exactly what Jay Lucas is hoping his team is going to do And Ill tell you what they are proving that they can play better defense than they did on Monday night tonight 100 Deep shot Shot clock expiring Senica Willoughby the guard out of Philly buries a deep three Great shot Three is worth more than two Got to get a stop Got to get a stop 13th attempted threepointer by Bathoon Theyve made four Miami three of six from distance And thats an offensive foul Its a tough call right there but I love the way Sheltons aggression gets him downhill that makes the ref make a call That could have went either way Thats the third personal foul on Sally Alunis Every time that Jay Lucas has put him on the floor hes immediately drawn a foul So tough night for Altunas the forward and the freshman out of Istanbul whos been playing internationally for a long time Shout out Hedo Turaloo Thats his guy Bring him over here Shout out Hedo I was sitting next to him Hedo is very high on this kid and Im very high on him as well Find a way to stay out of foul trouble And now Shelton Hendersons going to get called for a foul Its going to be the ninth foul by Miami And Willoughby whos already got three points will go to the free throw line for the first time tonight So Kyle since we got a quick break if you had to play basketball you had to step on the court right now What player shoes would you wear first I want to see your style What whose shoes would you wear if youre the step on the court What number are you wearing and what team Uh hadnt thought about it Maybe Malik Renu They look pretty sweet Ah Spider Mitchell Not a bad shoe All right Its not a bad pick Its not a bad I like the color way I like the color Lets get back to the game Ask me next Ray New pulls down the rebound He gets fouled Go ahead Heres your time My time You know me you know Im a Kobe guy Im going to go Im going to go on Terry Morris Hes got the coes on Got the Got the Mamba on the side The snake mama mental Im had to go with that And he just look good Look good You play good There you go Play good Get paid good You sure do All right Miami leading by 13 A little over five minutes left to play Ray new with the basketball Hes got 10 Hes working on Ronan Donaldson whos got 12 is fouled And Miami is headed to the free throw line for a oneonone opportunity One and one Got to finish your bro I used to love when you get in the bonus I was I was talking to Coach Cy He said one of the things University of Miami wants to lean on is getting other teams in the bonus early Drive the basketball Get to the bonus early So every call every foul is a one and one but you got to make your free throws Miami is six of seven from the free throw line so far Bethun Cook been six of eight I did think it was interesting Jay Lucas said after the Miami 8669 win on Monday he said One of our goals is to make more free throws than the other team attempts Miami was 29 of 37 from the free throw line in the opener 100 If you want to make more attempts and the other team goes that means you have to draw fouls That is something that is very very very crucial for this University Miami basketball team to attack the basket and make the ref make a call so that you can get in the bonus and get free shots They dont call free throws for nothing Kyle And Donaldson misses the second Got to finish your breakfast I know its dinner time but you got to finish it Little over five minutes left to play The lead is 14 But Reggie Theas not happy with his offense right now as that one rattles in and out for Morris Dante Allen gives it up to True Washington Trey Donaldson works left and spins What a beautiful move but its taken away Think Donaldson wanted the foul Now heady on the other end cheering This is probably going to go well Hes looking to shoot the basketball right now Works back left Step back Three from the wing Thats I know a shooter when I see one I know a scorer when I see one Hand down Man down Give me the crown And the lead shrinks to 11 for Miami Hey trade a little razledazzle Tween tween bop bop Let me see you give me something HIGH SCREEN BY MALIK RAY Slammer jammer boy with authority Gives the crowd the building a little bit of life And a foul Hey I dont know why they do that when people dont dunk They go Hey why you think people do that when you get a dunk Talk to me Give me a second But why Hey say hello Playing great basketball right now I love the way Malik plays Hes got the high socks so I dont know about those but Oh maybe theyre not socks Maybe theyre like compression cap things Jacobe Heavy makes the first of two free throws coming out of the timeout Spent last season at Central Michigan before transferring back to BCU this past offseason This is Jacobe Heds second tour of duty He had nine points against Auburn and four rebounds and 28 minutes of play on Monday Hes got Bathoon back to within 11 Jeobi is coming in with supreme confidence Marcus Allen nearly threw that one away Look down low Trey Donaldson running around on the baseline The shot clock at five Donaldson nearly had it poked away by Morris So 4 and 12 seconds on the shot clock Well see what the Miami offense can do here Sideline out of bounds Look for the ball to go to Malik Renu going left for a finish Dante Allen looking Boy he threw it off the shoe of Jacobe Henny Hes probably lucky he did because he threw the ball in the wrong direction in which Trey Donaldson was going 100 Watch this Whoa Where was that puppy going That puppy was going to the other end Roof Roof You know why I said roof Roof Said puppy Wheres the roof though The roof Is it high Yeah Its above the rim That was about to be a dunk You got to stick You got to stay with me Kyle I dont think you I dont think thats hard to do And an offensive foul I think theyre going to get Malik Reu Its going to be his first foul of the half We talked about this game It looks like the Hurricanes are up by a lot Theyre only up 11 right now If Patun Cubman comes down gets a two or three Theyre down by eight or nine Its still three minutes left to go in the first half Heds got 11 Passes it off to Willoughby Works off a high screen by Bland Theres the younger Hedi looking for space in the baseline Hi Thats taken AWAY BY DONALDSON OH behind the back right to Dante Morris True Washington lays it up and in Great move in transition Im loving the throw play by University of Miami The guards get after it on defense and thats what you want to see Guards getting after it playing together clapping playing together clapping playing together clapping playing together Everything that Miami wants to do they want it to start on the defensive end And the lead swells to 13 once again Baseline drive That was swatted away Morris lost it Dante Allen will go to the free throw line Great pass Look at the whole team going to pick up Dante Thats a sign of a great team that loves each other A lot of times you I want everybody out there to watch other teams when somebody falls If they dont have four players going to pick them up team chemistry is off This chemistry is on point for this team A beautiful feed from Trey Donaldson So after being held scoreless in his freshman debut on Monday Dante Allen has seven points here tonight but he misses that free throw Hes made a three and hes three of three from the field He makes the back end The largest lead for Miami was 16 with 733 left to go and they led it 39 to 23 They lead 4531 with two minutes left to play Miami continues to crank up the defensive intensity Good ball movement here though by Bthoon but an errant pass by Quentyn Hedi It was taken away Donaldson up top to True Washington in the paint gets fouled One thing about you Washington if he gets in that paint that balls going up But one thing I do love to see he does know how to draw the foul Lets say we can knock down these free throws music What is Miami at the free throw line right now Whats their percentage Do we have that over here somewhere They are shooting 73 from the free throw line Theyre eight of 11 Bethun is eight of 10 Each team with 16 rebounds although an area in which Jay Lucas will probably not be thrilled Bthun Cookman Of their 16 rebounds nine of them have come on the offensive glass He was not going to like that True Washington Another miss You got to make your shots Sali Alumas with three personal fouls Well check back into the game for Miami and he replaces Malik Renu Every time I think about true Washington I dont know if its weird but I always think about Master P when I hear True Washington You remember TR uh Master P True to the game you know Oh my god Come on Come on True to the game Shout out Master P in New Orleans They made a TCU team No but I used to listen to Master P and True to the Game True I used to listen to that I always think about that when I hear Tree Washington TRU His parents must have liked Master P when they named him Miami lead back to 15 And Johnson is trying to get it down low to Onanina and that three is no good Miami pulled down another rebound Thats their 17th rebound of the half and a whistle on the floor Boy double technical So Artario Morris and Trew Washington are going to be assessed technical fouls Jay Lucas just looked at True Washington and said What you do What you do laughter And now Reggie Theus and Jay Lucas are chatting Come on True What you do Stay true to the game And now Drew Washington will step out and Teemo Malovich will come in Teemo Urban 106 left to play Miami inbounds the ball to Marcus Allen Beth Cookman hasnt scored in three minutes Here goes Trey Donaldson off the glass and good Great body control by Trey Donaldson right there to be able to go up find the contact and still make the layup with the left hand Well a tough finish for Trey Donaldson whos got 15 first half points leading all scores for either side Now Hetty being bugged by Malavic And here is Johnson with five on the shot clock They got the ball near half court Somebodys got to go Here goes Still looking to go still looking to go double team throws it up Shot clock will expire and the Miami defense forces a turnover with 22 seconds to go for the first half What do you think coach Jay Lucas is giving his defensive grade for this team right now B theres always room for improvement Paying attention to everything you say so be careful Attention to detail We got to we Oh that wasnt planned We got to play a lottery tonight Im playing it 33 33 33 33 13 seconds left to play in the half Miami outpacing Bethoon Cookman in the paint 266 6 seconds left to play Down to five and four Back in the paint Trey Donaldson with the bucket That shot no good Didnt get it off in time Miami makes the first shot of the game They make the last They lead by 19 at the recess stay important This first play of defense is very very important Being aggressive being in the right place high hands and speaking with your teammates is very crucial this first play on uh defense for Pat Cookman All right underway here in the second half Miami leading by 19 in the paint Drew Washington had it swapped away Shelton Henderson came up with it and hes fouled going up So hell go to the free throw line immediately You dont want to see that The first play coming out youre down 19 You want to be able to defend the basketball hands up You dont want to give a team free throws Have we ever did research on who came up with the term when you shoot a foul shot its called a free throw Why isnt they call a free shot Why they call it a throw Thats the third or fourth really good question youve asked tonight I dont know I would love somebody next game we need to do a poll ACC Network where we are right now Put it out Find out Yes Who created the term free throw Its a free shot Its not a throw Well we could change it Thats something youre interested in doing well change it Lets get back to the game Lets see whats going on over here A pair of free throws for Shelton Henderson Drew Washington comes away with a steal Trey Donaldson hands it off to Ray Newa to the basketball jugglers out there The last set that Bthoon Cookman is in Bthoon Cookman was in we call it a horn set You put two people at the elbow Great contact A strong drive by Jacobe Hetty but he couldnt finish So here comes Shelton Henderson in transition That young man is so strong he missed the layup And now a threeon two opportunity for Bthoon Will they settle for a three No Here comes Jordan Johnson with reverse layup off the glass Jordan Johnson thought he was Michael Jordan on that shot You should have just made the easy layup You went in you went on the other side with the right hand He finished it but thats a thats a tough shot Shout out to Jordan Johnson on that layup I probably would have missed that if I took that Would you make that or no Oh absolutely You would have made it or missed it Absolutely As easy as that layup for Malik Re Was he going left Hes going left laughter Lucky lefty I got to come up with a nickname with Malik Donaldson and Ray Newu have combined for 33 of Miamis 56 points I love the number 33 Okay Know somebody that might have had that number here It hangs up in the rafters Me too One of the best players I ever played at Miami I dont know his name but hes hes very good laughter Now Ray knew flying in that was blocked and a fouls called Was he going left or right He streak down the middle that time I think he might think he was trying to finish with the laughter right He got fouled though Hes going to the line Hes going to shoot the free throws with the left Almost looked like a clean block by Quentyn Henny And Renu will go back to the free throw line Hes got 16 Seven of eight from the field along with three rebounds Meanwhile Ernest U has been very quiet tonight Hes on the floor for Miami Hes got seven rebounds Hes only attempted one shot no points Theres Ernest They call him Big E You know one thing about Ernest he can affect the games without scoring the ball on offense Rebounds block shots being in the passing lanes talking being vocal and being that big physical presence that he is There may very well be nights where they need 14 and 14 from Mus Date There might be other nights where they need 12 rebounds He doesnt score but they still win the game Exactly Hit it on the head Tonight might not be one of those nights We need 14 and 14 Rayu made the first and he makes the second So now he surpasses Donaldson for a team high 18 points tonight So now Donaldson and Rayu have combined for 35 of the 58 points for the Canes Just a lot of scoring Open three in the corner and that was no good The attempt by Ricky Mitchell Jr the guard out of Colorado Up top Ernest Uday Jr with the flush in the alley Ernest Ude with the flush and throws the U up Its all about the you is what they say over here in South Miami or Coral Gables Theres Artario Morris got stuck One thing I loved about the Ernest Udo interview when they asked him about coming back to Miami he got very emotional about coming back to the homestead that he played in So youre going to see hes going to play with extreme passing for this basketball team Him and Malik Ray knew both as Shelton Henderson drives all the way but he cant finish Bit too strong at the rim Very strong Like he eats weights Strong right shoulder Yeah he got the contact Just finished Didnt finish He does not profile like a true freshman The bank is open for Daniel Rousan the senior out of Las Vegas and the transfer from Manhattan The crazy part is the bank closes Its 800 Its not open Well but its open for this guy Yeah I guess until about nine He shook his head like he does it all the time I want to see him do it again Great shot There goes Donaldson wide open True Washington Three ball on the way Buried it I love the rotation on Washingtons jump shot I always say the definition of an okay shooter is rotation The definition of a great shooter is the ball going in the basket Boy and dont blink now Miami has a 28point lead Yeah that D3 no good by Morris One and done go the Wildcats and Shelton Henderson had it taken away but Miami got it back and Trey Donaldson finished it And now a three and that is good for Jacobe Hetti Bit of a frantic pace here the last couple of minutes and we talked about the importance of the first four minutes for Bthoon They were very important and they didnt capitalize In fact Miamis really run away with this one now Theyve run away And that swung around the rim and fell out for Rayu And back the other way comes Hedi Did he finish it cheering Well see Well step aside Miami offense flourishing here tonight Henderson up top for U And then a wide music open true Washington Theyre great shooters You just got to be in the gym see the ball go in and come in cheering Jacobe Hetty goes to the free throw line Hes got 16 points for Bethun Cookman tonight Hes made four of his five threepoint attempts Hes also made all three free throws They did indeed say that bucket was good when we went to commercial break Trey Donaldson threw that off of the right shin of Ricky Mitchell Jr the transfer from the City College of San Francisco Aurora Colorado native won the California State Junior College Championship last season Well that was taken away Bthoon Cookman with a little bit of pressure defensively Now a threepoint opportunity is no good But an offensive rebound for Artio Morris and he puts it back up and in Looking at Artio Morris he had them Kobe Mama mentalities and he threw on the orange Kobes Lets see if the shoes make a difference He played a team high 37 minutes on Monday and now Marcus Allen has that blocked by Morris Morris had a double double 20 points 10 rebounds on Monday That three was too short One thing you can see with this Mun Coopin basketball team and Trey Donaldson continues to have the ball taken away from him and he was laying on the out of bounds line Out of bounds One thing you can see about this Mun Coopin basketball team theyre not running any offense Theyre coming down and shooting and jacking No pun intended to my basketball name or my name You got to get a good shot Move the basketball The universe praises people that move the ball Theyre coming down Dribble dribble dribble shot And theyre down 65 to 43 right now You want to see the basketball move to get a better look at the basket Doing a little housekeeping So sideline out of bounds here for Beth after they forced another turnover Miamis turned the ball over five times Oh beautiful look Its a great pass by Arttorio Thats a great pass And Ariel Bland with the flush Boy Miami is not taking all that kind here to the pressure Although heres a wide open look for Rayu but he had that one taken away Great hands Wow Thats one thing about the press Opposite side You got to sprint back I have a suspicion at the next timeout Jay Lucas might get into his guys a little bit Theyre not handling this pressure very well at all Theyre not at all The ball was out on the Wildcats and the ball is inbounded by Dante Allen to Marcus Allen The Allen brothers There goes Henderson Little contact Cant finish And U couldnt back put back the offensive rebound but he was fouled And hell go to the free throw line for two How many times do you see a big man with a single number Name one big man and No I want you in Its a quiz right now Name one big man has a single number I know one Let me see if you know one A big man Are you talking college or the pros or anybody in general Whatever Big man with a single number No I dont know Think really hard Im thinking about as hard as I can and nothings coming to mind as UD misses the first Oh Victor Wbeyama No its a good one See its the only one really But is he really a big man He might be a hybrid big man See you were wrong I was wrong I was wrong You just talked yourself into it and you were wrong No I wasnt sure Mari start Oh there you go Thats a great one Come on Is he a big man laughter Okay maybe not Ricky Mitchell Jr Ricky I thought you were saying Ricky Mitchell Im like no I dont know who that is I know who he is on the platoon but I didnt know hes a big man Alovitz down low for Henderson He got fouled The bucket is good Malovitz looking down low and Henderson wanted it He was calling for it He wants it And Malik Reu is back into the game for Miami And Ariel Bland is back in for Beth I got another question for you Uh oh What do you think about teams that dont have their names on the back of their jerseys Why do you think they do that Why do you think they do it Is there a reason behind it I would say so I would say the coach would either say we want you to play for the name on the front not the back or we got a money issue Right Right But dude doesnt have a money issue They got Charles Barkley gave a million dollars All right Sir Charles Sir Charles Shout out Charles Barkley So why dont they have the names on the back We got to ask We got to ask the Oh youre asking questions You dont have answers I dont have the answers Im ask I dont know Okay I know a lot of things I dont know this one Youre quizzing me I dont have an answer The inbounds goes to Rayu and he hits it off the glass and in You cant let him go left Oh we got Tristan Thompson in the building right now on the floor We got a Tristan Thompson in the building and Cory Joseph Lets get the camera on these Toronto guys shortly 6945 in favor of the Kings Here goes Morris That was blocked by And Shelton Henderson wants Jay Lucas to challenge this Its a new rule in college basketball You get a challenge this season If you win it you get another Jay Lucas still waiting for his bench And they wave it off They say No we dont want to take a look at it There was a more critical juncture here in the game A little bit closer Maybe they take a look Well take a look Who was it off of Hard to tell at that angle And you know what Miami has taken a timeout with 7 seconds on the shot clock So I got another question Its really max one kind of kind Yeah Im following what youre saying That was nearly taken away by Miami Artario Morris for three Shot clock winding down Its no good And an offensive rebound for Hedi And the ball was off of Miami Boy Jay Lucas is not happy They just gave up another offensive rebound Thats their 25th of the night and their 13th offensive rebound Hes not happy No he was he was just hollering at his guys to rebound the basketball Got to rebound the basketball Look at his face Dead stare Great D Teemo Irman I like this kid a lot The Slovakian freshman the forward Teimo Malovic I love Malovic I love the fact that he has 88 Hes got to swing that basketball right there 14 on the shot clock Morris hits the deck able to pick it up is Hetti with a little bit of breathing room Free throw line extended up and under What a beautiful move Thats a heck of a move by Jacobe Hedi right there Thats a very tough two points Love that move by Heddi A lot of times you look at players drive to the basket Check this two feet stop step through Thats an underrated basketball move to all the youngans or the basketball junkies Remember you have an extra step after you finish off two feet Step through Finish at the basket Filet made 31 appearances Did Heddi started 26 games last season in the MAC at Central Michigan Heres Ray New DRIBBLE DRIVE LEFT SIDE HE TOSSES it up top for Ernest New Dribble drive left side Was that a rhyme for me or did you already have that in your mind That was for you Thank you Appreciate it 7147 Miami now and thats a turnover No Ricky Mitchell Jr takes it back Itll be Baton Basketball Miami is up 7147 and theyre playing like theyre down 71 to 47 Thats the definition of a championship basketball team It doesnt matter what the score is were still going to play like were down I love to see it with any program in the country Play like youre down Dante and Marcus Allen check back in for Miami now with 1230 left to play Theyre trying to get some of that sweat off the floor in front of that Boom Cookman Wildcat bench Reggie Fas head coach fifth year also serves as the athletic director for the Bethoon Cook and Wildcats Whats your thoughts on that Head coach and AD Well I think its very admirable to be quite honest with you Im sure thats very difficult to do but its the right guy for the job Its kind of like Doc G He was the head coach and he was the president of the team right Yeah Well I think within reason I think thats thats fair Howd that go for him Not great Im not saying Im not saying its good or bad Im just if you trying to juggle too many hats its like in business youre trying to do so many things right A lot of business people say Oh you got to focus on one thing I dont agree with that I feel like you should if youre creative you should be doing multiple things I hear it I hear it What do you think I Youre right All right Cool Thanks K You finally You agree with me on one thing I appreciate that Once in a while Once in a while Thats all we needed once in a while All it takes is one right All it takes is one Pin down screen to the pick and roll Great finish Donaldson with an open look and a shooter stop Donaldsons got 21 tonight Oh 19 Oh 21 21 Team high 21 points for Trey Donaldson Jacobe Hedi has a team high 19 for the Wildcats Hes got the basketball He just shook Henderson off of him and the shot is no good And Shelton comes down with a rebound in the paint Two feet with a little stop and that is goalending offensive You saw Jays face right there Timeout on the floor 1138 left to play and the Canes are up big He almost had big fell Hes got a vision He is defensive minded And then well see how things start to shake out for Jay Lucas here in Miami in year number one His hurricanes are up big on the Wildcats who took Auburn to overtime on Monday They lost 95 to 90 But game two a much different story here tonight for Beth Cookman Theres a foul Thats on true Washington And Dante Allen is going to sub in for TR Stay true to the game Hes got four Got to stop hacking When you slacking you hacking Come on TR Shout out Dell right Why not Thats Russell Westbrooks team Why not Huh Thats Russell Westbrooks AU team Why not Really Oh he like sponsors the team Yeah True play for them Oh nice California And theres a foul on Dante Allen Allen a little bit too much with the body Little bit too much body Too much for the third foul by Miami Beth Cookmans already committed six I got another question for you You know what an underrated trade is of basketball Stand by Here goes Trey Donaldson Donaldson Doesnt get that any easier that for Donaldson whos got 23 points now Sneaky athletic Are you ready for an underrated trait in basketball Mhm Theres the dunk Lets see the dunk first Sneaky athletic And he hung on it The underrated trait in basketball I think is baseline out of balance plays Theres a lot of teams that struggle Think about how many times you get the ball at the baseline out of bounds If you run a correct play you can get eight to 10 points a game on that Really most teams lose by 8 to 10 points Well a lot of teams too baseline out of bounds will just throw the ball into the back court chuck it down to the other end of the floor to see if they can sense that I hear you I hear you Insert a lot of energy on your baseline out of bounds play and get you If you can score every time you can score 70 of the time thats 6 to eight points So heres I guess here would be my question for you What in all of your experience Jack what are the key to those plays Is it is it generally a simple screen Like whats the key to scoring on a baseline The key to scoring on the baseline is the key to see the defense is going So its its preparation to the scout Okay this team plays a lot of manto man Were going to box it up Were going to exit Were going to go to the corner Were going to find our cutter The end of the day I think its preparation Wide open look for Marcus Allen and he misses it Onanino with the rebound for the Wildats Theres our Terio Morris Hes got four points Hes one of 11 from the field tonight Well good passing there for Bthoon And now a Miami player is hurt That is Shelton Henderson whos hurt for Miami Thats the last guy that the Canes want to see hurt Last people we want want to see Hes going to get a little bit of assistance coming off the floor Watch Henderson Oh quick ankle Hell be good Hes built like a horse Hes straight Be back tomorrow He just told Jay Lucas hes okay but in these lopsided affairs You dont want to see anybody get hurt So Jacobe Hedi who has a team high 19 points for Bethun Cookman will go to the free throw line or no baseline out Heres heres your baseline out of bounce play Lets see what they run right now Lets see if they run a play to get a shot They get each side the basket Eddie looking and he gets it into Rousan I didnt love the play They got it They got it in there though And here goes Jaylen Johnson And hes got that swatted away by Uday What do I say about that Give me that Chris Brown Dante Allen D3 No good Missed it too far off to the right This is going up Trust me I know a squirrel when I say one Its going up Thats off the fingertips of Allen and it will be Wildcats basketball Heres another look at the block Block by Pogo stick You see how Dante Ellen got that ball and didnt put it on the ground He just threw it right up the court The pass moves way faster than the dribble Let the ball go All the young kids are the basketball junkie Stop dribbling and pass the ball Willoughby with a wide open Johnson and thats not going to fall in for a good look Not a whole lot more that Jaylen Johnson could do that time or Jordan Johnson I beg your pardon Wide open Malik Rayu Hell give it a go from three No good Gets his own rebound He puts it in Wow So you miss a shot collect a rebound and get an easy dunk Hes got 22 Donaldsons got 23 Those two have combined for 66 of Miami scoring tonight And that is a turnover And Miami has been relentless defensively They are not giving up on the defensive end Up 30 I got a feeling that Jay said Yall better play hard the whole game Theyre up 30 right now Theyre still playing like theyre down 30 or down 10 Playing with supreme intensity And you want to see that in a basketball team New beginnings You want to see them playing like this the whole game because thats the way youre going to have to play in March if you want to win Dante Allen running the point for Miami Heres Malovitz Hell fire away for three and he got it kind of winds up behind his head Not a whole lot of rotation on the basketball but the European out of Slovakia is a fabulous threepoint shooter Shot 36 12 from threepoint range last season internationally And that spinning hook shot is good for Rousan Ran he hit the bank shot Great footwork great finish around the basket Hes always got the extras after he makes a shot Shaking his head every time he made it Malovitz again Tried to feed it down low for U but he got his bad pass back Well he kind of spins one up there Collects his own rebound Then he has it go off his leg Here comes Senica Willoughby in transition And he lays it up and in Theres a whistle on the floor And again theyre going to have to clean up some of the sweat down there on the baseline Willoughby took a bit of a tumble after he made that Fullcourt pressure here from the Wildats Dante Allen in charge of things right now Under eight minutes left to play I really like to see how Dante Allen plays the point guard position Wow Great basketball by University Miami That was perfect Thats started by Dante Allen and a beautiful feed and a lob from Renu to Uday The third time tonight theyve connected on that alley Great basketball A lot to like there for Miami from that sequence Wow how about that rejection by U Uday said no way And now Allen up and under with a left hand Thats 10 for Dante Allen in his second game in college Ernest Uday wants the crowd to get into it a little bit Hes having quite the night Started with the flush after a terrific Play basketball the right way Guys that can play basketball the right way go a long way Shout out to Malik Renu Had 12 in the first half Has 10 in the second Just so efficient every time he touches the ball Seems like he scores All lefty players are efficient Name one lefthanded basketball player thats not efficient Well actually Kyle name one hand left Name one lefthanded basketball player The first man comes to your mind Um hold on Let me think First one comes to your mind bro Could be anybody I dont know I think about it You put me on the spot Its hard My bad My bad Thats what we do You know that We know We do that Jump shot No good I dont know Id have to think about it True Washington for three in transition Give me a couple names Id think of I dont know Just keep thinking about it And Malovich has his man tied up on the baseline Thats offensive Come on You still thinking Give me something Thats up to you at this point You got to pick up a teammate Name somebody lefty The first lefty comes to your name Lamar Odum Lamar Odum Did you say Lamar ODM cuz Tristan Thompson is here Thats right You did Okay Its a good one Lamar was a great basketball player Rhode Island Great player One of the coolest lefthanders Ive ever seen 8451 A little over six minutes left to play Trey Donaldson with a team high 23 points for the Gates tonight Now Shelton Henderson was banged up a little bit I guess well see if hes back at some point or if theyre content letting him rest for the rest of this game Here goes Dante Allen again up and underneath the basket with a left hand Great move by Dante Allen right there Hes got 12 Five of six from the field is Dante Allen So after not scoring in his collegiate debut on Monday hes in double figures here tonight Theres a foul on the floor and thatll send Senica Willoughby the senior out of Philadelphia to the line Im loving what were seeing from the freshman Dante Allen right now Youre looking at the guys that the first game they didnt have bad game but they didnt have the best game Youre seeing the guys like Trey Johnson Dante Allen come in extreme aggressiveness and finishing at the basket Thats what you want to see Its not about how you play its about how you respond to how you play cheering Going to answer my own question Shelton Henderson is sacked to check back in for Miami Bro look at him Hes built like a Mac truck Yeah hes fine Drink a little water Hes back in the game bro Its uh not exactly what you think of when you think of a true freshman Thats for sure Its definitely not I dont think theyre supposed to be built like that He had 15 in his debut Hes got seven tonight A little bit more of a quiet night for Shelton Henderson This is also exactly what Miami needs too from their veterans right 23 from Donaldson N youre not probably not going to get 20 plus from Donaldson and Renew every night But those are the guys if this teams going to get back to the NCAA tournament The guys you really need to contribute Dante Allen with a lob up top again for U You want to see early I go back to Dante Allen knowing how to play the right way An original freshman or a regular freshman would have took that shot and try to float it He sees his big man throws it up and gets him the basketball Those are things you want to see in impactful freshman Shot no good The floater by Artario Morris Dante Allen was committed to Villanovavva They fired their coach Committed to Miami Grew up down here Nice floating shot there Great move by Marcus Allen Great move Took his time was cut off was able to step through and finish at the basket Strong player Im loving the way Marcus Allens on the University of Miami basketball team Deep three rattles in and out So Dante Allen once again will bring the ball across the floor His father is an assistant coach for Eric Spolstra I say that uh Jack I did want to send our condolences tonight to Eric Spolstra who got off a road trip this morning uh to his house engulfed in flames here in nearby Coral Gable So thoughts there the head coach of the Miami Heat Fortunately there were no injuries reported but uh he did lose his home today Condolences to to Eric a great guy a good friend of mine Our condolences go out to you And meanwhile Teimo Malovic with a three and Miami seven points away from the sentry mark with under four minutes left to play You know looking at Dante Allen right now hes very comfortable at the point guard position Yeah he is Hes looking very comfortable and thats what you want to see from a freshman because we dont really have Well I say we I keep saying we because Im from Miami Well I live in Miami but hes looking like the guy for the job 335 left to play Hurricanes on Hurricanes have four players in double digits in scoring Rayu is one bucket and two points away from another double double or uh Uday I beg your pardon Hes got eight and 10 Uh meanwhile Jacobe Hedi leads all Wildcat scores with 19 Nobody else has more than nine Its been all Miami here in their second game of the season this evening And they are five points away from uh 100 which I suppose might be significant Dante Allen playing some terrific defense out there Oh we can hear him over here at this at the table hearing how much hes talking on defense And Onanina skies over top of Alunas And here is Alunas down low Left block left hand hook shot no good And Henderson couldnt follow with the offensive rebound and put back back to Dante Allen As a freshman you dont usually see freshman speaking up as much as hes doing Hes really talking getting his team going Thats what you want to see from your freshman point guard potentially your backup point guard in ACC play You see Jay Lucas has him in the game early being late being a starting point guard right now So its great to see that Jay Lucas believes in him let him run the show at the end of the basketball game And Si Alt Tunas is unaware of the fact that he just fouled out of the game They just called that on Altunas Thats his fifth Is he out Hes still in the game though Let him play Alunas is still not aware that hes fouled out of the game JJ John Le boy the second freshman out of Houston Gay from Houston and Jordan Key has also come in from Miami as well with 244 left to play Alunas who Miami would love some contributions from just couldnt stay on the court tonight Nine minutes five fouls missed or attempted one shot and he missed it That was all cheering Hell get back to it Hell be a good player I see things with him Marcus Allen baseline with the left hand and Malovic swings it to Le Boy back up top Malovich fires away for three Drilled it Boy he can shoot a little bit Loves is hitting those shots Catch the ball One motion lets it fly The ro the ball doesnt really rotate but it goes to the net I cant say nothing about it The Slovakian freshman with boatloads of European experience is three of three from the perimeter tonight After he buried this three the bench went nuts Look at Ernest You want to see that from your bench Happy for your teammates making shots being happy That is contagious to a basketball team Thats the things that a team does that wants to play in March Well for a lot of these guys its their last goal around Its their last shot And after tonight youve only got so many college basketball games left And theres probably something to be said for you know those type of guys that that know their time is winding down in the college game and theyre going to bring everything that they have and the energy that they need as Marcus Allen pulls up and he cant make it and is nearly taken away Three too short Offensive rebound after the air ball by Onanina Under two minutes left to go Miami in search of a 100 And there it is Jordan Key the transfer from Georgia the hometown kid Adam Broward Jordan Key the hometown kid You love to see it This kid stays in the gym and hes ripping it benefits of the work hes put in Shout out Jordan Key Shout out Carlos Ber being a great figure in his life Shout out my brother Carlos Ber Jordan Q was a fourstar prospect coming out of high school Preserved his freshman eligibility last season as Allen cant make that three And back down the floor they go And this ball is all over the place As we start to wrap this one up Jack well start with Miami It does it feels like after an 8669 victory on Monday uh maybe the nerves wore off a little bit here tonight Just your general thoughts I think the nerves are wore off but I also think like you have something to look at Youve been playing the whole year the whole summer playing against yourself You finally played against another team You get to see your flaws You get to think see the things that you were great at They were able to come back and change the flaws and change the things that they thought they were good at and they switched it Right now theyre up 101 to 61 Thats how you know that a basketball team that saw what they didnt do great and came back and took advantage of the things they need to be better at And a much different story for Reggie Theus and his club tonight after they took Auburn to overtime on Monday John Le boy the second for three No good Thats another near turnover Heres a deep three That one looks like its on the mark It It was but it rolled in and out Is Miami going to hang right on to it They will And thats going to end the ball game tonight A resounding 10161 victory for the Miami Hurricanes And the Jay Lucas era here in Miami begins 2 and 0 A 40point win for the
