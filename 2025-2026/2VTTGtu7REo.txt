opponents early on We are ready for the opening tip off from Maples Pavilion and the Cardinal will have the first possession moving right to left A Cororey running things coming off that 26point performance against Portland State Apara had 21 His pass to Cayman or Cayman comes up short And a look at the Montana starters coming up on your screen Money Williams Tyler Thompson is Tyler Isaac Kenyan Nino and Tan Sawyer as there goes a a Cory for an early two Well he gets the basket Ben But that was outstanding defense by Aorei Just in the dribbling passing lanes was there on the dribble and just took it away This Montana team features five Bay Area natives four of them in the starting lineup We told you money Williams from Oakland So maybe a little uh added motivation today for these guys You figure they got some some friends and family in attendance as Williams cant hit the three Rebounded by Camman Lets look at Stanford starters now Its a Cororey AJ Roi Benny Giler Chisum Apara and Aiden Cam for Kyle Smiths club as Apara gets to the hoop for an easy two Well and thats what he does He gets to the basket He really did that well in the opener and thats something hes done in the in the past He likes to drive it and get to the rim First four points to the Cardinal and some more good defense there from Aorei as he deflected it off of Isaac and its Stanford Bowl Well we talk about his 26 points but how about the defense this young mans playing You know I dont think he gets enough credit that hes clever Hes in the passing lanes Hes really playing beyond his years as a freshman I know its early but hes really uh shown that he can play both ends of the floor The Gatorade player of the year in New Hampshire last season in high school Nice post move by Rajosi and a quick six nothing lead for the Cardinal Well I like the play of of Rajosi Hes really AJ Roi can really use footwork inside Hes big hes long he gets the shot off pretty easily Stanford three for four from the field to start the game Kenyan Nino cant get Montana on the board and here comes Aorei You talked about his quickness last game coach Thats what really stood out to me about a Cororey is he can change pace in a hurry Yeah he does Hes uh hes really good at accelerating and thats important if youre a guard You know usually its upper classmen and veterans that develop that but a freshman thats got that kind of poise and ability to shift gears uh you just watch him how he plays He doesnt never ever plays at the same speed Benny Giler inbounding to Apara Still 15 on the shot clock Apara has it stripped away but good hustle to get it back Five to shoot for Geler cheering Now down to two on the shot clock Can they get one up Camin and no A shot clock violation Good defense by the Grizz Well thats good defense by the Grizzlies Really good defense Helpside on the on the post up really good helpside defense and post double down dig down But now Sanford didnt recognize the clock You got to get that shot up Late clock recognition Somebody on the floor has got to yell that out They got to be aware This Montana team last year 25 and 10 as you see the first substitution for the Cardinal and its Jeremy Dent Smith checking into the game Yeah goodlooking freshman another goodlook uh player Im sorry transfer player not freshman a player thats played got some lot of games under his belt at the division 2 level but he dominated there Yeah he was an allAmerican Coach Kyle Smith talked about loving his uh his poise and more good defense from the Cardinal Another Montana turnover Thats three already Well Ive been impressed so far Ben with Stanfords you know theyre theyre connected They they really theyre really there on the drives I mean they got a lot of guys helping out player turns his back doesnt see the floor You get down there and you and you just get your hands in the ball Great defense Stanford forced 21 turnovers against Portland State Nice pass underneath and Rahosi will go to the line Dent Smith with a nice find Yeah nice basket cut and D Smith with the great look Stanfords doing a really good job early of attacking the basket not settling for outside shots But thats what you want to do You get your big guys posting up streaking to the basket Stanfords guards pretty good passers that that have their head up and find their teammates Foul called on Tjan Sawyer Roosi two for four at the line this year now Two for five Yeah thats you know theres theres really not a lot of holes in his game but if theres one this would probably be it Not a great free throw shooter Um hes got to you know shoot it a little better but uh he can definitely get to the basket and he certainly draws fouls Shot 62 at the line last year at Claremont Mud Scripps cant convert there Good effort on the offensive glass from Camman but itll be Montana ball Well youre watching Stanford now Theyre going to pick up the pressure a little bit Thats something theyve done a little bit differently this year They extend the floor their defense a little more aggressive and its paid off for them So this is Brooklyn Hicks just into the game Kickball there from Rajosi Well we talked about the success Montana had last season Travis Dur what a job hes done now in his 12th season as the Grizzlies head coach alltime wins leader for that school with 228 Now outstanding job Hes one of the top coaches in my opinion in the country Hes done it You know just every year four Big Sky Championships three NCAA tournaments Longtime coach former assistant at Cal So I got to know Travis pretty well Yeah he was at Cal 2008 to 14 Another steal for the Cardinal Cam Nice anticipation Dent Smith will fire the three Front iron Oara flying in for the rebounds Good energy early on I think from the Cardinal Camman will try a triple and hit A n run to start the game for Stanford And Cammans increased his uh ang I mean his range Hes really done a nice job early just knocking down shots Something he didnt do as well a year ago but thats thats a bright spot for Stanford Montana still looking to get on the board Grizzlies 0 for two from the field Theyve turned it over four times Down to seven on the shot clock More good defense but theyll call a foul on Apara First team foul on the Cardinal Well take a timeout A good start for Stanford leading at 9 nothing And Stanfords done a great job not only in their opener but theyre doing it early in this game You saw the series history between these two teams Stanford the 52 edge last meeting in 2019 as down to eight on the shot clock Montana looking to get on the board More good defense as Trey Taylor was met at the top of that leap Well theyre doing two things man Theyre playing aggressively and thats good A lot of teams can do that to play aggressively but theyre also recovering Theyre on the help side and thats important You know you got two guys on the ball at almost every juncture Theyre putting early pressure on the ball Defense really looks good Four to shoot for Montana Hicks trying to create and thats a tough shot Well thats a great shot I I mean that was some really good defense on ball defense but just even better offense Brooklyn Hicks the transfer from UNLV 92 Stanford 1510 to go in the first half McCory steps into a long two and knocks it down Well this might sound kind of funny but you know the Grizzlies and Travis Secure theyre theyre a good defensive team but theyre having to play against a Stanford team thats playing with an awful lot of confidence right now And so it just doesnt show because they can defend as well Too strong on the three from Grant Keley and the Cardinal looking to push this lead to double digits Apara calls for the screen goes around it Nice entry pass but its stolen away Well theres case in point Thats just good defense by the Grizzlies Kenyano the freshman averaging 10 points and eight rebounds through the first two games for the Grizz Nice blow by from Hicks underneath Camman stands his ground Boy Stanford not making anything easy on this end Five on the shot clock again cheering Hicks for three and he got fouled Ben they just made something easy Thats thats the last thing you want to do That defense could not have been any better to your point However when the shot goes up at the very end of the shot clock the last thing I mean the last thing you want to do is as aggressive as youre playing is now to put this team at the line and take away your momentum And you know the coaches will talk about it early in the season Those things happen But boy thats just a real momentum killer when youre when you foul on the threepoint line end of the shot clock Hicks now five for five at the free throw line this season He only shot 54 last year at UNLV Junior from Seattle Hes got two more coming I always thought as a coach that you want to chart challenge shots and that was thats your goal Your goal is not to block shots fine if you got a great shot blocker but change a shot Go up and challenge a shot If you can keep teams shooting against you with challenge shots the average college teams shoot 38 If you dont challenge the average percentage is 62 So thats a its a big difference Uh thats why coaches are really big on challenging shots He hits all three And so Brooklyn Hicks off the bench with all five Montana points cuts the lead to six just get the sense that the Grizzlies need to settle into this game and well theyre a good team They they will theyre a good team and you can see thats two turnovers in a row now that the Grizzlies have caused and I said that a possession or two ago that you you talk about Travis Dure and his teams down through the years they can play defense uh you know Travis Secure and well talk about it later Mike Montgomery disciple and Mike Montgomerys teams play defense so uh his teams no exception uh and so Stanford is off to a good start but theyre going to have to maintain it Stanford ball on the possession arrow This is Jeremy Dent Smith trying to drive inside He gets bumped out on the perimeter from Kley Well if you look closely Ben thats one thing that Stanfords been able to do not only last year where they led the conference in free throw attempts They are drawing fouls So they are a hard team to defend They They can draw fouls on you Yeah they shot 36 free throws last game and made 29 of them Yeah thats thats huge Dent Smith long two and the rebound to Connor Dick into the game for Montana Hes the only Montana native on this Grizzlies roster from Missoula We talked about all the California kids theyve got Five from the Bay Area Hicks double teamed Good ball movement Bobbled by Dick Pretty fine for Sawyer who gets blocked Sticks with it and puts it back in Well again good defense by Stanford but then just dont clean it up You make the block and dont come up with the block for loose ball So nice response from Montana back within four The jump hook from Talis Té wouldnt fall Well heres a dish And look at the block shot I mean thats the block but then didnt recover Really good job by the Grizzlies staying on the offensive music glass Well dont look now Its a one possession almost two possession two possession game now The Grizzlies have come almost all the way back after a 9 deficit And theyve got the ball now Chance to make this a onep possession game Sawyer top of the key Hes one of the five Bay Area natives from San Francisco Went to Celisionian Prep Thompson for Hicks Great defense And the steal from Aorei And look at him go the other way Lefty layup is good You know whats impressive Ben is the way hes able to not just come up with the steal but get to the basket float and then just calmly use his off hand He did exactly what you should have done to protect the ball He really plays with a lot of experience Quick move from Sawyer for the reverse layup Dejan Storyer hes tough Know a little bit about him Uh he played for one of my former players Justin Labar at CC in the city and great college Great player to the offensive rebound off of the Cororey miss Deep three from Geler and that wouldnt fall And here comes Montana again Chance to get within one possession Stanford started this game on a 90 run but the Grizzlies have responded nicely Sawyer lost it but hes fouled And thatll take us to the under 12minute timeout 1132 to go in the first half We got a good one on the farm Stanford 13 Montana 9 Back in a moment They have won wherever theyve been and theyve won big Yeah Kyle Smith and Travis Dir We got a chance to talk to both of them this week and theyve got a lot of respect for one another you would understand why Definitely two of the better coaches out there So Montana basketball out of the timeout Sawyer going to work in the post Raosi staying right with him Nice defense from the big man and he collects it Eeler knocked up in the air Cameron grabs it for the Cardinal Cory Oh what a feed Rajosi couldnt finish And a loose ball foul on Stanford Well Aorei set the table and Rahosi just couldnt get the ball to fall but you see how explosive the freshman is I mean Ibuka Aorei just drops off a dime and you got to come away with if not a basket a foul Uh and thatll happen as year goes on But thats a great look Just over nine minutes into this first half Stanford has led by as many as nine and another near turnover but out of bounds Itll remain with Montana Well theyre trying to look for the big fella Tjan Sawyer inside And Stanford I think is doing a great job playing a three quarter defense and also playing a foot behind but getting down there early on help That time was a front They tried to go over the top but Stanford recovered on the on the air time of the pass So uh really impressive opening series defensively for Stanford They have played well Three for nine shooting for Montana Five turnovers and the shot clock winding down again Oh Dick has to put it up and its knocked away from him out of bounds What a play by Aiden Cam Nothing easy against the Cardinal They really you know youre getting beat off the dribble but theres a wave by there a recovery that just playing long guys Theres some pretty rangy guys out there in Stanford You know you you dont want to give up too many blowbyss but when you do hustle recover and make a play Thats a great play by Camman to to get the ball and not foul too Cory midrange jumper and he is now four for five from the field Eight points in the first 10 minutes of the half He makes that shot look easy Just shoots it with calmness and poise Coming off a Stanford freshman debut record of 26 in the opener Tuesday night against Portland State Cardinal up by six Shot clock winding down again Skip pass to Thompson His three banks in Did he call that I dont think he called it but I dont think they care The bottom line is the shot went in Quick timeout here to talk about it and it just what hes done uh where every step of the way hes just helped his team win But uh today hes going to have hes going to have his hands full with a really aggressive and uh talented you know Montana team Very confident Grizzlies team as well out of the timeout Stanford up by three Came will try a three Thats too strong I think the Grizzlies will give Stanford that shot that they can keep their guards away from penetrating to the basket See if money Williams can get a little bit involved in the offense Just one shot so far tonight for him Spin move by Aino Wow the freshman looking good Well thats what you have to do when youre playing against an aggressive defense like Stanford You got to drive somewhat You got to be able to finish but you got to drive And another quick trigger three and Montana has a chance to take its first lead Well I think you know Stanford settling a little bit now There goes Monty Williams Knocked away from him More good defense from the Cardinal coming the other way Dent Smith knocks down the triple Great recognition by Aore He knew that Dent Smith Dent Smith was trailing and he just pitched it back and gave him a rhythm shot in transition and he drained it Jeremy Dent Smith shot 35 from three last year at Cal State Dominguez Hills And thats in and out Oh that was in in and out Down and out and came back I thought that was bottom In and out twice Yeah that was tough Octara sizing up Dick Back out for it Dent Smith and a whistle away from the ball Thats going to be a foul on Aino Well Stanfords going a little bit small right now but you can see you know as youre coming down the floor watch a Cororey with his presence of mind He knew he had Jeremy Den Smith trailing and he just just pitched it back and he had a really nice shot in transition That was easy Cardinal with the ball up by four Eighth meeting all time between these two schools as Dent Smith got inside but couldnt finish Itll be Montana basketball Yeah a little bit of a lid on the basket for Stanford last several possessions but that has a lot to do with the Grizzly defense Theyre playing a lot better now themselves defensively They again uh you want to talk about a tradition and what Travis Durs been able to do His teams have played traditionally very good defense Tough to gauge too much from Montanas first two games Again just the level of competition not near what it is today as Geler has a steal and hes going for two for Stanford Well thats cheering again Benny Giler a clever player in the passing lanes anticipation Thats so much about the game of basketball is just being in the right place and getting there early They were he was there way early to get that Had five steals Tuesday night against Portland State So he is off to a nice defensive start this season and lead back to six for the Cardinal Thompson Good entry pass to Aino Yeah nice recognition The front took place They went over the top Helpside couldnt get there fast enough Good job Straightaway three from Cameron Grant Thats too strong Aara tips it to the back court chases it down and it stayed in bounds Nice hustle Good recognition Montana still with a slight edge on the boards 11 to eight as Grant will try another three Couldnt hit that one Well he can shoot it I thought hed rush though the last two shots Just strained a little bit Another good entry pass Sawyer positioned underneath and lays it in Twopoint game Hes a load down there He hasnt really been able to get going yet this game but you know Stanfords aware that hes there and so is Montana Theyre feeding the big big guy Hes got six points and four rebounds early on to lead the Grizzlies A Cororey a game high eight points Hes got the ball right now for Stanford Dent Smith to the corner for Giler Burries the three Again good recognition You got to make those plays You beat your defender you got to know theres going to be some help side uh getting there late And he found Benny Geler who can drain it from three Stanford three for 10 beyond the arc in the early going and itll go back to the Cardinal Well take a timeout way to go in the first half Stanford up by five uh you know acclimated and going in his team So uh you know if youre the Grizzlies you got to start your defensive attack by trying to find a way to slow him down make him somebody else beat you Kyle Smith had some high praise for him Called him our Lamar Jackson Said Im Im John Harbaugh Hes our Lamar Jackson because of what an important position he plays I like it Seven on the shot clock Dealer for Dent Smith going against Money Williams Deep three And that was well defended by Money Thats a great defensive possession coming out of the timeout for the Grizzlies Montana has not led in this game That was deflected a couple of times and thats the ninth turnover for the Grizz You know Ben thats a thats a turnover Itll go down as a turnover uh and you know kind of a bad pass but its Stanford thats causing that Theres great pressure on the ball and theres great offside Look at theres just guys all around that was deflected by a Cororey off of off of uh uh the Grizzlies So its the defense is still maintaining for for Stanford right now Nice back down by Raosi for the two and its a sevenpoint lead Yeah hes a post threat I mean hes legitimate down there They throw it down in the block You got a Cororey uh you know a Apara rather and theyve got a Rahosi that can really dominate down the block Thats pretty nice to have Well Rajosi is a local kid from Sanon Selmo in Marin as another turnover and Dent Smith behind everybody Boy the uh turnovers really adding up Thats 10 for Montana And the points off turnovers 163 Yeah you know theres turnovers and theres bad turnovers the ones that lead to baskets Ben those are bad turnovers and thats tough Good answer from Oino Yeah great back door cut Stanford you know playing aggressively When you play against teams aggressively youve got a back cut and the Grizzlies did that and found a basket Its actually 18 points off turnovers for Stanford So 18 of their 27 have come off Montana turnovers If the Grizzlies hes got to take care of the basketball a little better Apara couldnt hit the three Thompson skies for the rebound Ripped away Nice effort by Rahosi Akara Tough shot Rahosi got the rebound and hes fouled I dont think Chisum Paro was going to score that one But guess whos around the basketball AJ Roi was able to catch it and go back up Draw the foul Stanford here leading by seven hoping to hold on and increase their lead The Grizzlies not so much You got to drive it The problem is if you drive it you got to have somebody to pass it to Somebody in the passing lane uh and get a good look or finish AJ Roi now 0 for three at the free throw line today Hes got one more coming We mentioned just a 62 foul shooter last year at Claremont Mud Scripps and hes now 0 for four Yeah those just dont look good Theyre theyre little every shots a little different I know the Stanford staff working with him on that but you got to get your consistency You got to make each shot similarly not shoot it differently All things considered I think Montana has to feel fortunate Theyre only down by seven Yeah two possession game despite the turn points off turnovers being 18 to three Williams to the corner Threepointer on the way Thats too strong from Tyler Isaac Yeah good challenge by 610 Cam Tent Smith Roi in the post and he finishes Uh he may not make free throws but he makes his post moves Hes tough down there And you know give Stanford credit They know where their breads butter They go right to the block Theres Stanford extending the defense a little bit trying to maybe push the tempo a little bit but also you know play play solid and get down to a short shot clock ROS three for four from the field Strong take but unable to finish was Connor Dick and Giler the other way draws contact and I think theyre going to call that a shooting foul Thats a smart play by Benny Giler Hes in transition You know youve got to step on your defender Watch him He gets by his defender and he just gathers and gets his shot up Really clever move by Benny Geler Is also a very good free throw shooter A shot 89 from the free throw line last year Was five for six in the opener against Portland State and he knocks down the first Yeler had a really nice game on Tuesday 12 points three rebounds two assists We mentioned the five steels as IA Cory will get a breather Yeah you mentioned Benny Geler Hes gotten better every year Ben Hes a smart kid who play knows how to play but you know hes done whatever the teams asked him to do Hes certainly a great shooter but hes also a guy that thinks the game He began as a as a walkon here for Stanford and like you said hes just improved every year This is the biggest lead of the game 3120 Stanford Pump fake by Hicks The three on the way and Brooklyn Hicks off the bench has done a great job keeping Montana close Now thats a great look by uh Montana Stanford just couldnt couldnt quite catch up with the ball A lot of flybys but in the end a wide open shot Hicks hasnt missed Hes two for two from the field Three for three from the line eight points as Cayman gets the roll Nice drop off by Jeremy Tent Smith These guards showing their capability of getting the big guys involved Balanced scoring today from Stanford A Cororey leading the way with eight Geler has seven Roi six and Dent Smith five Nice ball movement from the Cardinal Isaac couldnt get the three to go Neither team shooting the ball great from threepoint range as were going to get a foul here on Montana The Grizzlies two for eight Stanford 3 for 12 Well yeah And heres heres the pick and roll Really nice job by Aiden Keman just hanging out and finding open space Thats your job in a pick and roll You dont just pick and just roll anywhere You got to roll and if you have to stop in the paint you dont get all the way to the basket You give your teammate a passing lane and he was rewarded there for the basket That foul on Connor Dick Sixth team foul for Montana That was a short breather for Aorei whos right back into the game Cameman driving Couple of defenders Stayed right with him Good defense Yeah theres nothing but green uniforms to the basket there Williams still looking for his first points tonight The pass to Sawyer blocked got it back and put it in Nice patience and persistence Tan Sawyer just shows you that you know you block my shot Im you better grab it because if you dont Im going to put it back And he does Hes Hes really improved his game over the years Hes got eight points along with five rebounds for the Grizzlies Raosi kind of offbalance shot Williams the rebound ahead for Chase Henderson and hell slow it down Coming up on the final minute of the half 3325 Stanford Williams swatted away by Camman and itll be Stanford ball Camemans had the ability this game just you know hes gotten beat a couple times or hes helped out but hes long and and he just blocked it Ball goes off the backboard and off the Montana Thats thats the second or third time now thats happened Thats his second block Five blocked shots for the Cardinal in this half The defense has been outstanding Yeah thats thats whats given them this lead Theyve scored but the defense has created their offense See if they go two for one here with under 50 to go in the first half trying to get it in the post Apara knocked out of bounds Itll stay with the Cardinal Well thats good defense Stanford kind of staying on one side of the floor able and and and Montana able to load up defensively They just never got off that one side of the floor But good defense by the Grizzlies 11 on the shot clock Inbound to Apara Ripped away and Akara called for the foul Yeah I really like the persistence of the Grizzlies Even though things havent been going their way and they have had turnovers theyre still hanging in and just playing and and and you know theyre going to have to get through that get to halftime and see if they can regroup But theyve got an opportunity to cut this lead significantly into maybe a twopossession game if they can knock down a three And thats the second personal foul on Chisum Apara Henderson running some clock here About an 8second difference between shot clock and game clock to the corner for Dick into the paint Kicks out Hicks for three That one off the mark Eight seconds for Stanford to work with and Kyle Smith will use it Wow Great timeout Lose it or use it Now you might say Well they had a they had a break Do you do you take that let them let the players go I think with 10 seconds or 9 seconds Ben thats a smart postseason So four straight And how about 17 wins at home last season Thats Thats a program ties a program record Impressive 17 and three A Cory with three on the clock Couldnt get it to fall The tip goes Cameron Grant at the buzzer Wow What a great finish by Stanford The shot goes up on the rim and Stanford huge on the glass Not the way the Grizzlies wanted to end the half lead Tan Sawyer with eight points to lead the Grizz Aino driving baseline spins back and draws a foul Get to the line for a couple Well thats actually you know pretty again pretty good defense until late in the clock And if the Grizzlies can get to the foul line they didnt get there a ton in the first half but if they can find ways to draw fouls thats going to help their cause We know the freshman from Albuquerque knocks down the first free throw Yeah heres a guy thats a threetime Gatorade player of the year How many guys do that Bill Thats incredible Impressive any state Thats incredible I mean three times you were player of the year in your state I I dont know how many guys can boast that You see his record in high school at Volcano Vista 116 wins four losses Yeah Not not too shabby Yeah So he makes both free throws Its an eightpoint Stanford lead Cardinal with their first possession of the half Ai man this guy is unreal Yeah And hes you know you can look at his hand I mean this is incredible Look just if you focus on his hand hes got his bandage there And my goodness hes tough Knocking down shots from deep the freshman Montana trying to get to three and 0 for the first time in seven years Stanford a ninegame winning streak against the Big Sky As we talked about they beat Portland State to start the season They got another Big Sky opponent on Wednesday against Montana State Threepointer on the way from Courtney Anderson Jr Hes another Bay Area native from Vallejo And look at A Cororey Oh everything but the finish Nice save by Money Williams Well thats his good hand The left hand thats not taped And he made that shot earlier Just couldnt get that one to fall Threepointer from Thompson Just not falling right now for the Grizzlies Is two for 11 from three Cory back the other way Hes got a game high 11 points Camman buries the triple Well he took that shot early and made it then missed a couple You know what Give him credit He stepped right back and said Look I can make that shot I have made that shot And he sized it up and drained it Biggest lead of the game 14 for Stanford Aino draws the foul against Camman Yeah Well you can see again theres a dish Look at that The draw to and find your big guy out top Again the Takori making the shot That was Keman picking up a foul on this end just you know hes 610 and he hes really long and just didnt have to go up and play with the body You youre just make guys shoot over the top of you and hes done that most of this game Hes actually talking to the officials now about hey why is that a foul And officials will tell him hey you use your body Yeah its just its a you know its a small thing but you go up there and and now you just go straight up and just to kind of lunge and get your body in there you just verticality If you go straight up its a hard shot to shoot over 610 Yeah see it on the replay Good call And thats what theyre telling him right now over on the Stanford sidelines Just got to stay vertical Well if youre going to bump your your man dont do it in front of the official Thats good advice Find another place So he makes it both Montana is a perfect seven or six for no seven for seven from the free throw line as that ball will stay with the Cardinal Yeah Aara just got to the basket just didnt finish it but explosive move This feels like uh an important part of the game for Montana You got to keep this thing close You dont want to let Stanford to push it up push the lead open too much more No but its important for Stanford too Ben They cant relax Theyve had 13point leads in their last opening game is uh Hey there it is again The foul They fouled a couple times now The same thing happened when they played Portland State They were 13 up a little bit comfortable and then Portland State came all the way back So you you got to play both ends here and and not the score You you know so many players look at the score Well lets see if this can get Money Williams going a little bit Hes he went scoreless in that first half Yeah hes been quiet and hes a tremendous player from Oakland High and we talked about the lineage at Oakland High You mentioned Dane Lillard but I got to mention Yende Obaka one of my favorite players of all time at Cal I mean he was at Oakland High and what a career he had So theres been some players that have come through the pipeline at Oakland High for sure I remember Aende Ubaka well He was there when I was at Cal and obviously you were coaching him He was a really good player We we beat UCLA a couple times with him at the helm and and uh he he was a tremendous player great young man as well and now coaching kids Cory missed the three Good hustle by Rajosi but saved to Anderson the other way Montana hanging around down by 10 trying to cut it back to single digits here And that was off the knee of Williams Well Ben you know this is what Stanfords done well When you bring two guys together to screen thats a good offensive play but its an opportunity for the defense And Stanfords just climbed on that this year Theyve really clamped down that that high ball screen out on the floor and they played it really aggressively and theyve already turned over uh not only Missouri I mean Montana theyve turned over their opponents even um Portland State in a very similar fashion Yeah they forced 21 turnovers against Portland State as RAOSI WITH THE BLOW BY OH look out below There was no measuring it off the glass there We tell guys use the glass He said no I want to jam it Whoa Will get back to the line for my Can we see that one Yeah How about this one step too Uhuh Give me that Oh I mean holy moly Thats with authority That is with authority And that that got this crowd buzzing a little bit as Money Williams will go back to the line where he just hit a couple And now three for three you know that this is a way if youre kind of struggling or teams are zeroing in on you and in terms of money Williams you know youre going into this game Stanfords going to pay attention to you but its a way you can get back in the game just kind of get to the free throw line uh get some points there and and find some ways but you know Stanfords going to have to continue playing its just a 10point game theyre going to have to maintain their intensity Stanford has led the entire way started the game on a 90 run led by as many as 14 as Dent Smith short on the three Good rebound by Thompson Hes got some really good leaping ability Tyler Thompson from Fairfield to the corner for Anderson And weve got a sevenpoint game Yeah I think Stanfords settling a little bit now Theyve come down with some you know some some shots from the perimeter Not attacked like they can Thats attacking Theres the answer Buo Aorei He must have heard me He is so quick off the dribble Well thats what you have to do You You had some success tacking the basket Continue doing that Money Williams back the other way No call He lays it in Well Money Williams you want to get him going Uh if youre Montana if youre Stanford you dont want him to get going Thats his first field goal of the game Hes got six early points in this second half Chisamokara right back at you How did he get that to go My goodness Chisum Obara with the drive the step back and the foul the harm and one Right As you were saying Stanford this is sort of a taste of their own medicine They got to the line 36 times against Portland State in their first game Well heres a guy that that can live at the line when he wants to Chisum Mopar is strong Hes agile Hes tough and and now thats he completes the threepoint play but that was a huge basket for Stanford They were kind of in a little lull Only about a two possession game So the lead back to 10 Money Williams much more aggressive to start this second half That jump shot wouldnt fall Officials letting him play a little bit Yeah Akara quick move in the post up and under Well defended Yeah he went to the backside I thought he had a little look on the on the front side but decided to cross over Oh his pass to Sawyer Collision And which way is this foul going I think its going to be on Stanford And if its on Giler thats a thats a tough one Well that could have gone either way Ben I I mean thats interesting Yeah theyre saying Benny Geler may initiate the contract I thought Benny Giller was in the right position defensively but then the contact occurred He Benny Giler did get foul but I think Benny Giller made the contact first so the initial play takes precedent Officials right on it Hopefully Sawyers okay Hes coming off a little gingerly but I think hes all right Well keep an eye on that Its Benny Giler I would worried about in that exchange I was going to say you would figure that hes the guy who probably get the worst of it Benny Geler going against Tjan Sawyer 68 255 4838 Stanford Theyve led by as many as 14 Have not trailed Conor Dick will try a three Thats short And Aorei has it for the Cardinal Very good defense by Stanford They challenged up the whole possession IA Cororey the freshman from New Hampshire down the lane with the left hand Score it and one You know Ben Im looking at this I mean this is just oneonone from the top You got the floor spread He says I can take my man And he gets by and again goes to the left hand and really really glides and just great body control I mean hes done that Thats not a fluke Hes done that in two games now And he completes the threepoint play 16 points on seven of 11 shooting And now a travel on Money Williams And guess who drew that turnover Yeah I dont have to guess I was right in laughter front of us I saw my own eyes And here he is He just anticipates Boy thats a veteran play too from a freshman And that could have been a charge but it was a travel first And these are big possessions because the Grizzlies are capable of coming back on you And the Stanfords now really you know they turned over Montana in the first half and now turning over Stan Montana again Thats huge Oh if you dont know the name get to know it Ibuka Aorei poised for a big freshman season with the Cardinal Jeremy Dent Smith corner three And Aino with numbers for Montana A Cororey forced that turnover too He was the only man back Apara into the paint Somehow kept the pivot foot and drew the foul Yeah youre right He played like a a middle linebacker a defensive back I mean you know he was the only guy He doesnt make that steal Theyre going to score But here he is He jumps it He jumps it early And thats just a great play But now its Chisumara thats able to draw a foul expose himself I like the way he he he uses his body He doesnt just expose the ball but he keeps the ball tucked and gets a draws the foul by exposing his arms to the defender Veteran play by Chisum McParo MARO get a breather and a nice hand from his teammates in the crowd over there as Benny Giler checks back in One more free throw for Apara Offensive rebound by Cameron Grant Giler couldnt connect on the three No Counter Dick the other way and a blocking foul on Geler I think that was the right call Yep Then he got back but couldnt get set in time out on the floor You can see hes retreating Does a good job but you know its close Yeah it was close He did he did get he did get the contact out away from the cylinder Yeah maybe just a little late but those are always those bang bang calls to block charge Well its a 70 run for Stanford to push the lead back to 14 Connor Dick trying to put an end to that right here And thats the first miss for free throw today for the Grizzlies Conrad Dick the lone Montana native on the Grizzlies roster believe it or not 87 free throw shooter Doesnt miss a lot One more coming for the lefty and he goes one for two Montana So its 5239 1425 to go as getting his first action this season now for Stanford The freshman Christopher Scra number 12 in the white Hes got the ball right now Now Roosi Aorei step back three Higharker came up short and Tyler Thompson brings it into the front court for the Grizzlies Zakori with another steel Look at him go coast to coast Oh just mistimed the alleyoop Good idea but it wasnt there That would have brought the house down Money Williams back the other way And thats what he does man I mean he just gets to the basket and hes able to do that So Stanford exchange there misses the lob gives up a two Rahosi for Dent Smith Drives down the right side Offensive rebound Rahosi and sticks it back Now Stanford is playing with the two big guys inside and thats causing Montana some problems Theyre not able to clean up the defensive glass on drives AJ Rahosi 10 points eight rebounds Grant Keley cant hit from the baseline Stanford up by 13 Just sort of hanging in that seven to 13point range The lead for Stanford right now Grant for three Battle for the rebound goes to the Grizzlies Keepley ahead for Hicks Right to the lane and scores it Yeah nice basket Nice look there by Brooklyn Hicks Just a good drive And again you got the Grizzlies just hanging Theyre just theyre do doing what they have to do to be uh in the ball game Now from the left elbow Got it 18 points for Ibuka Aorei Thats tough to guard because you get screened There was no help coming off that screen and he just pulled up 5643 Williams trying to create some space Dent Smith stays with him but Williams over the top So he was scoreless in the first half Hes already got 10 in the second half No hes going to score it on you if if you give him that shot Oh I right back at you and one You know Ben Im a was a pretty good defensive coach Im watching Hakori and Im going I dont know what I would have done or my teams would have done with him I mean hes hes alone I I mean he if you pressure him hell go by you If you play off of him because you respect his driving ability he pulls up and just makes you pay So really tough guy And then if you put a ball screen in there if you dont trap him coming off a ball screen hes going to hes going to beat you Hell find guys Couldnt convert the threepoint play but an offensive rebound for Scrara brings it back out Still 10 on the shot clock Look at the confidence that a Cory plays with Grant with three to shoot Knocks down the three Wow To beat the shot clock Biggest lead of the game for Stanford Now you know why Cameron Grant was shooting all those threes cuz he hadnt hit one And he said Look Im not a bad shooter I can hit this shot And he did And that was not an easy one Williams fade away Too strong Cardinal trying to push this lead even further Akara into the paint with the left hand scores it cheering 6345 Well thats a veteran move and thats a a move that hes really worked on Hes able to get by you but with his pivoting and his size and his strength hes able to get shots up to the rim Nice move by Chismar The Cardinal have now taken control of this game with 11 minutes to go Montana trying to get back in it Williams with eight on the shot clock steps into a three and hits And boy did they need that one Well hes going to show you what he can do but you know his career has been too good for him to be shut out Hes going to score on you Hes hes a load Hes got 13 points this half Dent Smith and an offensive foul Theyre going to get Octara his third personal and itll take us to the under 12 timeout 1036 to go Stanford up 15 Defensively hes got four steals Yeah which has led to the offense Yeah hes doing it all Four rebounds a couple of assists as well Offensive rebound chased down by Hicks Well Money Williams talk about uh not being on a tear 13 points this half Hes really gotten it going Hicks tries a three and hits So a couple of threepointers from Montana cut the lead from 18 to 12 Theyre not going away just yet Now this is a veteran uh team that has guys uh returning guys that know how to play Under 10 to play from Maples Pavilion Back door cut from Dent Smith Pass by Raosi knocked out of bounds Itll still be Cardinal ball That was a good basket cut Stanford looking for their 10th straight win against the Big Sky Conference 1 and0 on the season after they beat Portland State on Tuesday night Heres Rozie in the post Hes closing in on a double double with 10 and eight rebounds Pretty pass to Camman for the finish I love Rozie I mean he draws the double and he goes and drops it off to his teammate Camman Just really good basketball 6551 Williams much more aggressive this half looking for his shot Isaac back for Williams This the freshman Aino right over the top of Camman Nice shot Yeah good poise Camman held his ground that time Didnt leave his feet Kenyon Nino has been impressive Hes got 12 points on four of five shooting Extra pass to Grant Another one to Rozie The little jump hook and hes got 12 points Well hes established himself down in the block and you know Stanfords teammates have his teammates have seen that Theyve recognized that They all gave up shots to get the ball down low Cardinal have made six straight field goals as Aino going to work Good defense by Cam Another turnover Ai coast to coast for two What can you say Ben I mean thats just good basketball Thats a a dynamic player climbing high on the glass and getting the ball off there for yet another two Hes got 22 points to lead all scorers Money Williams has 15 all this half But you see where he can take over a game I mean the Grizzlies are going to be in good shape with Money Williams He just didnt have a great first half but hes on fire this half Hes the Big Sky preseason conference player of the year for a reason Raosi in and out and it bounces to Williams See if Money can do it again Midrange jumper He got fouled He got fouled twice in that possession They didnt call the first one but they called the second one He got bumped early I think the officials knew that And you can see it Theres one bump No call But heres the next one Not as much contact but just on the elbow but definitely got him In fact the official just told him I think he leaned over and said Hey we missed one out there I Thats Roger Ers Hes a veteran Hes Hes a guy that will be in Final Fours I I really enjoy watching he and his crew work because they are veterans I dont care what time of the year it is And you see the officials talking now to the coaches Uh thats what good officials do The guys that dont want to talk to you I never had you know I I didnt like that as much you know I I thought at least I was worth an answer Well you know whats I was going to say whats funny to me is that all you coaches you love officials once youre in in com Oh I listen Theyre all good from the broadcast now Ben Ross I all these guys Den Smith Montana to get back within 10 Monty Williams Oh he couldnt finish Battle for the rebound Williams got it back Trapped underneath Look at Jeremy Dent Smith goes to the floor and rips it away ARI splits the defense and gets fouled applause End to end action at Maples Pavilion Oh my goodness How about the Montana 6957 Well T decided at halftime its time for me to start scoring and he has been tough to stop As speaking of tough to stop I makes the first free throw Hes now up to 23 points to lead all scorers Second one on the way Two for two for the freshman So hes got 50 points in his first two collegiate games and weve still got 7 and 12 minutes to go Yeah impressive What a start to his Cardinal career 7157 Stanford has led by as many as 18 Corner three from Thompson and last touched by Kaden Betts Well Stanford did a much better job that time covering out on the threepoint shot Theyve given the Grizzlies a couple of threes but that time I thought they challenged well Both teams shooting the ball well here in the second half Theyre both 50 from the field IA Cory right back to the free throw line So coach this has been impressive from Stanford Theyre up 14 and and look who theyre doing it without right A few key injuries Ryan Agarwal Evan Stinson you got Donovan Young and then Oscar Heilte also in street clothes Yeah No youve got Yeah Three guys weve seen on the graphic and four total I mean thats And these are guys that play Theyre not just guys that are on the team Theyre guys that we think Agarals a starter Yep 17 Tinsons come in and hit some good shots Donovan Youngs played significant minutes Uh obviously hell take good players So with this shorter bench Stanford still maintained I think some good depth and some good performances for their team Hey Ben dont look now but I has matched his 26 points from his first game The feed that time to Giler kept in play Akara driving baseline followed his own miss got it a third chance Look at the battle going on underneath And its finally taken by Kenyan Nino Now good defense by the Grizzlies Grizz back the other way Nice feed to Sawyer The assist to Tyler Isaac Well you can see why the Grizzlies were picked to win in terms of their their personnel Theyve got some guys that are hard to defend against And they just gone up against a much more deep and and spirited Stanford team thats doing things like that Benny Geler from downtown Hey you know Bennys going to play well when Ben and Ben are on the call right 17point lead for Stanford Are we going to let him on our podcast Thats what we got to know Aari what a save Benny Giler the other way Cardinal playing with a lot of energy in this second half Geler he was feeling it but not that time Money Williams and right back to the free throw line He is very good at drawing contact Number 10 Chisum Aara Thats Chisum Aparas fourth personal So a little bit of foul trouble for him and four for Benny Geler as well First free throw is good and the lead 16 as Aaro will come out with those four fouls One more coming from Money Williams 18 points six rebounds four assists The junior out of right here in the Bay Area Oakland High School and two for two at the line So we talked about some of the talent that come out of Oakland High School Damen Lillard among them but Money Williams actually the first to lead them to a state title Well my guess is the end Obaka had to be working with Money Williams a little bit and hes coaching now so well see I have to find that out Cory nice feed to Scrinda follows his miss and gets his first basket Yeah so much talent in the Oakland area Uh Ben Leon Poe coming out of Oakland Uh some great players that have played here and uh down through the years but the Bay Area you mentioned just really always has had talent Williams good defense that time and rebound Scrinda the freshman from Latafia and a three from Amecha Ibuka Oori hes got 29 points stop it stop it auka oh my I mean you didnt think you thought there could be an encore I thought he escaped hard to do if youre playing an o overly tough schedule but you dont want a false sense of confidence either its a great point its its a delicate balance in the nonconference 20point lead now for Stanford as Brooklyn Hicks missed the three Yeah Stanfords did a good job rebounding That was something that you know they didnt secure the defensive glass as well in the first game Theyve done a much better job tonight Jeremy Dent Smith with four and a half minutes to go Its been an impressive performance by the Cardinal against a really good Montana team Geler deep three Well you have Benny Giler thats knocking down shots like that And with the addition of Accorey and Jeremy Ben Smith what is happening now is now the floor gets space for those post guys to operate Hes got 13 points and another steel Cardinal starting to pour it on with four minutes to go And he wanted to get the ball back for a heat check I think on that one Benny said Hey come on I just hit a shot Give it back Stanford with 49 points in this second half and thats in and out The tip is there from Scr Well you see the size of Stanford paying off and thats been thats really been tough for Montana Montana doesnt have the size up front that Stanfords thrown at him but not many teams do In all fairness Stanfords got some big guys Biggest lead of the game as Stanford has put this one away Williams couldnt convert inside and you figure now both teams will probably start to go into their bench a little bit for these final few minutes Nice pass by Tent Smith in the finish from Aiden Camman cheering Yeah you see Stanford getting their confidence but theyve got uh theyve got talent and theyve got depth I mean we talk about the guys out Be able to put the guys on the floor who are performing at this level says a lot about their overall depth Its a 120 Cardinal run They lead by 27 Sawyer jump hook gets the roll Yeah I I really like the ability that Dejan Sawyer has been able to show and hell be able to do that this year for the Grizzlies Hes hes a much improved player 12 points and seven rebounds for him today 235 to play Stanford going to get their 10th straight win against Big Sky competition Another offensive rebound from Cameron Taken now by Hicks the other way Brooklyn Hicks having a nice game off the bench for Montana snorts And a threepointer put home by Courtney Anderson Jr Hes a local product from Vallejo Back down the road Colorado transfer talked about the five Grizzlies players who are from the Bay Area Nice to get them an opportunity to come back home play in front of some friends and family Geler theres your heat check A little too strong on the three Oh come on man He earned that He earned that And I dont absolutely Anderson quickly to the basket 8868 Stanford Mentioned the Cardinal play another Big Sky opponent next Theyll take on Montana State Wednesday night Itll be Ted Robinson and Mike Montgomery on the call there Hey look at the freshman Christopher Scrum Why not I mean you know he said Look dont forget about me But you mentioned Mike Montgomery and Ted Robinson coming up Thats a duo for you The veteran the veteran broadcaster and Hall of Fame coach Mike Montgomery Stand up big didnt play in the exhibition game No And hes a good player I mean thats shows you the depth when you have a Jaylen Thompson and a you know and players that can come off the bench and give you some minutes Thats thats speaks well for Stanford We talked about the uh the Cardinal and their success at home last year 17 and three Those 17 wins tying a program record Theyre going to start 2 and 0 at home this year with an impressive performance today against the defending Big Sky champion Montana Grizzlies Benny Geler short on the three as were under a minute to go for Maples Pavilion Amari Jkins inside Trey Taylor and out of bounds Last touched by Montana Well you know it was a good point time to make this Only 45 seconds left Stanford hasnt done Stanford hasnt done much much wrong today And you could talk about you know uh if youre the Grizzlies maybe youre let down you didnt score shoot it maybe the way you can but Stanfords been playing at a really high level And when that happens sometimes it doesnt matter who your opponents are Stanford dictated today And and if they play like this theyre going to have a pretty pretty good season Trey chases it down This is Thompson looking for his first points and rebounded by Chase Henderson Cardinal going to win their 10th straight game against Big Sky opponents Corner three from Jetkins off the mark and Stanford doesnt have to shoot again Well this ones in the books but Ben Ross you and I are in the books Good to be back with you partner And good working with you Got the Ben and Ben show back on Why not We weve been there before 9168 Stanford An impressive victory today
